 Maybe it's the pet owners who run away: We furnished figures the other day to 
show that, contrary to one theory, earthquakes are not foreshadowed by an 
unusually large number of lost-pet ads in the newspapers. In fact, there were 
fewer such notices the week of Jan. 11-17 in The Times this year than for the 
same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Atwater of Pasadena isn't sure that sets the issue to rest. "Perhaps," 
he wrote, "the message is that, with a disaster in the offing, the pets were 
smart enough to stay home."

 Pre-shocks: What is it with "Jeopardy," anyway? We've mentioned that the 1994 
desk calendar for the TV show has the answer "we all fall down" for the quiz 
question asked Jan. 17. Another caller points out that the answer for Jan. 15 
involves a body of water known as "Trembling Earth" to the Indians. The 
question: What is the Okefenokee Swamp?

 Of course, the early Spanish explorers called the San Gabriel River the Rio de

 Finally, an artwork that's all it's cracked up to be: L.A. artist Tracey 
Landworth hopes to create a 16-by-20-foot earthquake mural, made out of the 
items broken by the quake, which would be installed on an underpass of the 
Santa Monica Freeway. (Well, what else is the freeway good for anymore?) 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge people to take their broken things to the Children's Museum, which is 
sponsoring this project," she said. "Or, if they're out in the Valley, to hold 
onto their items until we can find a location out there."

 Carleton College in Minnesota offers a class on California, which a press

several parts.

A SHAKE-UP IS GOOD, BUT GOD DOESN'T CONTROL EARTHQUAKES

 Re: "Quake a Sign of God's Wrath, Clergy Say No" (Jan. 24): 
</P>
<P>
 If it takes an earthquake or two to awaken people to the reality of God and 
all the associated mumbo jumbo, then it's a plus. Such shock therapy may help 
people grow up.It should be abundantly clear by now to all that there is no God 
up there directing quakes or fires or floods, etc. It is simply the way the 
Earth is made. 
</P>
<P>
 Study geology, physics or civil engineering if you want to know. God has 
nothing to do with it. The notion that God has control of such things is 
infantile. If one, whatever his faith, is at the right place and the right 
time, he will be hit. Promoting infantile ideas of heaven and hell may be OK 
for kids who want simple, quick answers but it does no good for adult citizens 
of a democracy who are trying to understand and manage their own affairs.

<P>
 When the Lutheran AIDS Network heard that the National Episcopal AIDS 
Coalition was planning a four-day conference in Southern California in 
February, about the same time it had hoped to hold one, the organizations 
joined forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of this interdenominational cooperation is "Hope and Healing: The 
Church in the Second Decade of AIDS," which is expected to draw nearly 300 
participants from several countries to Santa Monica beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the conference coordinator, the Rev. Thad Bennett, "Hope and 
Healing" is more than an alliterative title. "It is part of what the church can 
offer," he said, "by looking at the crisis from a spiritual point of view 
rather than simply a hard-core medical one." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say, Bennett hastens to add, that AIDS education will be 
ignored at the conference. The Centers for Disease Control are sending 
representatives to present the federal agency's new campaign promoting condoms. 
And Warren (Buck) Buckingham, an assistant to White House AIDS Policy 
Coordinator Kristine M. Gebbie, will deliver a keynote address. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Bennett, an Episcopal priest, adds: "The questions we as a 
church ask go beyond 'Do we keep you alive or do you die?' They include: 'Is 
there spiritual healing in your life?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that if you are in a spiritually restful place, your physical healing 
is better. Part of spiritual restfulness is being in a proper relationship with 
God and your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops are aimed at helping churches that want to start or expand AIDS 
ministries by teaching them about successful ones. "Churches should know that 
they don't have to reinvent the wheel in order to help their communities," 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers include the Rev. Malcolm Boyd, an Episcopal priest, author and 
activist, and Olga Morales Aguirie, founder of the Mujeres (Women with AIDS) 
Project in San Antonio. Co-chairing the event are the Revs. William McCord 
Thigpen and Carmen Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in attendance will be the Rt. Rev. Frederick Borsch, Bishop of the 
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, Yona Okoth, Anglican Archbishop of Uganda, 
and Bishops Robert Miller of the Pacifica Synod and J. Roger Anderson of the 
Southern California West Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked the reason for his personal involvement in the AIDS conference, Bennett 
responded: "The bottom line for me, because I'm a Christian, is that we are 
called to offer God's love in the midst of a crisis where so many are 
considered unlovable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened for me," he said, "is that I have learned more about the 
Gospel and God's love doing this work than I ever did in the seminary." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will begin at 11:30 a.m. Thursday and run until the following 
Sunday morning at the Sheraton Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica. Some separate 
Episcopal and Lutheran sessions will be held next Saturday. Registration is 
$250. For information, phone (213) 975-1274. DATES

NOT THE POPULAR VIEW BUT . . .; INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, HARDING SHOULD 
SKATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike some of her predecessors, who often seemed as graceful off the ice as 
on, figure skater Tonya Harding is not about to become America's sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, had a tough childhood and grew up as adept at fixing cars as 
soaring above the ice. She proclaimed herself a woman of "rough edges" this 
week as she begged to be allowed to compete next month in the winter Olympics 
in Norway, despite the swirl about her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her protestation of innocence is likely to be sorely tested. On Friday, "NBC 
Nightly News" reported that Harding's ex-husband repeatedly told FBI 
investigators that the skater was in on the plot to assault her chief rival, 
Nancy Kerrigan, and that she gave final approval to the attack. If that is 
true, then Harding should not only be barred from the Olympics but should be 
punished fully under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is far from proven that she is guilty. Indeed, her main accuser -- 
ex-husband Jeff Gillooly -- reportedly will be allowed to plead to only one 
count of racketeering in the case. In other words, he appears to have cut a 
deal with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the American belief that one is innocent until proven guilty 
is required only in court, of course. However, it's a good principle to apply 
in this case as well: It is the reason that Harding should be allowed to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
 The only persons who have been arrested in the assault on Kerrigan Jan. 6 are 
Gillooly, Harding's former bodyguard and two other men. The attack, in which a 
man clubbed Kerrigan on the knee, was allegedly intended to disable the skater; 
it succeeded but apparently will not keep her out of Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding insists she did not know of the Kerrigan attack in advance, though she 
has acknowledged learning about it afterward. She clearly erred in not telling 
authorities. Still, Harding has not been formally accused of any crime. Let her 
skate.

HOW CHEATERS COULD RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE; THREE-DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR FOOD AID 
IS SAD, BUT NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is right to want federal emergency aid -- including food 
stamps -- to get to earthquake victims as quickly as possible. Washington's 
comparatively speedy mobilization is welcome, as is its corrective attention to 
the problems resulting from a powerful earthquake in a heavily populated city 
and an unprecedented demand for government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent frustration -- fraudulent claims for food stamps -- has 
swollen lines and tempers at county welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 45,000 people have sought the emergency food coupons since Monday. 
While most truly need food, the lines include those who seek to exploit the 
government's compassion and even to intimidate county workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This mess has prompted the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to seek 
federal permission to buy a little time to certify claims. The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, which administers the government food programs, agreed to allow 
county workers a three-day processing period to verify need. That waiting 
period will take effect today.  
</P>
<P>
 The new 72-hour safeguard is expected to scare away many dishonest applicants, 
thus reducing the lines. Local authorities and federal inspectors are also 
visiting welfare offices to discourage phony claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors plan to pursue charges against ineligible food stamp recipients, 
including those who have received multiple allotments from different locations. 
Many will be arrested when the county's computerized system sorts the 
information, and they will face fines of up to $250,000 and prison terms as 
long as 20 years. The book should be thrown at the greedy criminals who are 
penalizing the real victims and eroding the taxpayers' trust. 
</P>
<P>
 If taxpayers start to believe federal disaster relief has turned into a 
fraudulent giveaway, Congress -- being pressed by the Administration to act 
before its February recess -- may be reluctant to approve the $6.6-billion 
supplemental aid package urgently needed by Southern California. Votes surely 
would be lost if the fraud was unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 The new three-day wait for food stamps replaces the more compassionate 
emergency procedure that allowed Mississippi River flood victims to simply show 
a driver's license or photo identification card as proof of residence and 
attest to their low income and losses. Those applicants typically received the 
food stamps on the day they applied. That approach, which replaced the 
customary and lengthy food stamp verification process, works best in less 
populated areas where people tend to know one another. Unfortunately, the honor 
system has not worked universally in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungry families who suffered because of the earthquake should not have to wait 
another single day for food. Already victimized by the temblor, they now are 
victimized by dishonest neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new safeguard in the emergency food stamp program is unavoidable in the 
current unruly climate. But it's a shame that federal and local officials who 
are working without pause to help thousands must be plagued by a relative 
handful of vultures who are abusing government's helping hand.

YES, THE WAR IS OVER; SENATE VOTE GIVES CLINTON COVER ON VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years after the United States bitterly pulled out of Saigon and 
slapped a trading embargo against Vietnam, Washington appears to be moving 
toward resuming trade. It is time to lift the embargo, though this is an 
especially sensitive call for President Clinton, who did not serve in the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the United States stands alone among major nations in forbidding its 
citizens and companies to trade with the Vietnamese. International lending 
institutions have begun to grant loans to Vietnam for major rebuilding 
projects, but American interests cannot participate directly in the 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in U.S. economic interest to resume trading. Indeed, a greater American 
presence in Vietnam might help bring closure to the issue that has festered 
longest between the two nations -- the fate of Americans still listed as 
missing in action in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has provided some political cover for the President to move in this 
direction, voting by a wide margin Thursday in favor of resuming trade with 
Vietnam. The non-binding resolution calls on the President to end the embargo 
as expeditiously as possible. The White House said Clinton has not made a 
decision and is still assessing whether the Vietnamese are doing their best in 
accounting for the 2,200 Americans who remain missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Many veterans groups and families of MIA-POWS raised objections to the 
Senate's vote. They maintain that the embargo is their only leverage. That may 
have been the case, considering the recent significant progress on the MIA 
issue. But as Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a Vietnam veteran who has chaired the 
Senate's yearlong investigation into the MIA-POW issue, said, "If we don't 
proceed forward we can lose the ability to get the answers we are getting 
today." Lifting the embargo would not end the MIA search. What it would do is 
benefit both nations.

<P>
 The vast majority of retailers know that, morality and law aside, it is not 
good business to price gouge. Customers have long memories!

 I also believe your examples of gouging are apocryphal. Do you really think

 * I work in Westwood, and on Monday I went to work to see how bad the damage 
was to our place. We were pretty lucky, not much damage. We opened for business 
that day to help people with emergency items such as batteries and radios, we 
even marked down the prices of our batteries so we could try to help others in 
some small way. 
</P>
<P>
 I got upset that day at something that happened later in the afternoon. I went 
outside and began talking to people passing by. One mother and her daughter 
just got into town the night before from Texas. I began talking to them and 
told them not to worry too much. Then she asked me for a quarter for the 
parking meter. I told her not to worry today, that I was sure no meter people 
were out today. But alas she pointed out to me that the car behind hers just 
got a parking ticket, so I gave her a quarter. I find it appalling that the 
city had these people giving out parking tickets the day of the earthquake. 
Business in Westwood is bad enough without the help of the city and its parking 
enforcers.

deal with the disaster. Phone lines from the Long Beach network were either 
down or busy just minutes after the quake. I called out of the Whittier branch 
to reach the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a world! The boards were filled with volunteers willing to call 
relatives for victims and vice versa; postings would read "(510) WILL CALL FOR 
YOU" showing someone in an area code willing to call family members for people 
who can reach Prodigy but not a long-distance phone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Global Village we were warned about; it isn't that bad, after 
all. I wept at the simplicity and beauty of the quick notes crisscrossing the 
states. Marshall McLuhan would have been proud. Thanks, Prodigy!

reassuring.

U.S. RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * John McAlister in his introduction to "Vo Nguyen Giap" (Opinion, Jan. 9) and 
his interview created many false perceptions, among them that lifting the U.S. 
embargo against Vietnam would be a "cure-all" solution for all Vietnamese 
economic ills and that Vietnamese communists have always wanted to be on our 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the sorry state of the Vietnam economy was a direct result of 
Vietnamese economic and political policies, not from the U.S. embargo, as he 
asserted. After the war ended in 1975, victorious communist Northern Vietnamese 
imposed a Soviet-style economy on the South, centralizing all decisions, 
collectivizing all agricultural and industrial productions, and destroying all 
forms of private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve Vietnam's "poverty and economic backwardness" requires much more than 
U.S. money. First and foremost, a change in Vietnam's leadership. Vietnamese 
people do not have any confidence in the current government that has become so 
inept and corrupted. The only reason why they are still in power is that they 
rule by raw force, by guns and threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-praised economic reforms in Vietnam have benefited mostly ranking 
Communist Party officials. They have used their power to steal from the people 
and to get kickbacks from greedy foreigners. The privatization of the 
state-owned enterprises will legalize their ill-gotten wealth since they are 
the only ones who have money to buy.  
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, communist Vietnam never wanted to be on America's side. Rather, they 
wanted to create a perception that we are on their side.  
</P>
<P>
 The current Vietnamese government wants the U.S. to lift the embargo and 
normalize diplomatic relations because such actions will help it to remain in 
power, so it can go on imprisoning Buddhist monks and Catholic priests or 
anyone who dares to challenge its ruthless rules.  
</P>
<P>
 True reconciliation between the two peoples of Vietnam and America can come 
only when the Vietnamese people can enjoy the basic freedoms that the American 
people are taking for granted daily and more than 50,000 Americans died for in 
Vietnam almost 20 years ago.

 * I felt I had been cheated when I read the interview of Vo Nguyen Giap. I 
escaped from Vietnam in 1982 after living seven years under the communist 
regime. My family and I were punished and discriminated against because of our 
background. Vo Nguyen Giap was right when he said that "The spirit of our 
people is strong . . . Vietnam will prevail in the future as in the past 
because of the spirit of our people." The spirit of the Vietnamese people is 
the spirit of independence, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. Ironically, 
the Communist Party that governs the country has not given that spirit a chance 
to survive.  
</P>
<P>
 If Vietnam really wants to establish diplomatic relationship with the U.S., 
its government and the monopolistic ruling party should abandon communism, step 
down, and organize a democratic election.  
</P>
<P>
 Giap said that "it is ultimately the people who will decide" the policies of a 
nation. Unfortunately and ironically, Vietnamese people do not have the right 
to decide for themselves as the Communist Party is the one and only authority 
to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Giap seems to be proud to suggest the lessons he learned from the past 
relations between Vietnam and America. Unfortunately, the most important lesson 
that he has failed to learn is that the spirit of the Vietnamese can only 
prevail when their freedom and civil rights are guaranteed by the government of 
their own choice.

OBITUARY; MADELINE HUNTER; REVOLUTIONARY EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Madeline C. Hunter, the maverick educator and psychologist who was recognized 
worldwide for her research demonstrating that teachers -- not heredity and 
environment -- were the primary influences on learning skills, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA professor -- whose workshops attracted thousands of educators over 
the years -- was 78. She died Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA spokeswoman said she had recently suffered several strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the founder of what is called the "clinical teaching method," Mrs. 
Hunter held four degrees in education and psychology, her last a doctorate in 
education from UCLA in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Her career beginnings were ordinary but in distinctly disparate locations: 
Clinical psychologist at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Los Angeles 
Juvenile Hall, school psychologist and then principal at public schools ranging 
from Watts to Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been affiliated with John Goodlad, scholar and onetime director of 
UCLA's University Elementary School. He named her principal of the school in 
1963, a post she held for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there she became aware of research that challenged longstanding beliefs 
that poor learners came from poor and broken homes, that low incomes produced 
low IQs. Instead, she discovered that teaching methods alone can make the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have yet to find a student who won't learn (when taught properly)," she 
said in a Los Angeles Times interview in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 She also made partners of her student's parents and urged them to encourage 
the self-respect she was trying to instill in the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her burgeoning reputation and the consequent demands on her schedule, 
she made time each day to spend with her students at the experimental 
university school. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young, whose two children attended University 
Elementary School while Mrs. Hunter was there, said upon learning of her death 
that "the worldwide community of educators has lost a true pioneer who changed 
the face of elementary education for all time." 
</P>
<P>
 What she studied and then taught for three decades brought throngs of 
frustrated teachers to her seminars -- teachers battling declining test scores, 
teachers fighting rising dropout rates, teachers in conflict with parents who 
either did not understand or did not trust those they had charged with their 
children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think teachers were born, not made," Mrs. Hunter said in 1990. "But 
I know better now. I've seen bumblers turned into geniuses while charismatic 
characters turned out happy illiterates." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tools involved a language all her own: modeling was demonstration; 
dip-sticking meant that the teacher was checking for understanding, and 
anticipatory set meant review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disciplining with dignity" involved an approach she called "skillful 
manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
 And she also invented characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty Johnny had a mother who constantly told him to shut up. Affluent 
Johnny had a mother with the same message, but who couched it in more genteel 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Hunter not only became popular, she became wealthy. She spoke thousands 
of times for fees as high as $5,000 a day and she published videos and books. 
Most California districts exposed at least some of their teachers to her 
training.  
</P>
<P>
 But not all liked what they heard, particularly her ideas that the instructor 
should prompt new concepts from youngsters. Or that homework should involve 
review or "something a student pretty much knows . . . not original learning 
because the beginning is like wet cement: A mistake is very hard to correct." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of homework is just drivel. Teachers grade homework when they haven't 
the foggiest idea of who did it, or how much help the student was given. . . . 
The real question is whether the student learned what the homework was designed 
to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include her husband, Robert Hunter, a daughter, a son, two 
grandchildren and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations in her name are requested for the Madeline Hunter Fund, a 
scholarship endowment in the UCLA Graduate School of Education.

FAB FOUR ON VINYL AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is this 1994 or 1964? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Beatles fans must be wondering after the news this week that 
Capitol Records is preparing to ship 30,000 vinyl collector's copies of "I Want 
to Hold Your Hand," the Fab Four's first U.S. hit single. 
</P>
<P>
 The move represents the first salvo in Capitol's yearlong, 30th anniversary 
celebration, another of many Beatles efforts of the Hollywood-based record 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar marketing campaign, designed to stimulate sales of the 
group's old albums, is expected to culminate next year with the release of "The 
Beatles Anthology." According to sources, that six-disc box set will include 
Beatles classics and an undetermined amount of unreleased material. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beatles are back in a big way," said Capitol president and CEO Gary 
Gersh, who wouldn't confirm specifics of the anthology project. "The day the 
Beatles set foot on American soil was truly a historic moment in pop history. 
It wasn't just an exciting event for me and every kid I knew, it was a moment 
that altered the course of pop culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr -- the three surviving Beatles 
-- are scheduled to reunite next month to record new music for a 10-hour video 
documentary, also titled "The Beatles Anthology." 
</P>
<P>
 George Martin, who produced most of the Beatles albums, has begun mixing 
unreleased material culled from more than 400 hours of tape from BBC Radio 
archives, studio outtakes and personal collections of the Beatles for the 
upcoming CD set. The anthology package will also include vintage, new film 
clips released in video format plus a coffee-table book. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the unreleased material has been available on the bootleg market 
for years, this package will include the first legitimate "new" recordings 
since the 1977 release of "The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl" concert album. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is truly exciting news for Beatles fans," says Pete Howard, editor and 
publisher of ICE, the nation's leading compact disc newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the next year, we'll be able to hear tons of stuff few people have 
ever had access to before -- tracks like the very first take of 'Strawberry 
Fields.' Even the most jaded cynics agree that the Beatles were the most 
important rock band in the history of pop." 
</P>
<P>
 For Capitol, the Beatles have been a continuing source of major revenue. The 
label has sold more than 70 million Beatles albums in the last 30 years -- a 
healthy percentage of which sold in the late '80s to fans who bought CD copies 
of the old albums. 
</P>
<P>
 When the label's CD push seemed all but exhausted late last year, the company 
demonstrated the continuing sales lure of the group by releasing two "greatest 
hits" packages from the early '70s. The result: an estimated $18 million in 
sales since October despite a hefty $32 price tag per album. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol isn't the only label hoping to cash in on the Fab Four's 30th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Records will soon release a soundtrack album to "Backbeat," a film 
biography of the Liverpool quartet's original bassist Stu Sutcliffe, who died 
of a brain hemorrhage in 1962. Produced by Don Was, the album features early 
Beatles songs performed by a band drawn from members of various contemporary 
rock groups.

A RECORD $5 MILLION FOR AIDS; BENEFIT: THE FIRST LADY IS LAUDED AT THE SOMBER 
AND EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT TO LIFE VII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone doubts how the AIDS epidemic has decimated the ranks of the arts and 
entertainment fields, the point was relentlessly made at Thursday's starry and 
somber Commitment to Life VII at the Universal Amphitheatre, where the 
entertainment industry raised a record $5 million for the community outreach 
organization AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Where previous APLA benefits have tended to reach for a mix of entertainment 
and purpose, this one kept the audience teary-eyed nearly all the way through. 
A show that begins with Bruce Springsteen singing his ballad "Streets of 
Philadelphia" from Hollywood's first and only mainstream movie about AIDS -- 
"Philadelphia" -- needs somewhere to go. This one did, emotionally, all the way 
to Whitney Houston's final song. In between, were no less than Elizabeth 
Taylor, Barbra Streisand and the evening's two honorees, Hillary Rodham Clinton 
and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prayer-like statement, Taylor set the evening's tone: "I never dreamed 
when I conceived this award, that eight years later we'd still have no cure. 
But here we are, coming together once again, to honor, to remember, to mourn 
our losses and to pray that, maybe this year, heaven can wait. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Studios Chairman Katzenberg, a longtime APLA supporter, spoke of his 
friendship with the late lyricist Howard Ashman ("Beauty and the Beast," 
"Aladdin"), whose death he said is a lasting memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who here doesn't dread opening up the trades and turning to the obituary 
pages," Katzenberg said. "As an industry we have lost so much. But as an 
industry we can bring so much more to the fight. The entertainment community is 
like no other . . . no other group possesses such creativity and influence. We 
are dreamers with the power to inspire and educate. And until science finds a 
cure . . . we have the ability and the responsibility to shine the spotlight 
brightly on this plague and on the brave efforts to eradicate it."  
</P>
<P>
 Streisand introduced Clinton with remarks pointed at her husband's 
predecessors: "For more than a decade, the reliance of our Presidents on 
selfish individualism led us into the wasteland of official indifference to the 
suffering of many. One stark result of that politics for contempt and neglect, 
driven by homophobia, is that millions are now afflicted by the AIDS epidemic 
which might have been contained if only our high officials had cared. Let me 
now introduce someone who clearly does care." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton, who chaired the President's effort for health-care reform, said: 
"We are aware that people with HIV and AIDS need comprehensive health-care 
services and that these are too often too difficult to obtain. We have worked 
very hard this year to develop a national approach to health care that will 
guarantee health security to every American." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "In order to achieve that, we have to pass legislation that will, 
once and for all, make it illegal to deny insurance to people who need it 
most." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an environment of anger and frustration, in a fight against an 
unexplainable and ravaging disease, no deeds and no amount of money can ever be 
enough for some: A few hecklers greeted Clinton, shouting that "you've done 
nothing," but they failed to interrupt her remarks. And some cynics earlier 
this week sent out prank faxes on phony APLA stationery. It read that the 
awards part of Thursday's show had been canceled due to a lack of action on the 
part of the recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executive Barry Diller, who chaired the event with industry mogul 
David Geffen, Creative Artists Agency partner Ron Meyer and Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael Eisner, credited the industry with its support for AIDS 
groups. Critics, he said, say the industry "is cowardly, has remained silent 
and ungiving, that it pays only lip service. . . . Well, you Hollywood 
scoundrels, tonight you've given $4,924,009 -- and it will be over $5 million 
in a flash." 
</P>
<P>
 The amount was a record, topping 1992's $3.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The program included tributes to many artists who have died of AIDS, from 
Liberace to Ashman and from Keith Haring to Michael Bennett to some names less 
known outside the film community. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those performing were Angela Lansbury, Jennifer Holliday, Sarah 
Brightman, Patti LuPone and Melissa Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Liza Minnelli and a chorus sang what she introduced as an anthem for AIDS: 
"The Day After That," from the musical "The Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the program, Tom Cruise noted the thousands of the names of 
the dead that had been flashing on overhead screens and, in one of the more 
remarkably touching moments, asked the audience to stand and shout out the 
names of the friends, lovers, relatives they have lost.

POP BEAT: RECOMMENDED DOSAGE; MORPHINE -- A GUITARLESS TRIO FROM BOSTON -- IS 
PLEASING THE COLLEGE CROWD WITH ITS BIZARRE BRAND OF 'LOW ROCK.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Boston trio Morphine has a secret game plan, it's got to be "Lay low 
and avoid the high notes." The guitarless group, with instrumentation from 
saxophone, two-string bass and drums, basks in baritone. Imperfect rock 
melodies and smoky blues grooves rarely rise to a pitch higher than a foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an approach might suggest something as numbing as Novocain, but 
Morphine's sound proves hypnotic and darkly seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music is narcotic," says singer and bassist Mark Sandman, speaking in a 
low, laid-back voice. "It's thick and almost lubricious." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing Morphine seems to do fast is make albums. The trio, 
rounded out by saxophonist Dana Colley and drummer Billy Conway, recorded their 
new album, "Cure for Pain," in 12 days and released it less than a year after 
its acclaimed debut "Good." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its release last fall, "Cure" has crept in slow and steady fashion to 
No. 18 on the College Music Journal's alternative airplay chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our success has been a gradual thing through word of mouth," says Sandman, 
"which seems more natural than something that's been pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandman, who's in his 30s, grew up in Cambridge, Mass., where his mother was a 
social worker and his father ran a small electronics business. His early 
exposure to music included his mother's recorder orchestra. As a teen-ager, he 
became a Jimi Hendrix and AC/DC fan, then discovered such blues and jazz 
artists as Jimmy Smith, Oliver Nelson and Mose Allison. Later, he became 
mesmerized by the offbeat and experimental music of Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 In his late teens, Sandman began playing music and took his guitar on a 
two-year road trip. He traveled from Brazil to Alaska, where he worked on a 
commercial fishing boat, then returned to Cambridge to join his first real 
band, Treat Her Right.  
</P>
<P>
 Morphine started four years ago when Sandman began experimenting with Colley 
and original drummer Jerome Dupree. They all knew one another from Boston's 
tight music scene, where they had played in various, makeshift bands in styles 
from psychedelic funk to jazz. Current drummer Conway also came from the city's 
pool of bands. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obscure artists such as Lonnie Pitchford, who played a one-string 
guitar, who inspired Sandman (who writes all the lyrics and plays a dominant 
role in writing the music) to pull the "extra" strings off his bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was also inspired by an old 45 called 'Cherokee Dance' that had this guy 
playing something called a unitar," he says. "It was a bass string being played 
with a slide. It was so new and great, and it had never crossed my mind before 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics on "Cure for Pain" are often down and out and hopelessly romantic, 
touching on themes from jealousy to love addiction to loss. But Sandman doesn't 
like to associate his own life with the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My songs are not necessarily about something that's happened to me. It could 
be a friend," he says. He pauses, then modifies his position. "The more you try 
to disguise your real feelings, the more they come out. Sometimes I don't 
realize it till six months after the record is out. It's like, 'Wow, that is 
really how I felt?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sandman says the trio doesn't really know where their bizarre sound fits into 
the scheme of rock today, and they would like to keep it that way. "We call it 
low rock. If you have to provide a category, that's the one we can live with. 
You can just say that in the record store, Morphine can be found between 
Madonna and Motorhead."

DANCE REVIEW; A NEW SPIN ON GRAHAM; TWYLA THARP ADDS HER TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Feminist modern dance based on Greek myth: Isn't that exactly what you'd 
expect from the Martha Graham company? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but you might have been surprised by at least one of the company's 
Greek dance-dramas Thursday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an amazing career that ended with her death three years ago, Graham created 
a repertory of masterworks that radically reinterpreted ancient Greek legends 
-- and her "Errand Into the Maze" provided a potent example on the four-part 
Thursday program. No surprise here. 
</P>
<P>
 To music by Gian Carlo Menotti, this 1947 duet changed the story of Ariadne 
and the Minotaur into a study of a woman consumed by fear and then heroically 
conquering it. 
</P>
<P>
 But while female heroism also dominated "Demeter and Persephone" on the same 
program, this Greek dance-drama proved the last thing you'd expect to find in 
the Graham repertory because it wasn't by Graham at all. For the first time in 
its history, the company commissioned a work by an outsider and the choice fell 
on the predictably unpredictable Twyla Tharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Tharp, of course, started out as a dancer with Paul Taylor, who started out 
with Graham -- so she belongs to Graham's extended family. But even though 
"Demeter and Persephone" accommodated the Graham legacy by adopting a narrative 
structure -- and including a Grahamesque diva role -- this 1993 creation 
remained indomitably Tharpian in its emphasis on speed, sequencing ploys and, 
most of all, perhaps, its audacious choice of accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the clash of sensibilities Tharp set in motion: Demeter was the 
ancient Greek goddess of agriculture whose search for her abducted daughter 
eventually divided the year into the seasons as we know them. Christine Dakin 
portrayed her with sorrowful grandeur as the archetypal grieving mother. But 
Tharp's score consisted of irresistibly raucous, sinuous Klezmer recordings and 
the rich, silver-over-black costumes by longtime Tharp collaborator Santo 
Loquasto added deliberate Eastern European folk accents of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The result proved a very mixed metaphor, though you could easily see how the 
quasi-Yiddish overtones here reflected the same pan-cultural concept as the 
unmistakably Japanese accent in Isamu Noguchi's now-classic settings for 
Graham's Greek dance-dramas. Graham and Tharp recognized that the Greek myths 
are universal: You can set them anywhere. Tharp may have chosen a novel frame 
of reference, but she understood Graham's own audacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Tharp's storytelling skills turned out to be feeble, with all 
her frantic rocking-the-baby gestures and other spasms of gesticulation looking 
clumsy on their own and absolutely hopeless compared to Graham's gestural 
eloquence elsewhere on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 What Tharp ultimately offered the Graham dancers wasn't a deep probing of 
ancient legend but rather a thrilling display of contemporary technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best sequences bypassed character and narrative to harness the dynamism of 
the 10-member cast in surging, formal Klezmer cadenzas. And when that happened, 
she made you very, very happy. Besides dancing Tharp's earth mother, Dakin 
became the Bride in Graham's familiar "Appalachian Spring" (1944, music by 
Copland), simplifying the character's inner conflicts but keeping the movement 
strongly defined. Donlin Foreman was her powerful, sympathetic partner and 
Denise Vale a rather lightweight, blandly cheery pioneer woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite these uniformly likable characterizations, Pascal Rioult all but 
stole the performance as a lumpen , grotesquely tormented preacher: as twisted 
and devious as his counterpart in Paul Taylor's "Speaking in Tongues." Equally 
individual, Terese Capucilli's dancing in "Errand Into the Maze" heightened the 
feminism of the work by showing how the woman's fears empowered the male threat 
personified by Mario Camacho. Indeed, he scarcely seemed to exist except in her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1936 to music by Wallinford Riegger), "Steps in the Street" 
represented only a brief fragment of a lost suite titled "Chronicle." But 
Graham's bold movement design for a central figure (Vale) and woman's corps 
demonstrated an inspired fusion of rhythmic, sculptural and processional 
imagination placed at the service of an uncompromising social vision.

LACMA: POSITIVE NEWS FOR A CHANGE; ART: BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORTS A 99-YEAR 
CONTRACT THAT ASSURES FUNDING AND REOPENS A PATH FOR EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR and SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paving the way for what officials said would be a major expansion of L.A. 
County Museum of Art, the Board of Supervisors on Friday agreed in principle to 
a new 99-year contract that would assure continued public funding and provide 
interim financing for an expanded arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the non-profit Museum Associates, which manages LACMA, 
would restore some of the county's funds that have been taken from the museum 
and make possible the long-awaited purchase of the vacant May Co. facility 
adjacent to the current museum complex on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million purchase and renovation project would allow the museum to 
expand and to act as a hub to attract other cultural organizations, said Robert 
F. Maguire, president of LACMA's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguire said he has spoken with other arts and cultural organizations -- 
including the Children's Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Southwest 
Museum, Art Center College of Design and Otis School of Art and Design -- about 
utilizing space in the May Co. facilities or building their own structures on 
the site. No firm plans have been made, but the concept has met an enthusiastic 
response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8.6-acre May Co. site includes a 290,000-square-foot building and a 
separate 22,000-square-foot retail facility, in addition to a 1,400-car parking 
garage. Maguire said Metro Rail is planing to build a subway station at the 
site, adding to his hopes that the area will become a magnet for arts patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow us to build a major center for education and it opens 
possibilities for establishing a center of the art of the Americas, a center 
for Asian art or an expanded area for decorative arts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how the expansion develops, the existing museum will be enhanced 
by a planned outdoor sculpture garden that will surround LACMA and the nearby 
George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, he said. The sculpture garden, to 
be funded in part by a $5-million bond issue, will be open free to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, if signed by the board and the museum trustees in the next 
several weeks, would end years of bickering and uncertainty about county 
contributions to the museum's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board, which is mired in budget difficulties, cut back its support 
of the museum from a high of $16.3 million in 1991-92 to $13.3 million in 
1993-94, leaving the trustees to pick up the slack. At the same time, the 
museum has suffered losses in private donations and membership revenues, 
reductions of staff (including eight curators) and decreased hours of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguire said fund-raising efforts have been more difficult as the county cut 
back because of the uncertainty it created. Many potential donors, Maguire 
said, feared the county would back out entirely, threatening the viability of 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the county would provide an annual base amount of $14.2 
million, which could climb under certain escalator clauses related to increased 
costs of labor and supplies. The Museum Associates would be required to provide 
a contribution equal to 80% of the county's funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county would provide less under the agreement in principle than 
it did a few years ago, Maguire said that the change was a positive step 
because it guarantees a base amount in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this gives us is certainty," he said. "Without that, we were stuck. Now 
we can focus on building an endowment and move forward with a search for a new 
director." LACMA has been without a director since Sept. 30, when former 
director Michael E. Shapiro left the museum after less than a year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For the supervisors, the agreement eliminates the annual squabbling at budget 
time over how much the museum will get or how much it will get cut. It also 
clearly spells out for the first time the responsibilities and financial role 
of Museum Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will make the May Co. project possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the time to buy buildings," said Supervisor Gloria Molina, 
referring to the tight county budget. "But it is the time to take a good deal." 
And the May Co. project is a good deal for the county and the museum, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is planning to temporarily finance the $18-million purchase of the 
May Co. site and provide a loan of $7 million for rehabilitation work until the 
Museum Associates can sell bonds to cover the costs. Museum Associates would 
then be liable for repayment of the bonds. Maguire said that loans from 
trustees will assist in financing the expansion. "The board is really committed 
to this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief administrative Offier Sally Reed said there would be no cost to 
county taxpayers.

 Money Moves: Some proceeds from the American Jewish Committee's canceled Jan. 
20 dinner, which was to honor Clint Eastwood, will be donated to the Los 
Angeles Earthquake Recovery Fund at Eastwood's request. The presenation to 
Eastwood of the Sherrill C. Corwin Human Relations Award, was canceled in the 
wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Said Los Angeles AJC Chapter President Ira E. 
Yellin: "Since the Sherrill C. Corwin Award celebrates the concern of people 
for their community and fellow men and women, we applaud Mr. Eastwood's request 
that we put our principles into action."

 * More Shaking: "Later With Greg Kinnear," NBC's late-night talk show 
featuring new host Kinnear, will premiere Feb. 28, two weeks later than 
originally scheduled, due to production delays resulting from the earthquake. 
"Later's" current host Bob Costas will tape two additional weeks of original 
programs from New York with guests to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEA Quest: Los Angeles Cultural Affairs manager Adolfo V. Nodal is currently 
in Washington, D.C., seeking National Endowment for the Arts emergency funds to 
help artists struggling in post-quake L.A. At the NEA, which provided recovery 
funds to the city following the 1992 riots, NEA chair Jane Alexander told The 
Times that no money has been earmarked for the quake yet, but "we are 
investigating that now through our congressional liaison department . . . they 
are really looking to see how we can help, if we can help." Meanwhile, the 
California Arts Council's new director, Barbara Pieper, announced that the CAC 
would extend some grant application deadlines and provide new or additional 
funds to affected arts organizations. MOVIES

 Special Screening: Director Jim Sheridan will screen his film, "In the Name of 
the Father," at the British House of Commons Tuesday at the invitation of two 
Members of Parliament active in British-Irish politics. The Universal Pictures 
film, which stars Daniel Day-Lewis, recounts the story of Gerry Conlon, a 
Belfast youth who was convicted and imprisoned after being falsely accused of 
the terrorist bombing of a Guildford pub. The powerful film, which is based on 
Conlon's book, opened in limited release on Dec. 29 here and will be released 
in the United Kingdom on Feb. 11. STAGE

 Closing Down: San Bernardino Civic Light Opera -- a professional company with 
a $2-million annual budget -- has postponed its three-show spring season 
indefinitely, citing a debt that approaches $1 million. The action follows a 
decision by the city of San Bernardino not to buy back the company's home, the 
California Theatre -- a purchase that might have provided enough cash to avert 
a shutdown. Some 5,800 subscribers are being asked to donate their 
subscriptions back to the company. Among the causes of the crisis, said company 
officials, were the recession's effect on ticket sales and the loss of at least 
$300,000 on the company's co-production of "Annie Warbucks" in 1992.

 * Protest Lines: More than 100 members of the International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employees, joined by representatives from several other 
unions, mounted a picket line Thursday outside the newly restored Alex Theatre 
in Glendale, where the first preview of the venue's inaugural production, 
"Sayonara," was being held. Union stagehands, wardrobe and box office workers 
were protesting the use of non-union personnel by Theatre Corp. of America, 
which manages the Alex for the city of Glendale. Theatre Corp. also operates 
the Pasadena Playhouse without IATSE contracts and tours productions that 
originate at both theaters. A spokesman said union leaflets will be passed out 
at subsequent Alex performances, and picket lines will be mounted at each 
opening. MUSIC

 Concert Guest: Violinist Pinchas Zukerman was walking down a Vancouver street 
dressed in his tuxedo and carrying his violin, when a homeless man approached 
him to ask what street corner he had chosen for his concert. The man was so 
taken with the notion that Zukerman was about to give an actual concert that 
the musician invited him along for his Brahms concerto with the Vancouver 
Symphony Orchestra. Zukerman, who offered his guest a choice seat and a 
post-concert backstage tour, was said to have remarked, "If someone is dying to 
hear music, why not bring him in? When I was a kid, I used to sneak into 
Carnegie Hall because I had no money." POP

 Solar Power: U2, R.E.M. and other artists have contributed exclusive live 
tracks to Greenpeace Records' "Alternative NRG," the world's first album 
recorded entirely with the power of the sun. The album, set for official 
release Feb. 1, is the first from Greenpeace Records and even offers CD 
packaging in a special recycled cardboard folder printed with soy-based inks. 
"Four-fifths of the world's energy is provided by coal, oil, gas and nuclear 
power," said Michael Stipe of R.E.M., who contributed a reworking of the band's 
1993 hit 'Drive.' "We hope this album will help turn the tide in favor of 
non-polluting energy sources."

ATTRACTION REVIEW; FAST, FUNNY 'CAR TOON' RIDE FAILS TO CAPTURE TOONTOWN

 "Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin," a new ride that opened Wednesday at 
Disneyland, uses black lights, strobe lights, three-dimensional 
"audio-animatronic" figures, cut-outs, mirrors, sound effects and music to 
evoke detective Eddie Valiant's madcap visit to Toontown in the 1988 hit "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering through a "backstage" area that recalls the Maroon Cartoon Studio, 
visitors walk past dressing rooms for Jessica Rabbit and Baby Herman.Bongo, the 
gorilla-bouncer, scowls through the peep-hole in the door of the Ink and Paint 
Club. (He doesn't respond to "Walt sent me," the password in the film.) 
</P>
<P>
 The ride actually begins when visitors board a small version of Benny the Cab 
for a three-minute sound-and-light show that suggests a noisier version of 
Alice in Wonderland or Mr. Toad's Wild Ride in Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright yellow cars chase each other through a series of cartoon scenes 
that include a mad scientist's lab and a china shop, complete with bull. 
Entering a chamber filled with angular graphics that simulate a cartoon 
"explosion" feels a bit like driving into a Roy Lichtenstein painting; it's 
followed by the requisite stars and little birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers try to keep their cab facing in the direction they're heading by 
spinning the steering wheel (it's tougher than it sounds) as they bounce and 
jerk along, avoiding weasels armed with barrels of the deadly Dip that 
terrifies all Toons. (A sign lists the formula as equal parts of benzine, 
turpentine and acetone.) 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit finally comes to the rescue with a portable hole, a gag borrowed 
from the old Robert McKimson short, "The Whole Idea" (Warners, 1955). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fast and funny trip, but it doesn't really recapture the look of 
Toontown. The sequence in the film re-created the rubbery elan of the 
Fleischer, MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons.

MUSIC REVIEWS; PERICK, LACO PLAY WITHOUT PART/BACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least it left us wanting more. 
</P>
<P>
 With the main event of the evening -- the U.S. premiere of a new work by 
Estonian composer Arvo Part -- never materializing, the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra's program Thursday night at Ambassador Auditorium seemed oddly 
centerless. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop Christof Perick, newly re-signed as music director through 
the 1997-98 season, and the ensemble from performing their Part/Bach program 
with engrossing precision, but it did limit the concert's overall impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Part, reportedly unhappy with the new work, called "Introductory Prayers," in 
its recent European premiere, has withdrawn it from public performance. In its 
place, at the composer's request, Perick substituted the familiar "Cantus in 
Memory of Benjamin Britten." 
</P>
<P>
 Perick began with a curiosity, Part's 1978 "Wenn Bach Bienen gezuchtet hatte" 
("When Bach has raised bees"). The title turns out to be a pun: The 
eight-minute work makes its minimalistic way up (sounding curiously like Kurt 
Weill in the process) from B-flat to B-natural, with buzzing tremolos from the 
strings a main ingredient and a Bach-like summation at the end. It's mildly 
amusing and pretty, but that's about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Part's "Cantus," a beautiful descending cascade of sound, a single 
six-minute sweep, for strings and bell. Perick led restrained accounts of both 
works, clearly textured, avidly played and completely unsentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the brief program belonged to Bach, in vital performances. 
Concertmaster Ralph Morrison proved an exceptionally persuasive soloist in the 
two violin concertos, BWV 1041 in A minor and BWV 1042 in E. 
</P>
<P>
 His assured and graceful technique allowed him to make points with finesse. 
His taut yet elegant phrasing sent the music bounding forward. The sensitive 
accompaniment supplied by the conductor let Morrison play intimately, and this 
drew the listener in like a friendly whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach's celebratory Cantata "Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen," BWV 51, followed, 
with German soprano Ute Selbig, who made her U.S. debut with this ensemble last 
week, providing smooth, coloratura fireworks. The higher the notes, the happier 
she seemed, as her voice took on additional luster and flexibility. David 
Washburn blew merrily, brilliantly through the virtuoso trumpet solos. And that 
was that. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THE STUDENT INCIDENT AT 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' VIEWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without making any judgments about teachers with good intentions and certain 
Oakland students' apparent lack of sensitivity during the viewing of 
"Schindler's List" ("Did Cultures Clash Over 'Schindler's'?," Jan. 22), there 
are several questions that come to my mind: 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of readings, documentaries, guest speakers, discussions and other 
activities did the teachers plan before and after the viewing of the film? Why 
not use the study guide sent to more than 30,000 schools, as Amblin 
Entertainment spokesman Marvin Levy suggested? Was adequate time allowed for 
processing of people's thoughts and feelings after viewing the film? Did the 
teachers preview the film to aid student understanding? 
</P>
<P>
 Students must be taught not only the content of the Holocaust but what context 
the Holocaust experience has in their life today.Otherwise, the event becomes 
somewhat of a science-fiction horror story. 
</P>
<P>
 As a U.S. history teacher for more than 20 years and a social studies methods 
teacher for seven years, my experience tells me that there is no substitute for 
preparation and follow-up. My guess is that a number of students had little 
basic knowledge of the Holocaust before viewing, and I would suggest that a 
frank discussion of people's thoughts and feelings would be a better follow-up 
activity than ice skating. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, a psychologist, says that laughter in this case could be a display of 
discomfort and anxiety. It is important to prepare and warn students about the 
content of each film and the importance of being sensitive and courteous to 
other film viewers.

MUSIC REVIEWS; DIANE ALEXANDER'S 'MERRY WIDOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opera Pacific brought Diane Alexander in to sing the title role of Lehar's 
"The Merry Widow" for a single performance designed to introduce children, 
students and families to the operetta at budget prices Thursday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander had not served as an understudy for Roberta Peters, who sings it at 
all the other performances (through the weekend), but recently she had done it 
at Michigan Opera Theater, which is also run by Opera Pacific General Director 
David DiChiera. 
</P>
<P>
 Regretfully, one has to say, Alexander fit right into the vulgar, local 
comic-book version of Lehar's imperishable operetta, however much rehearsal 
time she had had with the rest of the principals (previously reviewed). 
</P>
<P>
 Insofar as the overwrought amplification permitted accurate judgment, 
Alexander seemed to have at least three different voices, depending on which 
part of the vocal range she was singing and whether she was applying pressure 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not exactly a testament to technical integration and seamlessness. At 
its most attractive, the voice displayed creamy, husky power, but more 
frequently it sounded squally, wobbly and pinched. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's acting was neither more nor less vacuous than anyone else's -- a 
smidgen of real feeling, much less overall dramatic credibility, being an 
impossibly lofty goal here. CHRIS PASLES

 As the end of the millennium approaches, musical revues soar in popularity as 
a way to remember the best of decades past. Revues are also a way to avoid high 
production costs in harsh economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two concerns combined usually results in singing heads, glitteringly 
adorned, impeccably and impersonally performing works grouped by composer or 
genre, where performers smile and bow after the n th number about their broken 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the best revues, songs emanate from real people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blues in the Night," conceived and directed at the Old Globe by visiting 
associate artistic director Sheldon Epps, is among the best. 
</P>

 The show, a 1983 Tony Award nominee and seen at Los Angeles Theatre Center in 
1990, puts more than two dozen numbers by Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington, Harold 
Arlen and others into the mouths of four types living the music in a seedy 
Chicago hotel in the 1930s.

over-the-hill singer belting out fabulously funny double entendre numbers as 
she dreams of her comeback. The lithe Alisa Gyse-Dickens exudes a Blanche du 
Bois eloquence as The Woman (a woman who has seen better days), seductively 
wrapping her body around her dances and voice around her songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Jajuan gives a poignant twist to the hopeful Girl who is destined to 
age into The Woman and then The Lady. And Billy Davis Jr. is all suave style as 
The Man who devils their dreams in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahn Coleman's musical direction captures the spirit of the blues as do 
Marianna Elliott's costumes and Patricia Wilcox's steamy choreography. But 
Douglas D. Smith's set design says it all with the HOT of the neon HOTEL sign 
gleaming through an oversized window. HOT is the right word for this show.

NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On behalf of our editorial staff I strongly object to the use of the phrase 
"Polish concentration camps" in " 'Schindler's List' Breaks the Jinx for 
Spielberg" (Jan. 24). 
</P>
<P>
 There never were any Polish concentration camps, only German concentration 
camps in occupied Poland. This is a critical distinction. This phrase not only 
is inaccurate but also offensive to the Poles and Americans of Polish heritage.

RICK DU BROW: THE BEST PLAY OF FOOTBALL SEASON IS FOX'S; TELEVISION: ITS 
BREATHTAKING $1.58-BILLION, FOUR-YEAR BID SEEMS CERTAIN TO HAVE A WIDE IMPACT 
BEYOND SPORTS. FOX HAS AN IMPORTANT NEW IDENTITY. 
</P>

<P>
 For the television industry, the real Super Bowl this season isn't Sunday's 
Dallas-Buffalo confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Super Bowl is already over -- at least for network programmers. 
</P>
<P>
 It took place when Fox Broadcasting swiped the weekly National Football 
Conference games from CBS with a breathtaking $1.58- billion, four-year bid -- 
a move that seems certain to have a wide impact on network and local TV 
competition, far beyond merely the sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, CBS, in blowing its 38-year football trademark, lost some 
valuable weeks of lead-in protection for its prized prime-time asset -- the 
Sunday night tandem of "60 Minutes" and "Murder, She Wrote," the cornerstones 
of the network in ratings competition. 
</P>
<P>
 On those weeks -- last Sunday, for instance -- the CBS football lead-in has 
given both shows an extra needed edge, a key factor at a time when ABC is 
suddenly challenging the No. 1 network for the top rung. 
</P>
<P>
 If "60 Minutes" and "Murder, She Wrote" continue to retain all or most of 
their audience after Fox begins its NFC football broadcasts, effective this 
fall, their reputations as two of the most awesomely successful series in TV 
history will only be enhanced -- and CBS will escape cheaply enough in the 
Sunday competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday prime time often is the battleground for the biggest network 
audiences of the week, and Fox, with football, now has a lethal new weapon to 
help its own high-profile lineup, which includes "Married . . . With Children" 
and "Martin." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, football broadcasts on Sunday afternoon will provide us with a 
promotional platform and lead-in, the likes of which we've never previously 
enjoyed," says Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Tortorici, executive vice president of CBS Entertainment, counters 
that while he's "not happy" his network lost football, "I would have been less 
happy at keeping it at the loss of $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't try to say there's no impact. There are minor consequences. Everybody 
assumes that football is a lead-in to '60 Minutes' every week, and it's not. 
And, after 25 years, the American public knows when and where to find '60 
Minutes.' On the perception level, people are saying this is big trouble. But 
on the reality level, it is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of Fox's coup, which includes the signing of announcers John Madden, 
Pat Summerall and Terry Bradshaw, is that the network borrowed a similar ploy 
that CBS used in the recent past to try to improve its future -- vastly 
overpaying for a sports franchise as a loss-leader in hopes it will profit the 
company in many other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 When CBS paid more than $1 billion for major league baseball rights a few 
years back, the move was -- and still is -- attacked as corporate stupidity. It 
became a much-ridiculed burden that put CBS in a deep financial hole. But, most 
important, it was a statement by a troubled network to its employees, 
advertisers and the TV industry that it intended to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, it may well have been a major turning point in reversing the 
fortunes of CBS. For within a short time, the new sense of commitment helped 
lift CBS out of the ratings basement to the No. 1 network position it now is 
trying to claim for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's move in buying into pro football is surely less desperate than was CBS' 
investment in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Fox organization has done quite well and now has expanded to seven 
nights a week of prime time, but it has highly visible shortcomings in key 
areas when matched against the Big Three networks. Among these are late-night 
programming -- where it has failed from Joan Rivers to Chevy Chase -- as well 
as the lack of a full-scale news operation and, of course, sports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with pro football, the sports area is immensely shored up. In addition, 
it gives Fox an important new identity in the expanding world of TV channels -- 
where brand names and trademarks are crucial to make a network stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Fox's owned and affiliated stations now have a highly visible and 
salable product -- pro football -- that can only strengthen them and make them 
more important in their markets. There is nothing more important that a network 
can give its stations to ensure loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox purchase of football thus was smart -- but also because of key 
problems at the network that were emerging. The Chevy Chase failure was a 
nightmare and an embarrassment. Fox programming, determinedly different under 
former boss Barry Diller, seemed more mainstream. (Diller once looked at ABC's 
"Twin Peaks" and said that it should have been on Fox.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fox was, and is, often tasteless, but it thrived on walking a tightrope and, 
above all, being talked about -- from "The Simpsons" to "Married . . . With 
Children" to "In Living Color" to "Beverly Hills, 90210" to "Cops" to the old 
"Tracey Ullman Show." It badly needed some new pizazz to push all the big and 
small problems into the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Football has given Fox that pizazz, although the network now suddenly is 
beginning to shed its old individuality -- for football is ultimate mainstream 
television. And Fox has been saying since last year that it now wants to appeal 
to a slightly older audience in addition to its core of 18-to-34-year-old 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is beginning to look more and more like a Big Three wanna-be -- the way 
the fledgling ABC network in the 1950s upset apple carts left and right until 
it became successful enough to measure up to CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that ABC founder Leonard Goldenson saw parallels in the birth of 
that network and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 For viewers, the important thing is what Fox will do with football. It is 
foolish to think that it won't alter the presentation to cater to its younger 
audience. Madden, at least, symbolizes a certain sense of tradition. At the 
same time, he comes on like a guy shot out of a cannon -- which may suit him 
perfectly for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a genuine free-swinging, pop-off kind of guy, a TV natural. It's 
surprising someone didn't cast him in a sitcom remake of "The Life of Riley" 
years ago. He could play Homer Simpson. It would not be too shocking to see 
Madden in other programming besides football on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the game's still the thing in football. But when Fox is bad, it 
plunges to depths unmatched at the Big Three. And the question is whether Fox, 
which also swiped the Emmy Awards show in 1987 and almost destroyed it, will 
try to jazz up its football presentation to the point of alienating a loyal 
audience. Will we be longing for the quiet musings of Howard Cosell? 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, now on top, clearly had the willies about risking another financial 
debacle. So Fox has the ball. It will also have the Super Bowl in 1997. We will 
know a lot about Fox's game plan by then.

TV REVIEW; 'HEADS' TAKES LOOK AT NEWSROOM LUNACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The once-popular city room yarn, epitomized by the classic "Front Page" and 
later "Lou Grant," has basically been usurped by the image of the ubiquitous TV 
reporter. Few movies dramatize print journalists anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's nothing like an ink-stained wretch of an editor (Ed Asner, but 
clearly not Lou Grant) and a raw cub reporter (Jon Cryer) to bring a fresh 
blast from the newspapering past. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, "Heads" (premiering on Showtime at 8 tonight) is unlike any 
newspaper story you have ever seen. The loony, almost cartoon imagery of the 
movie nicely accommodates the maniacal Asner character, who functions in a 
fractured world anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The weird fun starts when he promotes a naive copy editor in 1950s-looking 
black plastic glasses (the sweetly bumbling Cryer) to investigate the mystery 
behind a bunch of severed heads materializing in the quaint town's grassy 
knolls and back yard swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to a close-up of a sun-glassed cadaver's head bobbing like a beach ball in 
the victim's plastic pool. In the most priceless scene, the editor, who will do 
anything to juice up a story, orders Cryer to stop barfing and photograph a 
headless torso that happens to be reposing in a chaise lounge holding a jar of 
suntan lotion. Cryer's repeated efforts to balance the jar on the headless 
body, a scene director Paul Shapiro hilariously shoots as casual background 
material, is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the macabre, indelicate black comedy (laced with vulgar words and 
raunchy humor) is the arrival of a strange young woman with a beguilingly 
quirky voice (the absorbing Jennifer Tilly) and a rich eccentric (Roddy 
McDowall) who lives in a marbled palace of a house where greyhound racing dogs 
run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 This charming oddity, from a story by Jay Stapelton and a script by Stapelton 
and Adam Brooks, is hard put to sustain its lunacy over its hour and 45-minute 
playing time. But it's a brand of imagination you will never see on the 
commercial networks.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL WOULD FORCE MANSON TO PAY PART OF T-SHIRT ROYALTIES TO 
STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill to require state prison inmates receiving outside income from movies, 
books or other royalties to pay as much as 50% of the money for their 
incarceration costs has been introduced in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation (AB 2579) stems from the recent sale of T-shirts endorsed by 
mass murderer Charles Manson that is expected to earn him up to $60,000 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 One T-shirt design has a picture of Manson behind bars on the front and the 
words "Charlie Don't Surf" on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) said: "It is inconceivable that this man 
may make $60,000 in royalties from his perverse cult following but not pay a 
penny to defray the costs of his confinement." 
</P>
<P>
 The average yearly cost is $22,000 to keep a criminal behind bars, where 
Manson has been for 23 years, Andal said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action, Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) has introduced 
legislation (SB 1330) to require criminals who earn outside income based on the 
notoriety of their crimes to place the money in a trust fund to reimburse their 
victims. 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: AFTER 2 HUNG JURIES, 
'LORD PETER THE CHEATER' ADMITS TO ART THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach sports shop clerk who once jolted Great Britain by posing as an 
English lord surprised a Los Angeles judge Friday who was considering 
dismissing an art theft charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Crutcher Jr. -- dubbed "Lord Peter the Cheater" by British tabloids -- 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 His unexpected guilty plea to illegally taking a stolen 17th-Century painting 
out of the United States came after two federal juries failed in recent weeks 
to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
 His move surprised his lawyers. Even Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer questioned him 
to find out if he really wanted to admit to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two trials, Crutcher had contended that his late father, a former 
South Gate High School teacher, gave him the 350-year-old painting by Flemish 
master David Teniers the Younger titled "A Peasant Filling His Pipe." But when 
Crutcher shipped the painting to a London gallery last year in hopes of selling 
it for $150,000, art experts discovered that it had been stolen from another 
London shop in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents worked with investigators from Scotland Yard to track down Crutcher 
in October at a Belmont Shore sports store where he worked as a $6-an-hour 
clerk. Co-workers knew him as Charles de Crevecoeur. 
</P>
<P>
 But British authorities knew him as Lord Peter Charles de Vere Beauclerk, a 
con man who jilted a string of women and twice fled from police custody. His 
first escape came at his apartment after Crutcher allegedly knocked out a 
detective. Later, he bolted from police who cornered him in a pub and escaped 
by driving a car through a hedgerow. 
</P>
<P>
 His escapades earned Crutcher the nickname "Lord Peter the Cheater" in British 
tabloids. Several of his jilted girlfriends testified against him at his two 
trials. His record of escapes prompted authorities to hold him without bail. 
Those three months in custody will be applied to the sentence scheduled to be 
imposed Feb. 28, said one of Crutcher's lawyers, Neison Marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks said prosecutor Ronald Chang proposed a plea bargain calling for a 
one-year maximum sentence in exchange for Crutcher's admission. BOB POOL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; IT'S HISTORY AND STUDENTS ARE DIGGING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Ventura's Main Street, the patch of dirt looks like a vacant lot. But it 
contains one of the city's oldest archeological sites, waiting to be explored. 
</P>
<P>
 The dig at the Albinger Archeological Museum, located next to Mission San 
Buenaventura and opposite the Ventura County Museum of History and Art, looks 
as much like a garden as an archeological site. 
</P>
<P>
 Green olive trees shade landscaped lawns, and dark wooden benches provide a 
place to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But on one side of the quarter-acre lie remains of the past: stone foundations 
of several Indian barracks; the foundation of Ventura's oldest church, which 
was built in the late 1780s; and an earthen oven built as long as 3,500 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from around Ventura County take advantage of this local history, 
playing archeologists as they dig through the sand, piecing together broken 
pottery and cataloguing previous discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 For a group of Newbury Park fourth-graders touring the site Friday, the most 
exciting moment came when one boy discovered a bead made from a clam shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best part," said an excited Ryan Foster, 10, of Cypress 
Elementary School. The bead was put into a display in the small museum outside 
the dig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked being up on the hill, looking for artifacts," said Jeff Dokken, 9. 
"It felt like you really are an archeologist." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were among the many that visit the museum daily through the city 
of Ventura's Interpretive Outreach Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love the tour because they can touch things that they have seen only 
in books," said Patty Burrus, a teacher of California history at Cypress 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The dig, which was opened in 1980, resulted from a fortunate accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, while digging in the area, a group of archeologists noticed that a 
bulldozer was about to take down some old buildings sitting where the dig is 
today, said museum employee David Aleman. 
</P>
<P>
 The archeologists, who had found some artifacts in the area, raced to City 
Hall and asked Mayor Albert R. Albinger to stop the destruction, Aleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor not only stopped the bulldozer but authorized archeological 
excavations. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: READING WORKSHOP SCHEDULED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County parents interested in learning new ways to share the pleasure 
of reading with their children are invited to bring their youngsters to a 
workshop this morning in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by gifted-education associations and a Ventura children's bookstore, 
the workshop will be held from 9 to 11:30 a.m. at Guthrie Hall at Ventura 
College.The cost is $6 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the workshop is open to parents with children of any age, it is 
geared mainly toward students who are 8 to 14 years old and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will feature two speakers: Robin Rector Krupp, a children's author 
who dresses in costume to present her talks on literature, and bookstore owner 
Jody Fickes. 
</P>
<P>
 In her talk, Krupp will focus on showing parents and children how to create 
their own books. 
</P>
<P>
 Fickes will suggest nonfiction books for children on subjects ranging from 
earthquakes to art. She will also suggest projects that parents and children 
can do together at home, such as simple science experiments, to aid students' 
understanding of nonfiction books. MAIA DAVIS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY; HOPALONG 
CASSIDY MUSEUM RIDES OFF INTO THE SUNSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a Downey museum honoring film cowboy hero Hopalong Cassidy 
closed the doors for the last time Friday evening, victims of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Szabat, who opened the 1,500-item museum with his wife, Linda, in 1991 as 
a tribute to his boyhood idol, has turned down numerous offers to house the 
collection elsewhere because it would have meant either selling or giving up 
the museum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoppy memorabilia, which includes signed photographs, lunch boxes, comic 
books and movie stills, was displayed in a 225-square-foot corner of the 
Szabats' antique store, which is closing because of declining sales. The museum 
items will be placed in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad," said Szabat, 48. "I'm going to miss not being able to walk in here 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopalong Cassidy, portrayed by the late William Boyd in 66 films from 1935 to 
1948 and later on television, was known as a paragon of Western virtue, a 
classic good guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Szabat estimates that nearly 13,000 people have seen the Hoppy paraphernalia, 
including 3,000 this month after he announced that the museum was closing. 
Boyd's widow, Grace, recently stopped by to see the collection, Szabat said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 5 AIDES TO 
COUNCILMAN SVORINICH CALL IT QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five aides to Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., including his 
longtime friend and chief deputy, John Vidovich, have left his office in what 
Svorinich portrayed as a reorganization but others saw as signs of upheaval 
facing the first-term councilman.  
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Vidovich, 33, was the first to be announced by Svorinich, 
who was elected last year to succeed longtime Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores in 
the 15th District, which stretches from Watts to San Pedro.Vidovich, a Los 
Angeles city fire captain who was on leave to work for Svorinich, had said he 
would stay two years but decided Jan. 20 to submit his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, Svorinich announced other resignations after a series of meetings 
with his staff. Others leaving his office will be Wilmington field deputy Lilia 
Fernandez, Harbor City/Harbor Gateway deputy Brian Hannon, senior consultant 
John Barbieri and San Pedro aide Kate Acuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich did not return repeated phone calls for an interview Friday, but his 
newly hired spokesman, Tom Kruesopon, said the resignations were part of a 
reorganization.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPECT IN BANK ROBBERY IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who was run over by a truck after allegedly robbing a Ventura bank was 
identified Friday as Chris Smith of Los Angeles, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith remained in serious condition in the intensive care unit of Santa Paula 
Memorial Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.He has been there since Tuesday, 
when the accident occurred on California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is one of three people accused of entering the Bank of America branch on 
Main Street in Ventura, holding about 20 customers at gunpoint and fleeing with 
an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The three drove to Fillmore and abandoned the car, then fled on foot. All 
three were arrested after Smith was hit by the tractor-trailer rig while 
running across the highway. The money was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Ventura office, said Smith and 
a 15-year-old youth are believed to be members of Los Angeles street gangs. The 
youth is being held in Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The third suspect, Shoente Lynn McKinzie, is suspected of driving the getaway 
car.  
</P>
<P>
 She made an initial appearance in federal court Thursday before U.S. 
Magistrate Willard McEwen in Santa Barbara and is expected to be indicted on 
federal bank robbery charges, Auer said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LAWYER SAYS DISPUTE LED TO FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A defense attorney said Friday that a 24-year-old Oxnard man was shot to death 
in September because of a dispute over the cash from a robbery he helped plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Garcia, 22, of Oxnard is accused of fatally shooting Michael Wayne 
Mansir near Channel Islands Harbor and robbing a large Oxnard grocery store of 
$187,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In a document presented to the court Friday in a preliminary hearing in the 
case, Deputy Public Defender Richard E. Holly said Mansir helped plan the 
robbery of Smith's Food & Drug Center 10 days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly also said Mansir was shot by Garcia in self-defense after "terrorizing" 
the defendant's wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight witnesses testified at the preliminary hearing but it was continued 
until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecution witness, David Lutizetti, who was working as an assistant 
manager in Smith's at the time of the robbery, testified that Garcia held up 
the store and took him hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutizetti said he escaped by jumping from the car Garcia was driving on the 
Ventura Freeway near Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly acknowledged that his client took part in the Sept. 19 Smith's robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court document, Holly said Mansir was a mastermind in the robbery and 
provoked a fight with Garcia because Mansir was not satisfied with his take 
from the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the shooting, he said, Mansir kidnaped, assaulted and threatened 
Garcia's wife, Malai MacDonald, and their 3-year-old daughter, Paulina. Mansir

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN FACES TRIAL IN BANK FRAUD CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man, charged with defrauding seven Ventura County banks out of 
more than $17,000 in a credit-card scam, gave up his right to a preliminary 
hearing on Friday and will stand trial on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 David Jeffrey Wilkinson of West Hollywood faces up to six years in state 
prison on charges of commercial burglary, grand theft and credit-card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court arraignment for Wilkinson was scheduled for Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary hearings are held to determine whether prosecutors have enough 
evidence to merit charges against a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson waived that right before his hearing was scheduled to begin Friday 
in Ventura County Municipal Court, Deputy Dist. Atty. William R. Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said Wilkinson withdrew money from the banks using 
fraudulently acquired credit cards. He is accused of withdrawing money from six 
Bank of A. Levy branches between Thousand Oaks and Ventura, according to 
Redmond, and one Bank of America branch between Oct. 7 and Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson is being held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: DEPUTIES ARREST MAN IN DRUG CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies have arrested a 26-year-old man described as 
a supplier to street-level drug dealers in the Thousand Oaks area, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Marco Marangoni, 26, was taken into custody Thursday 
night after two men from North Hollywood delivered a package containing 2.2 
pounds of cocaine, said Sgt. Gary Pentis, who runs the narcotics unit at the 
East Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 minutes after the cocaine was dropped off, Marangoni emerged from his 
apartment and was arrested, authorities said. The two men accused of delivering 
the cocaine, Alfonso Reyes, 21, and Vincent Lizaar, 20, were arrested shortly 
after leaving Marangoni's apartment complex near the intersection of Hampshire 
and Triunfo Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of possessing 
cocaine for sale and criminal conspiracy. Marangoni and Reyes were both being 
held Friday night in lieu of $20,000 bail. Lizaar was released Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Marangoni's apartment, narcotics detectives found a loaded, 12-gauge 
shotgun and a small amount of marijuana, authorities said. They also found some 
additional cocaine in the rental car driven by Lizaar and Reyes, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis said more arrests are possible. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: COUNCIL TO WEIGH CABLE TV PROTOCOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cable television subscribers will be able to lodge formal complaints about -- 
or endorsements of -- rates charged for basic service if the Thousand Oaks City 
Council approves a protocol for regulating cable TV charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting the protocol is the final step before Thousand Oaks can receive 
federal certification as a body capable of regulating local cable rates for 
basic-tier service. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page protocol, which the council will consider Tuesday, outlines 
both consumers' and cable companies' rights should the city decide to step in 
and regulate basic cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens Tuesday night won't affect subscribers directly, but it will 
give them an opportunity to appear and make comments" in a future public 
hearing, cable consultant Tracy Westen said. "It also gives cable companies the 
right to appeal and to keep some data confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents interested in cable issues do not have to wait for the city to 
challenge basic-tier rates to put their two cents in. They can apply for one of 
seven vacancies on the Citizens' Advisory Cable TV Issues Committee, chaired by 
Councilman Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee helps city staff monitor the performance of the two cable 
companies serving Thousand Oaks: Falcon Cable and Ventura County Cablevision. 
The advisory board also makes recommendations on use of the public-access video 
production van. Finally, it evaluates applications for city grants to film 
public-access TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is seeking five Ventura County Cablevision subscribers and two 
Falcon Cable subscribers to fill the vacancies. STEPHANIE SIMON

AL MARTINEZ: THE HOUSE THAT IRV APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wasn't going to write another earthquake column because, God knows, we've 
all had it up to our bobbitts with seismic tremors, but I couldn't let the 
latest L.A. disaster go by without thanking Irv. 
</P>
<P>
 I was thinking about him the other day as I was putting hundreds of books back 
on their shelves that had been knocked to the floor in the six-point-sixer. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone I know is still involved in putting their books back. They left them 
until last because you can kick books aside without slicing off a toe or 
breaking your neck, and not bother with them until all the glass is swept up 
and the pictures rehung. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is a kind of joy to organizing books, to holding them and looking 
through them at your leisure. Lifting them back on the shelves is a little 
taxing, but, as a novelist friend pointed out, it's still a hell of a lot 
easier to lift a book than to write one. 
</P>
<P>
 About Irv. He came to mind when it dawned on me that the worst damage to our 
house was things dumped on the floor. Nothing cracked or split or shattered, 
and the place remained firmly on its foundation. There is no question in my 
mind all that is due to Irv. 
</P>
<P>
 His full name is Irv Erickson. He was an L.A. County building inspector who, 
in 1978, had the power of final approval over a major addition we were making 
to our house. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv insisted we put in steel pilings, sheer walls, metal straps and a lot of 
other things that kept the old place standing when the earth shook like a dog 
after a bath. Irv saved our place. But it wasn't easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take those steel pilings. Irv insisted we put in nine of them to bedrock, 
which would have added $18,000 to the cost of the addition. When I heard that, 
I went looking for him with hatred in my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not unusual. Doug Browne, who manages the Calabasas office of the 
building and safety division, tells me building inspectors are often hated. 
Sometimes they are the object of tears, shouts, spit and threats of physical 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not big enough or strong enough to worry anyone, but I was foaming at the 
mouth by the time I found Irv, who was at the bottom of a six-foot hole 
inspecting some kind of concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 I jumped into the hole with him and argued for 45 minutes against the 
necessity of putting in pilings, but Irv, who was a soft-spoken, slow-talking 
man, just kept saying I had to have them to make the place shaker-proof, no two 
ways about it. 
</P>
<P>
 He reminded me of one of those solemn, taciturn Northeasterners who insist in 
very few words you can't get there from here no matter what the map says. 
</P>
<P>
 The only emotion Irv manifested during the ordeal was when I finally gave up 
and said, "How do I get out of this hole?" 
</P>
<P>
 Irv said, "How'd you get in?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "I jumped in." 
</P>
<P>
 Irv smiled slightly and said, "Jump out." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the end of it. The pilings weren't enough for Irv. He wanted large 
sheets of plywood nailed up in the basement to prevent horizontal movement and 
a couple of dozen metal straps here and there to keep it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend suggested I bribe him, but by that time I'd spent all my bribe money 
on steel pilings, and a six-pack of Bud just wouldn't have cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are like that," Doug Browne said the other day. He meant 
people who spit and curse their building inspector. "But we've got to do what 
we've got to do." I felt like I was talking to John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd gone to Doug looking for Irv to tell him he was right about the pilings 
and the straps and all. Doug said Irv had retired about 10 years ago, probably 
from the stress I had caused him in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to know where he is, or even if he is. The last time Doug heard 
about him, Irv was ill and moving out of the area to be with a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a lot of crap," Doug said. "We all do. Usually when you explain to 
someone why something's got to be done to save their house in an earthquake, 
they'll say OK and let it go." Pause. "But some don't." 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about that when I crawled under our house the other day to see if 
everything was OK. I hate being under there because of spiders and God knows 
what else, but I was pleased to report that everything looked fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever you are, Irv, I wanted you to know that. If you have gone from this 
earth I hope heaven has a special little house for you with sheer walls and 
vertical straps. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm sorry I called you a dirty dog-licking, rat-brained, fish-eyed son of 
a scabby harlot. I get a little emotional when it comes to spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll be ever grateful to you, Irv. The house stands. We owe you for that. 
Come on over, the Bud's still cold.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2-ALARM FIRE SET BY CANDLE DESTROYS 
CONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-alarm fire sparked by a candle destroyed one Simi Valley condominium and 
damaged three others early Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 11:25 p.m. Thursday when a candle in a first-floor 
condo at 2057 Calle La Sombra tipped over and ignited a couch.When firefighters 
arrived six minutes later, they found the condo in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 As flames spread to the second story, firefighters punched holes in the roof 
to ventilate the building and wet down the second story. A total of 31 
firefighters worked until about 1 a.m. Friday to put out the blaze, a county 
fire dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the fire, only two of the building's four units were occupied. 
One boy, whose name is unknown, suffered first- and second-degree burns on his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a Simi Valley building inspector surveyed the damage and posted a 
"limited entry" sign at the beige stucco and brick-facade building. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the structural damage from the fire, if a tremor hit it could fall," 
said William Blackmon, 29, who owns one of the upstairs units but was not home 
during the fire. "It's uninhabitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmon said his two-bedroom condo was not burned but has several holes in 
the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wet insulation is just stuck to everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmon said power had been cut off to the unit where the fire began. All but 
one of the renters had already moved out, he said, and the remaining person was 
using a candle Thursday night for light. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A 22-year-old Moorpark man on Friday pleaded not guilty in connection with 
charges that he molested a 12-year-old girl after kidnaping her as she walked 
home from Chaparral Middle school in November. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date for Robert Magdaleno was set for Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno is charged with five counts of child molestation. According to 
authorities, Magdaleno abducted the girl on Nov. 1 and attacked her in an 
unoccupied home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested several hours after the girl reported the incident. A judge on 
Jan. 14 ordered Magdaleno to stand trial on the charges after ruling that the 
prosecution had enough evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The case been assigned to Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele, who conducted 
Friday's arraignment. DWAYNE BRAY

INSULTS NOT NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an old saying in politics that says, "If you can't attack an issue on 
its merits, then attack the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Oxnard Councilman Mike Plisky did when discussing the 
proposal to consolidate the Oxnard police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky has attacked the president of the Oxnard Fire Fighters Assn. (who 
happens to be my husband) for undertaking a door-to-door and telephone campaign 
to help educate the public about what the proposal means to the safety of 
Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at the council meeting, Mr. Plisky insulted a very articulate woman who 
posed questions to the council about the proposal. When she inquired about 
costs, Plisky said she had been "fed" information and suggested she come back 
when she had facts. 
</P>
<P>
 To her credit, the woman maintained her composure in the face of Plisky's 
insult. I was incensed. Here was an intelligent and articulate woman who asked 
legitimate questions and was treated as if she were a mindless sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Mr. Plisky has been a council member for so long he has forgotten that 
the people put him there to represent them. Listen to the people, Mike. Don't 
insult them.

<P>
 It's clear that the role of the city's firefighters has to be changed. Police 
officers are overwhelmed. They cannot finish searching and booking one prisoner 
before the dispatchers are calling them to hurry because they have other calls 
waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, firefighters spend perhaps five to six hours out of 24 responding 
to calls. They do have 1.5 hours for "physical fitness," if they want it. This 
taxpayer time is spent jogging, playing volleyball, basketball, or even golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us have observed the firefighters drive their $400,000 truck to go 
grocery shopping at Lucky or Ralph's, after which they go back to the station 
to cook it, eat and clean up -- all on taxpayer time. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters spend about three hours a day in training. A couple of years ago 
when the city was looking at cutting a training captain, the fire chief told 
the City Council that training was very important since they do not have enough 
real fires to keep his people proficient at their jobs. Isn't that amazing? How 
many businesses would keep employees if there wasn't enough work to keep them 
qualified? 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters have what they call free time. Of course it is not free to 
the taxpayers, and we've all read about the firefighters who think they should 
be able to read Penthouse or watch the Playboy Channel on this so-called free 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's idea to cross-train police officers and firefighters may not be a 
good plan, but something has to change. As a taxpayer, I expect government 
employees to provide valuable services, professionally and courteously. I also 
expect them to be busy. If they can't help police officers with public safety, 
they better find something productive to do.

CITY OFFICIALS OVERPAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent article, "Money Problems Still Plague Port Hueneme," it was 
reported that "city officials are adamant that they will have to trim city 
services if they are unable to build the beachfront RV park or find other new 
sources of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 One possible source of revenue could come from an immediate 25% salary cut to 
city administrative staff.The city manager of Port Hueneme, John R. Veltheon, 
is paid more than $100,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is in a fiscal crisis and cannot afford to pay bureaucrats salaries 
that are four to five times as much as most citizens are paid. Mr. Veltheon, 
manager of a city of 20,000 inhabitants, receives as much as L.A.'s Mayor 
Riordan, who manages a city of 3.5 million, and as much as the governor of our 
state of 32 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city has decided it needs to undertake an entrepreneurial venture 
like the RV park, it would make good sense to consider opening its management 
positions to unemployed MBAs or other business people. These business-oriented 
persons might be able to do a much better job of it and will probably work for 
a much more reasonable salary.

ISRAELI HIGH COURT GRANTS RECOGNITION TO ALL RABBIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON KAMPEAS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court granted Reform and Conservative rabbis their first official 
status in Israel this week Wednesday when it ruled that rabbis from either 
movement must be allowed on municipal religious councils. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related decision, the court recommended that the government set up a 
commission that would examine how all wings of Judaism could maintain access to 
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. 
</P>
<P>
 The two decisions reflect the tension between the powerful Orthodox Jewish 
establishment and the Reform and Conservative movements, which the Orthodox 
dismiss because they deviate from the fundamental belief that the Bible is 
God's absolute word. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orthodox Establishment has banned recognition of marriages, divorces and 
other services performed by Reform and Conservative rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform Rabbi Uri Regev, who launched the appeal that resulted in Wednesday's 
decision, said he hoped it would serve as a basis for granting Reform and 
Conservative rabbis the right to provide such basic religious services. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal stemmed from a 1989 action in which the Orthodox chief rabbinate 
rejected the appointment of a Reform rabbi to the Tel Aviv religious council. 
Such councils are appointed by municipalities to supervise the handling of 
religious services. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling Wednesday, the court said, "Banning candidates because of their 
worldview constitutes discrimination and contradicts the principle of 
equality." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Orthodox chief rabbinate said it was examining the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision regarding the Western Wall was in response to a group of 
religious Jewish women who were banned from praying there in 1990. The wall is 
the last vestige of the Second Jewish Temple, destroyed by the Romans in AD 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem's Orthodox rabbinate banned a group called Woman at the Wall from 
appearing at the wall because the women would pray out loud and wear prayer 
shawls. 
</P>
<P>
 Strictly Orthodox Jewish tradition bans women from wearing prayer shawls and 
forbids men to hear women sing. Uniformed guards maintained the ban by dragging 
women away from the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court upheld the right of the rabbinate to ban the women's group 
from appearing at the wall, but recommended the government investigate how such 
groups could attend services at the wall without offending Orthodox 
sensibilities.

IGNORANCE ON FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. Kapelus' letter on Jan. 5 demonstrated the ignorance of the people of 
California concerning the commercial fishing industry in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 The law banned gill netting not only within three miles off the coast but also 
within one mile off all the islands.This has eliminated fishing in over 95% of 
waters that were topographically feasible to fish. For years the state has, by 
law, limited the combined length of nets carried and used by any California 
gill net vessel to one mile or less. Mesh size has also been regulated to allow 
juvenile fish to escape and to prevent entrapment of sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy special-interest and user groups have abused the initiative process and 
used the ignorance and gullibility of people like Mr. Kapelus to ban one of the 
cleanest, most highly regulated fisheries in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was supposed to compensate fishermen it displaced, but the state has 
decided to rip us off instead. The Department of Fish and Game collected more 
than $7 million to be used for compensation. However, only a small fraction 
will be disbursed. The state will keep the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), the bill's author, or Mr. 
Kapelus, would be interested in purchasing the equipment in which I have 
thousands invested. They can display it as a memento of the hardship they have 
caused people in an industry and way of life that is no more.

CONCERN OVER RADAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your story coverage of the Ojai Valley protesters concerning the disputed 
Sulphur Mountain weather radar installation fails to address the expected 
levels of RF radiation from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Radar has been in use for over 50 years, dating back to World War II.In the 
last 10 years, microwave ovens have become common in almost everyone's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there must be a reliable RF radiation measuring instrument available 
today which will establish safe, acceptable RF radiation levels. If there 
isn't, we who have microwave ovens in our kitchen could be in danger. Couldn't 
we reasonably accept as a safe radiation level that which is measured in a 
kitchen with a microwave oven? 
</P>
<P>
 How much radiation can be expected from the weather radar as measured at the 
nearest home compared to the radiation level in a kitchen with a microwave 
oven? Is it more or less?

EPISCOPAL CHURCH PROJECTS $5-MILLION 1995 SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER HERLINGER, RELIGIOUS NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Episcopal Church's projected $5-million shortfall for 1995 could result in 
the loss of up to 40 jobs at the church's national headquarters here, according 
to church officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected cutbacks, to be accomplished through layoffs and early 
retirements, come on the heels of another major budgetary shake-up in 1991 that 
forced the elimination of one-fifth of the church's national staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of cuts, which could bring the number of jobs down to about 
190, is part of an overall effort to reconfigure the church's national program 
structure. The restructuring plan is scheduled to be considered by the church's 
Executive Council at a five-day meeting that begins Monday in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved in Norfolk, the proposal will be reworked into final form by a 
joint committee on program, budget and finance for presentation in August at 
the church's triennial General Convention in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials estimate that anywhere from 25 to 40 staff members -- out of 
a total of 228 full-time permanent employees at the church's national 
headquarters -- will leave before 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Some staff are being encouraged to take early retirement -- one reason the 
exact number of layoffs remained unclear Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials cautioned that proposals are at a tentative stage and are 
subject to further changes. However, officials have made it clear that the 
restructuring plan will result in some "involuntary terminations." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement from the church, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning said the 
council is being "called to make hard and courageous decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will be extremely painful, others will be very exciting, all will be 
renewing." 
</P>
<P>
 Browning, the 1.6-million-member denomination's top official, also expressed 
"deep pastoral concern" for the staff members who will leave before 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The church statement said that, if approved, the reorganization will regroup a 
number of program units and eliminate some others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the programs being phased out is Volunteers for Mission, which currently 
has about 50 volunteers placed in mission assignments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place, responsibility for mission programs will be shifted to local 
dioceses and congregations.

U.S. BISHOPS EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH CHURCH, PEOPLE OF MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. ANDERSON, RELIGIOUS NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have expressed their solidarity with the church 
and people of Mexico, including embattled Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal 
de las Casas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We share your anguish over the loss of life brought about by the 
insurrection, especially the killings of innocent noncombatants," Bishop Daniel 
Reilly of Norwich, Conn., said in a letter to Archbishop Adolfo Suarez Rivera, 
president of the Mexican Episcopal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly is chairman of the U.S. Catholic Conference Committee on international 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 14 letter, made public just recently, was written in response to the 
Mexican bishops' statement two days earlier, "For Peace and Justice in 
Chiapas." That statement was prompted by the peasant uprising in the Mexican 
state of Chiapas and efforts by the Mexican army -- amid accusations of human 
rights abuses -- to put down the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some government officials had also accused church leaders, singling out Ruiz, 
of aiding the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said the violent events in Chiapas "have deeply touched us," and noted 
that the U.S. bishops were "impressed by the role that the church has played 
and continues to play in denouncing the violence, in calling for dialogue and a 
political settlement of the conflict, and in defending human rights, especially 
the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 In their statement, the Mexican bishops blamed "the situation of misery, 
helplessness and scorn in which the peasants and indigenous people of Chiapas, 
as in other parts of Mexico" as the root of the violence along with "the misuse 
of wealth by some." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican bishops also criticized "the recourse to armed insurrection as a 
way of solving the real problems of misery and injustice" and said that it 
would "be equally condemnable for the Mexican Army to overstep its bounds in 
the fulfillment of its duty," reminding them to "respect the civilian 
population."

SUPER BOWL HAS A KINDER, GENTLER MEANING FOR 4 HABITAT FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like thousands of families throughout the United States, Ronald and Anna 
Cullins of Atlanta plan to have friends in Sunday afternoon while they watch 
the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills duke it out in Super Bowl XXVIII on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game will have a special meaning to the Cullins, who were among four 
families in Atlanta to receive new homes this week thanks to Habitat For 
Humanity International and the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes were built in just 10 days by nearly 20 football stars and 
television celebrities who participated in an event billed as the "Super Bowl 
Habitat Blitz Build." 
</P>
<P>
 A segment for ABC's "Home Improvement," starring Tim Allen and Patricia 
Richardson, also was filmed on site. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit Christian 
organization dedicated to eliminating substandard housing, will be included in 
a prime-time TV show. It will air March 2.

SIMI'S TOP POLICE CHIEF CANDIDATE DRAWS PRAISE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WILLARD 
SCHLIETER IS KNOWN AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDER IN ILLINOIS TOWN. HE SAYS MOVE WOULD 
BE A STEP UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top candidate for Simi Valley police chief is known as a consensus-builder 
who has made striking changes in his three years as police chief in the small 
college town of Urbana, Ill., officials there said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbana Chief Willard Schlieter, 53, acknowledged Friday he is among Simi 
Valley's top four candidates, but would not confirm that he is the first choice 
to replace outgoing Chief Lindsey Paul Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials have said they are doing an extensive background check 
on the best candidate for the slot, but have steadfastly refused to confirm 
reports from sources that Schlieter is their top choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said that commanding the Simi Valley department's staff of 156, 
including 109 sworn officers, would be a step up from his current post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice-sized city, a nice-sized department," he said of Simi Valley. 
"The city itself seems to be financially, economically sound. It seems like a 
really good opportunity to do some good work." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Simi Valley's ranking among the top four safest cities in the United 
States with populations over 100,000, he said, "It's certainly attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Urbana, Ill., is a small city of 36,383 with a smaller police 
department -- 45 sworn officers and 18 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbana and neighboring Champaign make up a metropolitan hub of about 101,000 
people halfway between St. Louis and Chicago, which is 130 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Champaign-Urbana area encircles the University of Illinois campus, and the 
Urbana City Council has a reputation statewide for liberal politics, said Sgt. 
Mike Miller, head of the Urbana police union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of youth-oriented problems because of the influx we've had of 
crack cocaine," said Miller, president of the local Fraternal Order of Police. 
"It's had a pretty bad economic impact on young people. We started seeing crack 
in here within the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Like police chiefs in many other cities, Schlieter had to cope with a rise in 
violent crime in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the year Schlieter was appointed, Urbana had no murders, 49 
robberies, 111 assaults, 528 burglaries, 1,300 thefts, 50 car thefts and 14 
cases of arson, according to statistics kept by FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the most recent available FBI statistics show, the city had two 
murders, 68 robberies, 130 assaults, 435 burglaries, 1,212 thefts, 50 motor 
vehicle thefts and eight cases of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the Urbana's poorer neighborhoods, residents complain that police 
patrols have grown scarcer in recent years, said Jettie Rhodes, a member of 
Concerned Citizens for Better Neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes said Schlieter and other police and city officials have been working 
closely with her community improvement group to push back the rise of drug 
traffic and related crimes, but more should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were doing a better job at patrolling the area before he came," 
Rhodes said in a telephone interview Friday. "Since he's come here, there's 
been quite a few complaints about patrolling the area as well as they should." 
</P>
<P>
 After complaints were lodged, "We'd see a patrol a little bit oftener for a 
week or so, and that faded right out again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rhodes also pointed out that Urbana's police have been severely 
understaffed until this year, and the city's new mayor has promised to hire 
more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Urbana Police Department, Schlieter is considered "pretty 
progressive, as police chiefs go," said Miller, the union president. "He's got 
a pretty liberal bent to his politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's solicited input from the union in the past on issues he thought would 
have impact on our contract," Miller said. The three-year contract, ratified 
last spring, gives Urbana officers a 3% annual raise for the next two years and 
a 3.75% raise in the final year, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers gripe about some of Schlieter's policies, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But generally speaking, police officers are complainers," he said. "With any 
police administrator, you're going to have people that are not going to care 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Most officers welcomed Schlieter's appointment by Urbana's board of aldermen 
in March, 1991, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous chief was a firefighter who had been appointed as Urbana's public 
safety director, but Schlieter is a cop, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his three-year tenure, Schlieter has brought community policing to one of 
Urbana's tougher neighborhoods, computer terminals to its patrol cars and the 
DARE anti-drug program to its schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has a lot of good ideas," said Urbana Assistant Chief Charles Gordon. 
"Some of them have been instituted. I never agree with anyone all the time, but 
we've been able to work with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The squad car computers have helped officers zero in on certain crimes. For 
example, Gordon said, one officer focusing on car thefts was able to spot 18 
stolen cars, many with the thief still driving, in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling community policing program -- so far just a single officer 
permanently assigned to patrol and getting acquainted with one crime-ridden 
census tract -- "has been going very well," Gordon said. "I have no doubt it's 
going to cause some problems, but the acceptance of the community has been very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 While refusing to confirm sources' reports that Schlieter is the top choice, 
Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester said the top candidate is "fiscally 
responsible, very well-spoken, articulate, knowledgeable in the advances of law 
enforcement . . . . The person understands the future of law enforcement as 
community-based." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter served as police chief in Los Alamos, N.M., for four years until 
1988, and earlier was chief in Taft, Calif., and an officer for 15 years in 
Santa Clara, Calif., where he reached the rank of detective sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 An Urbana newspaper reported Schlieter was a top candidate for the chief's job 
in Longmont, Colo., last October. But police in Longmont said the city chose a 
Boulder police commander instead in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter has five children. His second wife brought two children to their 
marriage in 1992, and he has three adult children by his first wife, Patricia. 
She died in 1992 after lapsing into a six-year-long coma following a botched 
operation, over which Schlieter said he sued for malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Wisconsin, son of a career U.S. Army officer, Schlieter said he moved 
around a lot. He went through 18 grade schools and four high schools with his 
father's changes in assignments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he earned a master's degree in criminal justice administration from 
San Jose State University and a bachelor's degree in law enforcement 
administration with a minor in psychology from San Jose State College.

 Simi Valley earthquake victims on Friday finally got what they had wanted all 
along -- special attention from top disaster relief officials and public 
acknowledgment that the Northridge quake hurt their city as severely as any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley's like a lot of other areas I've been to," said James Lee Witt, 
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, after touring crippled 
mobile homes and caved-in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of damage," Witt said. "A lot of people's lives have been 
disrupted, and a lot of people are very scared and concerned."

 John Emerson, a deputy assistant to President Clinton who toured the city with 
Witt, said, "It's as bad as I've seen anywhere in my visit throughout Los 
Angeles. I'm very impressed with how the city has coped." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson said damage estimates in Ventura County could reach $2 billion to $3 
billion, and that more damage will become apparent as time passes and people 
have time to take stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said the opening Friday of a new disaster aid center at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library on Olsen Road should help process thousands of damage 
claims for Simi Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bath, the FEMA coordinator at that center, said about 40 people had 
applied there for aid by late Friday afternoon. The number probably was low 
because not many people know the place is open, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday morning, the 18 disaster centers and 14 mobile centers around the 
Southland had accepted 160,000 damage claims, and FEMA had already paid out $27 
million in aid, Witt said.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency also has added 700 new telephone operators to handle calls from 
earthquake victims who want to make appointments by phone, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he toured the disaster center at the Sycamore Drive Community Center in 
Simi Valley, Witt shook hands with aid applicant Maria Freeman, who told him, 
"We're part of the earthquake too -- it seems like Simi Valley got forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Simi Valley has not been forgotten," Witt assured her. 
</P>
<P>
 After Witt chatted briefly and moved on, Freeman said of his visit, "I think 
that's really beautiful that he came out and showed interest in us in Simi 
Valley. We need all the help we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, Emerson and other FEMA officials also stopped at the Simi Country mobile 
home park. 
</P>
<P>
 There, dozens of homes slumped on the ground at odd angles, shaken off their 
jacks by the 6.6-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get to everyone," Witt told Evelyn and Ted Malaimare, who 
stood in front of their mobile home and the pile of cinder blocks that used to 
support it. "Where are you staying now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "At an apartment," Evelyn Malaimare answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt told her he was sitting in a FEMA regional office in Pasadena on Thursday 
when a 4.5-magnitude aftershock rocked the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were you afraid?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Witt chuckled. "I was." 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour moved on, Ted Malaimare said he faced close to $10,000 in repairs, 
and his insurance policy carried a $7,500 deductible for earthquake damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty shaky," he said of the Jan. 17 quake. "These kinds (of mobile 
homes) go with the flow, so the thing shook more than a stick house would." 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing other homes and the disaster centers, Witt and his entourage 
toured the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, then left by helicopter for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, court officials announced that the East County Courthouse will 
reopen Monday after workers finish repairing broken windows, plaster damage, 
ruptured fire sprinklers and other problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, residents can use the courthouse to pay fines and traffic 
tickets, request traffic school and appear in court if scheduled, said Vince 
Ordonez Jr., Ventura County courts assistant executive officer.

BOOKMOBILE TO OPEN IN SIMI IN WAKE OF LIBRARY DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bookmobile will open next week in Simi Valley, offering residents a place to 
check out and return reading material until their library reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, the bookmobile on the library's lawn will be open from noon 
to 5 p.m. every day except Friday and Sunday.Outdoor bins will be available for 
book returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley library was damaged extensively during the recent earthquake, 
with bookshelves overturned, windows shattered and furniture broken. But the 
building itself is structurally sound and should reopen by the first week in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit of everything was damaged," said Ritch Wells, an administrative 
assistant to Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard, who represents Simi 
Valley. "But it's structurally sound. It just needs to be put back together." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's conference room will reopen Thursday, a month before reading 
rooms are ready. Residents interested in scheduling a meeting in the library 
should call Howard's office at 582-8010. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley courthouse, which also suffered damage in the Jan. 17 temblor, 
will reopen all offices and courtrooms on Monday, Wells said. Many of the 
courthouse windows were broken and an interior water line snapped, flooding 
many offices and destroying some files. 
</P>
<P>
 Total damage for both the library and the courthouse is estimated at $1.3 
million.

DRUG POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * At last some of our legislators have discovered what many of their 
constituents have known for quite a while.The "War Against Drugs" has been a 
dismal failure. Prisons are bulging with minor drug offenders, preventing the 
long-term incarceration of perpetrators of serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug addiction should be viewed as a medical and a social problem. Let us hope 
that the National Coalition for Drug Policy Change and the surgeon general 
continue to seek solutions to a complex problem.

HE'S HAPPY TO SEE 'NAILS' NAILED BY AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to sports agent Alan Meersand for firing Lenny Dykstra, the 
poorest excuse for a human being I've ever met.It's time such egomaniacal 
athletes experience a dose of reality. Mr. Meersand deserves a purple heart for 
his past pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra humiliated me with his ignorant insults and profanity in front of 
co-workers, customers and management when I worked as a waiter at the Pacific 
Dining Car in Los Angeles. He also falsely accused me of stealing his credit 
card, for which I was exonerated by Dykstra's teammate, who later attempted to 
apologize for his behavior. Dykstra, a New York Met at the time, never bothered 
to do so.

FORGET ODDSMAKERS: BILLS HAVE SURPRISING AMOUNT OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Jim Murray, Mike Downey and the entire sports staff: 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, guys, whatever happened to rooting for the underdog? I mean, if you were 
Jim Kelly, could you even show your face, much less come back for more? Much 
less do what it takes to get back to The Show? How about Marv Levy? Isn't it a 
miracle that after last year they haven't come apart at the seams? 
</P>
<P>
 The crow pie is on me if they actually win. Shame on you. You take all the 
excitement out of it.

 The epic spirit inspires some people to persist in personal goals long after 
the average seeker gives up. Yet when the Buffalo Bills, after losing three 
consecutive Super Bowls, earned the right to a fourth appearance in a row, I 
sighed, I can't bear to watch. Their dream has become a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Coach Marv Levy, however, has a notable perspective: "I see this more 
as an American epic. This game, for us, is about what it takes to endure. What 
it takes to come back, keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Three failures followed by a fourth attempt is an epic convention, occurring 
frequently in "The Iliad" by Homer. The fourth attempt does not guarantee 
success. Whatever happens, whoever's fate weighs heavier in the scales of Zeus, 
Buffalo's struggle for a Super Bowl triumph is indeed epic.

 I am shocked and dismayed at how the media are handling the Dallas-Buffalo 
matchup. I work in a large hospital in Long Beach, and most everyone agrees 
that the Bills are a great team and fully deserve to be right where they will 
be on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the media determine that the average fan does not like the Bills, and 
didn't want them back in the Super Bowl?  
</P>
<P>
 I say to the media, give credit where credit is due. Hands down, the Bills 
have been the best in the AFC. Last year they were the second-best team in 
football, certainly not the worst, as they are being portrayed. The Bills have 
a lot more support than you could ever imagine, and much more than you 
obviously dare report.

MEANWHILE, IN OTHER FOOTBALL NEWS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headline of Bob Oates' latest commentary (Jan. 24) was so ridiculous that 
I had to have a look: "This Super Bowl Comes Down to Johnson Against Kelly." 
Why? Because, according to Oates, Jim Kelly is "one of the NFL's few complete 
quarterbacks," while Jimmy Johnson is one of the three "top coaches of the last 
half-century." And who are the other two? "By more or less common consent," 
writes Oates, "Vince Lombardi and Bill Walsh." 
</P>
<P>
 More or less common consent? Since when? What about Don Shula, who has won 
more games overall and been to more Super Bowls than any other coach? And what 
about Chuck Noll, who has won more Super Bowls than any other coach? Or even 
Joe Gibbs, who has won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks? 
</P>
<P>
 You mean Jimmy Johnson has already surpassed these giants in just a couple of 
years? Then answer me this: If he's such a great coach, why couldn't he win a 
game without Emmitt Smith at the start of this season? 
</P>
<P>
 As for Jim Kelly, remember that it was Frank Reich, not Kelly, who 
orchestrated the greatest comeback in NFL history last year, enabling the Bills 
to make it to the Super Bowl. As for this year, any quarterback could have been 
carried into the big game on the shoulders of Thurman Thomas.

 I am disappointed that Mike Downey failed to express extreme displeasure at 
the threats made against Joe Montana to disable him in the playoffs. This would 
really be no different than hitting him in the knee on his way home from 
practice. In both games Sunday, the quarterbacks were knocked out. Intentional 
disabling should be a criminal offense.

 I really thought California had the opportunity to put a team in the Super 
Bowl until I saw the Dallas Cowboys beat the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys were clearly superior. Why? Because the 49ers played like they 
were scared to death. I have never seen them so lackadaisical. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Dallas coach psych them out with his guarantee? Sometimes cockiness 
does pay off. It must give a team confidence, something the 49ers seemed to 
lack last Sunday.

 After reading about the recipients of the 1993 Eclipse Awards, I felt 
compelled to make some comments. Thank you for giving Dehere the award for top 
2-year-old. We all know what a kiss of death that is to a colt's career. I 
foresee Dehere in the Breeders' Cup next year . . . in the Sprint. Brocco is my 
choice for best 2-year-old who can go around two turns.  
</P>
<P>
 For trainer of the year, I select Nick Zito. Why? Because he chose to retire 
Strike The Gold when he saw the horse was facing injury, rather than run him 
into the ground as too many other trainers did last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As for kind gestures, I would give an award to the connections of Sea Hero, 
for donating his $1-million Triple Crown bonus to equine medical research.

 I was deeply moved by the article about Harold Ellis by Chris Baker (Jan. 
25).If there are any parents in search of a role model for their child, I would 
hope they consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harold Ellis makes $150,000 per year or $1,829 per game. He gives 100% 
full-time effort and is ecstatic about being with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Harper makes $4 million this year or $48,780 per game, gives 100% 
part-time effort, blasts his employer and is miserably unhappy playing for the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely I'm missing something here.

REPORTS BRING DOW RECORD, LOWER YIELDS 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks finished the week with another record-setting session 
Friday as a government report showing strong economic growth accompanied by 
mild inflation cheered investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields fell, driving prices higher, in reaction to the good inflation 
figures. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rolled into record territory from the opening 
bell and never looked back. It stayed solidly higher all day and closed at 
3,945.43, which was 19.13 points above the record reached Thursday. For the 
week, the popular gauge gained 30.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Market indicators that encompass a broader range of stocks also beat their 
previous bests. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 1.04 to 265.42, and the 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.65 to 478.70. Both were higher than 
their record closes of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq Stock Market composite index jumped 3.65 to 796.53 and added 2.25 
in the week. It surpassed the all-time high of 794.28 set Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 12 to 7 
on the NYSE. Trading was heavy, with the Big Board's volume totaling 312.64 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelling stocks aloft was the government's first official reading on how the 
economy fared in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department said economic 
growth ran at a surprisingly fast 5.9% annual pace in the final three months of 
1993, the best showing in six years. The fourth-quarter increase was stronger 
than the 5.5% that many economists had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp jumped 1 1/4 to 43 1/8 and was among the active NYSE issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continental Bank jumped 6 5/8 to 34 1/2 and topped the Big Board's actives 
list following word that it has agreed to be acquired by BankAmerica in a deal 
valued at $1.9 billion. BankAmerica slipped 3/8 to 45 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the day's biggest losers was Scientific-Atlanta, which shed 4 7/8 to 
26 7/8 in heavy NYSE trading after posting a second-quarter loss Thursday of 12 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other financial stocks found buyers, including Federal National Mortgage 
Assn., up 1 3/8 to 89 1/8; Citicorp, up 1 1/4 to 43 1/8, and Bankers Trust, up 
1 1/8 to 82 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aetna Life & Casualty said it is cutting 4,000 jobs and will take a $1.025 
billion charge against 1993 operating earnings. The stock rose 1 3/4 to 59 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teledyne shares fell 2 1/8 to 23 5/8. On Thursday, the company suspended 
cash dividends on its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * America Online shot up 7 1/2 to 60 3/4 after an upbeat earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Mexico City's Bolsa gained 30.29 points to 2,743.2, 
another new high. The market was driven by hopes for a peaceful ending to the 
Chiapas conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Other foreign markets got a boost from the subdued U.S. inflation numbers and 
Wall Street's response to them. Stocks gained in Frankfurt, London and Paris. 
However, Tokyo's Nikkei average closed down 133.91 at 18,757.88. Credit  
</P>

 The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell to 6.21% from 
Thursday's 6.26%, pushing prices up another 5/8, or $6.25 per $1,000 face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally a surge in economic growth should send bond prices lower, on the 
premise that more aggressive economic activity could lead to inflation and 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's report also contained data indicating that, while the economy is 
growing, inflation remains benign. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called GDP implicit price deflator, a broad-based measure of inflation, 
came in at 1.3%, well below the 3% some economists were expecting.

<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar closed higher in hectic domestic dealings, in a dramatic 
turnaround from an earlier selloff overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * In commodities trading, gold settled at $376.90 an ounce, down 50 cents on 
the New York Comex. Silver finished the week at $5.008 an ounce, up 4 cents 
from Thursday.

 United Pilots Near Vote on Buyout: Leaders of United Airlines' pilots union 
joined ground crew workers in approving a proposal for employees to use wage 
and benefit cuts to buy the airline.The deal still requires the backing of 
shareholders in UAL Corp., United's parent company. A shareholder vote is 
expected this spring, although no date has been set. Union leaders representing 
5,255 pilots, or 72.7% of the membership, voted for the deal, and those 
representing 1,972 pilots voted against it, the United chapter of the Air Line 
Pilots Assn. said. The 28,200 ground-crew workers represented by the Machinists 
union approved the plan 56% to 44%. Machinists would take a 9.7% salary cut for 
six years.

<P>
 The California Arts Council on Thursday granted East Indian dancer Ramya 
Harishankar of Irvine a spot on its Touring Artists Directory for 1995-97. 
Those who present artists on the roster are eligible for partial fee subsidies 
from the CAC. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, meeting at the Bowers Museum, also announced that it will extend 
by two weeks Tuesday's deadline for certain grant applicants in Los Angeles 
County affected by the Northridge earthquake. The extension applies to 
educational, service and multidisciplinary performing-presenting and visual 
arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring troupes listed on the council's current Touring Artists Directory that 
had to reschedule performances because of the earthquake will be covered under 
their existing contracts, as will any artists-in-residence forced to postpone 
their presentations, the council announced.ZAN DUBIN

'SCHINDLER'S' REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to "Did Cultures Clash Over 'Schindler's'?" (Calendar, Jan. 22): 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that on a day commemorating the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. 
a group of young students in Oakland on a field trip to view the movie 
"Schindler's List" would demonstrate a painful insensitivity to numerous scenes 
of beating, shooting and slaughter of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has never before witnessed so vast a process of human destruction 
carried out swiftly by officials using advanced methods of mass killing. We in 
the older generation know this, and we know, too, that surviving Jews suffer a 
special agony in the memory of millions of murdered family members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be morally and socially tragic if the legacy of Martin Luther King 
Jr. could not be seen as the unfolding of compassionate arms that embrace all 
of humanity and all of history. 
</P>

<P>
 I couldn't believe the reasoning behind the behavior or the 
statements/comments of the chaperons, which I believe showed a total lack of 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not Jewish. With 19 1/2 years in the Marine Corps, I have not seen the 
death and pain the Jewish people have seen. I went to see the movie today, and 
I was brought to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how these kids would react to someone saying that "slavery in America 
was a myth," or "it happened so long ago, and since I didn't know anyone, who 
cares?" How would they feel if a group of Anglos were sitting around watching 
"Roots" and laughing, joking and carrying on? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope these students learn that they have not cornered the market on pain, 
suffering and oppression.

 I wonder if these same youngsters would have acted this way if they were 
viewing a movie about the Ku Klux Klan with scenes of lynchings and beatings of 
African Americans and burning of their churches! 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that teaching tolerance and understanding of diverse cultures and 
religions is sorely needed, starting in grade schools.

JURORS' RIFT EMERGED EARLY AND RAN DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE and BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The testimony had taken five months, but two of the men on the Erik Menendez 
jury were sure they would have a verdict in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 What was there to argue about? The younger Menendez brother was obviously 
guilty of first-degree murder. He was a baldfaced liar, making up that stuff 
about being molested by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 So after their jury went behind closed doors in the late afternoon of Dec. 15, 
both men thought they would be done in no time. Pick a foreman. Vote. Go home. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't have been more wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they were listening to another juror, a woman, passionately telling of 
her personal experience in an abusive relationship. She knew a victim of abuse 
when she saw one -- and Erik Menendez, to her, fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, the panel -- sharply divided along gender lines -- was 
arguing bitterly. The men against the women. It almost came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were split in half," said Mark Dearing, 45, a Northridge electrician who 
was pushing for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen days later, that jury had given up trying to agree on anything, while 
a second panel continued to argue the fate of Lyle Menendez, the older of the 
Beverly Hills brothers accused of murdering their millionaire parents. On 
Friday, it too was declared deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally free to discuss the case, seven jurors later described weeks of 
frustrating and tense deliberations. In both juries, the gulf between factions 
was vast -- and no evidence, testimony or argument could draw them into common 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 On one extreme was Lyle Menendez juror Sharyn S. Bishop, 43, of Northridge, 
who believed that although both brothers "need a lot of help, no doubt," she 
wouldn't mind having the older one as a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Lyle is a threat to society," she said. "If he lived across the 
street from me, I wouldn't be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum sat Jude Nelson, 52, an unemployed marketing 
representative from Sylmar, who called the evidence against Lyle Menendez "a 
classic first-degree murder case." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really wanted to come to a consensus," Nelson said. "But I just wasn't 
going to let these guys walk and have manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jury votes unsealed Friday reflected almost even splits on both 
panels, there were differences between the two. Discussions among the Lyle 
Menendez jurors were more civil. It wasn't just men against women.  
</P>
<P>
 On the Erik Menendez jury, in contrast, some felt that others arrived with 
their minds made up, creating, in the words of Hazel Thornton, "too much 
prejudice . . . to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was . . . not enough concentration on evidence and the law," said 
Thornton, a 36-year-old Lake View Terrace resident who voted for voluntary 
manslaughter. The Pacific Bell employee said to Associated Press that some 
jurors had a "bias against rich people and homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lead attorney, echoed that description, 
saying the jury went through "basically a war" that included "some threat of 
physicality." 
</P>
<P>
 In that war, several of the jurors saw Abramson as their triumphant general.  
</P>
<P>
 Although computer aficionados on the Prodigy bulletin board often poked fun at 
her famous frizzy blond hair, and although prosecutors were enraged at times by 
her aggressive style, the women on the Erik Menendez jury loved her -- they 
admired her wardrobe and biting wit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leslie -- what a pit bull," said Bishop, an admirer on the Lyle Menendez 
jury. "But if I needed a lawyer I'd want (that) one." 
</P>
<P>
 The admiration did not end when the Erik Menendez trial did. Abramson 
disclosed Friday that she had been host to several jurors at a seven-hour 
dinner party at her Hancock Park home recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem with Erik's jury was it was a mix of individuals who 
could not work together," Abramson at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting differences noticed throughout the trial among the public, the 
women on Erik Menendez's jury were more likely to be swayed by the tales of 
sexual abuse, many said, while men saw the issue as either incredible or 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a possibility (of abuse), but I don't think that would rectify the 
fact that they did take the law into their hands to kill their parents," said 
juror Robert Rakestraw, 53, a full-time postal carrier from Canoga Park who 
voted for first-degree murder. "I don't think that justifies their actions, if 
molestation did occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors declined Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg's offer Friday to use 
his courtroom to meet with reporters. Many did not want to talk about the 
marathon trial when called at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurors who agreed to be interviewed by telephone seemed to see the 
case as defined by the defense's contention that the brothers had been sexually 
abused. Many said that the determining factor was whether they believed that 
claim -- not the prosecution's contention that the brothers were driven by 
hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody on our jury believed they did it for money," said Bishop, a member of 
Lyle Menendez's panel, whose 25 days of deliberations were interrupted by the 
Northridge earthquake. In contrast to Erik Menendez's jury, this group was 
relatively harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jurors sometimes merely "tolerated one another," Nelson said, 
they were generally able to consider each others' views -- thanks in part to 
the valiant mediation of the foreman, a 35-year-old Van Nuys mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised all kinds of hell. . . . We all spoke our piece," said Nelson, 52, 
who held out for first-degree murder and said he was frustrated with the 
deadlock. "I have a hunch in the back of my mind this defense was drummed up 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's lawyer, said jurors told her that "at one point, 
the vote was split 9 for voluntary manslaughter and 3 for second-degree murder" 
-- a more forgiving assessment than the final tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although notes to the judge from the Erik Menendez jury indicated little 
movement among its members from start to finish, the shifting vote on the Lyle 
Menendez jury seemed to confirm that its members were actively weighing one 
another's viewpoints -- perhaps, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich, until 
the very end. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were switching between voluntary (manslaughter) and murder and . . . 
they were switching between the degrees as well," Bozanich said after her brief 
private talk with some of Lyle Menendez's jurors. "I got the impression that 
they were switching as recently as today." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the jurors concluded their half-year of service depressed -- 
feeling badly that no verdicts were reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some advice for the prosecution," said Thornton, the Erik Menendez 
juror. "Get some more evidence and prove it in a convincing manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror, meanwhile, worried that she and her colleagues would be mocked 
for their inability to resolve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it my all," said Ruth Slike, 60, a retired homemaker from Sun Valley 
who served on the Lyle Menendez jury. "I don't think the general public thinks 
the jury is any more than a bunch of idiots."

LYLE MENENDEZ CASE ENDS IN A MISTRIAL; D.A. TO RETRY BROTHERS; COURTS: JURORS

<P>
 The Menendez murder case ended Friday without a single verdict as a second 
jury was declared deadlocked, the jurors hopelessly polarized over whether Lyle 
and Erik Menendez were coldblooded killers or long-suffering victims of abuse 
within their family's gated Beverly Hills estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg declared a mistrial in the 
Lyle Menendez case Friday afternoon, ending the six-month trial. A separate 
jury for younger brother Erik Menendez was declared deadlocked two weeks ago in 
the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors promised to try the brothers again for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, broadcast live to a nationwide television audience, was dominated 
by a bold defense, which insisted that the brothers killed in fear after years 
of being raped and molested by their father, Jose Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 That defense, it turned out, transformed jury deliberations, dividing both 
panels into rival camps -- believers and skeptics. Jurors said their debate 
took on a nearly religious fervor at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Records unsealed Friday showed that the juries were split almost in half on 
most counts, with those skeptical of the brothers' stories pushing for murder 
convictions, while the believers held out for lesser manslaughter convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was basically a war," Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lead attorney, 
said outside the Van Nuys courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Erik Menendez jury deadlocked Jan. 13, Abramson declined to call it a 
victory win for the defense -- as some legal experts did. But Jill Lansing, 
Lyle Menendez's attorney, did not hesitate to proclaim Friday's hung jury a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anybody at the beginning of the trial believed . . . these 
two young men were abused or that they could have been motivated by fear," 
Lansing said. "Obviously a great number of people now understand that that was 
the situation."  
</P>
<P>
 Both defense attorneys said they did not believe that jurors at any new trial 
would convict the brothers of first-degree murder, and Lansing suggested that 
"it would be in everyone's interest" to reach a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said that was out of the question. "There will be no 
plea bargain," he declared at a news conference in a courthouse law library. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he had an "ethical, professional and moral responsibility to go 
forward" with a retrial, despite the $1 million-plus price.  
</P>
<P>
 "Be damned with how much money it's going to cost. We're going to seek justice 
in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich, the lead prosecutor in the trial, 
dismissed suggestions that the hung juries were a loss. "I think that society 
is a loser in this case," she said. "It appears now that vigilantism is not 
against the law, at least in some minds. And that's a terrifying thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to set a new trial date for the brothers. 
Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, remain in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just very sad," said Marta Cano, an aunt of the brothers who -- like 
many relatives -- testified in their defense. "The discouraging thing for me is 
I cannot imagine the state of California is going to continue spending money in 
a case like this, where there is no way they will ever find 12 people to 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Though prosecutors have hinted that the discovery of new evidence will help 
them in a retrial, legal experts cautioned that the abuse defense seemingly had 
a strong emotional pull on many jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question remains whether, even with changed prosecutorial strategies, the 
district attorney will be able to share his vision. The evidence to date . . . 
suggests that prospect is not very likely," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury votes show that neither panel was close to a conviction on any count, 
though no juror voted for an outright acquittal of either brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The votes also served as a reminder of the unpredictability of juries. 
Although Erik Menendez was widely viewed as more sympathetic than his cooler 
older brother, his jury had more votes for first-degree murder -- five -- and 
proved far more contentious than the Lyle Menendez panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Erik Menendez jury said their deliberations became almost a 
battle of the sexes, split largely along gender lines. All votes for 
first-degree murder were reportedly cast by men. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked each jury to choose from four verdicts, from first-degree 
murder -- meaning premeditated -- down to involuntary manslaughter, the legal 
term for an accidental killing. Some experts had speculated that jurors might 
compromise on second-degree murder, meaning a killing that was not 
premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 But compromise was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury, five men and seven women, voted this way: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the killing of Jose Menendez: three for first-degree murder, three for 
second-degree murder and six for voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the killing of Kitty Menendez: three for first-degree murder, three for 
second-degree murder, five for voluntary manslaughter and one for involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the charge of conspiracy to commit murder: three for first-degree murder, 
three for second-degree murder and six for not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Erik Menendez jury, six men and six women, voted like this: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the killing of the father: five for first-degree murder, one for 
second-degree murder and six for voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the killing of the mother: five for first-degree mother, three for 
second-degree murder and four for voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the conspiracy count: five for first-degree murder, one for second-degree 
murder and six for not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries were used in the trial because some evidence was admissible against 
only one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a case that began as a whodunit, evolved into a lurid soap opera and 
finally set off debate on the cutting-edge social issue of childhood sexual 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Marked by twists worthy of a theatrical melodrama, the case saw the Menendez 
brothers go from being portrayed as the orphaned victims of a possible mob hit 
to -- after their arrests -- spoiled brats who killed their parents out of 
hatred for everything but their money. Then the defense once again offered them 
up as victims -- a claim belittled by prosecutors but which earned Lyle and 
Erik Menendez passionate supporters among courtroom and television onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, there were many. The trial, replete with tabloid-style elements -- 
homicide, sex, family wealth, secret tapes, a philandering psychologist and the 
cachet of Beverly Hills -- became a staple of the cable Court TV network. Jay 
Leno made the brothers and their post-killing spending spree part of his 
monologue for weeks. "Saturday Night Live" did a skit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks into the case, defense lawyer Abramson proclaimed in court: 
"Let the sleaze fly!" 
</P>
<P>
 And so it did, often in astonishing detail. The defense introduced a love poem 
written by a key prosecution witness, psychologist L. Jerome Oziel, to his 
paramour. Prosecutors prodded defense witnesses to delve into Erik Menendez's 
sexual orientation. And a parade of witnesses provided a virtual trivia test of 
incidents to portray the Menendez household as the flip side of Ozzie and 
Harriet's. 
</P>
<P>
 Their testimony revealed that Kitty Menendez did not clean up ferret droppings 
around the house and that her hair needed a "bleach job." Jose Menendez made a 
niece eat caviar against her wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers spent 19 days on the witness stand, providing more such minutiae, 
but also the broad drama of the trial -- with their tearful tales of sexual 
abuse and descriptions of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez said he was molested from age 6 to 18, and that Jose Menendez 
stuck pins in him during sex. Lyle Menendez testified that his father molested 
him, too, from age 6 to 8. Crying, he said he also abused his younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 After they testified, thousands of people from around the country wrote the 
brothers at County Jail, identifying or empathizing with them, defense lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the case hardly seemed like it would inspire such emotions. When 
Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47, were found dead, the sons were seen 
not as suspects but as grieving victims, even by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed at Beverly Hills police headquarters hours after the slayings, 
Lyle Menendez suggested that his father's business dealings might have provoked 
the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Menendez was the boss at Van Nuys-based Live Entertainment, a video 
distribution business, and "could step on a lot of toes," his older son said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez hired bodyguards for 10 days, saying his parents "were murdered 
by either the cartel or the mob and he was in fear of his life," a guard 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear, however, did not slow Lyle Menendez's shopping. He spent $15,039 on 
three Rolex watches and money clips, $70,484 on a Porsche and even made a 
$300,000 down payment on a restaurant in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March, 1990, seven months after the slayings, the spending came to a 
halt as the case took a 180-degree turn: The brothers were charged in the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 For police, the key break came when a woman named Judalon Smyth alerted them 
that her ex-lover, psychologist Oziel, was treating the brothers -- and that 
they had confided to him that they killed their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than three years to bring the brothers to trial, largely because 
of legal wrangling over the admissibility of notes and tapes made by Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, books and movie deals were cut. The media portrayal of the 
brothers -- now as greedy playboys -- was so pervasive that when jury selection 
began, nearly all the potential jurors knew of the rich Menendez family. Some 
said they were sure the brothers were guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a week before trial, Abramson disclosed that the brothers would claim 
they acted in fear after years of abuse, portraying them as children who 
erupted when they could take it no more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, the brothers came dressed in sweaters to make them look younger. 
Defense lawyers referred to them as "the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its strategy, the defense called about three dozen teachers, 
coaches, relatives and friends of the Menendez family, who related tale upon 
tale of the brothers' childhood, portraying the household as a grim place where 
hugs and smiles were rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the references to caviar and ferret droppings, Jose Menendez was depicted 
as domineering and authoritarian; Kitty Menendez as a cold, rage-filled enigma 
with a drug and alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
 When the defendants took the stand, each said the killings took place after a 
series of confrontations that began when Kitty Menendez ripped off her older 
son's toupee on Aug. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the defense said, Lyle Menendez threatened their father that 
he would tell outsiders about the alleged molestation of Erik Menendez if it 
did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Though such testimony might have gained sympathy for the brothers, under 
California law it was not enough to make a case for self-defense. Under the 
law, child abuse -- no matter how severe -- does not justify murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the brothers' attorneys went a step further, contending that the years of 
abuse made the brothers incredibly fearful of their parents. The brothers 
testified that they were sure they were about to be killed on the night of Aug. 
20 when their parents entered the TV room and closed the door behind them. The 
brothers said they thus burst inside to kill their parents first. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors gave a different version, saying that the parents were 
coldbloodedly blown away while watching TV, eating berries and filling out a 
college application for Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the defense made an all-out effort to bolster the notion that the 
brothers perceived that their lives were in danger. A string of experts in 
child abuse -- a psychologist, a psychiatrist and professors in nursing, 
psychology and social work -- said extensive jailhouse interviews persuaded 
them the brothers were telling the truth.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did not put on any expert witnesses, saying that would only have 
lent credibility to what Bozanich belittled as psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors reminded jurors how Lyle and Erik Menendez had lied in the past to 
police, the media and family about the slayings. In one dramatic moment of the 
trial, prosecutors also caught the brothers in an apparent lie in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The setup was their testimony that they went to a Santa Monica Big 5 store on 
Aug. 18, 1989, to buy handguns. Deputy Dist. Atty. Lester Kuriyama then 
disclosed that the sporting goods chain had not sold handguns since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also scored a victory when Weisberg ruled that jurors could hear a 
tape recording of a session the brothers held with Oziel several months after 
the slayings. The defense had fought to get the tape sealed on the grounds of 
patient-client confidentiality, but the judge ruled it relevant because the 
brothers had made their mental state a central issue.  
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, the brothers said they killed their mother to put her "out of her 
misery," and that their father's infidelity caused her despair. There was no 
mention of sexual abuse or self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, no piece of evidence was enough for a verdict. The Erik 
Menendez jury gave up after 19 days. The Lyle Menendez jury took 25 days -- 
although it met for only five hours over three days this week, after enduring a 
long break because of the Jan. 17 earthquake, which damaged jurors' San 
Fernando Valley homes and the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors insisted that the quake had little impact on deliberations that were 
seemingly doomed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regret to inform the court that we are still unable to reach a verdict on 
any of the three counts or lesser charges," said the note sent Friday by the 
jury foreman, a 35-year-old mailman. 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Weisberg declared a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 As the courtroom cleared, Abramson draped an arm around Lyle Menendez. Looking 
over at Lansing, the other chief defense lawyer, Lyle Menendez smiled.

Chronology of the Menendez Case 
</P>
<P>
 1986: 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez family moves from New Jersey to California. Jose Menendez, a 
Cuban immigrant who began working as a dishwasher and rose to become a top 
executive at Hertz and the RCA Corp., takes over as chief executive at Live 
Entertainment, a Van Nuys-based video distributor. He moves with his wife, 
Kitty, and two tennis-playing teen-agers -- Lyle and Erik -- into a Calabasas 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 1987: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1988 
</P>
<P>
 January: Erik Menendez and a friend at Calabasas High School write a 
screenplay about a son who murders his parents for $157 million. Prosecutors 
later lose a bid to use the script at the brothers' trial. 
</P>
<P>
 July: Erik Menendez helps burglarize two houses in Calabasas, getting about 
$100,000 in property. Lyle joins in the second break-in. To satisfy 
authorities, Jose Menendez makes restitution and his younger son, Erik, begins 
seeing Beverly Hills psychologist L. Jerome Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 July 30-31: NBC-TV airs a movie on the Billionaire Boys Club, a money-happy 
group of young Southern California men who turn to murder. The club includes 
the older brother of one of Erik's friends -- and prosecutors later suggest 
that the film gave the Menendez brothers the idea of killing their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 15: On this night, according to the brothers, Kitty Menendez rips off 
Lyle Menendez's toupee in the family's new home, a Beverly Hills mansion. As 
the brothers tell it, Erik Menendez is shocked to learn Lyle wore a wig, but 
also feels closer to him -- and thus confides that he has been molested by 
their father since age 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 17: Lyle confronts Jose Menendez, telling him to stop the abuse, 
according to Lyle's testimony. He says his father responded: "We all make 
choices in our life. Erik made his. You made yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 18: According to the brothers' testimony, they shop for handguns at a Big 
5 store in Santa Monica, then wind up instead buying two shotguns in San Diego, 
using a false ID. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 20: About 10 p.m., the brothers burst into the TV room of the house and 
blast away at their parents, hitting Jose Menendez six times and Kitty Menendez 
10 times. After dumping weapons and bloody clothing, the brothers drive to a 
food festival in Santa Monica to establish an alibi. They return home and, at 
11:47 p.m., Lyle Menendez dials 911. In seeming hysterics, he reports the 
discovery of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 21: Lyle Menendez tells Beverly Hills police his father's business 
dealings might have provoked the killings.  
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 24: Lyle Menendez spends $15,039 on three Rolex watches and money clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 31: Summoned to the mansion by Lyle Menendez, computer expert Howard 
Witkin searches the family computer to look for new wills, but finds none. Lyle 
Menendez pays him with a check for $150. It bounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 6: Lyle Menendez buys a $70,484 Porsche. Later, he puts down $300,000 on 
a chicken-wing restaurant in New Jersey. "I realize, I look back, it sounds 
awful," he says in testifying about the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 31: Erik Menendez confides to Oziel that he and his brother killed their 
parents. Lyle Menendez, called to the therapist's office, confirms his 
brother's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 2: The brothers meet again with Oziel. Oziel's lover, Judalon Smyth, is 
in the waiting room, and later claims she overhears "bits and pieces" of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 11: In another session with Oziel, which is taped, the brothers say they 
killed their mother to put her "out of her misery" and that their father's 
infidelity caused her despair. 
</P>
<P>
 1990: 
</P>
<P>
 March 4: Judalon Smyth, who has been living at Oziel's in Sherman Oaks -- 
under the same roof with his wife and two daughters -- leaves, ending their 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 March 6: Smyth tells police that the brothers confessed to Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
 March 8: Oziel's bank safe deposit box is searched. Police find notes the 
psychologist dictated after the Oct. 31 and Nov. 2 meetings, and the Dec. 11 
tape. Lyle Menendez is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 March 11: Erik flies home from a tennis tournament in Israel and is arrested 
at Los Angeles International Airport. Both brothers are held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 27: In a split decision, the California Supreme Court rules that Oziel's 
notes on the Oct. 31 and Nov. 2 sessions can be used as evidence against the 
brothers because Lyle Menendez allegedly threatened the psychologist. But the 
court blocks use of the Dec. 11 tape on grounds of patient-therapist 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 7: The Los Angeles County grand jury indicts the brothers on murder and 
conspiracy charges, with special circumstances that could mean the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 May 14: Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg rules that two 
juries will hear the case because some evidence is admissible against only one 
brother.  
</P>
<P>
 July 11: Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson, representing Erik Menendez, discloses 
that he will say the brothers killed in self-defense after years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 July 20: Before opening statements begin, spectators line up for seats in 
court. Prosecutors allege that Lyle and Erik Menendez were driven by hatred and 
greed. Abramson says they killed in "pure terror, pure panic." 
</P>
<P>
 July 29: With Oziel scheduled to testify, Abramson vows to "attack his 
credibility in every way known to man and God." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 4: Oziel testifies that the brothers considered the killings the "perfect 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 10: Under cross-examination, he is made to recount his affair with Smyth. 
Even he laughs at a poem he wrote her: "For like a nymph, she strides from the 
forest at daybreak dressed in white where no other man has known her -- 
Judalon." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 16: The prosecution rests after calling 26 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 17: The defense begins a parade of teachers, coaches, relatives, 
neighbors and friends to depict Jose Menendez as a power freak and Kitty 
Menendez as a suicidal enigma. Weisberg warns the lawyers to keep to relevant 
evidence: "Every time someone picked their nose and the father slapped his 
hand, that's not going to be before the jury," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 10: Lyle Menendez takes the stand, saying that he was molested by his 
father from age 6 to 8. Sobbing, he says he, in turn, sexually abused his 
younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 17: Recounting the slayings, Lyle says he just "freaked out," and now 
mostly recalls a dark room, glass breaking, booming guns and lots of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 20: Lyle Menendez admits offering his onetime girlfriend, Jamie 
Pisarcik, a bribe to testify falsely that Jose Menendez made an unwanted pass 
at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 21: On cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich asks Lyle 
Menendez: "You almost got away with it, didn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 23: Lyle Menendez says his mother appeared to be "sneaking" away, so he 
reloaded and shot her one final time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 27: Erik Menendez, pale and trembling, takes the stand and testifies 
that his father molested him from age 6 to 18, sometimes sticking pins in him 
during sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 1: Prosecutors spring a trap. They allow Erik Menendez to testify about 
shopping for handguns at a Big 5 store -- then reveal that the Big 5 chain had 
stopped selling handguns three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 13: A new phase of the defense opens with five expert witnesses on the 
mind-set of the brothers. Ann H. Tyler, a Salt Lake City-based psychologist, 
tells jurors that Erik Menendez endured "psychological maltreatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 15: Ann Burgess, a nursing professor at the University of Pennsylvania, 
says the crime scene was "disorganized," suggesting there was no plan to kill. 
She later cites research on snails to bolster the notion that prolonged fear 
can "rewire" the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 3: Weisberg rules that the Dec. 11, 1989, tape of the counseling session 
with Oziel now is admissible as evidence because the defense made the brothers' 
mental state a central issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 12: Defense attorneys play the tape for jurors, saying they did not want 
it to seem they were hiding evidence. There are gasps when Lyle says of his 
mother and father: "You miss just having these people around. I miss not having 
my dog around. If I can make such a gross analogy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 15: Smyth, whose tip led to the brothers' arrests, is called by the 
defense to discredit Oziel. She says he wanted the brothers to confess on tape 
so he could control them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 18: After three months of testimony and 56 witnesses, the defense rests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 23: The prosecution, in its rebuttal, calls Brian Andersen, Kitty 
Menendez's brother. He says the Menendez parents were loving and caring, but 
their sons were brats. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 6: Weisberg rules that the evidence does not justify a legal instruction 
giving jurors the option of outright acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 9: As closing arguments begin, Lyle Menendez's lead lawyer, Jill Lansing, 
implores jurors to convict him of manslaughter, not murder. She asks jurors to 
consider: "What in the world could have caused these two boys to kill their 
parents?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 10: With Bozanich calling the brothers cold-blooded killers who put on 
the "best defense daddy's money could buy," Lyle Menendez's case goes to the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 13: Deputy. Dist. Atty. Lester Kuriyama kicks off his closing argument 
for the Erik Menendez jury by posting pictures of the killing scene. Abramson 
calls that a "cheap prosecution trick," then puts up her own pictures, of the 
brothers as naked young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 15: Relating her "fantasy" of seeing Erik Menendez a free man, Abramson 
urges jurors to acquit him. Closing arguments wrap up with Kuriyama suggesting 
that Erik Menendez was gay and that his sexual orientation -- not abuse by his 
parents -- fed the family friction that led to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 10: The Erik Menendez jury announces that it seems hopelessly deadlocked. 
Weisberg urges the panel to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 13: A hung jury is declared in the case against Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 17: The earthquake damages the courthouse -- and the neighborhoods of 
many jurors -- causing a postponement of deliberations for the Lyle Menendez 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 24: The jury finally resumes deliberations, in a trailer.  
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 25: The jury reports: "We are unable to come to a unanimous decision." 
The judge asks the panel to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 29: With the Lyle Menendez jury still hung, Weisberg declares a mistrial. 
Prosecutors vow to retry the brothers.

COLUMN ONE; A PUSH TO TAKE BACK THE PARKS; PERSHING SQUARE WILL HAVE A BOLD NEW 
LOOK, BOLSTERED BY TIGHTER SECURITY AND SUPPORT FROM SOCIAL AGENCIES. MORE 
CITIES ARE FIGHTING TO RECLAIM BLIGHTED PUBLIC AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A purple carillon tower rises 125 feet above Hill Street, with a big pink 
globe dangling from its pinnacle. Canary yellow walls embrace an open-air cafe 
and citrus trees poke up from a rose-colored walkway. A waterfall cascades into 
a fountain that simulates tidal ebbs and flows. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming upon those features in Downtown Los Angeles, even longtime residents 
may be disoriented. They will be hard-pressed to find familiar remnants of 
Pershing Square except for old war memorials and a statue of Ludwig van 
Beethoven, and those have been moved from previous spots of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But that shock of the new is precisely what architects and financiers hope to 
evoke when Pershing Square's $14.5-million reincarnation is dedicated Thursday. 
Haunted by past failures to revive the park, they believe that a radical 
redesign combined with social services and tighter security will erase the 
image of a filthy, crime-ridden place where many feared to tread. 
</P>
<P>
 They also hope to place Pershing Square at the forefront of a national 
movement to take back troubled urban parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept is to make it humane, inviting and, I'd even go to romantic. So 
people feel very good there and react positively," said Ricardo Legorreta, the 
Mexican architect who redesigned the five-acre square, along with the 
Philadelphia-based Hanna/Olin landscape architecture firm. "I think if the 
place becomes the pride of the neighborhood, then 80% of the problems will be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
 From San Diego to New York, cities are struggling to restore the common 
grounds that once symbolized civic pride but too often have become examples of 
metropolitan shame. Unlike previous campaigns, these projects try to tackle 
tough social problems while still planting trees. 
</P>
<P>
 This "quiet rebellion" is led by people who feel unwelcome in city parks 
because of homeless squatters or drug dealers, said Barry Tindall, an official 
with the National Recreation and Park Assn. Many citizens, he emphasized, want 
a change from parks that are "unhealthy or unsafe or aesthetically not 
pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome public skepticism, changes must go beyond offbeat architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 But such change is difficult in these days of tight municipal budgets. At 
Pershing Square, 18 nearby property owners have assessed themselves $8.5 
million in a 30-year bond issue for the park's overhaul; the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency is paying another $6 million.

 Projects such as Pershing Square aim for a push-pull effect -- having enough 
policing to control crime, while providing cafes and concerts to attract the 
public. "I think the key is if they can provide some positive reasons why 
people should come to the park. So people will get used to the park and it will 
become an essential part of their day," said Jane Adams, executive director of 
the California Park and Recreation Society. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, designs are intended to discourage overnight squatting. 
Pershing Square has small lawns and no public restrooms; social workers will 
offer to help the homeless obtain shelter and job counseling. Homeless 
advocates welcome the plan but want to make sure everyone can use the park as 
long as no rules are broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even Downtown boosters know that the national track record on urban 
park restoration is uneven. The square's planners have already heard criticism 
that the use of walls in its design could create a security problem. So they 
are anxiously watching what happens in this, the fifth face lift for Los 
Angeles' oldest city park. 
</P>
<P>
 As a model of what to look forward to, they cite the recent redesign of Bryant 
Park in mid-town Man hattan, which eliminated hiding spots, drove out drug 
dealers and attracted as many as 5,000 tourists and office workers a day. At 
San Diego's downtown Horton Plaza park, the crime rate has been sharply cut, 
but only by taking out all benches and converting lawns to flower beds 
unsuitable for napping. 
</P>
<P>
 Other efforts have fallen short of expectations. Berkeley's People's Park 
remains a trouble spot despite new sports facilities and a combination of 
social and security programs. And St. James Park park in downtown San Jose is 
sliding back to its unsavory reputation after a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pershing Square, planning was complicated because its location gives it an 
astonishing array of constituencies: shoppers from the lively Latino stores on 
Broadway and the multiethnic jewelry district, office workers from Downtown's 
western side, motorists parking in the garage beneath the park, subway riders 
from the adjacent Red Line station, tourists staying in Downtown hotels, and 
homeless people seeking a safe place to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apart from sporting events, parks are one of the only things that all social 
classes attend and care about," said designer Laurie Olin, who collaborated 
with Legorreta. "A lot can go wrong with a public structure today. This can 
either be the DMZ or a common ground. I think it has the potential of uniting 
people rather than driving them apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the block enclosed by 5th, 6th, Hill and Olive streets, the square 
will have an open-air cafe run by the adjacent Biltmore Hotel and five other 
food stands run by the nearby CitiDeli. The firm that operates the Pasadena 
Playhouse plans to bring concerts and shows, both at workday lunch hours and on 
weekends, to a palm-lined stage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to further draw visitors with quirkily colored walls, tunes 
played by the tower chimes and Mediterranean plants. In unusual touches, artist 
Barbara McCarren has paved one walkway with a design that resembles an 
earthquake fault line -- completed well before the Jan. 17 temblor. She also 
conjured up telescopes through which viewers see photos of the square when it 
had white picket fences in 1889 and when it was a center of soapbox oratory in 
1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Recreation and Parks has the main responsibility for 
running the park. Its officials and leaders from other public and private 
agencies promise cooperation to keep out drug dealers and to make sure, in 
Olin's words, that Pershing Square doesn't become "the nicest homeless shelter 
in North America." Officials emphasize that all visitors will be forbidden to 
bring in shopping carts, camp, aggressively panhandle or drink alcohol. 
Although the park cannot be locked up at night, it will be declared off limits 
from 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A police substation has been built at the square, but will not be staffed full 
time. Instead, plans call for patrols at least eight hours a day by city Park 
Rangers, frequent visits by guards from the Biltmore Hotel and the underground 
garage, as well as intermittent checks by LAPD officers and by transit police 
at the Red Line station across Hill at 5th. Counselors from the Weingart 
Center, an agency that aids the homeless, will be at the park much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Callaghan, director at Las Familias del Pueblo, another organization 
that helps Skid Row residents, said Downtown families look forward to Pershing 
Square's reopening because the area has so little open space. But she hopes 
that authorities "make the effort to separate out the criminals from the poor 
who need to be made welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The people behind the project are well aware of past failures to improve the 
park since the once grassy pastureland was set aside as public space in 1866. 
The last cleanup, for the 1984 Olympics, lost its glow soon after international 
visitors left town. A 1985 redesign competition attracted 200 entries, but was 
abandoned amid financing and political problems. The park, named for World War 
I Gen. John J. Pershing, closed for the latest renovation in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The current plan seeks to provide visitors with "both a physical and 
psychological sense of security," said John T. McAlister, president of the 
Pershing Square Property Owners Assn., which helped finance and guide the 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to strike a balance between excitement and vitality and a 
hardheadedness about security," said McAlister, a vice president of Maguire 
Thomas Partners development firm. That company, like others in the association, 
sees park improvement as a public service that also may raise values of their 
nearby office buildings and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Legorreta believes that the success of the Third Street Promenade in 
Santa Monica, Old Town Pasadena and Universal CityWalk proves that Southern 
Californians will leave back yards and cars if the environment is pleasant. 
"The tradition of public spaces is just starting in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be accurate, it is a tradition trying to be reborn. As a reminder, a 1946 
quote from California historian Carey McWilliams is chiseled onto the back of a 
new concrete bench at Pershing Square. In it, McWilliams recalls stumbling into 
the crowded park: "Then it suddenly occurred to me that, in all the world, 
there neither was nor would there ever be another place like this City of the 
Angels. Here the American people were erupting, like lava from a volcano; here, 
indeed was the place for me -- a ringside seat at the circus."  
</P>
<P>
 New York's Bryant Park, on which Olin also worked, succeeded in keeping the 
urban circus under control -- through police patrols and the silent pressure 
that comes from well-behaved crowds, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an era of anything goes and permissiveness," New York City Parks 
Commissioner Henry Stern said. "Now, people are waking up to the fact that a 
park is not the place for the lowest common denominator of human activity, 
whether it's drugs, crime or sex." Parks should be treated "like outdoor living 
rooms -- not a bedroom, bathroom or kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern contends that those rules do not discriminate against poor people or the 
homeless: "I'm not talking social exclusion. The key is behavior. If they don't 
behave, out." 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Bryant Park, although publicly owned, is managed by a semiprivate 
organization that gives extra punch to enforcement. Bryant Park's 
administrator, Daniel A. Biederman believes that Pershing Square could suffer 
because it is to be run by a resource-scarce city department instead of an 
agency devoted solely to that park. There also could be friction between the 
city and property owners association, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban spaces are very demanding. It takes tremendous attention to detail," 
Biederman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pershing Square's designers broke up what had been faded lawns and rose beds, 
crisscrossed by pathways. The new park is conceived as a series of open-air 
rooms: to the north, a performance area with a lawn below; a statue garden on 
the northeast; a central walkway dotted with orange trees between the tower and 
cafe; the tidal pool on the south, and plazas for tables on all four corners. 
More like European plazas, much of the ground is covered with decomposed 
granite and stenciled concrete that aids wheelchair access and discourages 
camping. 
</P>
<P>
 Legorreta's signatures at hotel and office projects around the world are 
thick, brightly colored walls, evoking a Mexican village central plaza. At 
Pershing Square, the walls are punctuated with very large openings and pink 
columns that dramatically frame the Downtown skyline. The purple tower, he 
said, is meant to contrast with the stately Biltmore and the sleek glass office 
buildings nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some critics and police worry that street-side walls could create 
difficulties in monitoring the park from the outside. Some people also grumble 
about the colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless it's managed well, it could become a scary place," said Fred Kent, an 
urbanologist who is president of Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit 
organization with offices in New York and Hollywood. Kent, who helped with 
Pershing Square's Olympics make-over, said the current design has too much 
flashy architecture and not enough comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some nice parts of it that are interesting and unusual and 
unique and I think a city needs to have that. . . . But it's such a linear 
place, people are not going to be comfortable. There's not enough grass." 
</P>
<P>
 The walls, planners counter, are needed to shield Pershing Square from its 
most intractable problem. Since 1950, it has sat atop an underground parking 
garage that ruined the park's environment, surrounded it with awkward ramps and 
deprived trees of deep rootings. The ramps simultaneously cut off the square 
from Downtown's regular pedestrian flow and took away any sense of 
tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers contend that clear sight lines inside the park and from its 
exterior corners, plus intense lighting, overcome surveillance problems. And, 
with two of the eight auto ramps eliminated, a sidewalk finally circles the 
park and ends its isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hauck, LAPD's senior lead officer for the area, said a few features of 
the park are not "police- or security-friendly." But Hauck said those can be 
worked around and that such criticism is minor compared to the positive change. 
The square, he added, complements other nearby revitalization projects such as 
the Central Library expansion and the Bunker Hill Steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you like the color scheme, or the architectural layout, you've got to 
love what it represents -- and that is that this is a new Pershing Square and 
not the old square," Hauck added. "Maybe it took a big, tall tower and somewhat 
odd architecture in bright colors to make people realize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such debates over security and park use continue nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of overhauling a troubled East Orange, N.J., park, underground sensors 
are being installed to alert a security guard or police if anyone enters the 
grounds after hours. In San Diego, taking lawns out of Horton Plaza provoked 
controversy but parks official Ted Medina contends that "essentially we knew 
that in order to purge, cleanse and reintroduce the park, it would take 
somewhat drastic measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet rents are rising and vacancy rates falling around Bryant Park in Manhattan 
and near the reclaimed Post Office Square in Boston. "The notion," Olin said, 
"that public space can be a benefit or a perk instead of a drain and a worry is 
a very different attitude."

JAPAN PREMIER LANDS SURPRISE DEAL ON REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
early today reached a surprise eleventh-hour compromise on political reforms 
that promised to end a mounting challenge to Hosokawa's grasp on power. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented joint news conference on national TV that began well after 
midnight here, Hosokawa and LDP leader Yohei Kono signed a 10-point agreement 
containing a pledge to enact a new reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough, if approved by Parliament before the current legislative 
session ends at midnight tonight, would eliminate pressure on Hosokawa to 
resign or call a general election. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also clear the path for Hosokawa to meet President Clinton in 
Washington on Feb. 11 as scheduled and allow him to dispose of a logjam of 
pending economic measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement stipulated enactment of the reforms before the debate on Japan's 
fiscal 1994 budget begins, implying action by March at the latest. The new 
fiscal year starts April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliamentary approval is expected but not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility remains that new rebellions could occur in both Hosokawa's 
coalition and Kono's LDP to scuttle the compromise when it is put to a vote 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A revolt in the LDP helped pass Hosokawa's reforms in Parliament's powerful 
lower house last Nov. 18, while an uprising by Socialists, the largest group in 
the Hosokawa coalition, led to defeat of the bills in the upper house Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who suggested last August that he would resign if he failed to enact 
political reforms, conceded that the compromise contained "large concessions." 
</P>
<P>
 The original package would have cleaned up Japan's scandal-ridden political 
system by eliminating corporate and labor-union donations to individual 
politicians and changing the way the lower house is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister was forced to drop the ban on contributions. Under the 
compromise, donations from any single company or union will be limited to 
500,000 yen ($4,587) a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the news conference, Kono cited this concession as the greatest "ordeal" 
for Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, condemning corporate funds as a hotbed of bribery, had 
insisted vehemently on a total ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa defended the concession by pointing out that the reform would limit 
politicians to receiving corporate funds from a single body. And in five years, 
all corporate and union donations would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialists' chairman, called the concession 
"unfortunate but unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the party's leadership would back the compromise, but he added that 
members' approval would have to be sought later today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa said he and Kono share the belief that "without reaching a conclusion 
to the problem of political reform, which has been debated for more than five 
years, the economy will not perform well. Recovery of the people's trust in 
politics will be impossible. And international trust in Japan will decline more 
and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the compromise, the reform bills would constitute the biggest 
overhaul of Japanese politics since the American occupation of Japan after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliamentary red tape forced the compromise. With only a day left in the 
current session, too little time was left to print revised bills, as required.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, a 20-member joint committee from the upper and lower houses must approve 
the compromise by a two-thirds majority. With one Communist and a member of an 
upper house splinter group expected to vote no, as few as four LDP members of 
the joint committee could sabotage the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the committee approves it, however, a simple majority in both houses would 
be sufficient to approve the government's four original reform bills, each 
stripped of an enforcement date. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisions to implement the Hosokawa-Kono compromise, as well as a date for 
enactment, would then be added during the next session of Parliament, which 
begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A new lower house electoral system was expected to lead toward a two-party 
system capable of producing changes in government. Until last summer, when 
their 38-year rule was broken, the Liberal Democrats had towered over an array 
of opposition parties, none strong enough to mount a power challenge on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by embracing seven parties in the lower house and eight in the upper 
chamber was Hosokawa able to take power in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now the system for electing lower-house representatives enabled a 
candidate to win with 20% of the votes or less and led to a proliferation of 
small parties. It would be replaced with a combination of single-seat districts 
and proportional representation. 
</P>
<P>
 A method of counting party votes by regions, instead of throughout the nation, 
was also approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Redistricting would substantially decrease the weight of farmers' votes, which 
are now worth about three times that of urban votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's joint appearance by Hosokawa and Kono symbolized a new relationship 
between ruling party and opposition: Never before have a prime minister and an 
opposition chieftain appeared together at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The two announced their agreement after more than six hours of talks attended 
by only Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief of the coalition's Renewal Party, and 
Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general.

RANDOM DRUG TESTING OF NCAA ATHLETES UPHELD; RIGHTS: CALIFORNIA'S TOP COURT 
SETS A NEW STANDARD FOR PRIVACY CLAIMS. WORKPLACE REPERCUSSIONS ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a landmark decision, the California Supreme Court on Friday upheld the 
NCAA's policy of random drug testing of athletes, ruling that it did not 
violate their state constitutional guarantee of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited decision was the result of a case involving two Stanford 
University athletes, who sought an injunction in 1988 preventing the testing by 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Stanford students have not been required to take the tests 
because of lower court decisions that were upheld on appeal. Now they will have 
to submit to the screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some student athletes felt disadvantaged by having to go through the 
procedure and not have their competitors go through it," said Frank Uryasz, 
NCAA director of sport sciences. "We're extremely gratified that the Supreme 
Court upheld the program, and what that means to us is we can apply it now 
uniformly throughout the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The high court's ruling may have repercussions beyond the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 By establishing a new standard for evaluating certain kinds of privacy claims, 
the divided court has probably made it more difficult for workers to challenge 
drug testing and other kinds of screening and monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices specifically declined to rule on drug testing in the workplace, 
noting that cases will be reviewed on their individual merits. Workers may 
reasonably expect more privacy than college athletes competing in major events, 
the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Victor Schachter, a lawyer who represented an association of some of the 
state's largest employers in the case, said he was "very optimistic" that 
employers will be able to defend their drug testing under the new, more 
permissive standard established by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are dealing with what has been viewed as the most intrusive kind of 
testing -- random, without notice -- and if the court has upheld the 
constitutionality of that, then all those less intrusive tests . . . will 
surely pass constitutional muster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less intrusive tests would include targeting employees for testing because of 
suspicious behavior or screening all job applicants for drugs. Employees have 
also objected to psychological testing and certain kinds of surveillance by 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 decision marks the first time the high court has ruled on whether the 
private sector, as well as government, must abide by a constitutional privacy 
guarantee passed by voters in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the court said private entities are covered by the constitutional 
provision, a majority of justices also held that business need not always meet 
the strict standards imposed on government when infringing on privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Government must show compelling reasons, but the court said private entities 
in many cases need only show that the invasion is justified by legitimate 
interests and needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invasion of a privacy interest is not a violation of the state constitutional 
right to privacy if the invasion is justified by a competing interest," Chief 
Justice Malcolm Lucas wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he wrote, if confidential information extracted from a person is 
shielded from everyone but those "who have a legitimate need to know," there is 
no privacy violation. 
</P>
<P>
 To allege a privacy violation, victims must show that they have a legally 
protected privacy interest, a reasonable expectation of privacy in the 
circumstances and that the conduct by the offending party constituted a serious 
invasion, the majority said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case troubled the court, with three justices weighing in with separate 
opinions. Justice Stanley Mosk complained that privacy claims "are practically 
doomed to fail" in the future under the court's new definitions and standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today the majority take away from Stanford student athletes -- and all other 
Californians -- the right to privacy guaranteed by the California 
Constitution," wrote Mosk, the most liberal member of the conservative court. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two Stanford University athletes won an injunction in 1988, a Court 
of Appeal upheld the injunction, and the NCAA appealed to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 For championship or postseason bowl games, the NCAA requires some athletes to 
urinate into a beaker while an official monitor watches. The association 
selects the athletes to be tested at random or on the basis of their 
performance or the suspicion of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to deter drug use. The NCAA tests 9,000 student 
athletes each year and fewer than 1% are ruled ineligible because of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The court majority, in overturning the lower courts' decisions, wrote that the 
NCAA has "self-evident interests in insuring fair and vigorous competition as 
well as protecting the health and safety of student athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mosk, in a stinging and lengthy dissent, complained that the "NCAA is now 
free to use in California the weapons it had chosen for its 'war on drugs.' " 
He noted that the trial court found that it was not necessary to have direct 
monitoring of an athlete urinating to ensure a valid sample. He also said that 
an NCAA justification of the program -- to show that it is serious about the 
war on drugs -- is an unacceptable justification. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce L. Kennard accepted most of the majority analysis but said the 
Stanford students should have been given an opportunity to return to court and 
argue their case under the new, more permissive standard established Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Ronald George, who is usually considered part of the conservative 
majority, objected to the creation of a new standard. He also criticized the 
majority for setting forth new conditions for filing a challenge charging 
privacy intrusions, complaining that they are likely "to bar privacy claims 
that properly should be permitted to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Simone LeVant, a former diver for Stanford who filed the lawsuit against the 
NCAA, said she still regards being forced to urinate in front of a monitor 
"degrading and humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really disappointed in the decision," said LeVant, 29, now a paralegal 
in San Francisco. "I still feel it's an invasive test." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Van Nest, one of the attorneys representing the Stanford students, 
agreed that the decision was a "defeat for college athletes." But he said it is 
unclear how the case will affect the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers will have to prove they have a legitimate and reasonable basis for 
testing employees for drugs, particularly if the intrusion is severe, he said.

ECONOMIC GROWTH SURGES AT FASTEST RATE IN SIX YEARS; PRODUCTION: PURCHASES OF 
CARS, HOMES FUELED SPURT AT END OF 1993. INFLATION STAYS AT LOW LEVEL, 
GOVERNMENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rush of new buyers for homes, cars and business equipment spurred the 
nation's economy to grow at a 5.9% rate -- the fastest pace in six years -- 
during the last three months of 1993, while inflation remained at low levels, 
the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of stronger-than-expected growth and low inflation drew 
expressions of satisfaction from the Clinton Administration and business 
executives, cheered financial markets and bolstered hopes of recession-weary 
Californians that their long-awaited recovery may be in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists agreed that the strong fourth-quarter growth won't be 
sustained through the first half of this year, particularly as Americans begin 
to feel the effects of last year's tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The national economy is also sure to be hurt by the effects of the Northridge 
earthquake and this month's brutal winter weather in the East, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, economists said the national economy will probably grow faster than 
the Administration's expected 3% in 1994 -- and that will be good news for 
everyone as long as it doesn't trigger higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This upturn is not driven by the government, in terms of higher spending or 
lower taxes, but just the opposite," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at 
Lehman Bros., an investment firm in New York. "What appeared in the fourth 
quarter is strictly the private domestic sector lifting itself up by its own 
bootstraps, and that's very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services 
produced in the United States -- increased at an annual rate of 5.9%, its 
fastest rate since 1987, according to a preliminary report by the Commerce 
Department. Revised GDP figures are due March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth came on the heels of modest 2.9% annual growth in the third quarter 
of 1993, an anemic 1.9% spurt in the second quarter and 0.8% growth in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 GDP growth for the year was 2.9%, the best performance since 1988's 3.9%, the 
Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the news Friday, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average up 19.13 points to an all-high of 3,945.43. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration was not shy in taking credit for the robust growth, even 
though the figures partly reflected one-time gains from an adjustment in 
national auto production and a renewal in farm income from fields no longer 
inundated by last summer's Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get much more solid and steady growth than that," Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, an inflation measure linked with the GDP -- the so-called 
"deflator" -- rose at a 1.3% annual rate, down from a rate of 1.6% in the third 
quarter. It was the lowest showing since a 1% gain in the third quarter of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to previous reports indicating that inflation has not yet heated up, 
Friday's news seemed likely to take pressure off the Federal Reserve Board to 
raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market clearly thought so Friday, sending the yield of the Treasury's 
bellwether 30-year bond down sharply to 6.21% from 6.26% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear, however, whether the Fed will hold off for long. 
Economists said they expect that the Fed will eventually take preemptive action 
to forestall inflation if the economy appears to be overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to testify to Congress on Monday. The 
Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is scheduled to hold 
a strategy session next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter growth was driven mainly by purchases of durable goods -- 
items such as autos and appliances that are intended to last at least three 
years -- and by purchases of new homes. Both were spurred by low interest rates 
and pent-up demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth also reflected strong new capital expenditures for computers and 
other business equipment as industry restructures to improve productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Durable-goods purchases were up at an annual rate of 14.3% in the quarter; 
residential fixed investment was up at a 31.7% rate, while business equipment 
expenditures rose at a 24.6% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Spitzer, president of a Cleveland-area management firm that franchises 30 
auto dealerships throughout Ohio, said sales in 1993 were between 5% and 7%. At 
the same time, inventories of autos on hand were down from more than a 60-day 
supply last year to about a 45-day supply now. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., California's largest home builder, reported that 
its gross sales in the West amounted to 625 houses this month, compared with 
475 in January, 1993, said Eli Broad, founder of the company and chairman of 
its executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 California stands to benefit from an investment-driven national recovery 
because the state produces the kinds of computers, instruments and other 
capital equipment that industry is now buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the strength of the national economy is very important for 
California," said Stephen Levy, an economist and head of the Center for 
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Clara-based Intel Corp., industry's move to streamline itself has 
paid handsome benefits. The firm, which makes 85% of the microchip brains in 
the world's personal computers, saw revenues balloon by 50% in 1993 and profits 
soar 115%, said spokesman Howard High. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter growth was magnified by one-time events. Farm output was 
reduced in the third quarter by the Midwest floods, which shaved 0.6 of a 
percentage point off that quarter's GDP growth rate. Lower losses in the fourth 
quarter added 0.4 of a point to the period's rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, scheduling problems at the nation's auto plants shifted some 
production from the third to the fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 For the future, economists say that growth will slow, though it will keep up a 
healthy pace. One good sign: the University of Michigan reported Friday that 
its consumer sentiment index for January jumped to 94.3, the highest since 
September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will realize they owe a little more money than they thought they did," 
said Raymond Stone, economist and managing director of Stone & McCarthy 
Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "Add to that the earthquake . . . and 
the subsequent loss of retail activity . . . and the loss of wealth (from 
damaged assets) will show up to modest degree in the GDP and depress 
first-quarter growth." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dayton Hudson Corp., parent company of the Mervyn's and Target stores, 
Chairman Kenneth Macke was cautious about 1994, particularly in light of the 
recent bad weather and the Los Angeles-area earthquake, which closed four of 
the company's stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are "still very concerned about job security, about how much their 
tax bill is going to be, and the ultimate costs of health care," he said 
through a spokeswoman. "As we look at California, we believe the economy there 
is not going to turn rapidly."

MANY BUILDINGS RED-TAGGED IN ERROR, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL and SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials say that hundreds of earthquake-damaged buildings from 
South-Central Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley may have been inaccurately 
tagged as unsafe or seriously damaged because of hurried inspections, 
unnecessarily forcing residents out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stems in part from the fact that many evaluations were performed 
quickly by agencies and volunteers unfamiliar with the city and its residential 
structures. Now, as the city's Building and Safety Department has begun 
reviewing many of those initial postings, revisions are under way.  
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling is that as many as 25% to 30% will be changed," said Russell 
Lane, chief building inspector, who is in charge of the city's field 
operations. "We had many volunteers out there and even though they were 
trained, it was their first time out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Delli Quadri, a senior structural engineer and department spokesman, 
estimated that about 20% of the red placards, declaring buildings unsafe to 
enter, will soon be reclassified to yellow, which allows limited entry at the 
person's own risk. And he said as many as 50% of the yellow placards would be 
revised to green, which places no restrictions on occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these emergency inspections were made, they were made under conditions 
of duress, (with inspectors) tagging buildings and quickly moving to the next," 
said Delli Quadri. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that, by and large, inspectors were conservative in their 
initial assessments, preferring to make judgment calls on the side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, inspectors have begun to reclassify structures to allow 
limited or full access, particularly after owners have cleared rubble and made 
preliminary repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials caution that, because of the hurried inspections, there may be 
buildings initially tagged as "limited entry" that are, in fact, not safe. "For 
the most part we're OK, but there may be damage we didn't catch, especially if 
we weren't able to get into the buildings," said Karl Deppe, a manager working 
on the department's special emergency response team. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 80% of the more than 30,000 buildings inspected by the city have been 
found to have suffered damage. Of that, 1,600 buildings have been declared 
unsafe, another 5,000 have been deemed damaged enough to permit only limited 
entry, and the rest have been damaged but are not considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 So far only about a dozen demolition permits have been taken out and officials 
say they do not expect the total number of buildings that must be demolished 
because of the quake to exceed 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though officials say initial inspections should be seen as temporary, 
those assessments have had significant impact for many residents. Property 
owners have used the inspections to justify loan requests, and tenants have 
moved out of buildings declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case on West 40th Place in South-Central Los Angeles, where a 
team of inspectors who were not regularly assigned to the area declared as many 
as nine buildings unsafe.  
</P>
<P>
 The landlord at one evacuated four-unit building changed the locks, preventing 
a return by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 At another building, a tenant who refused to move was threatened with 
eviction. "There is nothing wrong with this building," argued Rose Flowers, a 
single parent who has lived in the building for 17 years. "There are only a few 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 After Flowers complained to Councilwoman Rita Walters' staff, city inspectors 
were called in to review the initial assessment. They found that Flowers' 
building and eight others on West 40th Place had been improperly tagged as 
unsafe. The news came too late for many who, seeing the initial signs, packed 
their belongings and moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The incorrect posting also angered Flowers' landlord, who had ordered the 
tenants out because he feared for their safety and did not want to be liable if 
the building collapsed. Now, he said, he has suffered too because he has lost 
good tenants who were reliable in paying their rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The building on West 40th Place did not suffer major structural damage from 
the quake, but cosmetic cracks in pillars supporting second-story units gave it 
an ominous appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials refused to categorize the initial inspection as a mistake even 
though an inspector quickly revised the building's status from an unsafe red 
category to green. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a judgment call," said Errol T. Tate, a senior building inspector 
who reversed the decision. "They called it the way they saw it. After a closer 
look, it was clear that the buildings had suffered some damage but not 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days immediately after the earthquake, officials from the city's 
Department of Building and Safety determined that they needed more than the 
department's 300 inspectors and engineers to adequately determine the extent of 
the damage.  
</P>
<P>
 They reinforced the staff with a contingent of outside inspectors, including 
some brought in from other city departments, volunteers and inspectors from the 
Army Corps of Engineers, who were flown in from throughout the country. After 
orientation classes, they were sent out to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had inspectors showing up from all over," said Dave Keim, principal 
building inspector. "They are coming from as far away as Florida, Washington, 
Arizona and Utah. We have verified their credentials and put them to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said the volunteers ranged in ability from excellent to poor. Many were 
initially paired with city workers, but after the city force was spread thin, 
they were sent out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, confusion erupted over a 13-story building where 
200 county Department of Children's Services employees work. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was surrounded by yellow police tape and its entrances were 
posted with yellow city signs reading "Limited Entry." Such a posting would 
normally mean that the building could not be opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't stop many people from going to work. Until Wednesday, workers 
had to climb to upper floors, using a dimly lit stairwell in which plaster had 
peeled from walls, because the building's two elevators were knocked out of 
service by a power surge following an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who had returned to work in the building said they were 
concerned about its safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a lot of communication right now. We don't know what's going 
on," said social worker Jennifer Keltner, who works on the seventh floor of the 
building. "I mean, I saw that yellow tag and I thought, my God, what are we 
doing in here?" 
</P>
<P>
 After inspecting the building for a second time Thursday afternoon, city 
inspectors ruled that only a portion of the building was unsafe -- a 
third-floor section that had also suffered damage in the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our inspectors have found that it can be occupied, except for a few areas," 
Delli Quadri said after the inspection. He said the yellow tag was amended to 
instruct tenants to stay out of specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, workers' fears were not allayed even after additional inspections by 
county and private experts, said Tim Farrell, a union shop steward for more 
than 100 social workers in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that anything that has been posted makes anyone feel this 
building is safe," Farrell said. "People still don't know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Blech, one of the building's owners, is also concerned about the safety 
of the building. Blech said two private engineers he hired to examine it said 
the building had suffered "substantial structural damage."  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday he sent tenants a letter saying they may have to evacuate pending 
a more detailed report by a private structural engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I feel the safety of the tenants is in danger," Blech said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the "Limited Entry" sign only served to scare people, himself 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't feel safe occupying a building with a sign that says you're taking 
your life into your own hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Building and safety officials say it is possible that some yellow-tagged 
buildings were not properly assessed in the initial flurry of inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't just rely on our placard," said Delli Quadri. "If you feel insecure, 
hire a contractor or an architect to take a closer look." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Usui, assistant chief of building and safety's Management Assistance 
Division, said there is no way to quantify how many people are improperly 
occupying yellow-tagged structures throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty obvious there is going to be a certain percentage of that going 
on. How do you keep people out if we're not around to say, 'You can't go in 
there'?" Usui said. "They're just taking their chances."

FORECLOSURES COULD SOAR ON QUAKE-DAMAGED HOMES; HOUSING: MANY BORROWERS MAY 
WALK AWAY FROM MORTGAGES. LENDERS TRY TO DEVISE WAYS TO HELP OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley, already at an all-time high, could 
surge in the coming months because the earthquake has left thousands of people 
with significant or irreparable damage to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than taking on more debt to rebuild, many homeowners are considering 
walking away from their ravaged homes and the mortgages on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although foreclosures could rise in several areas -- such as Santa Monica -- 
devastated by last week's quake, the problem is seen as most acute in the 
Valley, where homeowners generally suffered the worst damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosures there threaten to further depress a Valley housing market that 
was in the dumps before last week's earthquake. A record 3,650 residential 
foreclosures in the Valley last year -- 20 times more than in 1990 -- helped 
drive down housing prices to what they were in 1988. The recession has dwindled 
savings, and the earthquake has left many without jobs, so those with little or 
no equity in their homes will think twice before making expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreclosures are going to go up astronomically," said Dale Fay, owner of 
Century 21 Oak Tree in Valley Village and a 20-year sales agent in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Hunnicutt, an accountant in Woodland Hills, knows several families whose 
homes will have to be bulldozed. "I'd expect them to walk away. Wouldn't you?" 
he asked. Even homeowners who have earthquake insurance face 10% deductibles. 
"It seems the number of foreclosures has to increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the plight of Newhall homeowner Seong Ho Kim. Less than two years 
ago, Kim put $90,000 toward a $360,000 four-bedroom house just north of the San 
Fernando Valley. But the quake cut a six-inch-wide crack from the driveway 
through Kim's house to the back yard. Contractors say it will cost about 
$150,000 to put Kim's house back together. But like many homeowners in Southern 
California, Kim does not have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 After wiping away the tears, Kim packed up with his wife and 14-year-old son 
and moved into the living room of a friend's home in the Valley. "I don't have 
money to rebuild it, and I can't take on another loan on top of my mortgage," 
said Kim, 46, who operates a mini-market in Pacoima. "What else can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other lenders, Kim's mortgage-holder, Prudential Home Mortgage, has 
given him a two-month deferment on his $2,000 monthly mortgage payment. But 
when the grace period runs out, Kim says he may walk away from his $270,000 
mortgage unless his lender helps pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had over 600 calls" from borrowers who sustained small and big damage 
in the quake, said Doug Rossbach, Prudential's vice president of marketing in 
New Jersey. "If a house is totally destroyed, a month or two (grace period) 
isn't going to help. So we'll do much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, mortgage lenders in general are discouraging homeowners from turning 
in their homes. Some lenders have made arrangements with earthquake victims for 
unusual deals such as "short payoffs," in which a bank agrees to accept less 
than full repayment on a mortgage if the property is sold. It is a sort of 
partial debt forgiveness and allows owners to walk away with their credit 
rating intact. 
</P>
<P>
 State law gives lenders little legal recourse when people walk away from their 
homes. But financial institutions say they will foreclose on abandoned 
properties and report them as loan defaults to credit bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do walk away -- and unfortunately there will be some who do -- it 
will affect the borrower's credit record," said Linda Mueller, a spokeswoman at 
Great Western Bank, the big savings and loan based in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a 90-day deferment on mortgage payments, Mueller said, Great Western 
customers affected by the earthquake can apply for another loan to pay for 
repairs. "We want to work with the borrowers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Cochran, director of loan services at Glendale Federal Bank, said each 
customer's case and needs will be reviewed. But in general, he said, "we loaned 
the individual the money in good faith, and it would be our intent to keep them 
in their houses, however possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders do not want to add to their stockpile of foreclosures because the 
properties are costly to maintain. It takes several months for lenders to 
foreclose on properties, and then they are sold at fire-sale prices for usually 
less than the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were about 4,300 residential and commercial foreclosures in 
the Valley -- about 85% residential properties -- or double the number in 1992, 
according to TRW-REDI Property Data in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosures also hurt the housing market because the cut-rate prices for such 
homes drive down other home values, and make it harder for trade-up sellers to 
unload their properties and move up in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a short payoff may not be enough for homeowners like Jerry Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired deputy sheriff, Stern owns a one-bedroom condo in Sherman Oaks. But 
the three-building, 122-unit condominium complex is riddled with deep fissures 
and has been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern bought the condo at the height of the market in 1988 for $96,000. He 
owes $75,000 on his mortgage. Contractors say they may have to demolish one of 
the three buildings, while the other two -- including Stern's building -- may 
be repairable. Even with earthquake insurance, Stern faces huge repair bills, 
not only for his unit but for his share of the work on the condo's exterior 
building and underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the condos are repaired, Stern does not think it will be worth much 
because multistory buildings fared much worse in the earthquake. "Who will want 
to buy it?" he said this week as he took snapshots of the damaged building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know for another month. And then we have to wait and see what the 
lender will do. Everything is up in the air," he said in disgust. "Whether I 
come out better financially by rebuilding or walking away, that's going to be 
the real decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Even homeowners with relatively little damage have been put in a bind by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Fouse, a sales manager for a pet food company, lives in a two-bedroom 
townhouse in Sylmar. For nine months before the earthquake, Fouse tried to sell 
her home but got only one offer. Now she is looking at repair bills of $5,000 
to put in a new water heater, replace the kitchen tiles and repair the 
dislodged fireplace, which were knocked out by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what to do," she said. She owes $90,000 on her mortgage, 
but the townhouse is probably worth $80,000, she said. Asked if she would walk 
away, Fouse said: "I don't know. Gee, that's a hard thing for me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fouse hopes to get out of her mortgage through a short payoff. Though lenders 
are reluctant to agree to such arrangements, Valley real estate brokers say 
that is about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Belson, a sales agent and owner of a Remax franchise in Sherman Oaks, said 
one lender agreed this week to reduce by at least $100,000 the mortgage on a 
home in Sherman Oaks. The owners, both in their 70s, owed $380,000 on their 
mortgage, and Belson had listed the home for sale at $500,000 before the 
earthquake. But the 6.6 magnitude temblor knocked the home off its foundation 
and it must be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 The land still has some value, so Belson went to the lender and it agreed to 
reduce the mortgage. Now the site has been listed for sale at $259,000. Belson 
believes that he can sell the land at that price, although the buyer must 
demolish the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banks right now want to hear solutions," said Belson, who figures to make 
a 5% commission if that sale goes through. "They already had a lot of 
properties they didn't want. With the earthquake they have a lot more. It's 
like a double whammy. They're all ears because they want out of it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people will dump their houses and walk away," said Sam Lee, a 
Pinnacle real estate agent. "But if the price is right, there's always a buyer. 
I have to switch (the customers that I target) and contact banks and sellers 
who want to walk away."

JURORS' RIFT EMERGED EARLY AND RAN DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE and BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gulf between the factions among the Menendez jurors was vast -- and no 
evidence, testimony or argument could draw them into common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 On one extreme was juror Sharyn S. Bishop, 42, of Northridge, who said: "I 
don't think Lyle is a threat to society. If he lived across the street from me, 
I wouldn't be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum sat Jude Nelson, an unemployed marketing 
representative from Sylmar, who called the evidence against Lyle Menendez "a 
classic first-degree murder case." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were the jurors who spent half a year sitting in judgment of 
Erik Menendez, the other brother accused of murdering their parents: that panel 
almost came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Those jurors, speaking for the first time since they were dismissed 15 days 
ago, described a contentious and sometimes mean-spirited 19 days of 
deliberations. The split was so deep, so early, that some believed that others 
arrived with their minds made up -- creating, in the words of juror Hazel 
Thornton, "too much prejudice . . . to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was . . . not enough concentration on evidence and the law," said 
Thornton, a 36-year-old Lake View Terrace resident who voted for voluntary 
manslaughter -- one of the lesser charges -- for the younger of the two Beverly 
Hills brothers accused of murdering their parents. The Pacific Bell employee 
specifically complained that some jurors had a "bias against rich people and 
homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
 With participants in the case finally free Friday to talk about the top-secret 
deliberations -- which ended in two hung juries -- defense attorney Leslie 
Abramson portrayed the Erik Menendez jury as sharply divided along gender 
lines, with frequent verbal clashes and even "some threat of physicality." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson spoke on the basis of extensive discussions with members of the 
panel. She revealed Friday that after her half of the case ended she had 
several jurors over to a 7 1/2-hour dinner party at her Hancock Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem with Erik's jury was it was a mix of individuals who 
could not work together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Lyle Menendez's panel, whose 25 days of deliberations were 
interrupted by the Northridge earthquake, was a relatively harmonious group in 
which gender did not play a role, according to Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 While sometimes jurors merely "tolerated one another," he said, they were 
generally able to discuss and consider one another's views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised all kinds of hell. . . . We all spoke our piece," said Nelson, 52, 
who held out for first-degree murder and said he was frustrated with the 
deadlock. "I have a hunch in the back of my mind this defense was drummed up 
somewhere. We really wanted to come to a consensus. But I just wasn't going to 
let these guys walk and have manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's lawyer, said the older brothers' panel got along 
extremely well and she predicted that some close friendships that formed during 
the trial will continue now that it's over.  
</P>
<P>
 Lansing also said Lyle Menendez's jurors told her that "at one point, the vote 
was split 9 for voluntary manslaughter and 3 for second-degree murder" -- a 
more forgiving assessment than the final tally. 
</P>
<P>
 The change suggested that jurors had been actively weighing one another's 
viewpoints -- perhaps, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich, up until the 
very end. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were switching between voluntary (manslaughter) and murder and . . . 
they were switching between the degrees as well," she said after she, too, had 
a brief talk with some of Lyle Menendez's jurors. "I got the impression that 
they were switching as recently as today." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month trial had revolved in large part around the brothers' contention 
that they had been sexually abused by their parents. Although prosecutors said 
the Menendezes were driven by greed, lawyers for the brothers said they had 
killed out of fear -- and the believability of that assertion clearly became 
the most divisive issue in the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 The women on Erik Menendez's jury were more likely to be swayed by the tales 
of abuse, many said, while more men saw the issue as either incredible or 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a possibility (of abuse), but I don't think that would rectify the 
fact that they did take the law into their hands to kill their parents," said 
juror Robert Rakestraw, 53, who voted for first-degree murder in Erik 
Menendez's case. "I don't think that justifies their actions, if molestation 
did occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Rakestraw, a full-time postal carrier from Canoga Park, said he felt badly 
that decisions were not reached in either case, and at least one juror on the 
other panel said she thought they would be roundly mocked for their inability 
to resolve the case.  
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it my all," said Ruth Slike, 60, a retired housewife from Sun Valley 
who served on Lyle Menendez's jury. "I don't think the general public thinks 
the jury is any more than a bunch of idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thornton, of the Erik Menendez jury, said the problem was not in the 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some advice for the prosecution," she said. "Get some more evidence 
and prove it in a convincing manner."

L.A. TOURISM A BIT SHAKY AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Optimistic by nature and necessity, Los Angeles' tourism and convention 
industry already is putting its own spin on last week's deadly earthquake, 
combatting stark media images of wrecked freeways and tent cities with a global 
blitz of feel-good faxes and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear in tourism circles is that news stories and television pictures of 
yet another Southern California disaster could cause more damage than the quake 
itself to an industry worth an estimated $8.25 billion a year to Los Angeles 
County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of disconcerting when you get calls from Germany, Russia and 
Britain saying, 'Should we cancel our trip?' and 'Do you have any hotels still 
standing?' " said Bill Boyd, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce in 
Beverly Hills, where quake damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to stamp out such scorched-earth scenarios, the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau -- still recovering from the 1992 riots -- has 
contacted 25,000 international travel agents to assure them that most of the 
metropolitan area remains in good shape. Additionally, the bureau has invited 
15 national meeting planners into the area to let them see for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a visit is worth a thousand 
pictures," said Michael Collins, the bureau's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late to help the four-day California Gift Show at the 
Convention Center, which wrapped up this week, an extravaganza normally counted 
on to bring in 12% of the facility's annual revenue. After the quake, about 5% 
of the exhibitors canceled -- part of the reason the Convention and Visitors 
Bureau this week projected $308 million in lost business because of the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Film Marketing Assn., scrambling to make sure the same -- or 
worse -- doesn't happen to its annual film market in Santa Monica next month, 
faxed 6,000 film producers and distributors in 66 countries a memo -- "We're 
Alright!" -- that proclaimed hotels and movie theaters essentially unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to let you know it was a bumpy ride, but Santa Monica survived the 
Northridge earthquake with flying colors," the fax chirped, neglecting to 
mention that Santa Monica was actually one of the hardest-hit communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recorded message on a Los Angeles visitors hot line takes a similarly breezy 
tone, noting that access from Los Angeles International Airport to points east 
is "not a problem" and that "all major attractions remain open." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials, in turn, sent out a fax to travel agents to report: 
"Disneyland Resort unaffected by recent earthquake; business and fun as usual 
in Orange County." Those who depend on tourism and convention business insist 
that they are not seeking to minimize the quake's devastation, but rather to 
counter unfounded perceptions of a metropolis eternally burning and traumatized 
from fires, floods, riots and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really took the offensive on this," said Tim Kittleson, vice president of 
the film marketing association. "If people sit there and don't hear from you, 
they start to think, 'Is anything still standing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kittleson and others also must cope with the fact that apocalyptic images and 
rumors spread with surprising ease along the information superhighway -- and 
key distinctions, such as Santa Clarita's relatively remote location, may be 
lost on people in Egypt or Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, one official complained about how television networks fed 
images to Europe of broken stretches of Interstate 10 identified on the screen 
as the "Santa Monica Fwy." The concern was that Europeans unfamiliar with the 
abbreviation Fwy. might be left with the impression that all of Santa Monica 
was in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have any clue how much damage that does," said Beverly 
Moore, executive director of the Santa Monica Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, tourism officials dread TV's relentless portrayals of the 
worst pockets of disaster, which may encourage foreign news organizations to 
hype the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hope the media, especially the Japanese media, doesn't exaggerate 
the circumstances right now," said Shiro Monden, general manager of Japan 
Travel Bureau, the largest coordinator of Japanese tourists in Los Angeles. 
"Japanese people are worried about fires and bridges collapsing in Downtown Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 A consoling factor for tourism officials is the timing of the quake -- during 
the off-season, improving the chances that travelers will forget about it by 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the temblor struck just as the eastern half of the nation was crippled 
by a killer cold snap, making it easy for spin masters to crow about Southern 
California's fabled weather while noting that no region of the world is immune 
from natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the quake may have done nothing more than confirm what people already 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody realizes that this is an earthquake city, but it's not the only 
destination in the world where you have earthquakes," said Patrick Schoeneborn, 
vice president of Go America Tours, a major operator in the German market. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is "always a place people are going to come," added Lisa 
Kruttschnitt, who does marketing for the California Office of Tourism. "In the 
big picture, there hasn't been much damage. Visitors can still have an 
excellent time here." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind such rosy outlooks lurk concerns that the quake will make it 
tougher than ever to woo visitors -- at a time when business was finally 
improving after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Travel Bureau said the number of Japanese tourists coming to Los 
Angeles dipped to 80,000 in 1992 as a result of the riots, down from 106,000 
the year before, a drop of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 The number crept upward last year, approaching the 100,000 mark, and observers 
say tourism throughout Southern California had begun a slow but steady 
recovery. Last week's quake could put the industry back to square one, however, 
forcing it to overcome images of four-hour traffic jams in addition to the 
unending assortment of crime and gang news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever progress we've made, it's certainly a backward step," said Diane 
Conti, president of VIP Meetings and Conventions, a Pacific Palisades firm that 
is managing a national convention of bilingual educators next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Conti said 20 delegates have canceled already, and with others, "We've had to 
coax them to come." 
</P>
<P>
 A precursor of what may lie ahead could be the just-concluded California Gift 
Show, which organizers heavily promoted, hoping to take advantage of the newly 
expanded Downtown Convention Center. But as exhibitors of everything from 
hand-carved clocks to environmentally correct footwear packed up Wednesday and 
departed the cavernous hall, early attendance estimates were disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gelt, the show's marketing director, said the show probably fell 5,000 
short of its target attendance of 45,000 people. He blamed the quake. "I don't 
want to be Pollyannish and say it didn't hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists at Chapman University in Orange this week predicted a 10% to 20% 
drop in tourism this year in Los Angeles County and 5% to 10% in Orange County, 
reversing pre-quake forecasts of moderate growth. And the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau, in addition to projecting a $308-million drop 
in business, estimated that more than 9,000 jobs will be lost temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Elinor Oswald, owner of LA Custom Tours, worries about the impact on his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a letter I was going to send out before the earthquake telling everyone 
how great it is here," she said. "Now I can't. . . . Everybody in the whole 
country knows about our problems. Who wants to pay to sit on our freeways?" 
</P>
<P>
 One fear is that even locals will be intimidated by the crippled 
transportation system and stop day-tripping, a worrisome notion in places like 
Venice Beach, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants at the funky oceanfront boardwalk rely on local visitors arriving on 
the Santa Monica Freeway, a section of which is now unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to go through the hassle," fretted Hwan Song, chairman of 
the 180-member Venice Beach Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tourism industry is nothing if not resilient, and at least one tour 
operator is hopeful he can turn the temblor to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Michael Fawcett of Insider Tours, based in Morro Bay, which offers such 
offbeat excursions as "Marilyn Monroe's Los Angeles" and a "Historical Tour of 
Venice." He anticipates some visitors will want to see the quake damage 
firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for me," he said, "to accommodate them."

EUROPE; BOSNIA COMMANDER'S RECORD BELIES SWASHBUCKLING IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Sir Michael Rose, the British lieutenant general chosen to command U.N. 
troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, suited for the role, which he formally assumed 
this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Rose -- tall, lean, witty and sardonic -- is the former commander of the 
Special Air Service, Britain's crack unconventional forces regiment. He also 
served in posts in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that veterans of World War II and the Korean War are past retirement age, 
Rose, 54, is one of the most decorated officers in the British military and is 
considered one of the brightest minds and stars in the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his swashbuckling reputation -- at least in the press -- Rose may appear 
an unlikely commander to replace Lt. Gen. Francis Briquemont, the Belgian who 
retired because of "exhaustion" as commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia. But 
military experts say appearances belie realities. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Rose may have been a commando commander. But he also has trained a 
generation of British officers in his posts as commandant of the School of 
Infantry and head of the Army Staff College. He is credited with introducing 
new ways of thinking about the military's role. 
</P>
<P>
 As John Keegan, the distinguished military historian, said of Rose's U.N. 
appointment: "At his rank -- they needed a three-star general in Bosnia -- he 
was the youngest and best general in the army. It's as simple as that. In five 
years' time, he will probably be considered for chief of staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Michael Dewar, the deputy director of the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies who has known the general since staff college, observed of 
Rose: "He has always been considered a thinker. His belief is that the military 
should be proactive, not reactive, that it should be thinking ahead of the 
game. He is also a man of tremendous energy, who is used to making do with the 
resources he has got. He is not going to do a Briquemont and sulk because he 
hasn't got enough men. He will not become 'exhausted' in six months." 
</P>
<P>
 British experts said Rose will be flexible enough to step up the pressure of 
the U.N. command in Bosnia, if ordered; he also could preside over the scaling 
down -- or pullout -- of British troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was commander of United Kingdom Land Forces when selected to replace 
Briquemont, who resigned halfway through his tour after criticizing the U.N. 
headquarters for supplying insufficient reinforcements for the 12,000-member 
Bosnian contingent.  
</P>
<P>
 One senior official of the U.N. Protection Force, headquartered in the 
Croatian capital of Zagreb, speculated that Rose's selection was intended to 
strengthen British influence among troops deployed in Bosnia. "The Brits have 
been complaining about the French getting out of control, in particular Cot," 
the official said, referring to the mission commander, French Gen. Jean Cot, 
who has appealed for the authority to order air strikes -- a power now held 
only by the U.N. secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose -- whose fluency in French, colleagues said, will help him work well with 
French commanders -- is respected among fellow European military officers, the 
official said, adding, however, that someone of Rose's take-charge reputation 
and temperament might soon fall victim to the frustration rife in the Balkans 
mission.

MIDEAST; ISRAELI GROUP CHIPS AWAY AT WALLS OF RELIGION; JEWISH WOMEN CONTINUE 
TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO PRAY THE SAME WAY MEN DO AT JERUSALEM HOLY SITE. EVEN 
IN LEGAL DEFEATS THEY SEE HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All they wanted was the right to pray with some of the same spiritual 
adornments as men -- to hold the Torah, to wear a prayer shawl, to sing aloud 
the ancient praises of God -- as they stood before the holiest shrine of 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the 25 women gathered at Jerusalem's Western Wall in what would 
become a test case of women's role in religion and the role of religious 
authority in a modern democratic state, none expected the fury of the response. 
</P>
<P>
 They were beaten with chairs, pelted with mud, spat upon and berated as "pigs" 
by ultra-orthodox men and women alike. They ultimately were dragged off by 
Israeli police for violating traditional interpretations of religious law. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, the group, now known as the Women of the Wall, appeared to 
suffer another defeat this week, this time at the hands of Israel's legal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearly 200-page ruling, the Israeli Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected 
the group's petition asking Israel's legal authorities to protect the right of 
all Jewish women to pray as they wish at the very soul of Judaism, the 
2,000-year-old wall that is the only remnant of King Solomon's temple in Old 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision went beyond simply upholding the religious status quo at 
the wall, where the chief rabbi has evoked religious tradition to bar women 
from many of the prayer rituals permitted for men. In doing so, the three-judge 
panel underscored the inherent dilemma in balancing religion and law in a 
modern state that was founded on religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Meir Shamgar responded to the women's argument that there is 
nothing in strict rabbinical law preventing them from wearing prayer shawls or 
reading from the Torah in the women-only section of the wall. He recommended 
that the Israeli government appoint a committee to determine the legal rights 
of all Jews -- male or female, Orthodox or Reform -- who pray at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion," he wrote, "it is necessary to find other practical ways in 
which any person wishing to appeal to his creator in prayer will be permitted 
to do so in his own method and fashion." He added, though, "this should not 
present an actual offense to the prayers of others." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Women of the Wall, the majority of whom are Orthodox Jews, that 
recommendation alone was cause for hope -- for some, in fact, celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a landmark decision," declared Bonna Haberman, one of the group's 
founders. "It's what we wanted to have happen. We want the Israeli system to 
appreciate that there are different strands of religious practice, and that's 
exactly what this decision satisfies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There cannot be a victory in a case like this," she added. "There can only be 
the beginning of a process by which the Israeli public will be educated -- not 
only the Israeli public but the world community." 
</P>
<P>
 Anat Hoffman -- another Women of the Wall activist whose position as Jerusalem 
city council member testifies to the liberated role of women in other aspects 
of society -- was more circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't win," she said but added that the court did break new ground for 
women's rights simply with its decision "to order the government to look into 
this, to recognize the fact that we are there, that women exist. The 
emancipation of women in religion is the final frontier. And we are all moving 
in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Israeli high court ruling this week bolstered Hoffman's optimism. She 
was among the Reform and Conservative Jews who appealed to the court in a 
separate case seeking to permit their membership on Israel's religious 
councils, which traditionally have been reserved for Orthodox Jews. In that 
case, the court ruled clearly in favor of weakening the grip of orthodoxy on 
daily life in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just as Israel's religious orthodoxy found cause for criticism and 
concern in both verdicts, the Women of the Wall saw a common thread of change. 
"Most Jews in the world are not Orthodox," Hoffman said. "And over half the 
Jews in the world are women. It's a great day for the majority. The majority 
won today." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very next day, they suffered another setback: On Thursday morning, a 
group of 18 women again approached the wall with shawls and Torahs. They were 
taken away by police before they could complete their prayers.

COPTER CRASHES ONTO OFFICE BUILDING; 1 DIES 
</P>

<P>
 A cargo helicopter hovering over a downtown office building lost control and 
crashed into flames on the rooftop Friday, killing the pilot and showering 
chunks of debris onto the street 13 stories below. 
</P>
<P>
 Four co-workers on the rooftop narrowly escaped injury.At least one said the 
pilot saved lives by steering the doomed chopper back over the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he brought it back over the roof on purpose," said Ron Bilyeu, a 
technician who was working atop the First American Title building when the 
chopper went down and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he knew he had lost it and was trying to minimize the damage. If you 
crash it into the side of the building, it would have been more than the pilot 
(killed)," Bilyeu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is in the heart of San Jose and is surrounded by apartment 
complexes, homes and other office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunks of concrete from rooftop pillars and pieces of the rotor blades from 
the Sikorsky S-58T twin-engine helicopter rained down on the ground but didn't 
strike anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire on the top floor, triggered by the exploding chopper, took about 1 1/2 
hours to extinguish. Police evacuated the building and cordoned off surrounding 
streets for several hours. Fire officials were unable to say when the building, 
which was without power, would reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Mike Burtch said the pilot, whose name wasn't immediately 
released, was the lone victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter had finished lifting heavy equipment used to service the 
building's air-conditioning system and was hovering when it suddenly tilted to 
one side and slammed into the rooftop, Fire Capt. Henry DeGroot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no indication of trouble, although one of the ground crew said he 
heard the engine whine," DeGroot said.

S. AFRICA POLICE HUNT SERIAL KILLER OF CHILDREN, ASK FOR INTERPOL HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police dug through sand dunes with their hands and spades Friday, searching 
for more victims of a serial killer dubbed the "Station Strangler." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of 19 boys have been linked to the serial killer, who is believed 
to abduct his victims from railway stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren, office workers and parents also helped search after the bodies 
of two boys were found Thursday behind a garbage dump near the mixed-race 
township of Mitchells Plain. Later that day, four more were found in shallow 
graves in Mitchells Plain's dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 State radio reported that a note found on one of the bodies read: "One more, 
many more in store." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents threatened vengeance if the killer is found. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the community catches him, he will go to the morgue," Ashton Barnes said. 
"I'll do it myself, I'll kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten bodies have been found since last week. Nine others had been uncovered 
since 1986, when police believe the killings began. Until the new discoveries 
were made, police believed that the killings had stopped in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 South African Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said Friday that he will 
seek the international police agency Interpol's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriel told a meeting of area residents that police had little experience of 
tracking mass killers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not used to this, and we have called in a top psychiatrist to help up 
build up a portfolio on the man. We will also approach Interpol," Kriel said, 
adding that the international agency would be asked to send investigators with 
a background in finding serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has offered a $73,000 reward for information leading to an 
arrest in the killings.

TURKISH WARPLANES BLITZ KURDISH REBEL CAMP; ATTACK: RAID IS BIGGEST IN 
10-YEAR-OLD UPRISING. PREMIER VOWS TO BRING GROUP'S TERRORISM UNDER CONTROL.

 More than 50 Turkish F-16 and F-4 warplanes blitzed a Kurdish rebel camp deep 
inside Iraq on Friday with a barrage of 500-pound to 2,000-pound bombs, the 
Turkish armed forces said.  
</P>
<P>
 The raid was the biggest in Turkey's 10-year-old struggle with the Kurdistan 
Workers Party (PKK), a Stalinist group whose aims include an independent state 
for the 20 million ethnic Kurds in the mountains straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq 
and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will bring terrorism (Kurdish separatism) under control in 1994. This is a 
determined political decision," declared Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who 
monitored progress of the raid on big screens at Turkish military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed Forces spokesman Col. Dogu Silahcioglu said he could not estimate 
casualties because the target area was covered to a height of 3,000 feet by a 
black pall of smoke from an exploding rebel ammunition dump. The Kurdish rebels 
insisted that the only dead were four Iraqi Kurds from a nearby village. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had expected such an attack and had taken precautions," rebel spokesman 
Kani Yilmaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi Kurdish spokesman Hoshyar Zibari said two Iranian Kurds, probably 
smugglers, were killed and two other civilians injured. At least nine badly 
wounded PKK guerrillas were taken to a hospital in a town several hours away by 
foot from the camp, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yilmaz alleged that Ankara had ordered the raid to cover up a crisis 
atmosphere in Turkey, where the national currency has fallen more than 20% and 
stock prices by more than half since Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "Such an attack is a demonstration of the dead end that the Turkish Republic 
is in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The target camp, at Zaleh, lies 70 miles south of Turkey in an old smugglers' 
valley tucked between mountains on the Iraqi-Iranian border. The guerrillas 
have used Zaleh as a main training and logistics base since American and 
Turkish pressure on Syria forced the closure of their big camp in Lebanon's 
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters, Turkish spokesmen showed a mock-up of the camp marking 
almost every tree and flimsy tent in the Zaleh base. The rocky, scrub-covered 
region is loosely under the rule of Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas, who are close to 
Turkey; they oppose Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Marxist ideology of 
the Turkish Kurdish rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish officers did not deny that one target of the raid was the camp 
commander, Osman Ocalan, the brother of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
 To hit the Zaleh camp, Turkish warplanes had to cross a "no-fly" zone 
patrolled by U.S. and allied warplanes to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq 
from Hussein. Turkey may also have counted on a recent improvement in relations 
with Tehran to conduct operations virtually on the Iranian border. 
</P>
<P>
 While NATO-member Turkey has garnered growing Western support in its fight 
against the PKK -- which has not hesitated to use terrorist killings to show 
its power -- some Western governments are frustrated at human rights violations 
by the Turkish security forces and Ankara's refusal to enact reforms allowing 
freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Turkey feels its very existence is threatened. Armed forces 
generals said they were ready to renew the blitz, triggering speculation that 
the army may now be embarking on another of its regular offensives to wipe out 
the PKK. Preparations for an exceptional crackdown this year have included 
lengthening national service for conscripts among at least 150,000 troops 
serving in the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of guerrillas facing the security forces has also risen steadily 
over the years and was recently estimated at about 10,000 by the Turkish 
government. Nearly 4,000 people were killed in 1993, a record in the 10 years 
of conflict that have killed a total of 10,600 people.

WHITE HOUSE URGED TO RETAIN VIETNAM EMBARGO; POLITICS: GROUPS REPRESENTING 
FAMILIES OF POWS AND MIAS CRITICIZE SENATE VOTE THAT CALLED FOR LIFTING TRADE 
SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A day after the Senate called for a lifting of the trade embargo against 
Vietnam, groups representing families of former prisoners of war appealed to 
the White House to delay the move until Hanoi provides more information on 
military personnel still listed as missing in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest family support group, the National League of Families of American 
Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, convened a special session of its 
board of directors here Friday to plan its strategy in the wake of the Senate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution on a 62-38 vote urging 
President Clinton to lift the two-decade-old embargo imposed at the end of the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by reports that Clinton may be on the verge of taking that step, the 
board members and league Director Ann Mills Griffith met for an hour at the 
White House with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 They said afterward that Lake had assured them no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, for whom the POW issue is especially sensitive because of his 
avoidance of the draft, promised the family groups last summer that he would 
not lift the embargo until he is certain that Hanoi is doing all that it can to 
account for the more than 2,200 Americans still officially listed as missing 
from the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, a consensus seems to have emerged within the 
Administration and in Congress that Hanoi has cooperated fully enough to 
warrant lifting the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton has been described by senior officials as reluctant to make the 
final decision because of his concern that lifting the embargo would spark 
protests from veterans organizations and POW/MIA family groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them continue to believe that Vietnam is still withholding information 
about prisoners it allegedly retained at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The family groups have been highly critical of the way successive 
Administrations have handled the POW/MIA issue. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend that, because of political and diplomatic considerations, 
policy-makers have long ignored spotty but tantalizing information suggesting 
that at least some POWs were never released. 
</P>
<P>
 The family groups so far have avoided criticizing Clinton's handling of the 
POW issue, but senior advisers have acknowledged that he feels more vulnerable 
than previous Presidents on this point because of his avoidance of military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, however, there have been several signs that the Administration 
is laying the groundwork for a lifting of the embargo -- a move that would 
please U.S. companies poised to do business in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hint came when the Pentagon said that documents found last year in 
Russian intelligence archives were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents had reinvigorated the long-simmering POW debate by indicating 
that Hanoi secretly held about twice as many American POWs as the 575 who were 
released at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said last week that its analysis of the documents had concluded 
that they contained numerous "exaggerations and fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with repeated assurances from Pentagon officials that the Vietnamese are 
now cooperating fully in the search for the remains of American soldiers 
missing in action, the dismissal of the Russian documents helped to set the 
stage for Thursday's Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said those who met with Lake on Friday argued that the Administration 
will lose its leverage to pressure Vietnam on the POW issue if it lifts the 
embargo.

TASTE FOR CAPITALISM SLIPS IN NATION ONCE FED ON 'GOULASH COMMUNISM'; HUNGARY: 
FORMERLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF EASTERN EUROPE'S TRANSITION TO FREE MARKET, IT HAS 
FAILED TO EXPLOIT ADVANTAGES. 
</P>

 Economist Karoly Soos strikes a pensive pose when asked if this nation has 
lost its leading edge to the Czech Republic or Poland in the regional quest to 
overcome communism. He removes his musty spectacles, polishes them with the 
wider end of his tie, inspects a shirt button and ponders the ceiling before 
offering an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget Slovenia," the Parliament's chief budget analyst finally 
replies. "Their economy is performing quite well too." 
</P>
<P>
 While Soos is only half-serious in lengthening the list of Hungary's 
post-Communist betters, this nation -- the unquestioned front-runner only three 
years ago -- has witnessed such a miserable downturn in recent months that even 
optimists are frowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost five years after Hungary triggered the wave of East European 
anti-Communist revolutions, the economic expansion that was supposed to follow 
political restructuring still looms out of reach. Privatization is stagnant, 
Western investors are looking elsewhere, and 20% inflation and 15% unemployment 
are both on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 True, this former Hapsburg capital rarely passes a day without some new 
hamburger franchise or shoe store compounding the crowds and neon glitz of the 
traffic-clogged center. And Hungary tallied another record year for foreign 
investment by attracting $2.2 billion in 1993, thanks to an $875-million 
telecommunications deal ramrodded through just under the New Year's wire. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath Budapest's veneer of prosperity, and despite Hungary's head start 
with the 1970s-era reforms known as "goulash communism," this nation of 10 
million has failed to exploit its advantages, and officials both in and out of 
the government admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Due in part to a controversial bank "consolidation" last month, Hungary's 
combined domestic and foreign debt has increased to a disastrous 80% of gross 
national product, Soos says. Recession in Western Europe also contributed to a 
25% drop in Hungarian exports last year, resulting in the first negative trade 
balance in the country's short capitalist history, a staggering $3-billion 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow there hasn't been enough willingness of the government to achieve 
important results. Everyone was happy believing the role this government had 
when it came into power," says Soos, a leading figure in the opposition 
Alliance of Free Democrats. It is one of several parties expected to benefit in 
May elections from the current government's lackluster performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The center-right ruling coalition, led until last month by the late prime 
minister, Jozsef Antall, has prided itself on being the only freely elected 
government in Eastern Europe to survive a full term without being toppled by 
popular disenchantment. But as the end of the first four-year parliamentary 
term approaches, boasts of longevity by Antall's Hungarian Democratic Forum are 
providing little solace for a ruling party that commands less than 10% support. 
</P>
<P>
 Antall died Dec. 12 after a long battle with cancer. He was swiftly replaced 
by a handpicked successor, former Interior Minister Peter Boross, who has vowed 
to uphold Antall's policies and values in serving out the last months of his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Antall's death deepened Hungarians' gloom over their deteriorating 
circumstances. But the Forum's popularity -- or lack of it -- has been little 
affected by his passing. Two liberal political factions, and even the successor 
party to the once-reviled Communists, have for months been getting more support 
in opinion polls than the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't find any sober person in Hungary who thinks this government will 
remain in power," says Peter Szirmai, president of the National Assn. of 
Entrepreneurs. "It is impossible. There will definitely be a change. We just 
don't know who or how." 
</P>
<P>
 Szirmai's group, which operates like a chamber of commerce in looking out for 
interests of private business, would be a natural power base for the 
purportedly right-leaning Forum, if Hungarian political forces would abide by 
their labels. But in the uncertain world that has unfolded since one-party 
Communist rule was thrown off, Antall's Forum has shown itself to be more 
protective of social welfare than some socialist factions. It has pumped 
expensive subsidies into doomed industries to save jobs, pushing the national 
budget deep into the red to keep a bankrupt social welfare system afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Most damaging to the Forum's image and to the nation's political balance sheet 
has been what both government and opposition politicians describe as a snail's 
pace in privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Other East European countries executed a rapid transfer from state to private 
ownership by distributing shares of public assets to citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 That has allowed the Czech Republic, where unemployment and inflation are both 
in impressively low single digits, to convert almost all of its property to 
private ownership. Even in Poland, which now has a Socialist-led government, 
the private sector accounts for more than half of the economy, while in Hungary 
the share has stalled around 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with the distributive approach, Hungary sought to sell state-owned 
property to local or foreign investors. Many economists here still argue they 
were right to do so. "If you are given a dog, you don't have the same attitude 
toward it as when you buy a dog," says Erno Racz, director of privatization for 
the State Property Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others who are dismissive of the practice of changing ownership by 
giving people something for nothing contend that only owners willing to plunk 
down their hard-earned money can provide the kind of self-interested management 
necessary for success. The problem, they now concede, is that there were far 
more enterprises on offer than there were interested and responsible owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The most promising companies sold early, especially those where former 
Communist Party bureaucrats were able to cash in on connections with investors 
abroad. More than a few former deputy ministers now earn handsome salaries 
managing private companies that were once part of the government offices they 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization through sale or public stock offerings worked for state-owned 
firms accounting for about one-third of state assets, creating the foundation 
of a stable, if not thriving, Budapest stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 But toward the middle of the four-year term to which Antall was elected, the 
government decided to hold back 160 of the more profitable state operations 
from public offer in hopes of earning money for the state's empty coffers. They 
include most public utilities, transportation and other vital services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that move, state-owned businesses performed abysmally in 1993, posting 
an overall loss and compelling the government to rethink its approach to 
privatization. "A bureaucracy is not able to act as a private owner. Never," 
says Racz, who concedes that clinging to so much property was probably the 
government's biggest mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 That left only the least attractive factories, like steel plants and other 
antiquated heavy industries, on the market for potential foreign or Hungarian 
investors. Most of the industrial white elephants have yet to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 30% of the Hungarian labor force is still employed at the doomed 
enterprises -- a colossal drain on the national budget as well as an 
unemployment time bomb set to go off as soon as this government or the next one 
is forced to closed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Hungary's first post-Communist government also lament its formula 
for land privatization, which broke up agricultural cooperatives that had been 
the one sector of the socialist economy that performed well. Farm output 
tumbled by an estimated 40% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, say opposition leaders poised to inherit control of Hungary's 
flagging fortunes, much of the difficulty is the consequence of history rather 
than government bungling. 
</P>
<P>
 "All former Communist countries have problems with their economies," says 
Tamas Deutsch, 28, a lawyer and vice president of the Alliance of Young 
Democrats, which tops the popularity polls and is widely expected to be part of 
the next government. "The previous 40 years of communism was more responsible 
for these problems than the last three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, says Deutsch -- whose jeans, pierced ear and fashionable stubble 
are almost a uniform among the party's counterculture activists and yuppies -- 
the Forum and its conservative partners must shoulder blame for fiscal 
indiscipline, putting brakes on privatization and tolerating wide-scale 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The Young Democrats and their elders in the Alliance of Free Democrats have 
already worked out a political program that identifies economic growth as the 
highest priority for any government they might become part of. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections are still more than three months away -- May 8 is the date 
considered most likely -- and the vote distribution is far from certain. But 
the trading of coalition talks is already under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast on the heels of the Young Democrats is the greatly reformed former 
Communist Party, which renamed itself the Hungarian Socialist Party in the 
transition to multi-party rule that culminated in a March, 1990, election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, led by former Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, have been rising in 
the esteem of Hungarian workers nostalgic for the days when jobs were certain 
and prices were low. 
</P>
<P>
 Because at least nine parties are believed to have good chances of clearing 
the 5% minimum of voter support needed to win seats in Parliament, a coalition 
of at least three parties is likely if the current splintering continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Orban, the Young Democrats' leader and likely candidate for prime 
minister, has loudly refused to take part in any coalition with the Socialists, 
saying that his liberal party, which only recently dropped a requirement that 
members be younger than 35, would rather join forces with the Forum than with 
the party that bequeathed Hungary its present crises. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Socialists' early campaign theme of soothing transitional hardships is 
steadily winning support among those eager to hear that there might be one 
choice that would end their pain. Their growing popularity raises the prospect 
of repeating last year's electoral results in Poland, where a reform-minded 
Socialist Party now heads the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of such a popular retreat on market-oriented reforms explain part of the 
chill in Western investment here, which would have dropped by nearly half last 
year if not for the hurried selloff of 49% of the state telecommunications 
system to U.S. and German investors. The late-December deal, announced only two 
days after the bidding deadline, was pulled from the previously untouchable 
state property pool. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hungary is down after a year of disappointments, politicians from all 
sides say it is far from out. The Czech Republic, most concede, has 
outperformed Hungary in revamping industry. But they argue that they have 
nothing to be ashamed of in comparison with any other country in the former 
East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have taken any government more than four years to sweep away the 
ruins of 40 years" of Communist mismanagement, says Forum spokesman Karoly 
Herenyi. "Hungary has carried out much of the political and legislative reform 
yet to be tackled in Poland or the Czech Republic." 
</P>
<P>
 Herenyi contends that the Forum is still in the running for partnership in the 
next government, and like most political forecasters he holds out the 
possibility of a grand coalition uniting the current ruling party with the 
allied Young and Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 While alliances of such unlike factions in other countries often lead to 
parliamentary paralysis, Western diplomats here note that all leading parties 
have similar programs for economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the election outcome, the policies will have to get better," says 
Szirmai, who has low expectations for this year but predicts economic growth in 
1995. "Everyone, especially those in power, realizes it is time for change."

RISK TO BEDOUIN CAMPSITE REFLECTS MIDEAST LAND-FOR-PEACE DILEMMA; DEMOGRAPHICS: 
A SCRAMBLE FOR REAL ESTATE APPEARS UNDER WAY. PALESTINIANS ALLEGE ISRAELIS ARE 
EXPANDING SETTLEMENTS. ISRAELIS SEE ARABS INFLATING JERUSALEM'S POPULATION.

<P>
 Mohamed Ahmad Hairsh and 21 other families in the Jahaleen Bedouin tribe 
rejoiced on the day that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
signed their historic peace declaration last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tin shanties weren't much -- a barrio of scrap metal built into mud and 
rock in the shadow of the largest Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the huts are the only home these members of the nomadic Arab tribe have 
known since settling there, members claim, decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, they figured, peace meant land -- and their right to remain 
on it despite the sprawl of the Jewish settlement a few dozen yards above them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bulldozers came. Then the eviction order. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: To make way for 500 new Jewish homes in a $50-million expansion of 
the Ma'ale Adumim settlement that is as controversial as it is ambitious. The 
plan that has turned Hairsh's campsite into a construction site will increase 
the Jewish presence on strategic Israeli-occupied land at a time when Israel's 
leadership is negotiating the return of Arab land for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of peace is it that takes away the place where I live?" Hairsh 
asked as the bulldozers churned around him this week. "This is not peace. We 
see quite the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the Jahaleen is hardly as clear-cut as it appeared this week, 
when Palestinian human rights groups in Jerusalem used it to illustrate 
allegations that Israel has accelerated confiscation of Arab lands in and 
around Jerusalem in the months since it signed the land-for-peace agreement 
with the PLO -- a charge that Israeli authorities promptly and flatly denied. 
</P>
<P>
 But the threatened eviction of the Jahaleen is, in fact, symbolic of a deeper 
debate that resurfaced this week over the future of the strategic Jewish 
settlements surrounding Jerusalem -- indeed, the future of the city. And the 
Bedouins' dilemma is emblematic of how, in the months since the historic Middle 
East peace ceremony on the White House lawn, Jews and Arabs alike have sought 
to change what both sides call "the facts on the ground" -- the use of the land 
in question -- in advance of negotiations on the land's future. 
</P>
<P>
 As settlements such as Ma'ale Adumim have quietly continued to expand, carving 
new roads, walls and foundations for villas on Israeli-occupied land a few 
miles outside Jerusalem's city limits, Israeli legislators have in turn warned 
of Arab expansionism inside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarking on new, large-scale building programs of their own, Palestinians 
have been erecting hundreds of illegal structures in recent months, inflating 
Jerusalem's Arab population and threatening the delicate demographics of a 
disputed city that the PLO leadership has vowed to make the capital of a new 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, the land scramble went largely unnoticed, a sideshow to the 
Israeli-PLO deadlock over implementation of the September agreement for Israeli 
withdrawal and limited Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank town of 
Jericho and in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that agreement, the land where the expansion is taking place will not 
come up for formal debate for several years, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the land controversy is what Palestinian negotiator Faisal 
Husseini this week called "the spirit of the agreement," and fears of emerging 
policies he said would amount to "tactical breaches" that could "stand in the 
way of real peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Husseini's comments came on Monday, after four Palestinian human rights groups 
released maps, documents and a formal statement charging that the government of 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has embarked on a policy of "land 
confiscation" and "settlement expansion" on occupied land in and around 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups alleged that, in the months since the Israeli-PLO agreement was 
signed, Israeli authorities confiscated 11,500 acres of Arab land for military 
use, settlement expansion or nature reserves aimed at blocking Palestinian 
expansion, mostly in the strategic belt surrounding Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli civil administration in charge of the territories later denied, 
and presented evidence disputing, the allegation, explaining that the actions 
taken were merely "implementations" of land decisions made long before the 
agreement was signed. The actions, a spokeswoman said, will not affect the 
future use of most of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Palestinian groups' statement contained another, more general 
allegation that reports in the Israeli press this week appeared to confirm, at 
least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring specifically to Israel's policy to continue implementing land 
decisions in the occupied territories, the Palestinian groups concluded: "These 
practices are based on unpublished plans which aim at entrenching Israeli 
presence in the West Bank and containing Palestinian presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles (Sept. 13), extensive 
plans have been geared towards realizing an Israeli 'Greater Jerusalem.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, the highly regarded Israeli newspaper Haaretz published 
what appeared to be an outline for such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper report stated that Jerusalem's conservative, newly elected Mayor 
Ehud Olmert was "leaning toward accepting recommendations from a committee of 
experts to 'thicken' (Jewish) construction in Greater Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 With the report was a map showing the boundaries of that "Greater Jerusalem," 
its lines extended so far beyond current city limits that they include the key 
West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Ramallah, plus the entire Ma'ale Adumim 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Haaretz reported that the committee's recommendation was based on a belief 
that only through such settlement and construction could the government counter 
Palestinian expansion and ensure a Jewish majority in the area in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 And it added: "One of the professionals involved in the planning of greater 
metropolitan Jerusalem said what is being spoken about here is, in one disguise 
or another, an effort of de facto annexation of the expanse surrounding the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear, however, whether such plans have the sanction of Rabin 
and his Labor Party government, which announced plans to freeze most settlement 
activity when it took office in 1992, but deliberately exempted several 
settlements closest to Jerusalem -- settlements such as Ma'ale Adumim. 
</P>
<P>
 They are exceptions that continue to be official government policy, despite 
formal protests from both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations and despite 
the prime minister's vow last September to negotiate the future of those lands 
with the Palestinians at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Ofrah Preuss, spokeswoman for Israel's housing ministry, said there is no 
official plan to expand the settlements around Jerusalem, and she denied 
assertions that the concept of a Greater Jerusalem reflects official policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of 100 ideas until my minister, the prime minister and the Cabinet 
approve it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Preuss confirmed that the government did approve the 500-unit construction 
project now under way on the land that Mohamed Ahmad Hairsh and the 22 Jahaleen 
families refuse to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the government's stated policy, all funds for the project are 
from private, non-government sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman also confirmed that Minister for Construction and Housing 
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a close aide to Rabin, formally transferred to Ma'ale 
Adumim what the government years earlier had declared "state land" to 
facilitate the expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Israeli Civil Administration, which runs the occupied 
territories, similarly confirmed that it is the government's responsibility to 
remove all obstacles to that expansion -- a role it has played both in court 
and on the rocky hillside the Bedouins refuse to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israeli Army Maj. Elise Shazar, the Civil Administration's official 
spokeswoman, the controversy over the Bedouins is, like the other cases the 
Palestinian human rights groups brought up this week, "nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 The case dates back at least two years, she said. At that time, authorities 
approached the Jahaleen tribe and offered them an alternate campsite a mile or 
so away. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Jahaleen, who depend upon jobs at the settlement for their 
livelihood, accepted the offer and moved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hairsh and the 21 other families refused, insisting through a series of 
lawyers and court actions that the alternate site is uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 It is covered with boulders, they insisted, and adjacent to Jerusalem's main 
garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government told them, 'Take the rocks.' That's what they're being 
offered," said Israeli lawyer Lynda Brayer, whose Society of St. Yves, a Roman 
Catholic human rights group affiliated with the Vatican, has taken on the 
Bedouins' case for free. "From a health point of view, it's ridiculous. You 
don't put people on a garbage dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Brayer asserted that most of her clients have lived in the camp since the 
early 1960s, since the Israeli Army declared their traditional grazing lands in 
the northern Negev region a military zone and evicted several Bedouin tribes 
from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Shazar insisted, however, that authorities have aerial photographs 
indicating that the Jahaleen have been there only years -- "not decades." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, not even Hairsh, claims that his tribe has a legal right to be there. 
Their rights, Hairsh said, are traditional ones that predate by centuries the 
1967 Arab-Israeli War, in which Israel defeated Jordan and occupied the West 
Bank. But with Israeli law against the tribe, Brayer said she recently dropped 
a petition she filed with the high court seeking to block the families' 
eviction rather than wait for a judgment that would force them to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way they can stay there," Shazar said. "It is not their land. The 
alternative site is not their land, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said she doubts that the army will forcibly evict the 
remaining tribe members, although she stressed that the families are living in 
the midst of an active construction site from which the government has the 
legal right to expel them.  
</P>
<P>
 Hairsh remains both defiant and realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want us to do?" asked the 39-year-old father of eight, who worked 
as a tractor driver for the settlement's expansion project before his court 
case cost him his job. "We don't have a state. We don't have guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at us, you think we are living at the bottom of the pit of 
human society. Still, we are proud of our huts. We are proud of this fight to 
keep them here. But if they come with military power, what can we do? 
</P>
<P>
 "We move."

<P>
 A gas leak in Colombia's third-largest city killed three people and poisoned 
at least 300 Friday, causing widespread panic as residents scrambled to escape 
to cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster occurred around midnight in four neighborhoods in east Cali, 185 
miles southwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 Chloride gas in the underground sewage system seeped into homes as most 
residents slept, said Gen. Jose Reyes, commander of Cali's police department.

MEXICO FREES 38 SUSPECTED GUERRILLAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government late Friday freed more than half of 70 prisoners held on 
suspicion of participating in a New Year's rebellion, saying the release was 
another step in its efforts to restore calm to southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38 suspected guerrillas detained by the army walked out of the Cerro Hueco 
state penitentiary under "provisional liberty," said Gilberto Ocana Mendez, 
director of Chiapas prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not elaborate, saying only that the releases were not tied to a 
government-offered amnesty to rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
who surrender arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, officials announced that a military prosecutor would open a 
criminal investigation into the deaths of five rebel suspects who were lined up 
and shot in the head in Ocosingo during the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 And the former director of state security in Chiapas, fired for his part in 
failing to prevent the rebellion in the impoverished state, has been arrested 
on charges of drug and arms trafficking, kidnaping and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,000 Zapatista rebels rose up Jan. 1, declaring they were 
fighting to improve the living standard of the poor, neglected Indian 
population in Chiapas. More than 100 people were killed in two weeks of combat 
with 15,000 army troops, who pushed the rebels into mountainous jungles.

FIRST LADY BLASTS HEALTH CARE CRISIS NAYSAYERS IN D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday criticized politicians who say there is no 
health care crisis in America, calling them Washington insiders who have no 
health care worries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton said she met living proof of a crisis earlier in the day: Pamala 
Hinkley, a 34-year-old pregnant woman who said she is considering going without 
an anesthetic when she gives birth because it would cost $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of four told Mrs. Clinton that in her last delivery she had two 
such epidural injections. She needed them, she said, because she gives birth to 
10-pound babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, the people in Washington who are saying there is no health 
care crisis, their wives don't have to worry about whether they can afford an 
epidural," Mrs. Clinton said after meeting Hinkley and her husband during a 
tour of University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tour, Mrs. Clinton told Hinkley's story to an invited group of 
doctors, government officials and heads of local associations at a health care 
forum at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 She said lawmakers who criticize President Clinton's health plan have terrific 
coverage themselves, thanks to their employer, the federal government. And she 
noted that the government's plan is much like what Clinton is proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me, if it's good enough for the folks who live in Washington, 
it's good enough for the folks who live in Las Vegas," Mrs. Clinton said.

DOLE AFFIRMS HEALTH SYSTEM NEEDS REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's health care system may not be in a state of crisis but it does 
have "serious problems" that need reform, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're making too much over whether this is a crisis or a serious 
problem," the Kansas senator said."We don't want to get into a fight over 
whether there is a problem or a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole recently joined a growing number of Republicans who have questioned 
President Clinton's premise that the health care system is in crisis and needs 
sweeping reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview Friday with Kansas radio reporters, Dole said that he 
wants to shift the debate's focus away from the refusal of Republicans and some 
Democrats in Congress to use the word "crisis" when describing the health care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said that Republicans believe there are deep-rooted problems of access to 
health insurance and cost that must be addressed. "I think there's a universal 
feeling that we have to reform health care," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 He nevertheless criticized Clinton's plan for prescribing "a massive overdose 
of government control," adding that it would raise taxes and reduce the quality 
of care. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent Democrat, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, said recently that there was no "health care crisis," 
remarks that infuriated the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, Moynihan has specified that he meant to say there was no 
health care crisis but there is a health insurance crisis.

CLINTON PUSHES CRIME BILL, CITING L.A. SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, speaking to a group of mayors, Friday used the drop-off in 
criminal arrests in heavily patrolled post-quake Los Angeles as his latest 
argument for passage of the federal crime bill, which would put 100,000 more 
police officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the quake, "the actual patrol was tripled and crime in 
Los Angeles dropped so much that there were just 50 arrests per day in the 
whole huge city," Clinton told the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors here. 
</P>
<P>
 That was "one-tenth -- I'll say again -- one-tenth the normal number of 
arrests on any given day," Clinton said. "I want to ask each of you here today, 
therefore, to help us to pass this crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a letter of support for the plan from eight mayors, including Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Clinton urged the mayors to return to Washington 
"to work for the next 60 days walking the beat in the halls of Congress. . . . 
You can be the community police for your cities here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, citing public cooperation and the effect of 
increased patrols, last week reported that arrests fell to 73 people in the 24 
hours after the quake struck. The statistic appeared to buttress Clinton's call 
for his crime bill -- and also the LAPD's argument that it needs to increase 
the size of its force. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's crime package also would provide funds for the construction of more 
prisons and the establishment of military-style boot camps for young offenders 
and give life sentences for those convicted of a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The omnibus crime bill has passed the Senate but has not been voted on in the 
House, where its future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the meeting demonstrated the support of many mayors for the Clinton 
crime package, many also argued for even more federal spending to combat crime 
in their localities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, they presented Clinton with an anti-crime plan. One key element 
would allow cities to use federal law enforcement funds not only for hiring 
extra police officers but for overtime, training and equipment for veteran 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also traveled by helicopter to Piney Point, Md., to speak to about 110 
House Democrats who were participating in an annual issues conference. The 
Democrats were plotting strategies for a full legislative agenda that includes 
health care reform, welfare reform, passage of a major anti-crime package and 
campaign finance reform. The event was closed to the media.

GUNMEN AMBUSH BRITISH AID WORKERS IN BOSNIA; 1 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen ambushed and robbed three British aid workers on a relief mission in 
central Bosnia-Herzegovina. One of the men was killed and the other two were 
wounded as they fled, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloodshed highlighted growing lawlessness and desperation in central 
Bosnia, where food is dangerously short. Aid officials warned that such attacks 
could endanger their mission to feed hungry Bosnians. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Bosnia, three Italian journalists were killed by a mortar shell 
Friday in Mostar, where Muslims are under siege by Croatian forces, said Capt. 
Guy Vinet of the U.N. Bosnia Command. The journalists were believed to be 
working for RAI, the main Italian broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain on Friday suspended its humanitarian convoys to the former Yugoslav 
federation as a result of the attack on the aid workers. Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said the murder was a "tragedy and a crime" and called on the 
Bosnian authorities to find the killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediator Lord Owen called the killing of aid worker 35-year-old Paul Goodall, 
the father of four daughters, a "coldblooded shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 "If this kind of thing continues, we won't be able to operate," said Ron 
Redmond, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited field reports of continuing violence against non-Serbs in the 
northwestern Serb-held Banja Luka area, saying three Muslims, ages 65 to 70, 
were found with their throats slit in their homes in Prijedor. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall and the two other drivers were returning late Thursday to their hotel 
in Zenica, a government-held town about 40 miles northwest of Sarajevo, when 
three unidentified men in uniforms and armed with assault weapons stopped their 
vehicle, Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen forced them to drive to an overpass outside Zenica where they took 
the vehicle and opened fire. Goodall was killed by two shots to the head. Simon 
King, 27, and David Court, 42, were wounded as they ran. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken to a British military hospital in Vitez, where Court, the more 
seriously wounded, was in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall's body was found 50 yards from the road in a minefield that U.N. 
soldiers had to first clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers worked for Britain's Overseas Development Administration but at 
the time were working for UNHCR. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, several food convoys have been attacked in the Zenica area. 
Six Bosnian police escorts were wounded in nearby Kakanj earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Food is critically short in Kakanj, south of Zenica. Fighting and bureaucratic 
delays by Bosnia's warring factions mean only a fraction of the food needed 
actually arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The British driver was the 11th person working for UNHCR killed in Bosnia, 
Redmond said.

PRO-COMMUNIST ELECTED HEAD OF STATE IN BELARUS; POLITICS: THE CHOICE IS A BLOW 
TO REFORMERS IN THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In another rout for reformers in the former Soviet Union, a pro-Communist 
ex-police official was elected head of state in Belarus on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechislav Grib, 57, who advocates closer economic and military ties with 
Russia, was chosen on the second ballot by a vote of 183-55 to succeed ousted 
liberal reformer Stanislav Shushkevich as Speaker of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament voted no confidence in Shushkevich on Wednesday, just 11 days after 
the physicist-reformer had been warmly endorsed by President Clinton during the 
President's visit to Minsk. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department expressed regret over Shushkevich's departure, 
saying the vote "deprives Belarus of leadership that has made a remarkable 
contribution to peace and stability in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who was Shushkevich's 
constant critic. Kebich said Friday that although the two leaders had crossed 
swords, they agreed that their main task is to build a market economy in the 
nation of 10 million without causing social upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to prevent a sharp drop in living standards . . . and to maintain 
stability, accord and peace on Belarussian soil," Kebich said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Grib defeated rival Communist and Minsk Mayor Mikhail Marinich for the 
Speaker's job, Kebich announced that he intends to form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the Belarussian Speaker of Parliament and prime minister have 
equal power. Grib supports the adoption of a new constitution that would 
establish a strong presidency -- and Friday's vote gives him a good shot at 
becoming Belarus' first president, according to reports from Minsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Minsk, Grib is a relative unknown. Born to a peasant family, he was 
educated as a legal expert and a high-ranking official in the Soviet Interior 
Ministry in the Vitebsk region. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the Belarussian Parliament in 1990 and heads a committee on 
national security, defense and law enforcement. Grib also leads the 
pro-Communist Belarus faction, which claims 130 of the 345 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 His strong appeals for law and order have resonance in a new nation where, as 
in much of the former Soviet Union, economic and political chaos has bred 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Shushkevich. He was a nice man -- but a little bit soft," said Nina 
Marinich, a 36-year-old telephone operator in Minsk. "This new man, or rather 
the old Communist, may not be as good as Shushkevich in terms of democracy and 
all that." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the economy collapsing, living standards declining and criminals 
running wild, a tough former policeman might restore order, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least Communists used to have some order and discipline," she said. 
"Prices were stable, and there was no crime. Democrats brought a good deal of 
anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Grib also supports the recently announced monetary union between Belarus and 
Russia. Former Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar of Russia strongly 
protested the union as inflationary, but it is welcomed in Minsk, where the 
local zaichik, an interim coupon, inspires even less respect than the battered 
Russian ruble. In mid-January the zaichik was trading at 4.5 to the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nicer to have Russian rubles than the zaichiks of Shushkevich and 
Kebich," Nina Marinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarus never sought independence from the Soviet Union, and it remains 
dependent on Russia for 90% of its fuel. Shushkevich fought a lonely battle to 
shore up Belarussian sovereignty and tried to keep his country out of a 
military defense pact with the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 Grib supports that treaty and said Friday that he has "big hopes" for 
Russian-Belarussian friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Slavs, we are neighbors," Grib said.

 With good news rolling in on the economic front almost every day, it seems 
clear that the nation has finally and irretrievably pulled out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 That the recovery is accelerating was underscored by Friday's report that the 
nation's gross domestic product grew at the fastest pace in six years during 
the final quarter of 1993. Estimates of future federal deficits are declining. 
The stock market is setting new records. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most remarkably, the economy has recovered without reviving inflation 
and the Federal Reserve has felt surprisingly little pressure to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton Administration officials can barely contain their glee as 
Washington's statisticians churn out glowing new numbers. And in time-honored 
fashion, the White House immediately took credit Friday for virtually all of 
the positive trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a clear linkage between the President's economic program introduced 
last year and the economy's improved performance," declared Laura D'Andrea 
Tyson, who chairs the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's report of rapid economic growth came one day after the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office issued a new forecast saying that the budget 
deficit crisis is effectively over. It predicted that the deficit would fall to 
$166 billion by 1996, nearly half of what had been forecast earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer gave most of the credit to Clinton's 
economic plan. One Democratic senator called the report the "best news I've 
heard since I've been in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Republicans and other Clinton critics argue that Clinton's policies 
have had very little to do with the dramatic turnaround in the economic and 
budgetary outlook. They say that Clinton has been lucky -- not good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton is taking credit for the business cycle," said Martin S. Feldstein, a 
Harvard economist and former Ronald Reagan Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton budget plan has had almost nothing to do with the recovery," 
added Michael J. Boskin, a Stanford University economist and former chief 
economist in the George Bush Administration. "Clinton inherited an economy 
doing much better than many people realized and certainly better than what he 
let on during the campaign."  
</P>
<P>
 But such political distinctions have never stopped any President -- including 
Reagan and Bush -- from taking credit for positive economic trends. "We did not 
inherit a strong, robust economy" from Bush, countered Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it may be too soon for the Administration to pop the corks on the 
champagne. Analysts warned that the economy's high growth rate of 5.9% in late 
1993 will not be sustained this year. Even the White House's own forecast, to 
be released next month, will show that growth will moderate to just under 3% 
for 1994. The unemployment rate is not likely to continue to decline at the 
relatively rapid pace of recent months, either. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the surge of good economic news will not necessarily translate 
into political capital that the White House can spend on its ambitious domestic 
agenda for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters, critics noted, may not agree that Clinton should immediately shift 
gears from deficit reduction to big new spending plans in such areas as health 
care, welfare and job training. In fact, Clinton's fiscal policies may be 
severely tested this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, many moderates in Congress are pushing for passage this year of more 
and tougher deficit-reduction measures -- efforts that the White House will 
actively oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that further spending reductions would make it impossible to fund 
health care reform or welfare reform, the cornerstones of Clinton's 1994 
agenda, the Administration will fight hard to stop an expected congressional 
push for a balanced-budget constitutional amendment this spring. White House 
officials said that they hope the sharp reduction in the CBO's deficit forecast 
will slow the momentum of the balanced-budget forces but there is no evidence 
yet to support that hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential obstacle to the Administration's ability to fund its agenda 
may come from a bipartisan entitlement commission headed by Sen. Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.) and Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.). In May it is expected to call for 
tough reforms and spending reductions in fast-growing entitlement programs, 
such as Medicare and Medicaid. The commission's proposals could lead to a 
serious conflict between Congress and the Administration over the budgetary 
impact of Clinton's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, new polls show that as the economy is improving and 
Americans are feeling more secure about the future, the popularity of Clinton's 
health care reform plan -- by far his biggest social initiative -- actually is 
declining. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in mid-January found that of 
those surveyed 42% supported the Clinton health plan, while 39% were opposed to 
it. In a similar December poll, 47% of those surveyed were in favor of the 
Clinton plan and only 32% were against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and Clinton supporters are fighting hard to counter 
conservative efforts to depict the health care plan and other Clinton 
initiatives as huge new drains on government resources. Instead, Administration 
officials noted that the President plans to pay for his new domestic 
initiatives with offsetting spending cuts elsewhere. Voters should not see his 
1994 agenda as conflicting with his deficit-cutting plans of 1993, they 
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to increase the deficit with our proposals for 1994," said 
Tyson. "In fact, the only way to deal with the deficit in the future is to 
address fast-rising health care costs through comprehensive reform." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boskin and other conservatives view the Clinton agenda quite differently. 
They argued that, while Clinton's social initiatives would start as small pilot 
programs, they ultimately would grow to the point that Congress would be forced 
to raise taxes to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the mirror image of Reaganomics," said Boskin. "In 1981, Reagan tried 
to cut taxes to put pressure on Congress to reduce spending. Now, in 1994, 
Clinton is trying to build new programs into the budget that ultimately 
Americans will get hooked on, will require new spending and will put pressure 
on Congress to raise taxes."

BABBITT RETREATS FROM TRANSFERRING BLM DIRECTOR BACA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From the Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt backed down from a plan to replace one of his 
senior land managers, agreeing Friday to allow Bureau of Land Management 
Director Jim Baca to remain in his post. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's about-face concluded an embarrassing and awkward episode for the 
Clinton Administration during which environmentalists rallied to Baca's defense 
and he refused to accept a new post.Although Interior Department officials 
characterized that new position as a promotion, it was widely seen as a way to 
isolate Baca, a vocal advocate of fundamental changes in the way the department 
regulates grazing and mining on public land. Baca is one of the highest-ranking 
Latinos in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt agreed to let him remain as head of BLM, which manages 260 million 
acres of land in the West, at a meeting Friday night.

RAPE VICTIM SUES FEMINIST LAWMAKER WHO FIRED HER; UTAH: SEVEN DAYS AFTER BEING 
BRUTALLY ATTACKED, A BOOKKEEPER IS LET GO. THE CASE HAS RAISED QUESTIONS OF 
COMPASSION, COMMERCE AND POLITICAL CALCULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven days after being brutally raped at knifepoint, a bookkeeper was fired 
from her job here. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for dismissal, according to a letter signed by her boss: Her work 
productivity had dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Jacqueline Hedberg is fighting back with a lawsuit alleging wrongful 
termination by the employer who she says "threw me out with the trash": Utah 
state Rep. Sara Eubank, a first-term Democrat who was elected in 1990 as a 
staunch defender of women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in federal court in December, one year after the attack, was 
a piece of bad news for Eubank, who is also president of Employer 1, a 
staff-leasing firm in Salt Lake City. But the letter attached to it stunned 
Utah residents, and the incident has snowballed into a public spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found after the trauma Jacquie experienced from the rape incident, she 
could not continue to maintain the level of productivity required to handle 
this assignment," Eubank wrote to the Utah Office of Crime Victims Reparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, all other positions in our organization require similar levels 
of productivity," the letter continued. "We were therefore unable to place her 
in another assignment." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders in this overwhelmingly conservative state suggest that 
Hedberg's case is an attack orchestrated by Republicans trying to claim 
Eubank's seat at the ballot box this November. Others -- including some of 
Hedberg's friends and Eubank's supporters -- fear both women are being 
manipulated by people with ulterior motives of personal gain or political 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The case raises serious concerns about whether victims of sexual assault can 
expect compassion in the workplace -- even from avowed feminists -- when the 
welfare of a business is on the line, some women's rights advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough one for us," said Janece Vauk, former board member of the 
National Organization for Women in Utah, which has not taken a stand on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our action committee gave Sara money during her campaign. Now she is the best 
ally we have in the state House of Representatives," Vauk said. "On the other 
hand, we are shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Kanaval Whitesides, an outspoken feminist and president of the Mormon 
Women's Forum, was more direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sara made a really big mistake," Whitesides said. "There is no way, if I was 
an employer, I'd fire someone after she was raped." 
</P>
<P>
 Eubank's troubles mount each time she tries to defend the dismissal and 
discredit Hedberg's story in news reports and letters to her constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 9, Eubank publicly rejected a settlement demand of $100,000 from 
Hedberg's lawyer for back-pay and future lost wages, calling it "blackmail." 
Hedberg and her lawyer, Chase Kimball, responded by filing separate slander 
suits against the legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Eubank also said Hedberg was fired not because her performance lagged after 
the rape but because of longstanding incompetence on the job. The legislator 
said she had planned to fire the bookkeeper even before the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 That statement triggered a state investigation because Hedberg had received 
$4,000 from the crime victims agency for lost wages and medical bills as a 
result of the letter Eubank signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salt Lake County Attorney's Office ultimately did not bring charges 
against either woman, in part because the letter was not necessary for approval 
of the wage claim because a physician stated that Hedberg would be unable to 
work for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of control," said Dennis Poole, one of three lawyers Eubank hired to 
beat back the lawsuits and the state investigation. "This is a very emotional 
and time-consuming matter for Sara and for us as her counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the tussle is Hedberg, a bookkeeper who says she's too shy to 
pray out loud in church, and Kimball, an aggressive young Salt Lake City 
attorney -- both of whom thought the lawsuit would lead to a quick cash 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the rape trauma letter (signed by Eubank), my eyeballs were 
spinning in their sockets," Kimball said. "I told Jacquie: 'I don't think this 
will be much trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "they've never offered (Hedberg) an apology or a penny," Kimball 
said. "Their argument is that we blew the statute of limitations for filing a 
lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the lawsuit was filed in time is a major point of contention. Poole 
argues that under Utah's anti-discrimination law, any claims must be filed 
within 180 days. Kimball claims there is a 300-day deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case lumbers toward a final showdown in court, Kimball has tried to 
drum up support for his client in other ways that are giving some of Hedberg's 
closest friends cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Kimball accepted an offer to write a movie treatment about 
Hedberg's story for Hollywood producers. And Hedberg, to the chagrin of those 
who say she is a fragile and vulnerable individual, is entertaining notions of 
appearing on television talk shows such as "Donahue" and "Oprah." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm politically naive about a lot of things," Hedberg said. "But I do realize 
that if we look money-hungry, we lose the whole premise -- that people should 
be protected from losing their jobs after being victims of a heinous crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Eubank insisted that Hedberg "was dismissed for one reason: She was 
incompetent on the job and had been for a long time." And she said that 
Employer 1, a financially troubled firm, was not in a position to accept the 
risk of keeping such a worker in a critical position. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter sent to the crime victims agency, Eubank added, was an attempt to 
secure financial assistance for Hedberg when she needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Eubank said, she had located another, less stressful job for Hedberg 
-- as a caseworker at a county mental health clinic -- which was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to tell all the facts would destroy Ms. Hedberg, and I don't want to 
do that," said Eubank, who claims to have a file brimming with critical 
evaluations of Hedberg's work. "But I'm confident I'll be vindicated in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg said her former employer's version of her performance is untrue. "She 
commended me on my work," Hedberg said, "and never reprimanded me verbally or 
in writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the charges and countercharges, the only uncontested fact is that on the 
night of Dec. 2, 1992, Aaron Gene Mace, then 19, entered Hedberg's condominium, 
tied her up with duct tape and then raped and sodomized her. 
</P>
<P>
 After that ordeal, Mace forced Hedberg to take him to an automated teller 
machine and drain her bank account. Along the way, he muttered over and over: 
"I'm a 'born-again' Christian. Now I'm going to burn in hell," Hedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mace, who was later arrested at the nearby condominium he shared with his wife 
and three children, confessed to the crime. He was sentenced to five years to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the rape, Hedberg returned to work -- believing that "it was 
therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of her first week back on the job, Hedberg said, a manager at 
Employer 1 handed her a check and said: "We're going to have to let you go." 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, Hedberg said, she telephoned Eubank and begged to have her 
job back. Eubank, she said, "was nice but kept saying: 'You need time off. This 
is in your best interest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was raped twice in one week," said Hedberg, who added that she 
numbed her pain with tranquilizers and alcohol for months afterward. "I had 
nothing left to live for." 
</P>
<P>
 For consolation and advice, Hedberg turned to friends, including Kimball, and 
an investigator who had handled the rape case, Salt Lake County sheriff's 
Detective Glen Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me that she'd gotten a letter saying she was fired by her boss 
because of the rape," said Perot, who recommended she share the problem with 
rape trauma counselors. "I couldn't believe it. I'd never heard of a rape 
victim losing their job because of the rape." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Abby Maestas, executive director of the Salt Lake City Rape 
Crisis Center -- a private nonprofit agency funded with public donations and 
federal money funneled through the state -- said Hedberg's case has nothing to 
with rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a rape issue," Maestas said. "It is an employer-employee 
performance issue. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg disagrees. "I didn't do this on a whim: It took six months for me to 
decide whether to file the lawsuit," she said. "I had friends telling me I was 
wronged and should do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Eubank is fighting for her political life, according to observers, 
including David Magleby, a professor of political science at Brigham Young 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sara had a bright political future in front of her," said Magleby, a 
consultant to the Democratic Party in Utah. "This story has substantially 
altered her chances of surviving, let alone running for a state Senate seat or 
the U.S. House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think all employers should be patient with an employee in this 
kind of situation. That's what voters will consider in the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg's future also is uncertain. She said she fears that Eubank's 
assertions about her performance at Employer 1 will harm job prospects. Hedberg 
claims that she cannot afford therapy needed to deal with lingering rape 
trauma, but the publicity surrounding the lawsuit has made it all but 
impossible to put the incident out of her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have seen the future, I would never have done this -- but it's too 
late now," Hedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sara's a very powerful person, I'm not. She can pull strings, I can't. And 
it's true that people aren't out there rallying for me," she said. "But my 
friends are very supportive. My friends have faith in me."

'DEATH ROW' DOG IS PARDONED AND THEN BANNED FROM N.J. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dog sentenced to die after it injured a child won a pardon Friday from Gov. 
Christine Todd Whitman, but can never return to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman decreed that Taro, a 110-pound Akita, be exiled from the state and 
have new owners.The dog's present owners, Lonnie and Sandy Lehrer of Haworth, 
N.J., have 30 days to agree to the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that we have saved Taro's life," Lonnie Lehrer said in a 
statement released by the Animal Rights Law Center of the Rutgers Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Taro has been on Death Row at the Bergen County Jail since February, 1991. The 
borough of Haworth ordered him destroyed after he injured 10-year-old Brie 
Halfond on Christmas Day in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Borough officials said the dog bit the girl's lip, but the Lehrers said the 
child provoked the dog and was scratched. The girl is the Lehrer's niece. 
</P>
<P>
 Taro's saga became an international cause celebre, with dog lovers from around 
the world offering to take the Akita. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigitte Bardot, the actress turned animal rights activist, had telegrammed 
Whitman's predecessor, James J. Florio, last year in support of the dog. Florio 
refused to get involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman's order came two days after the state Supreme Court decided it would 
not hear an appeal brought by Taro's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to put this behind us and move on," Whitman told reporters. 
"There's been too much money and time and effort spent on this dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog's internment at the Bergen County Jail cost about $18 a day. The 
Lehrers have spent about $30,000 fighting the death sentence, while the borough 
has spent $60,000 defending it.

U.S. OFFICIALS LIED ABOUT CULT RAID, AGENT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top federal officials lied about losing the element of surprise in a raid on 
David Koresh's commune, then tried to pass the blame for the botched assault, 
an undercover agent testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not saying what had happened," said Robert Rodriguez, an undercover 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who had infiltrated the Branch 
Davidian complex near Waco, Tex. "I knew it was wrong. The information they 
were saying was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriquez added that a nervous, shaking Koresh repeatedly said "the time has 
come" after someone tipped him off about the Feb. 28 raid on his compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who had been posing as a student to get to know the sect, said he 
immediately reported to his ATF supervisors that Koresh knew of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover agent said he thought the operation would be called off, but it 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid erupted into a shootout that left four ATF agents dead. Eleven Branch 
Davidians are on trial for murder in their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 After the raid, Rodriguez said, then-ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins, 
Associate Director Dan Hartnett and the agency's intelligence chief, David 
Troy, claimed in nationally broadcast news conferences that they had maintained 
the element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he relayed his information about Koresh knowing of the 
operation to raid organizer Charles Sarabyn, who later briefed some top 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Sarabyn) told me what they were saying was true and what I had said was 
not right," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several ATF officials resigned or were disciplined for their roles in giving 
out the misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Rodriguez said that when he heard the false 
statements he wondered whether there was "a strategy" behind them. He said he 
eventually complained and hired his own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware of it. I was upset about it," Rodriguez said, adding that ATF 
officials tried to blame him for the agency's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers contend that their clients acted in self-defense during the 
shootout after federal agents waged an ill-conceived assault on the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Branch Davidians are thought to have died in the gun battle. An ensuing 
51-day standoff ended April 19 when the compound burned during a new federal 
attack. Koresh and more than 80 of his followers died in the blaze.

'DEATH ROW' DOG PARDONED, ENDING YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman on Friday pardoned New Jersey's "Death Row" dog, 
whose ordeal had sparked appeals for clemency from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman's action ended more than three years of legal wrangling over the fate 
of Taro, a 5-year-old Akita that has been held in a special kennel at the 
Bergen County jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has gone on long enough," Whitman told reporters, noting that the case 
had consumed more than $100,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge ordered the dog destroyed after ruling that it had attacked a girl who 
was visiting the Haworth, N.J., home of Lonnie and Sandy Lehrer on Christmas 
Day, 1990. Taro was committed to the county jail on Feb. 11, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman faced an unusual legal dilemma since her power to grant clemency 
applies to people, and not pets. But she said she had found a way out through a 
law on property forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
 Since pets are property, the executive order says, and the governor has the 
power to remit forfeitures, she will exercise that power to spare Taro and 
return the dog to her owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog must be moved within 30 days, and the owners must accept any 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Taro's saga became an international cause celebre, with dog lovers from around 
the world offering to take the 100-pound Akita. The Japanese government even 
expressed interest, since Taro's breed is native to that land. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigitte Bardot, the actress turned animal rights activist, had telegrammed 
Whitman's predecessor, James J. Florio, last year in support of the dog. Florio 
refused to get involved in the case.

 Taro was to have been killed under a law that orders dangerous dogs to be 
destroyed. But the author of that law said he meant it for pit bulls and other 
dogs bred to be aggressive. The state Legislature is considering revisions to 
the law to prevent similar disputes.

OREGON GOV. ROBERTS DROPS REELECTION BID

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Barbara Roberts called off her reelection bid on Friday, citing personal 
and professional concerns in her decision not to try for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could do it all . . . but I can't do justice to my family or 
myself if I spread myself that thin," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Frank, died of cancer last fall, and her sister is suffering from 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 57, became the second Oregon governor in a row to decide not to seek 
reelection. Democratic Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt in 1990 announced that he would 
not run again because he and his wife were splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts faced a strong challenge from former state Senate President John 
Kitzhaber in the May Democratic primary.

STATE CHIEF JUSTICE LUCAS' TRAVELS DID NOT VIOLATE ETHICS, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Commission on Judicial Performance announced Friday that it 
found "no basis" for disciplining California Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas for 
traveling extensively or accepting reimbursement for his trips. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, the commission said it would close its probe into 
whether Lucas' travels violated ethics or affected court productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas asked for the investigation after the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
in November that he had spent 53 week days out of state in 1992 to attend a 
variety of legal conferences and events. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas accepted reimbursement for two of those trips from a subsidiary of a 
corporation that has had cases before the court. But Lucas voted against the 
corporation's interests in two cases that came before the court after the 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing witnesses and reviewing records, the commission said it did 
not find that Lucas' absences interfered with court productivity. Indeed, the 
commission said that participation in activities about the administration of 
justice is part of the constitutional duties of a chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said also that it is not improper for a judge to accept 
reimbursement for travel expenses to participate in events. Lucas' judgment was 
not affected by his acceptance of expenses nor did he create an appearance of 
impropriety, the commission said.

HEAVY RAIN, FLOODS PUMMEL NORTHEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northeast was pelted with heavy rain Friday, causing street flooding and 
icy conditions that meant another tough day for commuters struggling through an 
already brutal winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy rain combined with melting snow in many areas to create flash 
flooding, which was worsened because many storm drains remained clogged with 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 A commuter train traveling 70 m.p.h. slammed into a mudslide that had spread 
across all four tracks of the Hudson River Line, which is operated by the 
Metro-North Commuter Railroad north of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact derailed the front set of wheels on the first of two locomotives. 
No injuries were reported on the five-car train, but a railroad spokeswoman 
said it would take hours to clear mud and fallen trees at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Major highways throughout the area were closed just as the evening rush hour 
began. A section of the usually packed Long Island Expressway was shut down 
because of the flooding. Many streets in low-lying areas also were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City Fire Department was called to the Central Park Zoo to pump 
out 10 feet of water. The water, which elevated the levels of the seal pond, 
did not injure any of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, creeks swollen by melting snow, ice jams and nearly two inches of 
rain surged out of their banks Friday across northern West Virginia, flooding 
streets and homes and forcing evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wheeling, W. Va., where 1.8 inches of rain fell overnight, a milelong ice 
jam blocked Wheeling Creek and pushed it out of its banks for the second time 
in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any injuries or deaths, but we have had some people who needed 
rescuing because it was quick rising. You might call it a flash flood," said 
Jim Bruce, assistant fire chief in Wheeling. "We had to evacuate them due to 
medical difficulties and panic." 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, concerns about icy roadways did not materialize Friday, but 
commuting in the area remained a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snow and ice situation has turned to flooding," said Pennsylvania 
Department of Transportation spokesman Edward Myslewicz. 
</P>
<P>
 During the morning, several central Pennsylvania highways, including a portion 
of Interstate 80, were temporarily closed due to icing before the rain melted 
the ice, Myslewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two feet of water covered some major roads in the Philadelphia area 
at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania state office buildings were closed Friday in Reading, Scranton 
and Harrisburg. Schools and businesses across Vermont were closed because of 
icy roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools were closed and many businesses opened late around Washington, 
D.C., as rain, sleet and freezing rain fell on top of a bed of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal employees were given a "liberal leave" policy, which meant they could 
take the day off as personal leave time. Government offices remained open, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine got a slippery mix of snow and sleet, closing most schools and making 
driving treacherous. But the precipitation gradually changed to rain along much 
of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain and fog created problems at some East Coast airports. New Jersey's Newark 
International Airport and John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, both which serve 
New York City, had delays of up to two hours because of fog.

OREGON GOV. ROBERTS DROPS BID FOR SECOND TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Barbara Roberts called off her reelection bid on Friday, citing personal 
and professional concerns in her decision not to try for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could do it all . . . but I can't do justice to my family or 
myself if I spread myself that thin," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Frank, died of cancer last fall, and her sister is suffering from 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 57, became the second Oregon governor in a row to decide not to seek 
reelection. Democratic Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt in 1990 announced that he would 
not run again because he and his wife were splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts faced a strong challenge from former state Senate President John 
Kitzhaber in the May Democratic primary. She has been far behind in polls but 
had vowed to wage an all-out campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton issued a statement saying he had learned of 
Roberts' decision not to seek reelection "with regret." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been very fortunate to work with the governor on issues affecting the 
people of the Northwest and the nation -- health care, economic opportunity and 
the protection of our natural resources. Her leadership on these and other 
issues will be missed," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who earlier was considered for a position in the Clinton 
Administration, said she had not been contacted recently for any such job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I want to do next," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' announcement led to speculation that Secretary of State Phil 
Keisling, an ally of Roberts, might enter the Democratic governor's race. He 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' term has been a difficult one: She faced three recall efforts and 
legislative opposition. She also has had to contend with a $1-billion budget 
shortfall resulting from a property tax limit passed by voters in 1990.

BLUE CROSS FAILED TO TELL ITS STAFF OF NEW PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue Cross of California, in a snafu that Chairman Leonard D. Schaeffer called 
"a major communications problem," rolled out a significant new health insurance 
program this week without notifying its sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The mishap led to mass confusion and some bitterness among the hundreds of 
Californians who -- upon learning of the program in The Times and elsewhere -- 
flooded Blue Cross' toll-free lines with inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is it's a sham," said Steve Stern of Los Angeles, whose wife had 
cancer four years ago and who thought the program might answer their insurance 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new initiative for individuals and families announced Wednesday, 
Blue Cross promises to extend coverage to all applicants regardless of medical 
history, with rates for even the riskiest applicants averaging only $214 a 
month -- a statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, effective March 1, carries some tight restrictions such as 
deductibles, caps on benefits and six-month waiting periods for existing 
medical conditions. Still, for many Californians, especially in high-cost Los 
Angeles, it sounded extremely attractive. It represents the first time that a 
private California insurer had guaranteed coverage for all applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 Problems started as soon as the company's phone lines opened Thursday. When 
callers asked about the rates they had seen in the newspaper, Blue Cross 
salespeople -- who Schaeffer said were working from price lists that did not 
reflect the new program -- told them that those prices did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those aren't Blue Cross numbers," a saleswoman said Friday when a reporter, 
without identifying himself, called to ask about the program. "It's just 
something that the media got hold of and ran by themselves," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of confusion was the average premium figures. Although 
Schaeffer insisted that the prices "are accurate and were given in good faith," 
they don't tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the average premium for policyholders with the most 
severe medical problems will be $268 a month, as compared to $214 for the state 
as a whole, Blue Cross said Friday. And premiums range substantially higher, 
depending upon an applicant's age. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program is fully implemented, current Blue Cross members with the 
worst health risks will see their premiums drop 20% to 25%, said D. Mark 
Weinberg, Blue Cross executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg said the company announced the program while it was in the process of 
explaining it to its staff and thousands of independent insurance agents. 
Salespeople will be acquainted with the program by Monday and will send out 
brochures and applications next month.

FIREFIGHTERS UNION ASSAILS WESTMINSTER; SPENDING: LABOR LEADERS SAY CUTBACKS 
HAVE ENDANGERED PUBLIC SAFETY. COUNCIL DENIES CHARGES THAT ITS ACTIONS 
CONTRIBUTED TO A MAN'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Officials of the beleaguered Westminster firefighters union charged Friday 
that the City Council's decision to cut the Fire Department budget has 
compromised public safety and contributed to the fire-related death of a 
mentally disabled man two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragedy is the direct result of the mayor and council placing politics 
above the safety of the people," Capt. Mike Garrison, director of the 
Westminster Firefighters Assn., said during a news conference at the city's 
Fire Station No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark D. York, 33, died early Thursday evening as flames engulfed the rear of 
Christian Residential Care, a board-and-care home on Candlewood Street. His 
body was found in a bathroom on the bottom floor of the two-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the City Council, including one who is the target of a recall drive 
backed by city firefighters, said it has yet to be determined what caused 
York's death or whether there was even a chance of rescuing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it somewhat disturbing that the union can reach this type of 
conclusion when the investigation by the state fire marshal has not been 
concluded," said council member Craig Schweisinger, who voted to cut the fire 
service budget and faces a recall drive. "It's apparent this union official 
would stoop to anything to maintain their money and power grab in the city," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Orange County coroner's office also said it would be 
premature to say how York died before a thorough investigation is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison said that because of staff cuts at the station nearest Christian 
Residential Care there were not enough firefighters to fully search the 
building immediately after they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the professional opinion of not only the Westminster Fire Fighters 
Executive Board, but the on-scene battalion chief that had Station 2's (second 
engine) . . . been in service, this fatality would not have happened," Garrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two fire engines previously stationed at the closest firehouse had been 
transferred elsewhere when city officials -- concerned about overtime costs -- 
ordered spending cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's assertions about York's death were some of the strongest statements 
firefighters have made in a bitter dispute with the City Council over staffing 
and overtime costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, the City Council's concerns triggered an investigation by 
the Orange County district attorney's office into whether firefighters and 
their superiors improperly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial suspicions of theft were raised when city auditors disclosed that 
about $1 million in overtime was paid in fiscal 1991-1992, when the budget for 
overtime was about $710,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to reduce overtime and overhaul the department, the City Council 
last year passed a reorganization plan that took one ladder truck out of 
service, eliminated six firefighters positions and realigned staffing to reduce 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the firefighters association say they are backing the 
recall movement because the council's efforts to streamline the fire service 
have seriously jeopardized public safety. They blame the overtime situation on 
the council's failure to hire enough firefighters to fill all shifts.

2 LEGISLATORS CALL FOR CUTTING OFF QUAKE AID TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; POLITICS: 
CRITICS IMMEDIATELY CONDEMN THE SUGGESTION BY REP. DANA ROHRABACHER AND 
ASSEMBLYMAN PAT NOLAN AS RACIALLY MOTIVATED. 
</P>

<P>
 The politically charged issue of immigration was tossed onto already complex 
earthquake relief efforts Friday, when two Republican legislators from Southern 
California publicly called on federal and state authorities to cut off 
assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics immediately condemned the officeholders' suggestion as the latest 
eruption of immigrant-bashing and political manipulation of the immigration 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, state and federal authorities have stated repeatedly 
that victims are eligible for most emergency assistance regardless of their 
immigration status. And U.S. officials have pledged publicly that immigration 
agents will not raid relief centers or otherwise seek out illegal immigrants 
looking for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Those assurances have enraged U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) 
and Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who said officials should be checking 
assistance stations and deporting those who are here illegally -- not 
encouraging them to apply for grants and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be relocated back to their home country -- that's a humanitarian 
thing," said Nolan, who introduced a bill Friday that would cut off state 
assistance to unlawful residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants queuing up for aid are blocking help meant for U.S. 
citizens and lawful immigrants, the two legislators charged. Although they say 
they do not object to illegal immigrants receiving short-term emergency aid, 
the pair opposes more long-term help, such as funds to cover moving costs and 
months of rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the people of California to understand that hundreds of millions of 
dollars that should be going to them is instead going to illegal aliens, and 
it's absolutely outrageous," said Rohrabacher, who added that he plans to 
sponsor a federal budget amendment next week excluding illegal immigrants. 
"Once people realize that there is free money available, the lines will be 
never-ending and will reach to every border." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their assertions, both Rohrabacher and Nolan acknowledged that they 
have no idea how many illegal immigrants are receiving disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of post-quake assistance to illegal immigrants has turned up 
periodically on radio call-in shows and elsewhere, but Friday's comments marked 
the first large-scale public linkage of earthquake relief with people's 
immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 The two legislators made their declarations at a news conference staged across 
the street from a county office in Glendale where hundreds of earthquake 
victims -- many of them immigrants -- were lining up for food stamps. Some had 
waited in line 10 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked down the street, I didn't hear anyone speaking English," 
Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Nolan were quick to dismiss suggestions that their campaign might 
be racially motivated. "I love my fellow human beings," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three area women -- an African American, a Korean American and a Spanish 
American -- were invited to speak in support of the legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take care of our own people first, before we go out and take care 
of people who are here illegally and who come to milk the system," said Celeste 
Greig, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors were quick to condemn the legislators' proposal as another effort 
to score points at the expense of a poor and politically powerless population. 
</P>
<P>
 An emergency "is not the time to be pulling this kind of stunt," said Angelo 
Ancheta, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the suggestions "mean-spirited," Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles) noted that the United States annually provides millions in disaster 
relief overseas. "How ironic that these legislators would turn their backs on 
people living on our own American soil, simply because it's the politically 
popular thing to do," Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal and state officials declined to embrace the Rohrabacher and 
Nolan proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hamlin, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
principal coordinator of disaster aid, declined to comment on the suggestion. 
But he noted that federal law currently prohibits officials from refusing 
disaster assistance because of citizenship or place of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who has charged that health and education benefits draw 
illegal immigrants to California, is nonetheless against excluding the 
undocumented from post-quake relief rolls, a spokesman said. "Clearly, 
earthquakes are not an incentive for people to come to California," said Kevin 
Eckery, the governor's press secretary.

COUNTY EXTENDS STATE OF EMERGENCY TO CUT RED TAPE; SUPERVISORS: SHERIFF BLOCK 
SEEKS PERMISSION TO LEASE SPACE FOR WORKERS DISPLACED BY CLOSURE OF HALL OF 
JUSTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Friday declared a continued 
state of emergency -- an administrative move that will give county officials 
wider authority to purchase supplies, make repairs and lease office space for 
employees displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen county structures -- among them the aging Downtown Hall of 
Justice -- remain closed because of earthquake damage, and scores of employees 
have been forced to double up at a time when demand for their services is at a 
record high. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block made a personal appeal for permission to lease space for 
the last 575 department personnel housed in the Hall of Justice, which served 
for years as the sheriff's headquarters. The Sheriff's Department is now 
headquartered in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said that because many of the department's computerized records and 
identification systems are locked up in the landmark building at Temple and 
Spring streets, "sex and narcotics offenders are not being registered, 
fingerprints are not being logged and . . . a whole range of law enforcement 
procedures are not getting done." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors agreed to provide temporary space for Block's personnel but 
postponed a decision on finding a permanent location for them.  
</P>
<P>
 The workers had been scheduled to move out of the Hall of Justice at the end 
of the year, but earthquake damage has speeded up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that it would cost about $80 million to refurbish the 
69-year-old building, which once housed such famous prisoners as Charles Manson 
in the jail that occupies the top floors. Some have suggested that it would be 
better to simply tear down the old building. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities took steps to quash a variety of scams that have sprung up in 
the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's bunco division assembled a unit to 
investigate quake-related fraud, federal investigators were sent to welfare 
offices to look for phony claims for emergency food stamps and state agents 
started posing as homeowners to catch contractors overcharging for earthquake 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stop "double-dipping," the federal Department of Agriculture 
approved a 72-hour waiting period for those applying for a one-time allocation 
of emergency food stamps. Previously, applicants had only to give proof of 
residence and declare that they met low-income requirements in order to receive 
the stamps immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our intent to hassle people who need food," said Dick Montoya of the 
USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. "But a few people are going to cheat, and 
we're trying to strike a balance." 
</P>

POST-QUAKE TOURISM IN L.A. IS A BIT SHAKY; IMAGE: BARELY RECOVERED FROM BAD 
PUBLICITY DURING THE RIOTS, THE INDUSTRY SCRAMBLES TO REASSURE TRAVELERS THAT 
METROPOLITAN AREA IS STILL STANDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Optimistic by nature and necessity, Los Angeles' tourism and convention 
industry already is putting its own spin on last week's deadly earthquake, 
combatting stark media images of wrecked freeways and tent cities with a global 
blitz of feel-good faxes and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear in tourism circles is that news stories and television pictures of 
yet another Southern California disaster could cause more damage than the quake 
itself to an industry worth an estimated $8.25 billion a year to Los Angeles 
County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of disconcerting when you get calls from Germany, Russia and 
Britain saying, 'Should we cancel our trip?' and 'Do you have any hotels still 
standing?' " said Bill Boyd, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce in 
Beverly Hills, where quake damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to stamp out such scorched-earth scenarios, the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau -- still recovering from the 1992 riots -- has 
contacted 25,000 international travel agents to assure them that most of the 
metropolitan area remains in good shape. Additionally, the bureau has invited 
15 national meeting planners into the area to let them see for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a visit is worth a thousand 
pictures," said Michael Collins, the bureau's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late to help the four-day California Gift Show at the 
Convention Center, which wrapped up this week, an extravaganza normally counted 
on to bring in 12% of the facility's annual revenue. After the quake, about 5% 
of the exhibitors canceled -- part of the reason the Convention and Visitors 
Bureau this week projected $308 million in lost business because of the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Film Marketing Assn., scrambling to make sure the same -- or 
worse -- doesn't happen to its annual film market in Santa Monica next month, 
faxed 6,000 film producers and distributors in 66 countries a memo -- "We're 
Alright!" -- that proclaimed hotels and movie theaters essentially unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to let you know it was a bumpy ride, but Santa Monica survived the 
Northridge earthquake with flying colors," the fax chirped, neglecting to 
mention that Santa Monica was actually one of the hardest-hit communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recorded message on a Los Angeles visitors hot line takes a similarly breezy 
tone, noting that access from Los Angeles International Airport to points east 
is "not a problem" and that "all major attractions remain open."  
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials, in turn, sent out a fax to travel agents to report: 
"Disneyland Resort unaffected by recent earthquake; business and fun as usual 
in Orange County." Those who depend on tourism and convention business insist 
that they are not seeking to minimize the quake's devastation, but rather to 
counter unfounded perceptions of a metropolis eternally burning and traumatized 
from fires, floods, riots and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really took the offensive on this," said Tim Kittleson, vice president of 
the film marketing association. "If people sit there and don't hear from you, 
they start to think, 'Is anything still standing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kittleson and others also must cope with the fact that apocalyptic images and 
rumors spread with surprising ease along the information superhighway -- and 
key distinctions, such as Santa Clarita's relatively remote location, may be 
lost on people in Egypt or Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, tourism officials dread TV's relentless portrayals of the 
worst pockets of disaster, which may encourage foreign news organizations to 
hype the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hope the media, especially the Japanese media, doesn't exaggerate 
the circumstances right now," said Shiro Monden, general manager of Japan 
Travel Bureau. "Japanese people are worried about fires and bridges collapsing 
in Downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 A consoling factor for tourism officials is the timing of the quake -- during 
the off-season, improving the chances that travelers will forget about it by 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the temblor struck just as the eastern half of the nation was crippled 
by a killer cold snap, making it easy for spin masters to crow about Southern 
California's fabled weather while noting that no region of the world is immune 
from natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the quake may have done nothing more than confirm what people already 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody realizes that this is an earthquake city, but it's not the only 
destination in the world where you have earthquakes," said Patrick Schoeneborn, 
vice president of Go America Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind such rosy outlooks lurk concerns that the quake will make it 
tougher than ever to woo visitors -- at a time when business was finally 
improving after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Travel Bureau said the number of Japanese tourists coming to Los 
Angeles dipped to 80,000 in 1992 as a result of the riots, down from 106,000 
the year before, a drop of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 The number crept upward last year, approaching the 100,000 mark, and observers 
say tourism throughout Southern California had begun a slow but steady 
recovery. Last week's quake could put the industry back to square one, however, 
forcing it to overcome images of four-hour traffic jams in addition to the 
unending assortment of crime and gang news. 
</P>
<P>
 One fear is that even locals will be intimidated by the crippled 
transportation system and stop day-tripping, a worrisome notion in places like 
Venice Beach, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to go through the hassle," said Hwan Song, chairman of the 
180-member Venice Beach Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tourism industry is nothing if not resilient, and at least one tour 
operator is hopeful he can turn the temblor to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Michael Fawcett of Insider Tours, which offers such offbeat excursions 
as "Marilyn Monroe's Los Angeles" and a "Historical Tour of Venice." He 
anticipates some visitors will want to see the quake damage firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for me," he said, "to accommodate them."

TOUGHER SEISMIC LAWS URGED FOR HOSPITALS; SAFETY: MEDICAL PERSONNEL SUPPORT 
PROPOSED MEASURE TO REQUIRE THAT OLDER BUILDINGS BE REINFORCED TO MEET CURRENT 
REGULATIONS. 
</P>

 Nurse Cathy Carder, who was on duty in the critical care unit at Santa Monica 
Hospital Medical Center when the Northridge earthquake hit, doesn't believe she 
will ever forget the terror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with the shaking, I could hear people yelling, things falling and 
crashing. . . . The elevators weren't working, water was pouring (through the 
ceiling), we had no telephone service . . . we smelled leaking gas." 
</P>
<P>
 She and other nurses managed to evacuate all the critical patients, using hand 
pumps to keep the respirators going when the power went out, or stayed with 
them in the quake-damaged building until help arrived. "We definitely were in 
fear for our lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carder believes that she and the patients were lucky. So do a lot of other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid a replay, she joined hospital officials, doctors, and other 
nurses at a news conference Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in support of 
legislation to toughen the earthquake safety laws that affect hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the legislation was made by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles), the chairman of the Assembly Health Committee who will carry 
the bill. Margolin said the bill, which could encounter strong resistance in 
the Legislature, would require older hospitals to meet the same stringent 
requirements demanded of hospitals built after 1973, when seismic safety 
legislation was passed in the aftermath of the Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference was held at Cedars-Sinai because its experience was 
typical of the way other hospitals fared. Newer buildings held up, older ones 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A key feature would be the requirement that older hospitals undergo 
retrofitting to make them as strong as hospitals built after 1973. Margolin 
said he wants a time limit set, possibly 10 or 15 years after the law is 
passed, requiring hospitals either to retrofit or close. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, a Democrat who is running for state insurance commissioner, said he 
will ask the Legislature to require more frequent inspections by state safety 
engineers and tougher standards for mechanical systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Mechanical system failures that crippled hospitals last week included ruptured 
water pipes, breaks in oxygen lines, equipment that was pulled up from the 
floor when bolts broke off, and generators that did not work properly. In some 
cases, state safety inspectors said damage could have been avoided by adding an 
extra bolt to fasten a piece of equipment to a floor or wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, hospitals have successfully fought moves to require retrofitting, 
largely based on the issue of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But Margolin believes that the Legislature may be ready to reconsider because 
of the Northridge quake, during which some hospitals, such as Cedars-Sinai, 
came through in relatively good shape while others had to evacuate patients and 
face condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said hospitals support the intent of Margolin's legislation. But Langness said 
retrofitting is extremely expensive and that hospitals would ask the 
Legislature to help pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Langness conceded the effectiveness of the 1973 law. He noted that during the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake, four hospitals collapsed, killing 52 people when walls 
fell on them. This time, there were no confirmed hospital deaths directly 
linked to structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1973 standards "saved lives and made a huge difference in the way the 
health care community responded to this disaster," Langness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there was a huge toll on services this time. Twelve hospitals were 
forced to either close or sharply curtail patient services because of 
earthquake damage. More than 900 patients were transferred from quake-damaged 
hospitals. Overall, more than 2,500 beds were lost, at least temporarily.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Corlin, a physician who practiced at St. Johns Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica, described the experience of one patient who was 
undergoing coronary bypass surgery when the quake struck. Corlin said the 
patient had been anesthetized and was unconscious when he was moved by 
ambulance from St. Johns to UCLA Medical Center. Surgeons successfully 
completed the operation at UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 "The patient was anesthetized at St. Johns," Corlin said, "and woke up at 
UCLA."

2-YEAR-OLD IS FIRST TO FALL IN GANG RAMPAGE; VIOLENCE: SHOTS HIT GIRL WHOSE 
MOTHER WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND. FOUR MORE WERE KILLED OVER TWO DAYS IN 
INGLEWOOD.

 When a loud rumbling woke him up, Inglewood resident Yarbrough Morrow assumed 
it was an earthquake. Moments later, when he saw his daughter and 2-year-old 
granddaughter stumble bleeding through the front door, Morrow realized that the 
sound had come from a far deadlier Los Angeles phenomenon: gunfire in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up yelling, 'Get the baby! Get the baby!' because I thought it was an 
earthquake," Morrow, 47, said Friday. "Then my daughter came in the house 
yelling, "Daddy, Daddy, I've been shot!' Then the baby fell down on the floor, 
and she was bleeding. Lord, I wish it had been an earthquake. How could anybody 
ever want to hurt that little girl?" 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow's granddaughter, Kyiara Nicole Morrow-Jackson, died after she was hit 
in the chest by one of more than a dozen shots fired by three men, believed to 
be gang members, who drove up in front of the Morrows' home on West 78th Street 
while her mother, Gina Morrow, 23, was outside talking with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the men apparently mistook the friend for a rival gang member 
because he was wearing a red shirt. Gina Morrow was wounded in the hip in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the opening casualties in an orgy of gang violence that swept this 
city of 112,000 on Wednesday and Thursday nights, which Inglewood Mayor Edward 
Vincent called "two of the most violent nights in this city's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Five people were killed, including 14-year-old Tila Lashay French, who police 
said was chased down by two suspected gang members on North Eucalyptus Avenue 
and riddled with bullets. Six people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were bystanders with no gang connections, leading 
Inglewood Police Chief Oliver Thompson to suggest at a news conference Friday 
that it would be appropriate for Inglewood residents to remain in their homes 
after dark so they do not get caught up in gang cross-fire. Vincent said he 
will ask the Inglewood City Council to set up a $15,000 reward for information 
on the shootings. No suspects have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarbrough Morrow and his wife Betty, 44, who have lived on their quiet, 
tree-lined block for two decades, said that gang violence was never a problem 
for them -- until their only granddaughter was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20 years, we never had any trouble here," Betty Morrow said Friday. 
"There's no graffiti, no fights, nothing. I don't know why it happened. I just 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen them before," Gina Morrow said Friday. "I was just standing 
there talking with my friend, and they pulled up in a gray Cadillac and got out 
and said: 'What's up, cuz?' to my friend. Then they started shooting. I grabbed 
my daughter and started running, and I knew I'd gotten hit. My leg was numb, 
but I thought it was just me. Then when I got inside I opened up her jacket and 
I saw the gunshot wound, and I was saying, 'Hold on, Kyiara, hold on, hold on.' 
And she said, 'Mama' to me, 'Mama, Mama,' and then she was just fading away, 
fading away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyiara died at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. Police said neither 
Gina Morrow nor her friend has gang connections. 
</P>
<P>
 A steady stream of well-wishers visited the Morrow home Friday, some of them 
relatives, some friends, some strangers who were moved and angered by the 
Morrows' tragedy. One was Cynthia Taylor, who said her 3-year-old grandson was 
killed when a stray bullet hit him two years ago at the Nickerson Gardens 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several others, Taylor noted how much money is now being spent helping 
earthquake victims. Although she said she understands the need for such 
assistance, Taylor added: "They ought to take a little of that money and use it 
to stop the crime. Parents are suffering. Little children are suffering. It's 
got to stop."

STAFF MISCONDUCT ALLEGED AT S. PASADENA PRIVATE SCHOOL; EDUCATION: AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATING CLAIMS OF ABUSE, GIVE FEW DETAILS. PARENTS ASSAIL POLICE TACTICS; 
SCHOOL DENIES WRONGDOING. 
</P>

<P>
 Authorities said Friday that they are investigating allegations of misconduct 
-- including alleged physical, sexual and emotional abuse -- by staff members 
at a small private elementary and junior high school in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a multi-victim, multi-suspect, multi-allegation investigation," said 
Lt. Stuart Heller of the Sheriff's Department Juvenile Investigation Bureau. 
"Based on the allegations made, there is a potential of serious misconduct 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Police Chief Thomas E. Mahoney said the investigation involves 
current and former students at the 130-student Stancliff School, a small campus 
of stucco buildings squeezed between railroad tracks and an apartment building 
on Arroyo Verde Road at the west end of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Stancliff officials denied wrongdoing and have pledged to cooperate with 
authorities. In a letter to parents Friday, Principal Judith Thayer urged 
parents to make their children available to investigators. No arrests have been 
made and the school remains open, although about one-quarter of the students 
were absent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that the truth will be told and that (the) allegations will 
ultimately prove to be utterly false," Thayer said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not provide details of the alleged abuse or indicate the number 
of alleged victims, saying the investigation was too sensitive and too 
preliminary. In a separate letter to parents, Mahoney said authorities are 
trying to "sort fact from rumor" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Stancliff owner Cleo Thayer, who turned over operation of the school to her 
daughter about 10 years ago, said she was hurt and outraged by the allegations 
and what she described as "Waco-like" police tactics. Several dozen police 
officers, some from as far as Culver City and Covina, served a search warrant 
at the school Thursday afternoon, confiscating files and interviewing students 
and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't even told us what it is all about," said Thayer, 76, who has 
owned the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school for more than 30 years. "I 
am just sorry for the parents who have such faith in us. You know how much 
damage can be done until the truth prevails." 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief tour of the cramped campus, which sits behind an 
eight-foot-high fence and electric gate, Cleo Thayer said the school is too 
small for any abuse to occur unnoticed. "If there is a place you could find to 
do something wrong, I would like them to find it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several angry parents gathered outside the school Friday to voice their 
support for the Thayers and the school's dozen teachers. Some parents 
complained that their children were interviewed behind their backs during a 
meeting called by police for parents, while others said their children were 
afraid to return to school because of Thursday's police activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son was terrorized -- by the police," said Lila Holman. "He said commandos 
came into the school. I had to stay up all night with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Police defended their tactics, saying they were following a countywide 
protocol for investigating child abuse allegations established after the 
McMartin PreSchool case in the late 1980s. Under the protocol, South Pasadena 
police sought the assistance of several other law enforcement agencies and 
interviewers were given limited information about the allegations so as not to 
ask leading questions of the children, Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do empathize with the parents," Mahoney said. "Their anger is 
directed at us right now. There is some truth to what they say happens to the 
messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, the state Department of Social Services cited Stancliff 
on Thursday for accepting preschool-age children without a license. In a 
2-month-old dispute with the agency, Stancliff has argued that its 3- and 
4-year-olds are enrolled in kindergarten, not preschool, but state officials 
ruled against the school two weeks ago.

MCDONALD'S TO SHUT '50S-ERA DOWNEY EATERY; ARCHITECTURE: LANDMARK SITE HAD BEEN 
THE FOCAL POINT OF PRESERVATIONISTS. OFFICIALS SAY A SIMILAR RESTAURANT WILL BE 
BUILT ELSEWHERE.

 McDonald's officials Friday announced that they have closed a popular 
1950s-era restaurant in Downey that residents and fans had been fighting to 
preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 Famous for "Speedee," its familiar winking chef, and its golden arches, the 
restaurant has been closed since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials said they plan to build a facility at elsewhere in Downey 
in the same architectural style as the old restaurant. The new facility is to 
preserve many of the elements of the old McDonald's, including the 60-foot-high 
Speedee sign, company spokesman Kevin Mazzu said. However, it will have 
conveniences lacking in the old restaurant, including a drive-up window and 
indoor seating. 
</P>
<P>
 He said officials have not selected a site for the new restaurant and do not 
know when it will open. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime fans and historical preservationists said they feared a permanent 
closure after McDonald's workers posted signs indicating that the restaurant 
had closed because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzu said that the extent of quake damage has not been determined, but that 
the restaurant had been closed to protect the safety of workers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a history of structural damage," he said. "The feeling was that the 
old restaurant had been declining for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders and historical buffs, who have held rallies and 
burger-eating campaigns to preserve the 41-year-old fast-food stand, were 
stunned by the McDonald's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Replicating history is not preserving history," said Gregg Davidson, 
associate director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, which has fought to preserve 
the site. "They have to understand that whether it's the White House or a Frank 
Lloyd Wright home, tearing it down and replicating it is not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it had fallen on hard times, the McDonald's for many has symbolized a 
golden era, said City Councilwoman Joyce L. Lawrence. When she was elected to 
the council two years ago, Lawrence spearheaded a campaign to preserve the 
stand. She even wrote an ode, urging McDonald's officials:

 "Do not take our youth away!/Here we met for shakes and fries/while Downey 
grew 'neath sunny skies."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SELLING THE 6.6; AMID THE RUBBLE, SOME TURN THE 
SHAKER INTO A MONEYMAKER 
</P>

 Call it the Rubble Rush of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Gold Rush that lured prospectors to California in 1849, 
fortune-hunters are hoping to strike it rich on the collapsed structures and 
frazzled emotions of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 From T-shirt hawkers selling a sense of survival only blocks away from San 
Fernando Valley death traps to Hollywood collectors marketing "Genuine 
Celebrity Earthquake Ruins," there seems to be no limit to these shaky 
entrepreneurial ventures -- which also include earthquake menus, earthquake 
haircuts and even a "no quake cake." 
</P>
<P>
 "They sell so good it's sickening," said Ricardo, who took the red-eye from 
Miami last Friday to peddle shirts in Granada Hills. With a map of the Valley 
and the slogan "I Survived the Great California Earthquake" printed on each 
shirt, the grizzled vendor was quickly raking in $10 a shirt. A veteran of the 
trade, his last lucky break was Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 How many people are rushing to profit from the disaster? There is no official 
count, but one shirt wholesaler alone -- Shirtique of San Francisco -- says 
it's cranking out shirts for 40 vendors working the corners of Los Angeles. And 
vendors say there will soon be even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Super Bowl ends, the vendors will be all over here," said 
70-year-old Bob of Garden Grove, working the same corner as Ricardo on Tuesday. 
"They'll come from New York, Boston, Michigan, all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the vendors will not give their full names (since they do not carry 
the appropriate business licenses), but they freely admit their intentions: to 
make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, perhaps, many Southern Californians who have been affected by 
the quake seem to admire, rather than resent, their attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts some humor in the quake," said Mike Madelon of Canoga Park, who has 
bought six shirts. "It's like going to Magic Mountain and buying a T-shirt 
saying, 'I Survived the Colossus.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Barber Mike Dimente agrees that humor -- and a soothing haircut -- is the best 
medicine for quake jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 In red lettering on a board that replaced a shattered barbershop window, he 
scrawled "Shake and Haircut, Two Bricks" -- a play on the old jingle, "Shave 
and a haircut, two bits." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it would make a few people smile and forget their scary 
experience," said Dimente, who works at Archie's of Hollywood in Studio City. 
"Actually, we had somebody come in with two bricks. We honored it because he 
was one of our regular customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have found that security sells better than humor, such as 
Russell/Packard Development Inc., which is taking orders for steel-framed 
houses in a 140-home tract in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company does not market the homes as earthquake-proof, the 
response to newspaper ads since the Northridge quake indicates that many people 
simply do not feel safe in their brick or wood-frame homes anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phones have been ringing off the hook from people who want us to build 
the houses in Hawaii and people who want us to build the houses in Sherman 
Oaks," said spokeswoman Irene James. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who find themselves trying to eat away their quake-caused anxieties, 
Pam Bono created an appropriate face-stuffer: the double chocolate "no quake 
cake" with a yellow circle and slash through the word earthquake . 
</P>
<P>
 "You need chocolate during times of trouble," said Bono, a baker for Vons 
Pavilions in West Hills. She sold all two dozen of the $3.95 cakes in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no more cakes are being made, Vons spokeswoman Julie Reynolds said it 
was not a matter of halting production because they were in bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they taste great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cakes were not the only earthquake-themed munchies in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At Il Tiramisu in Studio City, a new earthquake menu features "shake, rattle 
and roll" pasta, a traditional Italian dinner discounted to $7 for 
quake-rattled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 To work off any extra pounds caused by quake-related overeating, personal 
trainer Michelle Hazlewood is offering 10 sessions at a special earthquake 
discount of 50%, or $275. Actually, she said, she does not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm out of work," said the 29-year-old mother of two from West 
Hills. "I usually go to my clients' homes, but my clients aren't in their homes 
anymore because they're condemned or they're yellow-tagged and they don't want 
to risk me coming over." 
</P>
<P>
 Other enterprising efforts offer ways to contribute directly to earthquake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Hospital Medical Center -- located almost exactly atop the 
epicenter -- is selling a $10 shirt that crosses out "Medical Center" with a 
seismic wave and replaces it with "EpiCenter." All money from the sale goes to 
help the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a limit to what these entrepreneurs can sell? At Baby Jane of 
Hollywood, a movie memorabilia shop in West Hollywood, owners Charles Moniz and 
Roy Windham used their Hollywood contacts to scrounge up quake rubble tossed 
from celebrity homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices -- half going to the purchaser's quake charity of choice -- range from 
$10 for scraps of a wall from Jimmy Stewart's house to $1,500 for a slightly 
damaged lamp from Barbra Streisand's. 
</P>
<P>
 But Windham admits that there are some quake items that even a celebrity 
cannot sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen some rubble we decided to pass on," said Windham. "I won't say 
who it's from, but it was a broken toilet. We're not going to be that tacky."

ILLEGAL HUNTING RING BROKEN, OFFICIALS SAY; WILDLIFE: ARREST IS MADE IN L.A. 
STATE AUTHORITIES SAY THE GROUP SOLD $600,000 IN BEAR GALLBLADDERS TO ASIAN 
BUYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State wildlife officials said the arrest on Friday of a Korean American 
businessman in Los Angeles has broken up an illegal hunting and trafficking 
operation that they believe marketed coveted body parts of California black 
bears to buyers in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunting group, based in Los Angeles, allegedly arranged illegal guided 
tours in which at least 30 bears in remote forests of Northern California were 
killed since November, officials said. The bears' gallbladders were sold in Los 
Angeles and in South Korea, bringing in as much as $600,000, game wardens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this case is so significant is that it is the first time we have 
solid evidence that people are being solicited from outside this country to 
come to California and kill bears illegally. We suspected it in the past, and 
now we have evidence," said Greg Laret, deputy chief of wildlife protection at 
the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they expect to arrest about 20 other people throughout the 
state as a result of Operation Asian Ursus, a five-month undercover 
investigation by state Fish and Game authorities and the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Asian crimes task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Poaching of American black bears to sell their gallbladders is considered a 
multimillion-dollar business throughout the West, especially in California, 
Washington and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallbladders -- used by Korean, Chinese and Japanese apothecaries as a 
medicine to treat human stomach ailments and blood diseases -- are valuable 
commodities because bears are nearly extinct in Asia. State Fish and Game Lt. 
Eddie Watkins said each gallbladder sells for $2,000 to $5,000 in California 
and $20,000 to $100,000 in Asia. Bear paws and other parts also are popular as 
Asian delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say illegal bear hunting appeared to slack off in 
California in 1988 after an earlier Fish and Game investigation led to the 
arrests of 75 people. But with this new case, it seems to be on the upswing 
again.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrested Friday was William Jin Taek Lee, 35, president of Come Land 
Maintenance Co., a janitorial service on Melrose Avenue that also served as 
headquarters of the hunting organization, known as the Ace Hunting Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was charged with four felony counts -- conspiracy to commit illegal guided 
hunting, sale of bear and two counts of offering to sell bear parts. He 
declined to comment to reporters as LAPD officers handcuffed him at his office 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said Lee advertised guided bear hunts in newspapers in Korea and in 
Asian communities in California and solicited customers at the Western Gun Shop 
on Western Avenue in Los Angeles. The customers paid $1,500 each, and they and 
the guides allegedly killed bears near Redding and Yreka without valid hunting 
licenses.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on the going price for bear gallbladders, Fish and Game officials 
estimate that $600,000 could have exchanged hands at the Ace Hunting Club in 
its few months of operation. But Watkins said investigators suspect the profits 
could have been much higher. They say two or three times more bears may have 
been killed than the 30 cited by officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said undercover agents believe Lee also planned to expand his hunts to 
Washington, Alaska and Africa this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very large operation," Watkins said. "I think we're really fortunate 
to catch him in his first year. . . . I think we got him just in time. His 
business was growing." 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD undercover agent posing as an Asian buyer had arranged to meet Lee on 
Friday morning and pay him $2,000 for a gallbladder. But when the agent arrived 
at Lee's office, Lee allegedly told him it had already been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's arrest was based instead on other evidence, including an alleged $1,800 
sale of a bear gallbladder to the same undercover agent three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the arrest, two automatic rifles and two altered rifles were 
confiscated from the gun store, and an envelope containing $9,000 in cash was 
seized from Lee's house in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 No bear gallbladders or other animal parts were seized Friday, although Lee's 
office contained numerous trophies of his hunts, including a large black 
bearskin draped on the wall, an elk head, a wild pig head and a gray fox fur. 
His office vault held about a dozen rifles and several handguns, as well as 
many boxes of ammunition. Photos on a bulletin board portrayed Lee and other 
men in a forested area with dead bears and other animals. At his home, bear 
meat was found in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear hunting is allowed in California with a valid license and under strict 
conditions. But it is a felony to sell any bear parts and a misdemeanor to 
violate state hunting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said records seized Friday could give investigators the identities of 
Lee's hunting guides and customers. A warrant has been issued for one hunter in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning of the end with these search warrants served 
today," he said. "I suspect we may have as many as 20 misdemeanor counts on 20 
different people once we go through those records and discover who the other 
violators were." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. Brodney said Friday that he 
plans to seek stiff fines and jail time for Lee. Maximum penalty for each 
felony is a $5,000 fine and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juries do not like people who harm wildlife. In this day and age, people are 
becoming so aware of the need to protect our resources," Brodney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, the illegal animal trade is estimated at $2 billion a year, 
including $100 million a year in California. Federal and state wildlife wardens 
say wildlife trafficking is increasingly well organized and often connected 
with narcotics and weapons dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California's population of 17,000 to 24,000 black bears is considered 
thriving, unrestrained poaching and trade could eventually devastate the 
species, as has happened to other creatures throughout the world, from 
elephants to abalone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a healthy bear population in California, but this is a significant 
illegal activity," said Boyd Gibbons, director of the state Department of Fish 
and Game. "If this is a huge moneymaker, as we hear it is, it could do quite a 
lot of damage. Money talks."

SURFERS STAGE A 'PADDLE OUT' PROTEST OVER SEAWALL PLAN IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shelley Merrick, an avid surfer for more than 38 years, yanked on her wet suit 
and scowled at the bulldozer out on the jetty off Greenock Lane in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're putting an unnatural thing out there," Merrick said. "You have to be 
very careful what you put in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Merrick and about a dozen surfers paddled out into the water to 
protest the city's planned construction of a 100-foot groin extension that 
surfers say will destroy a prime surfing spot just up the coast from Marina 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers said the extension, to be built 400 feet out to sea and will 
ultimately resemble a lopsided 't', is the latest assault on the coastline by 
misguided public officials. They said the rock groin will not halt beach 
erosion as proposed, but instead simply shift the problem to another location 
down the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hovered by anxiously as surfers began gathering at Marina Park 
on Friday afternoon to hold a "paddle out" protest at the jetty, which 
officials believe will help prevent beach erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should help us build back the beach," said Mark Watkins, a senior 
construction engineer. "As long as they just paddle around, it should be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick said surfers knew they could not change city officials' minds or stop 
the project, but wanted to stage a public protest to inform residents about the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which was sponsored by the local chapter of the Surfrider 
Foundation, was a "protest to build public awareness of the coastline and to 
remind people not to sit back idly while it's destroyed bit by bit," said 
Merrick, who works for Patagonia, one of Ventura's most environmentally 
conscious companies. 
</P>
<P>
 While construction crews operated the bulldozer and excavator on the groin, 
the surfers bobbed in the water until a good wave came along. The paddle-out 
protest soon dissolved into a surfing session, with the demonstrators taking 
advantage of a west swell from this week's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies from city-hired consultants show the 100-foot extension would help 
stabilize the beach and will not have a significant environmental impact on the 
area, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But surfers say there is no evidence that the jetty will halt beach erosion, 
and they are also upset about the disruption of a well-known surfing spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one place that breaks year round," said Larry Manson, a Ventura 
College history instructor who has surfed for 32 years. "People come here when 
there aren't breaks any place else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfrider Foundation, a group of ecologically minded surfers, has objected 
to the project from the beginning. They were unsuccessful in halting the 
project, but got city officials to agree to monitor the effects of sand 
movements around the groin, said Everett Millais, city community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the extended groin will halt some sand from collecting in 
the mouth of nearby Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the sand to stay on the beaches," Watkins said. "This has been a 
problem for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction of the extension, which began this week, is scheduled to be 
finished in mid-March, said Marquita Ellias, a city engineer. If the crews are 
not finished by mid-March, however, the project will be halted and finished in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gotta be out of there because the grunion will be running then," Ellias 
said. "They don't want to disturb the grunion." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Surfriders Foundation lost a similar battle with Ventura Harbor 
officials over a 650-foot groin that was constructed on the beach south of the 
harbor. Surfers said the rock seawall would create beach erosion and destroy a 
top surfing area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 20 years, there has been a pattern of a loss of surf spots in 
California," Manson mourned. "What we see is a tremendous armoring of the 
California coast. We shouldn't interfere with natural processes; we can't 
manage the ocean."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 'OLD HOME WEEK' FOR A WORLDWIDE RELIEF WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months ago he was half-way around the world trying to get food and 
supplies to 50,000 Bosnian refugees living in Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only miles from his home in Oak View, American Red Cross delegate 
Francois (Pancho) de la Roche is supervising the distribution of food and 
supplies to earthquake victims in Fillmore and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it's Ecuador or Ojai, Armenia or Oxnard, the 42-year-old 
international relief coordinator still enjoys the rewards of working a 
disaster, namely, the personal satisfaction of helping someone in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like old home week," de la Roche said of his return to the 
Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross, where he was assistant director for 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I ever worked for the Red Cross I was a senior in high school 
and I was in Ojai for the '68-'69 floods and I sandbagged," de la Roche said. 
"Then we got taken to a Red Cross shelter and I remember getting some real good 
sandwiches and some hot cocoa!" 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning, he said while gnawing on another Red Cross sandwich, 
of a five-year adventure across Africa and Europe working with various 
international relief organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 de la Roche left the county chapter to become the logistics officer 
for CARE in Khartoum, Sudan, a job that was eventually terminated by the 
outbreak of the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, he was appointed head of the American Red Cross operation 
in Armenia and subsequently the Red Cross delegate to the International 
Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies, which was building and staffing 
a hospital to treat Armenian earthquake victims with spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Armenia, de la Roche was sent to neighboring Georgia to 
simultaneously head relief efforts after a devastating earthquake in the 
Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was off to direct relief operations in Guinea in West Africa, where he 
lived about a mile away from the Liberian war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how life has been for de la Roche -- moving from one disaster to 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 17 he left Slovenia and returned to Ventura County to spend Christmas 
with his family and find a new job. Exactly one month after his arrival home, 
de la Roche was in the midst of another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Jan. 17, de la Roche called the county Red Cross office and 
volunteered his services. He was immediately made mass care supervisor, 
responsible for the county's shelters and food and supplies distribution -- 
"things I know how to do," de la Roche said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 While his years of experience have been valuable in managing this relief 
effort, which is the chapter's largest and most expensive, de la Roche said no 
two disasters are alike and each new situation demands different measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you're working very quickly because you have the supplies and equipment 
to prevent a loss of life and injury -- you've got the resources. You go up 
into North Africa and you're running a relief operation -- it's a whole 
different ballgame. No matter how fast you have food going out, you have people 
dying on you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job on this is fairly complex," he said of the Red Cross's response to 
last week's earthquake, pointing to the loss of transportation in some areas, 
the initial communication problems and the number of people affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a longtime resident of Ventura County, de la Roche said one of the 
differences between this and other disaster sites is "here I'm helping my 
neighbors; there I'm helping strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 De la Roche spent 10 months in Slovenia aiding Bosnian refugees before 
returning to his home in Oak View, where his wife and two daughters live. 
Although he said it was one of his favorite missions, it wasn't an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically they have lost all hope of returning to their homes," he said of 
the Bosnian refugees. "The news gets to them. They hear the shelling that is 
going on and what we see on CNN -- Sarajevo and all these other places that are 
going down -- they hear that so they've pretty much lost hope. Anything we can 
do to keep their spirits up is real important and that's become a very 
important aspect of our operation." 
</P>
<P>
 De la Roche said one of the high points of his assignment in Slovenia was 
seeing the excitement of the refugees when the International Federation was 
able to bring them oranges from Spain and wheat flour from America -- 
delicacies no longer accessible in their war-torn native country. 
</P>
<P>
 Being able to help people in need and bring them even a little joy, like an 
orange or a bag of flour, is the reason de la Roche has made disaster relief 
his career.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can wake up and look at myself in the mirror and say I'm really happy with 
who I am," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who thrive on this stuff. I have friends who are now in 
Bosnia who served in southern Sudan, Somalia, who even served some time in 
Angola during the civil war, and they like the shooting and all that. I've got 
other friends who go the opposite way and find a nice quiet little development 
project in a Third World country, no political turmoil, no nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And where does he fall? "Sort of in between." 
</P>
<P>
 De la Roche has witnessed several coup d'etats, slept mere miles from active 
war zones and wrestled with the bureaucratic politics of numerous nations. But 
in the end, it is being able to provide people assistance in a professional 
manner that keeps drawing him back to the world's disaster hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When disaster comes in here you tend to sacrifice your time with your family, 
your friends. Then you go back to your regular work, etc. That is the way I 
would prefer to deal with it. Be ready, when you're done, get doing other 
things that need to be done."

COUNTY'S DECEMBER JOBLESS RATE DROPS; UNEMPLOYMENT: THE DECLINE TO 7.6% IS 
ATTRIBUTED MORE TO PEOPLE LEAVING THE AREA OR GIVING UP ON HIRING PROSPECTS, 
NOT ON ANY ECONOMIC RISE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County's jobless rate dropped to 7.6% last month, down from 8.3% in 
November and 8.7% in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But economists attributed the decline more to residents leaving the county or 
giving up on the job market than to any significant improvement in the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jobless rate fell last month, the county actually lost 200 
non-farm jobs between November and December, according to a report issued 
Friday by the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary estimate of Ventura County's unemployment rate for all of 1993 
is 8.6%, state analysts say. A revised final estimate will be available in late 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 For December, the statewide unemployment rate was 8.3%, down a full point from 
the year before, the report stated. The U. S. unemployment rate for December, 
1993, was 6%, a decrease from the 7% of December, 1992, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ventura County, unemployment could be going back up in the wake of this 
month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobless benefit claims have shot up at the Simi Valley unemployment office 
since the Jan. 17 quake. Officials at the Ventura unemployment office reported 
only a slight rise in benefit claims after the temblor. But Pat Baldoni, a job 
service supervisor in the Simi Valley office, estimated that about 2,000 
residents have filed new benefit claims in the nine working days since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the poor economy of recent years, the Simi Valley office usually 
processes about 2,000 claims and 500 claim extensions in an entire month, 
Baldoni said. She said she expects that number to double or triple in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not people who are used to filing unemployment at all," she said, 
referring to workers who have found their workplace condemned due to quake 
damage. "They are so stunned and dazed when they come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of such claimants is Robin Vecchio, 27, of Simi Valley. A former 
saleswoman for Saks Fifth Avenue, she learned Wednesday that the Woodland Hills 
store where she worked for years received severe damage and will not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Vecchio filled out a claim form at the Simi Valley unemployment 
office. "I've always had jobs," said the mother of two toddlers. "The word 
unemployment never crossed my mind. But then it was like, how am I going to 
feed my children?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Vecchio lost her job, but her husband, a department manager at 
Bullock's in Sherman Oaks' Fashion Square, might also lose his. He is still 
waiting to hear whether his store will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, she said with a wavering smile, her parents live in Northridge, 
two miles from the quake's epicenter. While Vecchio and her husband try to put 
their lives back together, they are also helping her parents get their home in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really scared," she said. "We haven't been getting a lot of sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, Ventura County's economy was in bad shape. Only 900 
county residents found non-farm work between November and December, about the 
same as the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool of manufacturing jobs -- among the highest-paying jobs in the county 
-- decreased by 300 over the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail sector added 500 jobs between November and December, but many of 
those were temporary holiday jobs. And the increase was smaller than in most 
holiday seasons, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like much is improving at all," said Mark Schniepp, director 
of an economic forecasting group at UC Santa Barbara. "People are leaving the 
area or . . . becoming self-employed. But self-employed could mean they are 
making pots or something in their garage." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Goehring, from his seat on the economic front lines, would agree 
wholeheartedly. It has been nearly nine months since Goehring, 41, received his 
layoff notice from a Newbury Park aerospace company, and so far he has had no 
decent job offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, the economy may be getting better in a lot of other states, 
but not in California," Goehring said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Simi Valley, Goehring checks the job ads for production planners 
such as himself anywhere in the greater Los Angeles area. "It's amazing how 
they've downgraded the salary for what I do," he said indignantly, asserting 
that salaries are down 25% to 30% from what he made less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he would settle for even that. In fact, he said, he's considering 
applying for a temporary job with a company in San Dimas, just to bring in some 
money. "You know where the 210 freeway is?" he asks. "Well, it's at the other 
end of it. But hey, I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury, his girlfriend, Julie Smith, 44, joined him at the 
unemployment office Friday after the same Newbury Park firm laid her off from a 
quality control job in the latest round of furloughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very well thought of there, and she'd been with them nine years," he 
said after Smith had gone into a meeting for first-time claim-filers. "But it 
doesn't matter who you are. Years of service -- well, they just don't seem to 
count anymore."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SPILL IMPACT WORSE THAN FIRST FEARED; WILDLIFE: 
MOST SANTA CLARA RIVER CREATURES THAT DIE FROM OIL INGESTION OR HYPOTHERMIA MAY 
NEVER BE FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil spill in the Santa Clara River will have a more devastating effect on 
wildlife in the ecologically sensitive area than biologists will ever be able 
to document, state Department of Fish and Game officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, department officials raised the estimated amount of oil spilled 
from 168,000 gallons to 214,000 gallons after new studies showed that more oil 
was in the ruptured pipeline than officials initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although biologists have recovered only 65 oiled birds, reptiles and mammals, 
most of the creatures that die from the oil by ingestion or hypothermia will 
never be found, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many small birds such as finches, gnatcatchers, vireos and orioles that become 
contaminated with oil will fly off into the brush to die where their carcasses 
cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger animals such as birds of prey that feed on oiled fish or rodents or 
become tainted with oiled feathers often fly miles from the site before they 
are overcome with illness. Turtles, toads and lizards crawl under rocks when 
ill. And poisoned mice scurry off into the brush to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "This spill is having a greater effect on wildlife than the numbers (of dead 
animals) indicate," said Bob Schlichting, a spokesman for the Department of 
Fish and Game. "We may never get the numbers of all the affected birds. And 
even if they don't die outright, their reproduction may be affected when 
breeding season begins in February." 
</P>
<P>
 The endangered least Bell's vireo, for instance, nests within the 12- to 
15-mile stretch of the river east of Piru that was contaminated when an oil 
pipeline ruptured in Valencia during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the migratory vireos have not yet arrived from their winter habitat 
in the south, wildlife biologists fear the spill might harm the birds' food 
supplies and reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping now that we will have the oil cleaned up before they get here in 
March so there won't be any direct effects," Department of Fish and Game Capt. 
Roger Reese said. "But we are concerned about indirect effects such as 
contamination of the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
 The vireos feed on invertebrate insects, which could become toxic from oil 
residue in the soil, Reese said. Also, the oil contamination could reduce the 
quantity of food available for the birds and harm their populations for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't get all the oil," Reese said. "It's impossible." Reese said the 
department plans a complete natural resources damage assessment to study the 
effects on fish, birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only find a small percentage of those affected directly by the oil," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the wildlife, officials have retrieved 637 dead fish, including 
three endangered unarmored three-spined sticklebacks that also live and breed 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 54 oiled birds found, 27 are dead. The survivors may not live long, said 
Lloyd Kiff, director of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology and an 
expert on birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People rush to the rescue and spend tens of thousands of dollars saving those 
few individuals," he said. "But I'm told that almost none of those animals 
survive. The treatment makes the rescuers feel better than it does the birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiff said the oil-tainted stretch of the river has a thick population of 
wildlife because of its distance from populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very important stretch of river," Kiff said. "There is still 
ecological integrity to the riparian habitat there. Just look around Southern 
California and see how many rivers we have with any habitat left." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Department of Fish and Game elevated its spill estimate to 
214,000 gallons, Atlantic Richfield Co., the parent company of Four-Corners 
Pipeline, said it estimates the spill at only 172,000 gallons. That is an 
increase from early company estimates of 147,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein estimated that about 64,000 gallons of oil 
has been retrieved. But he said that does not mean that 150,000 gallons -- or 
108,000 gallons depending on the estimate -- remain in the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has been absorbed into the soil or evaporated," he said. But Arco will 
make every effort to see the river is cleaned up as much as possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have been cutting off vegetation just above the roots so it will grow 
back. They have washed some plants and have removed some soil. And the work 
will continue for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the oil has smeared a blackened ring around the willows along the banks, 
and clumps of oil remain in the watercress and other vegetation in the stream 
bed. Some isolated pools of the river still showed a heavy sheen. But oil is no 
longer floating on the moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiff and Reese agreed that the short-term loss of fish and wildlife is not as 
devastating as development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as bad as having it paved over with asphalt," Kiff said. "But it is 
very distressing. It happened at a most unfortunate place."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 12 
LOOTING CASES REPORTED IN CITY SINCE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in Santa Monica have reported 12 looting incidents since the Jan. 17 
earthquake, including two Thursday -- a burglary at a damaged apartment 
building and the arrest of two men walking on Wilshire Boulevard with armfuls 
of jewelry and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Two tenants Thursday reported television sets, office equipment and linens 
taken from a 42-unit apartment building on Euclid Street, Sgt. Gary Gallinot 
said.Residents Friday moved their belongings out of the building, which has 
been deemed unsafe for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake the building was boarded up. When the building was downgraded 
to "yellow tag," allowing entry for short periods, police who had been guarding 
it were reassigned. After the burglaries, officers supervised as tenants moved 
their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, two men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of burglary 
when they were seen walking along the 1800 block of Wilshire Boulevard carrying 
jewelry and cash, Gallinot said. Police believe the goods may have come from a 
damaged store.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NATIVE AMERICAN GROUP WILL MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County group devoted to helping students of Native American descent 
succeed in school will hold a public hearing Tuesday for interested parents and 
community residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which will be held at 7 p.m. at Sequoia Intermediate School in 
Newbury Park, will give parents an opportunity to learn more about the Ventura 
County Indian Education Consortium and to make suggestions for improving the 
group's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974, the consortium is a partnership among seven school districts 
that have the largest populations of Native American students in Ventura 
County: Conejo Valley Unified, Hueneme Elementary, Fillmore Unified, Oxnard 
Elementary, Oxnard Union High, Simi Valley Unified and Ventura Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the U.S. Department of Education, the program serves about 800 
children in kindergarten through 12th grade in the consortium's seven 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the education program received a $103,000 federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the consortium's mission is to teach Native American children about 
their heritage by holding special school programs on tribal culture and 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group's main goal is to ensure that students enrolled in the program 
succeed in school, said Floyd O. Beller, the consortium's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goal is to see all of our kids graduate from high school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, the group offers tutoring in various subjects to children of all 
ages and provides personal and academic counseling to high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the consortium or the public hearing, call Beller at 
the Ventura Unified School District office, 641-5000. MAIA DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake repairs have been completed at the Sports Arena, which will re-open 
tonight for a game between the Clippers and the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hagerman, manager of the building that has been closed since the Jan. 17 
earthquake, said he received the go-ahead to re-open Friday morning from city 
inspectors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, the damage was very minor," he said. "However, we wanted to make 
absolutely sure that the facility was 100% safe before we opened to the 
public."

GRAF MAKES IT FOUR IN A ROW WITH AUSTRALIAN OPEN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, back to her dominance of yore, blasted forehand winners at will 
to defeat Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-0, 6-2, Saturday to win her fourth 
Australian Open title. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who won her fourth consecutive Grand Slam title, finished the match in 
57 minutes. She lost only 12 points in the first set as she overwhelmed Sanchez 
Vicario, much to the delight of Graf's kazoo-tooting fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is the way that I'm playing, I don't care about the score or the 
length or whether it's a final or the first round," Graf said. "It's such a 
great feeling to be able to play that way." 
</P>
<P>
 It was her 15th Grand Slam title and her most overpowering performance in a 
Grand Slam final since defeating Natalia Zvereva, 6-0, 6-0, in 32 minutes at 
the 1988 French Open. She earned $322,000 with Saturday's victory; Sanchez 
Vicario got $161,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my fourth Grand Slam in a row and I'm pretty proud of it," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory made it 13 straight Grand Slam titles that have been won by Graf 
or Monica Seles, a streak stretching back to the 1990 U.S. Open. Seles, who had 
won the previous three Australian Open titles, is recovering from being stabbed 
in the back by a spectator last April in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Seles was injured, Graf has won all four of the Grand Slam tournaments 
that have been contested. She needed three sets to win the French Open and 
Wimbledon last year, and dropped six games to Helena Sukova while winning last 
year's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Graf was on the attack from the start. The 24-year-old German 
breezed through the first set in 24 minutes, finishing it with a powerful 
cross-court winner on a service return. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sanchez Vicario finally won a game early in the second set, she slammed a 
ball high in the air in celebration. But Graf soon finished out the match, 
pumping her left fist in the air after completing the match with a backhand 
passing shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud to finally make it into the final here, but it was not my 
day," said Sanchez Vicario, a 23-year-old Spaniard who had lost in the 
semifinals the previous three years. "I made a lot of errors and I didn't play 
well. My legs were not working today. I was late every time to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras -- trying to become the third man to win Wimbledon, the U.S. Open 
and the Australian Open consecutively -- plays Todd Martin Sunday for the men's 
title in an all-American final. The last triple was accomplished by Roy Emerson 
in 1964-65. Before that, Don Budge did it in 1937-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras has won both of his previous meetings with Martin, including a 
five-set victory at the 1992 U.S. Open. Sunday's match will be the first 
all-American final at the Australian Open since 1982, when Johan Kriek defeated 
Steve Denton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Courier, seeded third and ousted by Sampras in the semifinals, failed to 
become the first man to win three straight Australian Open titles since Emerson 
won five straight from 1963-67. But he now has a 2-9 career record against 
Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tough," Courier said. "He didn't make any mistakes."

CONTROLLING HER SPIN, ON AND OFF THE ICE; FIGURE SKATING: HARDING FOLLOWS HER 
TEARFUL ADMISSION WITH FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO SOFTEN HER IMAGE. U.S. FIGURE 
SKATING ASSN. EXPANDS ITS INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, at week's end, perhaps a forthright comparison to a three-ring circus is 
in order -- call it the spectacle of American women's figure skating, under the 
Portland Big Top. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the suburbs is Tonya Harding, for everyone to see, in an all-out public 
relations press to save her place on the U.S. Olympic figure skating team. On 
Friday she's smiling, she's playing, she's telling the country she's just 
ordinary folk, but can be a lady when she needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry this happened, you know . . . ," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown at the courthouse is glowering prosecutor Norman Frink, slipping down 
a hallway, banging shut his door and forging ahead, widening still further the 
already colossal investigation of Harding and the attack on rival skater Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be fools to be on an Olympic schedule!" he snaps to those who are 
growing impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter officials of U.S. Figure Skating Assn., enlisting their own Portland 
attorney to dive into the scandal, asking whether Harding's half-way mea culpa 
of a day earlier is enough to to bounce her from the team for violating the 
Olympic code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "The highest standards of ethical behavior and good sportsmanship" are the 
stated terms for their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, supporters hoisted a Go-For-The-Gold-Tonya banner at the Portland 
convention center. Before long, it was vandalized by egg throwers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games women's figure skating begins with a draw 
Feb. 21 for the order of performance. No skater can be replaced after that. It 
is possible, now, to conceive that the drama of Harding could stretch to then, 
if she chooses to make it so. 
</P>
<P>
 Her public appearances Friday indicated nothing to the contrary. Back on the 
ice at a suburban mall, she was cheered on by a crowd that has grown in size 
and enthusiasm. Rather than merely a couple of hundred fans who watched her 
practice earlier in the week, there were more than 2,000 on hand to shout their 
approval. A spoilsport who booed was escorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the support, Harding turned in a controlled, relaxed 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Portrayed so often lately as a hard-scrabble, self-absorbed woman, Harding 
tried to show a softer side. She arrived early, mixed and played with younger 
skaters, and then joined in the traditional birthday hazing of a 9-year-old. 
After others pulled the boy's skates off, Harding took hold of his feet and 
dragged him around on the ice playfully. Supporters by the hundreds applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really nice," birthday boy Chance Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she kept it up in a televised interview with the tabloid newsmagazine 
Inside Edition. It was taped earlier, but aired Friday. In it, Harding sobbed 
and then apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "What do you have to say to Kerrigan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding: "That I'm really sorry that this happened, you know. . . . I just 
hope that she can some day forgive me . . . and we can go back to being friends 
and teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "What would you like America to know about Tonya Harding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding: "I'm just like everybody else. . . . A lot of people put me down 
because I drive a truck. . . . Well, I like to drive trucks. . . . Yet, you 
know, I can still mingle with the best. . . . When I need to act like a lady, I 
can act like a lady." 
</P>
<P>
 The show declined to say whether Harding was paid for the interview, but 
agents for such programs have offered less important figures in the case many 
thousands of dollars for their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 This attempt at image softening followed a Thursday appearance before cameras 
in which Harding confessed that she had withheld knowledge of the crime. Yes, 
she said, she had learned of the plot against Kerrigan after the fact and did 
not tell authorities. And yes, contrary to her earlier statements, people 
around her were involved. But no, she did not hatch the scheme and knew nothing 
of it beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 As theater, it might have succeeded. It was Harding's maiden attempt to 
address the case, she did it with a deep show of emotion. It was also her first 
personal expressions of sorrow for pain caused Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 23-year-old skater might have done more harm than good to her hopes of 
staying on the Olympic team. Until that moment, the figure skating association 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee had nothing to hold against Harding except the 
arrest of her former husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they have her own admission that she withheld the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 After days of frustration over the pace of the Portland investigation and the 
utter lack of sympathy by law enforcement officials for Olympic deadlines, the 
association said it would take its own steps. First, it formed a five-member 
panel to weigh the case against the broadly worded code of conduct for Olympic 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Friday, the panel hired Portland attorney John Bennett to gather 
evidence. He joins at least 10 other lawyers who are actively engaged in the 
case in one way or another. A first meeting of the panel was scheduled for 
Tuesday and a second for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But any action against Harding would be subject to ratification and a possible 
hearing before the USOC Games Administration Committee, which by then will have 
control of the team rosters. Any decision unfavorable to the skater can be 
appealed to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was a first sign of serious pressure against Harding from the 
Kerrigan camp. While the Massachusetts skater continued her practice workouts, 
coach Mary Scotvold suggested Harding quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has never happened before in figure skating. There's just no precedent 
that I can even relate this to. I would probably say she would do herself some 
good to withdraw," Scotvold said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Portland prosecutors continued to amass evidence. On Friday, 
the district attorney issued subpoenas, marked secret, asking local television 
stations to produce videotape of anything broadcast with Harding speaking since 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan was struck on the leg and knocked out of the figure skating 
championships in Detroit on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding returned from the national competition -- which she won -- to 
Portland on Jan. 10, she told one local station she believed her former husband 
was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said. "I mean, why does someone want to discredit 
me? I just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 In her Thursday statement, Harding did not specify exactly when she learned of 
the plot, from whom or which of the men around her was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested four men, including her former husband, Jeff Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is widely reported to be bargaining with prosecutors for leniency in 
exchange for his testimony against Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News reported Friday that Gillooly would plead guilty next week to one 
count of racketeering and face up to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's New York Times said that Gillooly would face one year less in prison 
on the racketeering charge than he would face under the original charge of 
conspiracy to commit assault. 
</P>
<P>
 A plea agreement would only become final with a court appearance, the Times 
said. Gillooly is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. 
</P>

ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?; COMMISSIONER: ALL TAGLIABUE'S ROWDY FRIENDS 
ARE PEACEFUL AGAIN, SO ATTENTION IS TURNED TO THWARTING THE FIELD GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With peace having descended upon the NFL's business side, Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue announced Friday that he will be taking his next crusade to the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you ready for two-point conversions? 
</P>
<P>
 And one-point field goals? 
</P>
<P>
 A quarterback who wears a microphone? 
</P>
<P>
 How about kickoffs from the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from Tagliabue's remarks, expect at least two, if not all of those 
ideas to become rules in March at the league meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this off-season, we will finally be able to focus on the game itself," 
Tagliabue said with a smile during his annual state of the NFL address. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in several years, Tagliabue did not use this forum to 
discuss labor, television or even expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he focused on recommendations he will make to the league's 
competition committee in hopes of dealing with: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Downgrading the field goal and upgrading the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Field-goal kickers have gotten so good, we need to do something to balance it 
out," Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
 He says a two-point conversion after touchdowns, a rule that has made the 
college game more exciting, would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can go for a touchdown and get eight points, that will make you 
think again about going for a field goal and three points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he can only make recommendations to the league's competition 
committee in March, Tagliabue said conservative co-chairman Don Shula has 
agreed to discuss the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner and a powerful 
committee member, also supports the change, it has a good chance of passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue's other attack on field goals involves reducing the points awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners, he said, would like to give one point for field goals from inside 
the 20-yard line, two points for field goals between the 20 and 40 and three 
points for kicks longer than 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But other owners consider that to be penalizing a team for penetration. They 
want an opposite scale, with one point for a field goal of more than 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect Jones to recommend returning the ball to midfield after a missed 
field-goal attempt, no matter where the ball was kicked from. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is understood by many owners that kickoffs will be moved from the 35- 
to the 30-yard line, in hopes of increasing returns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The timing and pace of games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at several technological features, including the audibilizer," 
said Tagliabue, referring to a microphone that fits inside a quarterback's 
helmet and helps teammates hear his signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The audibilizer, developed in Newport Beach, was successfully tested last 
summer and will be tried again in the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue also said that a microphone could be developed that allows 
quarterbacks to communicate with their coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The major topic during Friday's question-and-answer session involved the 
league's neutrality in the flag flap here. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue explained why his office has not protested the flying of the Georgia 
state flag -- a part of which is the Confederate Stars and Bars -- outside the 
Georgia Dome before the Super Bowl. The flag is offensive to some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to a lot of people . . . many African-American leaders . . . and 
the one thing they had in common was the suggestion that we not interfere," 
Tagliabue said. "It is a state flag, and we're not a political issue here. The 
advice we received is to leave the flag issue to the people of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say anything would be counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why the league was active several years ago in protesting Arizona's 
refusal to honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday -- the NFL denied Phoenix a 
chance to host the Super Bowl -- Tagliabue said pro football was also avoiding 
local politics in that instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although players have been reluctant to protest the flag, local activists have 
been outspoken in their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Black journalists covering the event are also planning some form demonstration 
before the game, perhaps turning their back on the American flag when the 
national anthem is played.

MIKE DOWNEY: TONYA'S NOT IDEAL, BUT STILL BELONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Skategate is in full spin. The issue now is no longer What Tonya Knew, but 
rather When She Knew It. Questions include: (a) Do you blame a woman for being 
reluctant to rat on her husband? (b) Did Tonya rat on Jeff only so she could 
cut a deal before he ratted on her? (c) Do you wipe out 20 years of work 
because young Ms. Harding hung around with an astounding assortment of creeps? 
And (d) When Charles Barkley strikes a fellow Olympian with an elbow and abhors 
being a role model, how much of an ideal "Olympian" is he? 
</P>
<P>
 I'll hang with Harding a while longer. Let her skate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Jordan. Figure skating. Don't laugh. It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The thing I'll miss most about Howie Long not being inside the Raider 
locker room is the way everyone was unable to tell us apart. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I believe the Buffalo Bills have an excellent chance to win Super Bowl 
XXVIII if they hire people with batons to hit every Dallas Cowboy across the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hi, I'm Kathleen Sullivan! Remember me from the Winter Olympics? Remember 
my morning talk show? Now I'm pitching weight-loss products on TV! I don't 
think I'm fat. In fact, that guy from the L.A. Times thinks I look great. 
Nevertheless, thanks to new miracle Hefty Bag diet drink, pretty soon I'll be 
skinny as Diana Ross! Well, let's go get me weighed! Up I go, onto the scale! 
And holy cow! I've lost 28 pounds in 28 hours! Thanks, Hefty Bag! You'll be 
seeing even less of me later on!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drove around L.A. trying to find a movie theater playing "The Air Up 
There." Couldn't see the marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I now suspect Jeff Gillooly in the last two Leon Lett incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Struggling Davis Love III will win more of these golf tournaments as soon 
as the guy learns how to break 60. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Jordan. Evander Holyfield. Don't laugh. It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.J. Armstrong and Kenny Anderson are the East's starting guards in the NBA 
All-Star game. A year ago, I make the odds on that around a zillion-to-one 
against. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Well, it'll be the Bulls, Hawks, Cavaliers and Magic battling it out for 
the Eastern Conference title this season, due to massive chest injuries bound 
to be suffered by Patrick Ewing, John Starks and other Knicks who keep giving 
each other hi-sternums after baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attention, attendance attendants: 17,507 at Anaheim Arena to see the 
California Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Billy Crystal told me at a Clipper game two months ago that he didn't 
intend to host the Academy Awards again. See, this is where Billy and I are so 
different. I always figured he would tell me at the Academy Awards that he 
didn't intend to go to a Clipper game again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's really scary is, if Manning and Harper leave, the best basketball 
player in Los Angeles next season could be Harold Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hi, I'm Kathleen Sullivan! Remember me from my last weight-loss 
commercial? It's been one full week now and I'm full, too, from pounding down 
this delicious Hefty Bag diet drink! Well, let's go get me weighed! Up I go, 
onto the scale! And holy mackerel! I've lost 70 pounds in seven days! I look 
like a Number 2 pencil! Thanks, Hefty Bag! You'll be seeing even less of me 
later on!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the time Fox gets finished, the only person left at CBS to report sports 
will be Angela Lansbury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recommended reading: "Nothing But Net" (Hyperion, $22.95), a biography by 
Bill Walton with Gene Wojciechowski. Here's that jacket blurb: Best book about 
a redhead since Huckleberry Finn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Jordan. The English Channel. Don't laugh. It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I see where Scottie Pippen got busted for having a gun in his car. And you 
thought Jordan had a competition problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Forrest Gump" is one of the funniest books there is, and Tom Hanks one of 
the funniest actors there is. Therefore, I guess it's unimportant that in the 
book, Forrest Gump -- Alabama football player, Vietnam war hero, NASA 
astronaut, character who will be portrayed by Tom Hanks in the movie -- happens 
to go 6 feet 6, 240 pounds. I guess nobody knew Howie Long was available. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manute Bol, released. Poor guy is so down, he must feel 7 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why do Channel 4's news anchors talk during Fred Roggin's air time? He 
doesn't talk during theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- So help me, next time a newscast, sportscast or headline uses the phrase 
"On Thin Ice" about Tonya Harding again, I'm coming after them with an ice 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- My favorite Buffalo Bill is still Marvcus Patton. I can't say why, except 
Marvcus is the kind of name that seems to go with a Roman numeral. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Jordan. Alaska. Dog sleds. Don't laugh. It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And the ESPY award for longest, loudest, most ear-splitting promotional 
buildup goes to . . . Chris Berman, ESPN! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put this in a three-inch headline: Dumping Gatorade on Jimmy Johnson's head 
could be hazardous to the Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hi, I'm Kathleen Sullivan. I'm back for one more damn weigh-in. I've been 
guzzling this goo for two solid months now! I need solid food! I need some meat 
on my ribs! I need some ribs! I need onion rings! I need a Twinkie! Help me, 
people! OK, let's go get me weighed. Holy guacamole! I've lost 125 pounds! I 
only weighed 126 in the first place! How do you reverse this process?! What the 
hell do you people care what I weigh? Get away from me! Get outta my face! I'm 
melting! I'm melting!"

FAST START FINISHES THE PISTONS; PRO BASKETBALL: LAKERS TAKE A 32-POINT LEAD IN 
THE FIRST HALF, THEN HOLD ON TO BEAT DETROIT, 105-97. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers won Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Scratch that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers survived Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Survived the Detroit Pistons. Survived what would have been one of the most 
embarrassing losses in franchise history. Survived the fallout from fans and 
management, and not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we showed some ability to hang tough when things went the other 
way," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said after they turned a 32-point advantage in 
the second quarter into a six-point lead in the fourth, then won, 105-97, 
before 13,235 at the Forum. "It would have been a tough one to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 A tough one? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a horrible one to lose," Pfund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially considering what would have been wasted: George Lynch's 18 rebounds 
-- the most by a Laker rookie since Magic Johnson on March 7, 1980 -- and 20 
points and three steals; Vlade Divac's 19 points and 14 rebounds and the 
Lakers' first back-to-back victories since Dec. 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
 All saved. 
</P>
<P>
 As if it wasn't enough to simply let the Pistons back in contention, the 
Lakers played the limping-team act to the end. Two 24-second violations in the 
fourth quarter. Another 10-second violation. Making only five of 10 free throws 
those final 12 minutes that probably seemed like much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Nick Van Exel's three-pointer, good for a 102-93 lead with 2:15 to play, 
was not enough to stop the monster comeback for good. The Pistons, led by Isiah 
Thomas' 31 points, were still within striking distance, 102-95, with 1:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, they scored only a concession layup by Thomas with eight seconds 
remaining. The Lakers were finally in the clear. They were free to exhale. 
</P>
<P>
 "A win is a win," Divac said. "Tomorrow, you will write about it. Next week, 
everybody will forget, right? People will say the Lakers beat the Pistons. 
Nobody will say by how much." 
</P>
<P>
 It took the Lakers 3 1/2 minutes to build a double-digit lead, then another 
six minutes to go up by 18 points, 29-11. The cushion reached 48-23, by which 
time the Lakers were shooting 62% and outrebounding Detroit, 23-11. 
</P>
<P>
 And, still, it got worse for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deficit reached 30 points, 53-23, with 6:35 to play in the second 
quarter, they had three assists and 12 turnovers. When the 13th turnover, a bad 
pass by Thomas, was converted into a Laker basket, the deficit became 32, 
57-25. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as though the Lakers could have won without showing up for the 
second half. So they gave that theory a test, allowing the Pistons to get 
within eight points, 87-79, heading into the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 A game had arrived, after all, just about 24 minutes late. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Harvey tested his strained hip muscle before the game and found he 
still could not run and jump, then said he "won't be in uniform, for sure, 
until after the All-Star break." With Doug Christie also on about the same 
timetable because of his sprained ankle, that means the Lakers could have only 
10 players for six more games. So why not put Christie and/or Harvey on the 
injured list and add someone to the roster? "We continue to talk about it," 
Coach Randy Pfund said. "There's just nobody out there we feel strong about 
bringing in. I think that's what it comes down to. . . ." Friday marked the 
seventh game in a row Christie and Harvey missed.

DUCKS CAP A SWEEP OF RANGERS; HOCKEY: DOLLAS' GOAL PROVIDES A 3-2 VICTORY AFTER 
MESSIER SCORES TWICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The New York Rangers have won 32 games this season, more than any team in the 
NHL. But no matter how many more they win, they won't win one against the 
Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who beat the Rangers at Madison Square Garden in the franchise's 
first road game Oct. 19, completed a sweep Friday night with a 3-2 victory 
before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win against the best team in hockey at home in front of our fans is 
special," Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The early-season loss to the Ducks so frustrated Ranger Coach Mike Keenan that 
he broke a stick over the crossbar the next day in practice. This time, he 
stood behind the bench in what looked like disbelief after the Ducks won their 
20th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there was a revenge factor, but that was a long time ago," Wilson 
said. "They had tough back-to-back games, after the emotional game last night 
(an overtime victory over the Kings.)" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a physical, fight-filled game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent out their big guys, but we answered the bell," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-0, but went into the third period with the score 2-2. 
Defenseman Bobby Dollas broke the tie at 3:25 of the third with a hard shot 
from the slot after forechecker Troy Loney helped separate Alexander Karpovtsev 
from the puck and Joe Sacco brought it around from behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 There was still a battle ahead, however. The Rangers went on a four-minute 
power play at 11:44 when Terry Yake was assessed a double-minor for 
high-sticking Alexei Kovalev. But the Rangers managed only one shot during the 
long power play, and after that, Guy Hebert needed to hold them off only 
another five minutes. Hebert made 28 saves in his second victory over the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum scored his team-leading 17th goal at 8:41 of the first period when 
his pass meant for Tim Sweeney in the slot went in off the skate of Ranger 
defenseman Kevin Lowe. Sweeney made the score 2-0 with a power-play goal from 
the bottom of the right circle off a pass from Yake at 16:40.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' Mark Messier scored off an assist by Kovalev at 12:05 of the 
second period, then sent the Rangers in tied at the second intermission by 
scoring on a breakaway with 40 seconds left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only two goals they got, we made a couple of mental mistakes and a 
superstar scored both goals," Wilson said. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have signed junior hockey player Mike Maneluk, 20, to a multiyear 
contract, but he will not join the organization until next season. Maneluk, a 
left wing, has never been drafted, but has 43 goals and 41 assists in 50 games 
with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western League. He will join the Ducks for 
training camp in September and probably will play for minor league affiliate 
San Diego next season. "Maneluk is an extremely talented offensive player with 
great speed," said David McNab, director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Sean Hill played after sitting out nine games because of a sprained 
left shoulder. Defenseman Alexei Kasatonov was scratched because of a foot 
bruise suffered Wednesday against Winnipeg. Steven King has been the forward 
scratched the last two games to make way for the return of Anatoli Semenov.

MORNING BRIEFING: DALY CREDITS EX-COWBOY FOR PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly credits former Dallas Cowboy Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson with being 
a stabilizing factor in Daly's battle with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Ann Liguori of Prime Ticket, Daly said: "I think a very 
important person in my life, who I've only known for about a year now, is 
Thomas Henderson. I just learned a lot from him on how to deal with situations. 
I hooked up with him at Sierra Tucson (a recovery center where) he goes in and 
speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just made so much sense, hearing it from another athlete. It's hard to 
talk to someone who hasn't been there, who doesn't really know how you feel. 
But when you talk to other athletes about how you feel, it just makes it a lot 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Daly: On his suspension from PGA tournaments, Daly said: "I got a little 
time off and it's going to be very good for me. I'd been on the go for the last 
two years, just nonstop. Everything's worked out in a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the only American to have won an individual medal in 
cross-country skiing in the Winter Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 The name game: Zoos in Ft. Worth and Buffalo have a rather exotic bet on 
Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a similar bet last year, before the Cowboys' 52-17 victory over the 
Bills, which is why there's now an exotic cat in the Buffalo Zoo named "Emmitt 
Smith," after the Cowboys' NFL rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, if the Cowboys win, the Buffalo Zoo will name an African lion after 
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman. If the Bills win, the Ft. Worth Zoo will name a 
buffalo after Bill defensive end Bruce Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic spirit: Jean Pierre Renzi figured if four men from the tropical island 
of Jamaica could make it to the Winter Olympics on a bobsled, so could he and 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So the four men from Rochester Hills, Mich., with dual citizenship in the tiny 
republic of San Marino, will take time off from their construction business to 
travel to Norway for their chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are nobody and we're competing with the best in the world," Renzi said. 
"We don't have a coach, we don't have a trainer. We are learning every time we 
go on the track."

<P>
 Who will dunk next?Heidi Gillingham is one of women's basketball's tallest 
players at 6 feet 10 inches and she is also Vanderbilt's homecoming queen. But 
can she dunk? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dunking hasn't been a goal, since dunking will just happen if I get strong 
enough and if I become agile enough," she says. "It's not as important to me as 
it is to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The only recorded dunk by a woman was by Georgeanne Wells of West Virginia 
against Charleston in December of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bill Koch of Guilford, Vt., who won a silver medal in 1976 at 
Innsbruck. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Koch: When a reporter asked if he had lived all his life in Vermont, Koch 
replied, "Not yet."

<P>
 THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE MEDIA: More than a dozen reporters and broadcasters 
covering the Super Bowl requested tee times at Atlanta golf courses Thursday . 
. . and it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE I-REMEMBER-JIMMY-CARTER AWARD: To Nate Newton of the Dallas Cowboys, who 
said, "I don't give a flying jack rabbit about last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * FINALLY, A WAY FOR ROSEANNE TO ATONE FOR HER MUTILATION OF OUR NATIONAL 
ANTHEM: A serious petition circulated throughout Super Bowl venues this week 
calls for the addition of women's mud wrestling to the 1996 Summer Olympics 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 * THIS SHOULD BE GOOD: Natalie Cole, who will sing the national anthem Sunday 
at the Super Bowl, has not sung it in several years and said she will probably 
never sing it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason? The last time she sang it, at a Laker game in Boston several years 
ago, she forgot the words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am scared to death," she 
</P>
<P>
 said. 
</P>
<P>
 * COUNTRY SMUG: Clint Black, a country music singer and one of the halftime 
performers at the Super Bowl, was asked if it will be difficult following last 
year's spectacular show by Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe not these days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * BERNIE KOSAR WILL BE LOOKING HER UP: Tanya Tucker, another halftime 
performer, said that after last year's Super Bowl in Pasadena, Cowboy backup 
quarterback Steve Beuerlein missed the team plane because he was partying all 
night at her house. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARE YOU READING THIS, RAMS? The city of Baltimore has received 12,000 
season-ticket requests for the 1994 Canadian Football League season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad, considering the city doesn't have a team, doesn't have a pending 
agreement with a team and hasn't tried to sell any tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 * VALLEY OF THE NUMB: With the sudden firing of Joe Bugel, the tension on the 
Phoenix Cardinals has become turmoil. And they are just one step from chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bob Ackles takes a job as general manager of the Philadelphia Eagles -- 
he's one of six finalists -- the Cardinals will be without a general manager, 
coach, player personnel director, and director of college scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the favorites to replace Bugel are San Francisco 49er offensive 
coordinator Mike Shanahan and Kansas City Chief coordinator Paul Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Bill Bidwill would like Norv Turner, but the Cowboy offensive 
coordinator appears sold on joining the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEAVYWEIGHT PUNCH: If Jerry Jones ever seriously thought about coaching the 
Dallas Cowboys when Jimmy Johnson leaves, he might want to read this quote from 
Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry could be one of those coaches who sits up there on a platform with a 
little bugle horn and says, 'Come on, guys.' " Norton said. "But he better 
leave the X's and O's to somebody else."

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; KEY SUPER BOWL FACTORS SAY BILLS HAVE COME DUE

<P>
 You know what they say about professional football 
</P>
<P>
 It's three hours of things nobody understands, like two-deep zones and 
rushbackers and counter treys and snack trays, mixed in with two minutes of 
spectacular catches and courageous runs, but it is those two minutes that make 
somebody want to spend a car payment on a Super Bowl ticket, even though you 
can see the game and those hot new potato chip commercials far better on 
television, though you won't get as close to halftime stars like Travis Tritt, 
but then, don't you ever wonder if there's something living in his beard?  
</P>
<P>
 You know what they also say about professional football: 
</P>
<P>
 It's a game of matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 So for Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta Sunday between the Buffalo Bills and 
Dallas Cowboys, here are ours: COWBOY COACH JIMMY JOHNSON vs. BILL COACH MARV 
LEVY 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's news conferences are often accompanied by much laughter, simply 
because he is so brazen. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's news conferences are accompanied by much shouting, simply because the 
NFL's oldest coach has difficulty hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson was asked about his underwear Friday -- we are not making this up 
-- he referred all questions to his nearby girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or she can tell you about my lack of underwear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Levy was asked about his underwear, he lost all color. This is no small 
feat, considering he has no color to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you trust more, your cousin with the two Corvettes or your grandfather? 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Bills. COWBOY OWNER JERRY JONES vs. BILL OWNER RALPH WILSON 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Jones pushed ahead of Johnson as the first speaker in the Cowboys' 
first news conference of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, he supplanted safety Bill Bates on one of the raised interview 
tables reserved for the really big stars. 
</P>
<P>
 When we last left him there, he was talking about kicking butt against some 
unsuspecting Oklahoma oilman when he was 14. Or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson gave one interview. In it, he delighted the crowd by saying, "I like 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 If you paid hard-earned millions to buy a football team, what kind of owner 
would you be? You bet your brass you would. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Cowboys. COWBOY QUARTERBACK TROY AIKMAN vs. BILL QUARTERBACK JIM KELLY 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it that Aikman, who forgot where he was for nearly 12 hours after 
suffering a concussion in the NFC championship game, has relapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the Cowboys' dismay, he reportedly walked into practice Friday and 
proclaimed he was Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 They hoped that after several completions he would realize this was 
impossible, but no. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, meanwhile, has already experienced one victory this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Tucker, country singer and a halftime performer, throatily announced, "I 
know some of the Cowboys, but I love Jim Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
 That does it. He's the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Bills. COWBOY RUNNING BACK EMMITT SMITH vs. BILL RUNNING BACK THURMAN 
THOMAS 
</P>
<P>
 Smith possesses one of the best smiles in the game. Thomas has made a career 
out of scowling. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is the only person in football who can get away with filming a shoe 
commercial about preseason workouts . . . and then purposely miss all of 
training camp in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is the greatest player in football who doesn't do any commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "You read all the news articles or listen to all the television stations, and 
the people that are talking don't know Thurman Thomas and probably never met 
him in their life and write about things they don't even know," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Until you get to know me, sit down and talk to me for a week or 
two, you really don't know what I'm like." 
</P>
<P>
 We tried. You told us to take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Cowboys. COWBOY DEFENSIVE END CHARLES HALEY vs. BILL DEFENSIVE END BRUCE 
SMITH 
</P>
<P>
 Haley, who will play Sunday despite a back injury, is best known to his former 
San Francisco 49er teammates as a guy who brought a package of his own 
excrement into a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He is best known to his current teammates as the guy who publicly derided 
insecure rookie running Derrick Lassic earlier this season, then smashed his 
helmet through a wall as an exclamation point. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been best known during Super Bowl week as the man who cursed an NFL 
official for asking Leon Lett to talk to reporters for the first time in two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear that for Bruce Smith's next trick, he is going to make Sam Malone wear 
a dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Bills COWBOY LINEBACKER KEN NORTON JR. vs. BILL LINEBACKER DARRYL TALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Norton has an interesting way of dealing with a torn biceps, which he has 
played with since refusing surgery three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start screaming," he said. "The more I scream, the more I forget about the 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Talley has a different way of dealing with hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 In despair after losing a third consecutive Super Bowl, he went to work for 
McDonald's last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only wonder who screams more. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: None. This one is dead even. COWBOY KICKER EDDIE MURRAY vs. BILL KICKER 
STEVE CHRISTIE 
</P>
<P>
 They are both Canadian. They are both former soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas Murray did not miss an extra point in 38 tries this year, Christie 
missed one in 37. 
</P>
<P>
 We think those who miss extra points should be summarily removed from the 
field and forced to spend the rest of the game in a TV booth with Joe 
Theismann. 
</P>
<P>
 And this Eddie Murray can still go to his left. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Cowboys COWBOY OFF. COORDINATOR NORV TURNER vs. BILL DEF. COORDINATOR 
WALT COREY 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is a walking offensive computer. He sits in the press box during games 
with charts, photos, and a complex play for every defense. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week he walks around the Cowboy complex, spitting out formations 
the way others say, "Good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he spits out formations instead of saying, "Good morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll see me at breakfast and the first thing he'll say is, 'On the route 
where you take the guy deep, I think you should try to get set quicker,' " 
receiver Michael Irvin said. "Only 
</P>
<P>
 then will he say, 'Oh, and how you 
</P>
<P>
 doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Corey doesn't sit in the press box. He walks the sidelines. He constantly 
chews on a piece of straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just relaxes me, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 We like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Bills 
</P>
<P>
 SPY vs. SPY 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Giants recently accused the Cowboys of trying to steal signals. 
</P>
<P>
 They were so worried, in fact, that they used an important timeout in the 
final game of the season against the Cowboys in hopes of thwarting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, everybody in the league accuses the Bills of stealing signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson tried to turn the tables Friday by saying that the Cowboys would 
not practice in the Georgia Dome because they didn't feel it was secure enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess where the Bills have been practicing? 
</P>
<P>
 Edge: Cowboys CONCLUSION 
</P>
<P>
 We know we are 0-2 in predictions this season. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that both of our picks in the conference championship games held up 
for less than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 We know what you must think. You are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But here goes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We like the Bills to knock down Troy Aikman. With his recent head problems, 
this could be enough to knock him out. 
</P>
<P>
 We like the Bills to hurt Emmitt Smith. With his recent shoulder problems, 
this won't be hard. 
</P>
<P>
 We like Jim Kelly to have the game of his life. He is having the two-month 
streak of his life, so why not?  
</P>
<P>
 We like the difference that Mark Maddox, Marvcus Patton and improved Nate 
Odomes make on the Bills' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't like the back injury suffered by the Cowboys' Charles Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't like the shortened preparation time the Cowboys have been given to 
counteract the no-huddle offense. Two weeks last year, one week this year. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't like Alvin Harper, and we don't care what anybody says about his luck 
in big games. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't like it that the Cowboys thought the Super Bowl was last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And we love this quote from a man who knows a thing or four about Super Bowls, 
Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think one more Super Bowl loss would even faze these Bills," Bradshaw 
said. "I'm sure Jim Kelly is thinking, 'Geez, we've lost three, what the hell 
is one more?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A winning attitude if we ever heard one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills, 31-27.

COMMENTARY / BOB OATES: SIMPLICITY IS THE BEAUTY OF COWBOYS' IMAGINATIVE 
OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This much can be said for the rematch. These teams don't play the same old 
conservative NFL game that most other teams play. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offensive schemes are two of the most unusual in football, and that 
largely explains why they are in Sunday's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills' no-huddle, fast-break approach with Jim Kelly is the more 
distinctive, but the Dallas Cowboys might have the league's most imaginative 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Most imaginative -- and simplest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Coach Jimmy Johnson, the defending Super Bowl champions aim not for 
touchdowns -- or even first downs -- but merely for five yards on every 
first-down play. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson figures that if his players can repeatedly make four or five yards on 
first down, they can put so much second- and third-down pressure on their 
opponents that everything else will fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is like a good pitcher who always wants to be ahead of the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely way to a sure gain, he also reasons, isn't a power run -- even 
with Emmitt Smith carrying the ball -- but a short pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the Cowboys pass most of the time on first down. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't throw far. In a close game, their quarterback, Troy Aikman, 
barely reaches the scrimmage line with most of his passes -- although he 
retreats so far, and whips the ball so rapidly and accurately, that they look 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman's easy first touchdown drive against the San Francisco 49ers last 
Sunday, the one that presaged the knockout, was typically sustained on two 
kinds of plays: draws and short passes that were carried for important gains. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 11-play drive, six passes were called. On one first-down pass, the 
ball was caught four yards beyond the line of scrimmage and carried an 
additional three. Another was caught at the line of scrimmage and advanced 28. 
Another was caught one yard behind the line and advanced 10. 
</P>
<P>
 On that opening, 80-yard move, Aikman twice abandoned called pass plays and 
scrambled, once for a first down, and then, on first and goal at the 49er 
10-yard line, for five critical yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas' only long pass of the entire sequence was thrown on a reverse play by 
another Cowboy, who missed his target. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the reverse-play surprise, that is how the Cowboys usually proceed 
-- in game after game, quarter after quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is almost no chance for Aikman to throw an interception. And such is the 
skill and style of Smith that, one way or another, the Cowboys keep 
transforming little plays into big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 No other NFL offense is like this one. The philosophy is Johnson's, the design 
is offensive coordinator Norv Turner's, and the normally flawless execution is 
by Aikman, who has thrown primarily short passes throughout his career, and who 
thus is better equipped for Cowboy football than backup Bernie Kosar, or any 
other NFL veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of Johnson's offense is staggering. It is based almost 
exclusively on three kinds of simple plays: dump passes, short slant passes and 
draw plays. 
</P>
<P>
 As the designated play-caller, Turner requires Aikman to look first for a 
slant-pass target almost every time. One wide receiver or the other, Michael 
Irvin or Alvin Harper, usually races a few steps forward before cutting in 
front of the cornerback and slanting in. If the defense has positioned a 
linebacker in the area, Aikman abandons the slant idea instantly and looks for 
a place to dump the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that the linebacker can't be in two places, covering both the slant 
and the dump. Thus, Aikman's job is simply to find the short target -- Smith, 
fullback Daryl Johnston or tight end Jay Novacek -- who is uncovered because 
the linebacker is busy elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For variety, the Cowboys occasionally call a square-out pattern. Instead of 
slanting in, a wide receiver will break for the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 And, occasionally, when the Cowboys reach their opponents' 30-yard line, or 
thereabouts, Aikman lofts a long one into the end zone. But he invariably 
throws that ball beyond the entire defense. First to last, Aikman's first 
responsibility is avoiding interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its simplicity, Johnson's system works because the defense has no good 
reason to guess whether the Cowboys have called a pass by Aikman or a fake-pass 
run by Smith. Because Smith is the best player in football, they have many 
kinds of draw plays -- as well as a pitchout play or two -- to get him into the 
open, where, Sunday, he scared everyone on the 49er team, and, no doubt, 
throughout the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was hurt the only time the Cowboys decided to turn their backs on the 
usual Johnson way. 
</P>
<P>
 That was at the start of the second half, which they began with a pitch to 
Smith. He isn't Superman. He can be had if the opposition is reasonably sure 
he's going to carry the ball, as the 49ers were that time. They expected the 
Cowboys to run in defense of their 28-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So they creamed Smith, who was re-injured, losing four yards. And on second 
and 14, the Cowboys were in the one predicament they try hardest to avoid -- a 
crisis exposing their quarterback to abuse and injury. 
</P>
<P>
 And the abuse came. And the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was sacked, kneed in the head, and delivered to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a reminder that, as a rule, it isn't their offensive line that protects 
Aikman and Smith. It's the way the Cowboys call their plays.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII; DAILY REPORT; TINIEST OF STORIES IS BIG THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE SPRINGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, it was Anthony, mysterious bodyguard of Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it's Princess Numa. 
</P>
<P>
 Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but that's the point.In Super Bowl week, no story becomes too small. And 
no incident is too small to become a story. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, linebacker Darryl Talley of the Buffalo Bills was in a Los Angeles 
nightspot during Super Bowl week, and he did or didn't get into a fight with 
Anthony. The details may have been hazy, but it quickly became clear that here 
was material to fill a column and a sportscast. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Anthony became big news. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Princess Numa. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Pete Metzelaars of the Bills is a nice enough fellow. Talented, too. A 
6-foot-7, 254-pound tight end, he led Buffalo in receptions with 68 on a team 
that has Andre Reed, Don Beebe, Thurman Thomas and Bill Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 So naturally, Metzelaars is a story. But not a very colorful story. The guy is 
religious, a good citizen and spent his undergraduate days at tiny Wabash 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly material for a movie of the week. Or even a gripping story. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Princess Numa came to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Metzelaars' great-grandmother was a 38-inch circus midget named 
Princess Numa, who married the circus barker, a man by the name of Gowdy, but 
then died while giving birth to Metzelaars' grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by a reporter if Numa was spelled N-U-M-A, Metzelaars replied with a 
smile, "Yeah, that'll work." 
</P>
<P>
 As the story spread, several Buffalo reporters claimed Metzelaars was putting 
everybody on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have known you guys were that interested in her," Metzelaars said, 
"I'd have brought the newspaper clips of her that I have back home." 
</P>
<P>

 Beware prognosticators. Buffalo has lost three consecutive Super Bowls, but 
now the Bills have opted to change their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of switching to a different hotel tonight, as they have done the past 
three years, they will remain where they have stayed all week. Also, for the 
first time in four years, Coach Marv Levy allowed himself to be photographed 
Friday posing with the Lombardi Trophy, which will be awarded to Sunday's 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had just one superstition in football," Levy said, "and that's if 
you don't block or tackle, you won't have good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills practiced for 75 minutes with no pads at Georgia Tech on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Richard Harvey (knee) and cornerback J.D. Williams (calf) practiced 
on a limited basis. "They could go (in the game)," Levy said. "But we want to 
make sure they're 100%. You can't be 90% in the Super Bowl when there are other 
players we can activate." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy said the decision on the status of Williams and Harvey will be made 
shortly before the game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cowboy defensive end Charles Haley, who had been a longshot to play against 
the Bills because of lingering back pain, took the majority of snaps with the 
first unit during a 90-minute workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles felt a lot better than he did yesterday," said Johnson. "There's a 
possibility he may start." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had asked the NFL for permission to practice in the Georgia Dome on 
Friday, but the facility was booked with events from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel the Bills have an edge because they were able to practice there 
(Thursday)," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson announced that tight end Joey Mickey, receiver Tim Daniel, tackle 
James Parrish and safety Brock Marion will be inactive for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I understand the rule, I don't agree with it," Johnson said. "I 
wish that the inactives for both teams could dress. This may be the biggest 
game of some of these players' lives. And I got to tell them no. I, for one, 
want to be able to change that rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams can dress only 45 players, plus a 46th as a designated quarterback. 
Johnson must inform three more players shortly before the game that they will 
be inactive and ineligible to dress for the Super Bowl. T.J. SIMERS

MANTLE GETTING ALCOHOL REHAB; BASEBALL: FORMER YANKEE HALL OF FAMER CHECKS INTO 
BETTY FORD CENTER AFTER BLACKOUTS AND MEMORY LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle, whose major league career was noted for home runs and late 
nights, has checked into the Betty Ford Center for treatment of alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantle, 62, a Hall of Famer since 1974, entered the clinic about three weeks 
ago and is expected to complete treatment next month, according to his business 
manager, Roy True. 
</P>
<P>
 His Friday statement said treatment was for "a 43-year battle with alcohol 
abuse." It added that Mantle was "prompted by brief periods of blackouts, 
suffering from memory loss over the past six years and concerned about possible 
liver damage." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey began using alcohol early in his life, perhaps a casualty of his early 
professional success," True said in the statement." 
</P>
<P>
 "It (alcohol) has been a celebration all his life," he added during a 
telephone interview Friday night from his home in Dallas. "I think when it 
started impacting his health, his short-term loss of memory -- he couldn't 
remember things that were discussed, events that had occurred -- he was 
beginning to realize it was time to take care of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mantle, eighth on the all-time home-run list with 536, retired at age 36 in 
1968 after 18 seasons with the New York Yankees. He won four American League 
home run titles. 
</P>
<P>
 His career was hampered by injuries to his knees, thighs, shoulders, fingers 
and hip, and by osteomyelitis, which nearly crippled him. Mantle is the only 
male member of his family to live past 41. His father died at 41 of Hodgkin's 
disease, a lymphatic cancer; his grandfather died at 40 with the same ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd known I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of 
myself," he once said, adding that he might also have tempered some of the 
evenings out with close friends and teammates Whitey Ford and Billy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Mantle's former teammates and opponents gasped when they heard the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this helps him," said Yogi Berra, the Yankees' catcher during most of 
Mantle's career. "Anything that could help him is good, because we want him 
around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad he went in if he had the problem," said Joe Garagiola, a former 
catcher and broadcaster who frequently helps former players through the 
Baseball Assistance Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Betty Ford Center, located in Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs, is a clinic 
at which many high-profile individuals have been treated for drug and alcohol 
dependency. Among them are actress Elizabeth Taylor, singer Liza Minelli and 
television newswoman Linda Ellerbee. It also treats lesser-known people. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic was founded by former first lady Betty Ford.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; CAMACHO'S ANTICS STEAL PRE-FIGHT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a performance as rare as any in boxing, as weirdly entertaining as any 
world title fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing's luminaries were upstaged here the other day by a smiling, shrieking, 
silly superstar of years past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector (Macho) Camacho, a three-time champion, shouted at fighters he is not 
scheduled to fight, clowned for the cameras that weren't there to film him and 
generally enlivened a long and meandering news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born to be No. 1," Camacho said. "I've always been No. 1. I'm in a 
class all by myself. I am the most charismatic, controversial fighter in boxing 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 And there he was, on the podium with Don King, Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray 
Leonard and a cast of dozens, promoting tonight's three-title fight card at the 
MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho, 31 and thought to be two or three years past his prime, will fight 
21-year-old rising star and fellow Puerto Rican Felix Trinidad, the 
International Boxing Federation welterweight titleholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho did not get the shot because he has relentlessly pursued the chance 
and worked until he deserved it. He got it because he was and remains, 
unmistakably, a character. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 20s, Camacho was considered one of the most talented fighters in the 
world, a stylish combination of bravado and skill, speed and timely power. He 
beat Edwin Rosario, Howard Davis, Ray Mancini, Vinny Pazienza and, after an 
earlier loss, Greg Haugen. 
</P>
<P>
 He also lived faster and harder than anyone around him, and trouble found him 
when opponents' fists could not. He had problems with the law -- dating to a 
sixth-month jail stay for car theft before his pro career began -- and is in 
the middle of a six-month term he must serve under house arrest for a November, 
1992, altercation with a police officer. He was given permission to travel away 
from home for this fight. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had other problems: In his last great matchup, Camacho had to lose 
seven pounds on the day of the fight, then lost a 12-round decision to Julio 
Cesar Chavez on Sept. 12, 1992  
</P>
<P>
 "After losing to Chavez, it seemed like I was forced to take second stage," 
Camacho said. "It makes it hard for me to go out there and get a good purse. 
It's just like I'm only a bag of tea. I learned the value of a title. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came onto the scene, I was like Trinidad. I was 20, 21, I had a title 
and I was always up there at the top. After the Chavez loss, I can see the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Chavez fight, Camacho went into semi-retirement before emerging with 
three victories in three fights in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he a changed, more mature Camacho now? 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they see a change in me," Camacho said. "I don't see what change." 
</P>
<P>
 Changed or not, he will be up against a fighter many say is the hardest young 
puncher in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho remains confident, citing Trinidad's last fight -- an awkward 
12th-round knockout of Anthony Stephens Oct. 23 -- and comparing Trinidad to 
his past opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's the worst of all of them," Camacho said of Trinidad. "He's not 
as good as Pazienza. He's not better than Chavez. He's not better than Haugen. 
He's not better than a lot of the fighters that I've fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a kid who came out of nowhere about eight months ago and knocked out 
Maurice Blocker, then knocked out (Luis) Garcia in the first round, so everyone 
was saying he's this great puncher." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho says he can still move well enough to avoid Trinidad's roundhouse 
shots and has plenty of power to defeat the younger fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid is still green," Camacho said. "Against Stephens, he was getting hit 
with straight shots, he got buckled a couple of times. . . . There's no doubt 
in my mind that I'm going to win this fight. Because he's so green. He throws 
the same stuff, one, two, three, he repeats the right hand. He's too straight 
up, he goes for the fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a different league. It's night and day. I'm Camacho, not a beat-up 
fighter like he's expecting." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of this fight is expected to fight Chavez in September at the MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is Camacho, it will be a far different fight from the first bout, he 
says, much like the way Pernell Whitaker frustrated Chavez in their 
controversial draw last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitaker did everything, basically, that I didn't do in the fight," Camacho 
said. "Stick, move, never in front of him, hold him, spin him off, get back on 
your bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't close to my best fight last time. It will be different. 
Trinidad's people were counting that I wouldn't be the same after the Chavez 
fight, and they are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I get to Chavez again, everything will be different." 
</P>

 Genaro Hernandez, the World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion whose 
career has been slowed by recurring hand problems, will undergo surgery to 
replace a loose screw in his right hand days after his fight Monday night at 
the Forum against Jorge (Cocas) Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 The screw was originally inserted late in 1992, but a specialist recently 
discovered that the bone was not healing around it, causing Hernandez pain 
every time he landed a punch to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is, if I land a good shot to the head, it feels like I hit a 
wall," Hernandez said. "I'm pretty sure it's going to hurt me in this fight, 
too, but that's never stopped me before." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is Hernandez going through with the fight against the veteran Ramirez? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can fight with broken knuckles and torn ligaments (as he has done 
earlier in his career), then I can fight with a screw loose," Hernandez said. 
"Once the bell rings, all that about my hand, that's gone. If it's going to 
hurt, it's going to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last fight was back in October, and it was time to fight again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez will have the operation in February, then take four or five months 
off before he fights again. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A trim-looking Meldrick Taylor is the most recent addition to the card here 
tonight. Taylor, who is being lined up for a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez in 
May at the MGM, will fight a 10-round welterweight bout against Craig Houk, but 
it won't be on the pay-per-view telecast. . . . The Taylor fight will be 
preceded by a women's bout -- Christy Martin vs. Suzie Melton. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans for a night of rematches led by the Chavez-Taylor fight in 
May, with the possibility of Julian Jackson-Gerald McClellan, Simon Brown-Terry 
Norris and James Leija-Azumah Nelson rematches on the same card. . . . Former 
heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe's next fight might be with Michael Bentt for 
Bentt's World Boxing Organization title in Las Vegas next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman's next fight probably will be next spring in New Orleans, 
coinciding with Louisiana's opening of casino gambling. . . . Oscar De La Hoya, 
training at Big Bear, is said to be ahead of schedule losing weight as he works 
down to the 130-pound junior-lightweight limit for his fight March 5 against 
Jimmi Bredahl. De La Hoya was said to have weighed 134 late last week. Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez vs. 
Jorge (Cocas) Ramirez; Dick Tiger vs. Florencio Ibarra, middleweights; Forum, 
7:30 p.m.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; STANFORD, RATED 10TH, IS UPSET BY UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA's women's basketball team overcame a rash of late turnovers and upset 
10th-ranked Stanford on Friday night, 80-73, at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins held Stanford to single digits for the first 11 minutes, maintained 
large leads for most of the second half, then stumbled home to victory in a 
whirlwind of turnovers and free throws.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory, before 1,283, boosted the Bruins to 9-7 overall, 4-3 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. Stanford dropped to 11-4 and 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also ended a 10-game UCLA losing streak to Stanford, winner of the 
last five Pac-10 championships and two NCAA titles since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Bruin forward Amy Jalewalia scored nine of her 21 points in the final 
eight minutes. Natalie Williams led UCLA with 24 points and 16 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Detra Lockhart sank five free throws in the final 26 seconds 
after Stanford had pulled to 75-73 with 30 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford had shot 51% from three-point range in its previous three games, and 
had 12 three-pointers against California last weekend. But the Cardinal was 
only three for 12 from long range Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense was huge," Bruin Coach Kathy Olivier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told our players they could all shoot the three, so we just couldn't let 
them take those shots.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we held them scoreless the first five minutes (actually 4:41), that was 
a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cardinal Coach Tara VanDerveer: "They did a good job of extending their 
defense on us. . . . They denied us the ball high and contested every shot. No 
matter what we did offensively, we couldn't get anyone open." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Rachel Hemmer led the Cardinal with 21 points, mostly on baseline 
drives and tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who now has had double figures in points and rebounds in 34 of her 
last 39 games, had the first four points of the game as UCLA took a 13-2 lead. 
The Bruins had a 40-30 halftime lead and five times had leads of at least 13 
points in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 Then they began coming apart.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had 24 turnovers for the game, but nine of them came in the last eight 
minutes. Luckily for the Bruins, Stanford had difficulty finding good shots in 
the stretch, and UCLA wasn't missing free throws.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will play host to California at noon Sunday. Stanford will play at USC 
Sunday at 1 p.m.

GOLF; MAGEE, FEHR TIED AT TOP OF PHOENIX OPEN FIELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrew Magee and Rick Fehr changed their off-season routines and perhaps their 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee, whose victory last week at Tucson was his first since 1991, carded a 
six-under-par 65 Friday, pulling into a tie with Fehr for the second-round lead 
of the Phoenix Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, who earned $556,322 last year without winning a tournament, shot a 67. 
Both players are at nine-under-par 133 after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both also were linked by strength and conditioning programs they began in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about myself," said Magee, who has played three consecutive 
rounds without a bogey. "I feel strong. I gained a lot of strength from the 
knowledge that I worked that hard to get myself ready to go this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr also said he has been working out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was approached on the range by (ESPN's) Gary Koch, and he said, 'Everybody 
says you're hitting it longer,' " Fehr said. "I said, 'Who's telling you that?' 
But off the tee I'm lining it solid, and it's getting out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr and Magee are one shot ahead of Bob Estes, Larry Rinker and Billy Andrade 
and two shots in front of Tim Simpson, Tom Lehman, Mike Hulbert, Gary McCord 
and Dan Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Springer, Bill Glasson, Blaine McAllister, Bob Burns and Ken Green are 
tied at 136. 
</P>
<P>
 Green came within a shot of the course record with a 63 that included a 
birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle-birdie series on the 12th through 16th holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Lee Janzen, Gil Morgan, Dave Barr, Steve Pate, Vijay Singh, 
Bruce Lietzke and Phil Mickelson were at 137. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-two pros and amateur Todd Demsey, who plays for Arizona State, made the 
cut at 141. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Ogle, winner of the Hawaiian Open two weeks ago, missed the cut at 144 
after shooting 73 on Friday.

SOCCER; DILUTED TEAM OF RUSSIANS TO PLAY U.S. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. national soccer team, off to a 1-0-1 start in 1994, will play host to 
a Russian team of unknown quality tonight at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 For the U.S. team, the game will be a chance to simulate conditions for its 
first World Cup game, June 18 in the Silverdome at Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Under different circumstances, the game against Russia would be an opportunity 
for the Americans to test themselves against a World Cup qualifier. But the 
Russian team is in disarray because of a player boycott. More than half the 
players on the national roster have not reported to a training camp. They are 
calling for the removal of Coach Pavel Sadyrin. JULIE CART

<P>
 Although portions of earthquake-damaged Anaheim Stadium are still being 
repaired, the motocross course and enough seats to accommodate more than 50,000 
spectators are ready for tonight's Coors Light Challenge, third round of the 
Camel Supercross series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jumbotron scoreboard collapsed during the temblor Jan. 17 and fell into 
the seats behind center field.An off-road race was postponed last Saturday, but 
engineers and construction personnel have been working around the clock to make 
the stadium safe for tonight's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy McGrath, a winner for three consecutive years at Anaheim, is the heavy 
favorite to win again in the 20-lap race for 250cc cycles. McGrath, 22, won 
125cc events in 1991 and 1992 before moving up to win the 250cc main event last 
year. McGrath then won nine more races and the 250cc championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Murrieta rider has won the first two events this season, at Orlando, Fla., 
and Houston. In both races, Mike LaRocco, also 22, was second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston was the toughest race I've ever won," McGrath said. "I thought when I 
took the lead, it was pretty much over. Then, all of a sudden, there was 
LaRocco. The pressure (he put on) was really intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's program, which also includes a 125cc support race, will start at 
7:30. SHAV GLICK

NBA ROUNDUP; RICE'S HOT SHOOTING HELPS HEAT END MAGIC'S FIVE-GAME STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are nights when Glen Rice believes he can't miss. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those nights was Friday, when the Miami Heat forward scored 34 points, 
including two clutch jumpers in the final 1:04, to help the Heat defeat the 
Orlando Magic, 106-97, at Orlando, Fla., ending the Magic's five-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice scored 15 third-quarter points, nine of them during an 18-0 run that gave 
the Heat an 80-70 lead. The Heat led by eight points going into the fourth 
quarter, and Rice's final basket enabled Miami to stay ahead after the Magic 
cut the deficit to 98-97. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I was feeling that whatever kind of shot I put up, I wasn't 
going to miss," Rice said. "Time and time again, I think back to when guys 
didn't step up for us in crucial periods. I just said, 'I'm going to step up. 
Give me a wide-open jumper, and I'll be taking it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal and Nick Anderson led the Magic with 21 points each, but it 
was a frustrating night for O'Neal, who was double-teamed most of the game and 
attempted only 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith scored 18 points and Grant Long 17 for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 119, Golden State 91 -- Karl Malone had 30 points and 17 rebounds, Jeff 
Malone scored 27 points and the Jazz throttled the Warriors' Latrell Sprewell, 
Chris Webber and Chris Mullin at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprewell, Webber and Mullin, averaging a combined 54 points, scored 24 on 
10-of-37 shooting before Coach Don Nelson took them out midway through the 
third quarter. Sprewell had nine points on three-for-12 shooting, Webber 10 
points on five-for-16 shooting and Mullin five points on two-for-nine shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 113, Milwaukee 96 -- Scottie Pippen scored 30 points at Chicago to 
help the Bulls to their 17th consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who started the fourth quarter with a 10-0 run, have won 10 of 
their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks didn't get on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter until there was 
8:44 left, on Blue Edwards' basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Murdock scored 25 points and Vin Baker 23 for Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 117, Charlotte 105 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 17 of his 27 points in 
the second half to lead the Hawks at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Willis had 24 points and 12 rebounds and Mookie Blaylock scored 25 
points on seven-for-11 three-point shooting as the Hawks extended their winning 
streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also clinched the Eastern Conference All-Star coaching berth for 
Atlanta Coach Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 108, Philadelphia 103 -- Dan Majerle scored 33 points to lead the 
injury-riddled Suns at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers lost despite a career-high 25 points by rookie Shawn Bradley, who 
made 10 of 16 shots and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:16 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 109, Minnesota 98 -- Clifford Robinson scored 18 points for the Trail 
Blazers at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Laettner scored 23 points for the Timberwolves.

NHL ROUNDUP; OATES, CASEY LEAD BOSTON IN SHUTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adam Oates had a goal and two assists and Jon Casey faced only 17 shots for 
his first shutout of the season as the Boston Bruins defeated the New York 
Islanders, 3-0, on Friday night at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins extended their unbeaten streak to five games and continued their 
mastery over the Islanders. They are 6-0-2 in their last eight meetings against 
the Islanders, 4-0-1 at Nassau Coliseum since Nov. 4, 1991, when they lost, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey preserved the 13th shutout of his career by making a kick save on Marty 
McInnis' screen shot with 3:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely scored the other Bruin goal, his 34th in 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, San Jose 3 -- Jesse Belanger's goal with 3:08 to play in the third 
period at Miami helped the Panthers extend their unbeaten streak to an 
expansion-record eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, 4-0-4 during the streak, had been tied for the record with the 
Kings and St. Louis Blues, both of whom who accomplished the feat during the 
1967-68 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers haven't lost since Jan. 7, when they were defeated by the New 
Jersey Devils, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose extended its road unbeaten streak to four games, a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Edmonton 2 -- Brendan Shanahan scored two goals to lead the Blues 
at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final minutes, St. Louis led, 2-1. In a desperate bid for a tie, 
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather called for a measurement of Craig Janney's stick 
with 2:25 to play. It proved to have too much curve and the Oilers went on a 
power play with a two-man advantage after pulling the goaltender. But Shanahan 
scored a short-handed goal into an empty net at 19:11, giving the Blues a 3-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie DeBrusk scored the Oilers' second goal at 19:59. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Calgary 2 -- Stephane Richer scored two goals at Calgary, his 
19th and 20th of the season, as the Devils extended their road unbeaten streak 
to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Walz and Theoren Fleury scored for the Flames.

QUAKE RELIEF IS WINNER AS SOLIS HAS A BIG DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Solis' big day Friday at Santa Anita was the American Red Cross' gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, the meeting's leading rider announced he would donate his 
Friday earnings to earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 He rode four winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis won the first race with favored Trusting Heart, then swept the final 
three with Ms. Something, Service Ace and Uncanny Ann. He also had a third and 
a fourth on the afternoon, so his total donation to the Red Cross was $6,950. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (trainer) Mel Stute's idea," Solis said. "I was at his barn on 
Wednesday morning and I walked in and he said, 'How you doing, son?' and I told 
him, 'I'm having a good time riding horses and everything's going well and I 
just feel so fortunate that everything is going so well.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I couldn't believe that I'm having so much fun and making so much 
money and he suggested I donate some of it (to earthquake relief). I said it 
sounded like a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really feels good to make such a donation. I was very excited all week 
long to do it and I couldn't wait until today to see how everything was going 
to work out. Every day I pray to God I come out healthy, and for all the other 
jockeys, too. Today, I prayed that everybody came out healthy and that my 
horses ran well, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Haceck, Solis' agent, also donated his share of the rider's earnings.

RECOVERY CHANNEL TO THE RESCUE FOLLOWING QUAKE; TELEVISION: FEMA LAUNCHED THE 
SATELLITE-GENERATED BROADCASTS TO AID COMMUNICATION DURING NATURAL DISASTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the unexpected results of the Jan. 17 earthquake is a new television 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the Recovery Channel, and it represents the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's (FEMA) most ambitious use of television to distribute 
information to assist those impacted by a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Recovery Channel provides round-the-clock programming -- mostly 
computer-generated announcements but also field reports, interviews and the 
daily news briefings on recovery efforts by FEMA and the California Office of 
Emergency Services. It also provides reports in Spanish and Korean and plans to 
expand its computer-generated announcements into Spanish once a translator can 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The channel can be seen at disaster assistance sites and recovery offices, and 
is also carried at times on KLCS-TV Channel 58 and on LA CityView35, the 
government-access channel on cable systems within Los Angeles' city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The programming began Jan. 21 and will continue "as long as we feel it is 
providing a service," said Phil Cogan, the acting deputy director of the Office 
of Emergency Information and Public Affairs, a branch of FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the broadcasts began when Cogan arrived in the Southland the 
evening of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA decided to use satellite-delivered television as a tool after being 
disappointed with the way information was conveyed following Hurricane Andrew, 
which hit southern Florida in 1992. Its first use came last summer for the 
Midwest flooding, with the broadcasts being done a few hours a day from the 
agency's Washington headquarters. A similar plan was used for Hurricane Emily. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the agency has broadcast from the location of a 
disaster, Cogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The channel is operating out of a Pasadena office building, using the corner 
of a sixth-floor office as a makeshift studio, where interviews are conducted. 
Its approximately 20-person staff has mainly been culled from government 
agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 The programming is distributed to the various cable systems via a satellite 
dish atop a television production truck parked outside the office. Satellite 
time has been rented on both the C and KU bands for $177,000 a month -- a 50% 
reduction from the normal cost, Cogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it has cut costs (from a disaster) because information is getting out 
faster," said James Lee Witt, FEMA director, who also pointed out that the 
service frees workers from having to repeatedly answer the same questions by 
telephone and reduces demand on the telephone lines. "It cuts time, and in a 
case like this, time is money." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two days, the Recovery Channel has interviewed an official from 
the state Contractors License Board, warning of fraudulent practices and 
offering tips on how to avoid them, talked with a man entertaining children who 
had been left homeless and scared by the earthquake and reported from a staging 
area in Los Alamitos, where water and food are being distributed.

ROOM TO GROW; WHITE WICKER, FLOWERED WALLPAPER AND DOLLS ARE FINE FOR LITTLE 
GIRLS. BUT AFTER ASHLEY WILLIAMS ENTERED COLLEGE, HER TASTES GRADUATED TOO. 
DESIGNER MARY DIVEL GUIDED WILLIAMS THROUGH TRANSFORMING THE YOUTHFUL BEDROOM 
INTO AN EXOTIC ADULT INTERIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ashley Williams turned 21, it seemed time her bedroom grew up too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The room had white wallpaper with flowers, white wicker furniture and white 
shelves holding my doll and music box collections," she said. "I was tired of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a student at Saddleback College, packed the collections away in the 
garage of the Laguna Niguel home where she lives with her parents and set out 
on a quest for a new, adult look. For help she turned to artist/designer Mary 
Divel, who is also a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished room is dramatically different: It has a rich color scheme and 
exotic touches. Most of the new look was achieved by reworking the existing 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few items were bought for the redesign. The biggest changes were made 
with the all-time agent of versatility: paint. It was applied -- often in 
multiple layers -- to walls and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 All plans have to start somewhere, and the plans for Williams' room started 
with a white bedspread that her mother wanted her to use. Because the white 
would make the bed less suitable for sitting, Williams decided she needed a 
separate lounging and reading area. 
</P>
<P>
 Designating one corner of the room as this area, Williams and Divel 
upholstered a piece of curving foam-rubber to create a futon on the floor. They 
covered it in a combination of zebra-print and tapestry fabrics, a decision 
that was to inspire other changes in the room. They added a custom railing 
designed by wrought-iron artist David Brunetta and stacked many oversize 
pillows against the wall and rail. 
</P>
<P>
 To further enliven the sitting area, a large mirror found in an antique store 
was refinished and added to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 The mirror was scrubbed of its painted color down to a metallic gold and 
rubbed with a black wash; a touch of the zebra print fabric was added. 
</P>
<P>
 The completed reading/sitting area is one Williams uses often: "It's really 
comfortable," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the sitting area was done, Williams had decided she liked the 
drama of the darker colors. She decided to buy a black bedspread, which meant 
she ended up not using the original white bedspread that started the whole 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is how I like to work," said Divel. "It's more fun because you create as 
you go along. You're able to add something you'd never thought of until you 
came across it, and you solve problems that you never anticipated. When Ashley 
and I went shopping for the original fabric for the futon, it took hours. And 
then when we picked the fabric we liked, only a black bedspread would look good 
with it. That's what made it fun and not some by-the-book look." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the existing furnishings that underwent a dramatic change was the metal 
bed frame. It had been painted with many coats of white paint through the 
years. "We sand-blasted it down to a natural metal, almost pewter color," said 
Divel. "Then we started painting it using the combination we used on 
everything: metallic copper, gold and a little bit of silver." 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of the bed they draped gauze fabric to give the illusion of being 
in a tent in the Moroccan desert and then held the gauze back with two golden 
lion heads they found in an antique shop. 
</P>
<P>
 When a new mattress was purchased for the bed, it was so much higher than the 
original one that the bedside table they had also picked up in an antique store 
now seemed too short. The solution: add metallic balls to make it taller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally I was just going to crackle the table to go with the rest of the 
furniture, but since it was so low we added the gold balls in the center to 
raise it up. It was never all that valuable, so we didn't ruin any priceless 
antique," Divel said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new, fantasy-like table goes better with the all-over look of the room 
than the original one ever would have. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bed, Divel made over-sized pillows to coordinate with the ones on the 
floor, and a lamp purchased by Williams' mother was added to the side table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the drama in the room comes from the rich golden color Williams and 
Divel added to of the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 After removing the original wallpaper -- white with blue and pink flowers -- 
they painted the room. The gold paint was applied with rollers, and then old 
T-shirts were used to wipe the still-wet paint off in sweeping motions. The 
process gave the walls a warm, weathered look. It was difficult to achieve a 
consistent effect because the paint needed to be rubbed before it dried. 
</P>
<P>
 Track lighting on the wood cathedral ceiling illuminates the artwork and 
filters through the gauze around the bed, making shadow patterns on the walls. 
"Getting the shadows right was very important to me," said Williams. "I like 
the look they cast on the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 In the far end of the room, a wooden chest of drawers that was once white has 
been given a crackled finish using the copper, gold and silver motif. On top of 
the chest is a lion lamp painted in the same colors -- it was also once white. 
"I wanted that lamp out of the room," said Divel, "but Ashley liked it, so we 
painted it and added a black lampshade with the zebra print on it. That was a 
good compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' favorite painting is Van Gogh's "Sunflowers," so Divel found a print 
of it, added an antiqued frame and matted it to coordinate with the mirror 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Left over from her young-girl's room are a Mexican desk and chair that were 
left unchanged except for the addition of a tapestry cushion to the chair. A 
black metal Mexican lamp on the table casts the shadows on the wall that 
Williams loves. The original off-white carpeting was also kept, although 
Williams and Divel are both on the lookout for a rug to go on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drapes, made of an off-white fabric painted with gold vertical stripes, 
hang from a wrought-iron rod, also designed by Brunetta.  
</P>
<P>
 In the adjoining bathroom, cabinets and walls were repainted in a blend of 
gold, red, blue and copper tones that suggest an ethereal sunset. For the light 
fixture, Divel took an old, long, rusted piece of metal and drilled holes in it 
for dressing-room-like light bulbs. The fixture runs the entire length of the 
bathroom mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time that we thought we were finished, we came up with another idea," 
said Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 In working with Divel on the project, Williams said she succeeded not only in 
leaving behind the young-girl look of her room, but also in opening open up an 
artistic side of herself she hadn't used before.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; SPRAY PAINT COATS EXTERIOR FASTER THAN FLICKS OF THE WRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to painting your home's exterior, spray painting is at least 
twice as fast as brushing, and much less fatiguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial sprayers may be expensive, but they can be rented for about $75 a 
day. These units use air to atomize paint to a fine mist by means of an air 
compressor. 
</P>
<P>
 They work like this: Paint follows the air stream out of the tip in a sort of 
cloud, causing a high percentage of the paint to trail away from the surface 
being painted. This trail is called overspray. 
</P>
<P>
 Airless sprayers, designed for do-it-yourself house painters, cost about 
$100-$250 and come in two basic designs. In piston-type systems, paint is 
pumped directly through an atomizing valve at high pressure. The other type, 
diaphragm pump systems, atomize paint by means of a mechanical screw, and they 
deliver the paint to the gate valve at relatively low pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the do-it-yourself sprayers have their pumps built into a hand-held 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 To spray paint, prepare surfaces as you would for brushwork. Trim and siding 
must be clean and free of unsound paint. All bare spots must be primed, and 
fixtures and hardware not to be painted must be removed or masked. 
</P>
<P>
 You can remove aluminum storm doors and windows, but consider that 
factory-finished metal surfaces make an excellent base for spraying latex. So 
if you want them to match the color of your siding, by all means paint them. 
Just make certain they are clean. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, first prime the pump by spraying onto paper or another uncritical 
surface. If the pump won't prime, the paint probably has to be thinned. 
</P>
<P>
 Start the sprayer with the nozzle pointing away from the work surface, then 
move it into position about 12 inches away. Work with rhythmic strokes, keeping 
the sprayer upright and parallel to the plane of the wall. Don't go over 
previously painted areas until they are dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Work from the top down, spraying a thin even coat. Several thin coats produce 
a better finish than one thick one. If drips, runs or sags occur, remove excess 
paint with a brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove all masking when the paint is dry to the touch. Inspect the job and 
finish with a brush any areas where the masking blocked the spray. If your trim 
is to be a different color from the siding, paint the trim first using a 
hand-held shield of cardboard or thin hardboard to protect the siding from the 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as maintenance is concerned, the single most important practice for 
airless sprayers is to keep them clean. If you work directly from the paint 
container with a long siphon tube, tape the tube to the container rim to keep 
it off the ground. Flush the tube thoroughly with solvent if it does contact a 
foreign substance. 
</P>
<P>
 When you are finished for the day, spray solvent through the gun for several 
minutes. Then disassemble the unit and soak the non-electrical parts in 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipe all the built-up paint from both the cap and cup and reassemble the unit 
and put a drop of light oil in the suction hole. Switch the unit on for a 
couple of seconds to circulate the oil.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: GOOD SUPPORT WILL QUAKE-PROOF YOUR CHIMNEY, 
WATER HEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: After seeing all the chimneys topple in the recent earthquake, I'm 
worried about mine. It's brick and 25 years old. Is there anything I can do now 
to protect it from quakes? 
</P>
<P>
 S.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "There is a retrofit kit that can give your brick chimney some 
support," says Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber & Building Supply in Westminster. 
"Basically, it connects the chimney to the roof line. It's adjustable to 
various chimney styles and roof configurations. Before installing the kit, have 
your chimney checked out to make sure there are no serious cracks and that it's 
sound. After connecting it to the chimney, you bolt it down into the roof 
rafters under the shingles, or surface mount it on top of the roof and use tar 
to seal it." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My water heater isn't secured, and I have some plumber's tape to do the 
job, but I'm wondering about the right way to do it. My neighbor said it 
shouldn't be attached tightly to the wall, that there should be a little play 
for it to move during a quake. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 F.F. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A: "That's false. It should be tightly secured, and you should use an 
earthquake bracket designed for that use," says Steve Johnson of Familian Pipe 
& Supply in Costa Mesa. "The problem that often occurs with your water heater 
is in the water connections. Over time, they become stiff and rigid and if the 
heater moves during a quake, the connection can break off. The bracket is easy 
to install. It fits on the top of the water heater, then you bolt it into the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're thinking of installing a clothes dryer next to the washer in the 
kitchen. A neighbor put one in the same place in his house and cut a hole down 
into the crawl space under the floor for the exhaust. We'd like to do the same 
thing, but I'm wondering if that's a safe way to vent. 
</P>
<P>
 R.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Venting your dryer under the house just isn't safe," says Rod Albright of 
Albright Plumbing & Heating in Los Alamitos. "The lint collects underneath the 
house and gas molecules can stick to it. If a plumber ever had to go underneath 
the house to solder a fitting, the flame could create a gas fire. When the time 
came to sell your house, it wouldn't pass inspection until you rerouted the 
exhaust. A better solution would be to run an exhaust pipe from underneath the 
hole to the side of the house. This will create a safer installation." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I need to replace a cracked window but I'm having a hard time. All the 
windows in our 12-year-old house have that faux pane look, where plastic strips 
have been glued in a grid to make them look like they're separate panes. I can 
put a new piece of glass in myself; however, how do I find these strips? 
</P>
<P>
 C.N. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Usually, a glass shop will cut off the existing strips and glue them in," 
says Bob Griffith of B & D Glass in Orange. "They're time-consuming to remove, 
but you just mark where they should be on the new window, cut them apart with a 
razor, glue them on and hold them into place with tape. When they're dry, you 
can remove the tape and install the window in place. If they break while trying 
to remove them from the old glass, you'll have to have a glass shop order them 
for you from a manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have an ugly grout stain on my bathroom floor that's between four tiles. 
I've used various cleaners and stiff brushes but nothing's worked. Any 
suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 W.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It depends on what the stain is and how deep it has penetrated," says tile 
installer Mike Blaney of Santa Ana. "I'd try getting a small grout scraper and 
try to scrape it out if it's not too deep. If it does seem to go down far, you 
may want to find a matching grout, scrape all of it out in the affected areas 
and re-grout."

INTERIORS; CATALOGUES' UPSCALE, GLAMOROUS IMAGE IS MADE TO MAIL ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The role of the catalogue is changing. Easy shopping used to be the selling 
point of mail-order merchandising, but now catalogues are taking on some of the 
glamour of magazines, offering fancy photos and how-tos along with home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 JC Penney, for example, is launching a high-end bed and bath book in March. On 
the drawing boards are a furniture catalogue and a gift registry service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've identified a need for better and best merchandise," said Jim Feit, a 
Penney executive. With the new catalogues, he said, the goal is for consumers 
"to like the layout so well that they'll buy everything that they see." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the fancy new wish books are mail order. Expressions, a 60-store 
chain based in Metairie, La., recently mailed out its first catalogue. Rather 
than order forms, the address and telephone number for each store is listed and 
readers are encouraged to visit the one nearest them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line is blurring between magazines and catalogues," said Ronna Greist, 
Expressions president. "For example, a recent newsstand decorating magazine had 
three manufacturers' sale catalogues bound into its pages." 
</P>
<P>
 The Expressions catalogue layout looks more like a decorating magazine than an 
advertisement. The furniture is featured in room settings, photographed mostly 
in real homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vehicle we chose to exemplify what it would be like to walk into an 
Expressions store is a catalogue," Greist said. "I see us going past the 
catalogue and into our own magazine with information and guidance on how to put 
a room together and why you want this kind of cushion versus another kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Greist said other likely topics are what does and doesn't work and what 
Expressions customers think of the pieces they bought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More editorial matter is finding its way into catalogues, according to 
Kathleen Joyce, executive editor of Catalog Age magazine, published by Cowles 
Business Press in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more are featuring entire decorating schemes," Joyce said. "This can 
range from showing how to set up an entire kitchen to showing how to set up a 
home office." 
</P>
<P>
 Other features range from interviews with artisans in Robert Redford's 
Sundance catalogue to how to choose and use electronic products in a Spiegel 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "People read catalogues for fun, not only when they are ordering merchandise," 
said Betty Rosenberg, director of home fashions for Spiegel in Downers Grove, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's home furnishings pages take what Rosenberg describes as an 
"info-sales" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A feature called "For the Look Shown" explains how to get the effects 
pictured. And in a recent catalogue, the section on home electronics included 
words as well as photos. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The writer's) job was to anticipate readers' likely questions and respond to 
them," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some catalogues fit a very specific niche. Levenger's of Delray Beach, Fla., 
for example, caters to the book lover, offering furniture and accessories -- 
everything for the bibliophile except books. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have grown about 800% in the last three years," Joyce said of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High-end merchandise and custom services such as monogramming, not usually 
associated with mail-order shopping, are now common in home furnishings 
catalogues, the Catalog Age editor said. In addition, a number of catalogues 
offer overnight delivery, liberal guarantees and return policies and advice on 
assembly or the offer of assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Penney's new "Fine Furnishings" bedding and bath catalogue will feature 
210-count Egyptian cotton sheets and services such as monogramming and will 
show coordinated bedding and bath products in an upscale environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Feit said the furniture book will offer delivery and set-up in the home by 
appointment. For the computerized gift registry, orders will be placed via a 
toll-free telephone number, gift-wrapped and delivered based on selections from 
a catalogue. Start-up cities are Chicago, Dallas, Detroit and Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 With the line blurring between magazine and catalogue, how do you tell the 
difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "If it has an ordering device, it's a catalogue," Joyce said.

HOME IMPROVEMENT; EVEN UP FLOORING FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a portion of wall separating two rooms is removed or when an opening is 
made to create a passageway, sometimes the levels of the finished flooring on 
the two sides of the wall are different. 
</P>
<P>
 This occurs most frequently when the finished flooring of one room is 
different from the other, or when a floor has been refinished during a previous 
remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of appearance and safety, it is desirable to create a uniform 
level or to provide an appropriate transition between the two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The slightest mismatches in floor levels can create tricky steps that cause 
people to trip, perhaps because of the unconscious habit of lifting one's feet 
only a certain amount while walking. It is necessary to create a distinct 
visual transition between the two floor surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a slight mismatch could exist when one part of a floor surface is 
finished with ceramic tile and the remainder with wood strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, the tile floor could be anywhere from one-quarter inch to 
seven-eighths inch higher than the wood floor, attributable to the thickness of 
the subflooring beneath the tile plus the tile thickness. There are three 
simple treatments.  
</P>
<P>
 One is to install a saddle to cover the gap by the wall that has been removed. 
The best way to do this would be to fill the gap with wood blocks or strips 
level with the wood floor. The saddle, a stock molding available in several 
widths at any lumber yard, would then be nailed in place over the filler 
blocks. The top of the saddle should be level with or slightly higher than the 
higher of the two surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is to nail a quarter-round molding to the subflooring's edge. 
This would provide the appropriate visual transition and also would protect the 
tile edge from cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 A third solution is to fill the gap left where the wall was removed with a 
floor-filling compound finished with a slope. The entire floor surface could 
then be covered with carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Where you want to create a uniform floor level, it may be necessary to build 
up the existing floor to create a flat, uniform plane. Building-up methods 
involve compensating for the height differential between two levels with new 
subflooring and/or sleepers, which are strips of material installed below the 
subflooring where they act as spacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood, particleboard, tempered hardboard and fiberboard are generally used 
for subflooring. Pine, plywood and hardboard strips may be used for sleepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic and resilient tile and laminated wood flooring units require a fairly 
rigid subfloor to prevent them from flexing underfoot, which will ultimately 
loosen the adhesive and may result in cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 For these applications, minimum thicknesses of one-half inch plywood or 
five-eighths inch particleboard are recommended. If these materials are to be 
supported by sleepers, the spacing between them should be no greater than 16 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempered hardboard should be used as subflooring for tile units only if it is 
laid directly over an existing floor without sleepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Solid wood strip flooring, which is generally one-inch thick, can be nailed 
directly to an existing strip floor, or any existing sturdy subfloor, or 
perpendicular to sleepers spaced 16 inches apart.

HOME SAFETY; ELECTRICAL TOOLS USED OUTSIDE NEED GROUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your best guarantee of safety while using electrical tools outside or in damp 
areas is to be sure that everything you use is plugged into a ground fault 
circuit interrupter. This electrical device instantly detects a hazardous 
situation and cuts the flow of power before a fatal shock is delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Current electrical codes require outside outlets and those in the bathroom and 
kitchen or in damp areas be protected by this device. New homes must have it, 
but homes those built before 1974 have only grounded circuits with a circuit 
breaker or fuse protector. Neither is as safe as circuit interrupter protection 
in conjunction with a fuse or circuit breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, double-insulated tools and tools with a heavy-duty, three-wire grounded 
cord offer good protection against shock, but their safety feature can be 
interrupted by accident or improper use. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit interrupters are inexpensive and easy to install. It's a simple to add 
one to a three-wire cord. To do this, you replace the receptacle end of the 
cord with a circuit interrupter receptacle housed in a weatherproof box. 
</P>
<P>
 A circuit interrupter current (amps) flowing to and from electric tools and 
equipment. Under normal operating conditions, the current flowing to the tools 
is the same as that returning to the electrical panel. When a ground fault 
occurs, some of the current is diverted to the ground by a short somewhere in 
the circuit. If the short is through you to the ground, you are in for a 
shocking experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The device senses current-flow imbalance -- as little as 5 milliamps (which 
can't hurt most people) and shuts off current flow in a fraction of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be added to a metal or plastic box. Metal exterior boxes come threaded 
for box connectors. Plastic boxes may be threaded, but many brands require an 
adapter. If you plan to use a plastic box, get the necessary plastic parts so 
the box can accept a standard clamp-type box connector. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the ground fault circuit interrupter receptacle, you need the 
following materials and tools: a 25-foot 14-2 extension cord (14-gauge wire, 2 
wires with ground), a weatherproof rectangular outdoor box that accepts dual 
receptacles, a combination wire cutter and stripper, locking pliers and a 
screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the extension cord, cut off the cord's receptacle and strip about 
one-half inch of insulation from the ends of the wires. Screw the connector 
into the end of the box and tighten with locking pliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Loosen the clamp on the box connector and pull about a foot of extension cord 
into the box; connect the wires to the terminals. If you use a metal box, you 
have to ground it. To do this, run a short section of wire from the green screw 
on the circuit-interrupter receptacle to the ground screw inside the box. Use 
wire connectors to join the conductors to the receptacle if it is equipped with 
wire leads instead of terminal screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull the excess cord out of the box to make room for the receptacle. Make sure 
none of the cord's bare or insulated conductors is exposed outside the box. 
Tighten the screws on the box connector to clamp the cord in place and install 
the cover.

 The collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum include the world's greatest 
collection of Constable's paintings, other fine and applied art -- and plastic 
Tupperware housewares. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's renowned National Museum of Art and Design recently acquired several 
Tupperware items for its decorative arts collection. Among them is a prototype 
bowl, "Zuppa a Noci," an experimental design not intended for production or 
sale. The bowl was also acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of New York.

HOW CAN STEEL-FRAME HOUSE BE INSULATED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a mechanical engineer with Hughes Aircraft Co. in Fullerton. I was 
reading the Jan. 15 article in Home Design titled "Steeling Home." It talked 
about the advantage of using steel in place of wood in home construction. It 
even recommended metal roofing and siding. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that structurally and economically, steel is better and won't be 
affected by termites, but how do you insulate a metal house against extreme 
heat and cold? 
</P>
<P>
 Wood is a good insulator, preventing sunlight from turning your house into an 
oven. In the winter, it won't conduct your heat through the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 A metal house would require some type of insulating scheme to prevent this. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, how do you prevent possible electrical shorts to the structure? A mouse 
can chew through (insulation of) a 220-volt line and ground it to your house! 
</P>
<P>
 Could you please answer these questions? 
</P>

 Staff writer John O'Dell responds:  
</P>
<P>
 These are two good questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Steel framing is made with holes for plumbing and wiring to pass through, and 
several companies manufacture plastic insulating grommets that pop into the 
holes to keep the metal edges from touching wires. The grommets meet 
requirements of the Uniform Building Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel framing designer Bill Justus said that, in the unlikely event that a 
wire did break and a bare end did hit a piece of metal stud, there would not be 
a fire because it isn't a flammable material. "The chances are that it would 
just short out and pop the circuit breaker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for insulation against heat and cold, Justus recommends blown-in 
insulation, installed after the exterior walls are up and before the drywall is 
hung. 
</P>
<P>
 "It settles into all the nooks and crannies in the wall" and comes in a 
variety of R-values (an insulating measure) to meet whatever the local codes 
would require for a steel-framed building, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, builders can use high R-value rigid foam insulating sheets in 
standard four-inch-thick steel walls or use six-inch framing for the exteriors 
and fill it with an extra two inches of standard rolled insulating material. 
</P>
<P>
 An architect or engineer can determine the R-value of the insulation that will 
be needed with steel framing in any given locale.

O.C. PARENTS COME OUT IN DEFENSE OF GAY STUDENTS; FAMILY: THE HENIGANS, WITH 
HELP FROM THEIR OLDEST SON, ARE PERSUASIVE ADVOCATES IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY FUROR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Henigans wince when called the perfect family, and who could blame them? 
It's a lot of pressure to both embody and shatter the stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 The four kids are attractive high-achievers, the parents involved and doting. 
Dad Mike is the Fountain Valley High School athletic director. Mom Adrienne is 
a homemaker who became a college career specialist at the high school as her 
chicks left the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 On a suburban cul-de-sac they raised their daughters and sons -- the boys 
football stars who played college ball, the oldest at Harvard. It is easy to 
see why people view them like a 1950s television clan. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Henigans are kind of like the Cleavers -- if Wally was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 When students at the school made national headlines recently by demanding the 
right to have a gay support group on campus, the Henigans stepped into the 
spotlight and became perhaps their most convincing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the storm clouds formed, the couple quietly offered their support 
at the first meeting in October. But a month and a few news accounts later, the 
campus was hit with anti-gay flyers and pickets by students calling themselves 
the Future Good Boys of America. And the Henigans decided it was time, in the 
words of their gay son, "to have their own coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 By earlier this month they had spoken to about 500 emotional people at school 
board meetings, urging tolerance and support for the Fountain Valley High 
School Student Alliance, and read a moving letter from their alumnus son, who 
typified machismo but secretly suffered as a gay teen-ager who could not be 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The story behind why the reserved family did this touches on universal 
emotions between parents and children. Usually we see the extremes -- Oprah and 
Geraldo versions of what happens when Mom and Dad learn their child is gay, the 
cases of estrangement and shame and lonely holidays for the banished one. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly exist, but the Henigans have offered to tell a less hysterical 
story of how they've coped with learning their son was gay, a story they hope 
is more ordinary than extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldest son Patrick Henigan, at 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds, had been an all-league 
offensive lineman at football dynasty Fountain Valley High School; a student 
government leader with a 4.2 grade-point average whose classmates gave him the 
school's top honor, male student of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 What nobody knew was that he was so deeply depressed about his sexuality that 
by his 1986 graduation, he repeatedly considered killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after he went away to Harvard, played football and graduated with a 
history degree into a successful law job, Patrick broke the news of his 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The Henigan family cried, hugged and vowed to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have admired Patrick his whole life, since he was in first or second grade 
and starred in his Christmas play," father Mike says, voice breaking. "I've 
lived a somewhat one-dimensional life, but Patrick is very well-rounded, a 
loving and sensitive person who always remembers you. How could I suddenly not 
love him for one part of his life being different than mine?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was the summer of 1991 that the Henigans learned their son/brother/grandson 
was gay. And they were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick had returned home from his New Jersey paralegal job to attend his high 
school reunion, and with him came a 12-page letter for his family and friends. 
He wanted them to read it, then they would talk. In it, he explained that he 
was gay and how he came to that realization. It was angrier then, a bit of a 
love-me-or-leave-me tone to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shocked? Oh, yeah," Mike says. "He asked, 'Did you have any inklings?' and we 
had visited him earlier that summer, and earlier something didn't sit right, 
but it was some passing thing, so I'd have to say no, we had no inkling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of crying that first night. . . . With the HIV virus and I teach 
health -- not that it's a gay disease -- the first thing that comes to mind 
(is), he's going to die before me. Then you feel sorry for yourself: He'd make 
a wonderful father and we won't get to see all those things. . . . I told 
Patrick that night, 'You are just gonna have to give me a couple days to deal 
with this.' That's how I dealt with my father dying, big situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few days later," Mike says, "I gave him a hug, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says mother Adrienne: "The thing that bothered Mike and I the most that night 
as we were crying and talking to one another was . . . OK, maybe I'm not sure 
with this gay thing, but we know he will face discrimination from the outside 
world, but at least with his family, we wanted him to feel that this was a 
secure haven." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick says that he never feared his family would abandon him. He was afraid 
they would be uncomfortable with him and the family, as it was, would never be 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew I was lucky in the sense that from day one, they supported me 
and asked questions," Patrick, 26, said in a phone interview. "But for them to 
be so public about it and support me is really neat. When I hear of (gay) 
friends literally kicked out of their families, and it's never even spoken 
about -- they live with lovers 10 or 15 years and their parents never meet them 
-- it's pretty much a lie, even if they told their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's literally a double life, and that's not a family if you can't 
share what you do on a daily basis, and your relationships. I know people who 
are very, very out in the sense that they're very politically active, and yet 
their parents don't know. It just shocks me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I even had a relationship," Patrick adds, "I told my parents. It was 
weird. I never had a relationship or joined a (gay) community activity or did 
the bar scene, I just went home. And it felt like night and day after that, 
after telling them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Henigans had an advantage in their ability to cope. In 1978, Adrienne's 
brother had told their family that he was gay, and she was the one relative who 
accepted him. The Henigans spent much time with the brother, a successful real 
estate lawyer who had lived for 15 years in Santa Fe, N.M., with his mate and 
is "a wonderful man," Mike says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still not the same as your son or your daughter, of course, but there 
were a lot of issues we'd already worked out," Mike says. "We knew 
(homosexuality) wasn't something that you could change or think through. We 
believe that's the way you are, the way you were born." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did they know that more than a decade later, they would be facing off 
with hundreds of emotional parents who felt otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 As it tends to on a close-knit campus, news swiftly reached the Henigans last 
fall that gay students and their friends were forming a support group. A month 
into their meetings, the 30 or so gay and straight members called the group the 
Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance, the first of its kind in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, the Henigans say, they were still effectively in the closet 
about Patrick's homosexuality. They'd told friends and family whose acceptance 
they were sure of -- Patrick's two sisters and brother have fiercely supported 
him -- but they never felt the need to tell the world their son was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 And surely the students never thought to ask either of the Henigans for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they would have ever picked Mike," Adrienne noted with 
amusement, "just because of stereotypes. Just like we stereotype a gay person, 
we stereotype macho types too. Like just a gay person can be sensitive, but 
supposedly macho types can't be sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But on their own, Mike and Adrienne quietly lent their moral support to 
individual gay students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we weren't able to help Patrick," Adrienne says, "but if we could 
help one other kid who's going through some lonely journey, we should. Even if 
it was one kid, we wanted them to know that they weren't hated." 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, the placid veneer at this campus of 2,500 students began 
cracking. A few youths calling themselves the Future Good Boys of America 
stuffed flyers into lockers urging students to ban the gay and lesbian support 
group and decry homosexuality as "deviant" and "queer." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Joe Khalil says he and some friends printed the flyers but insisted 
they were not gay-bashers. "It's not prejudice," he explained, "we just don't 
want them around us." He and his friends were worried their high school would 
be viewed as "a gay school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this electric atmosphere that the Henigans went public, removing any 
lingering pretense faculty and community boosters may have held about their 
"straight" son. 
</P>
<P>
 With two weeks before Christmas, about 200 highly emotional parents, students 
and churchgoers crammed into the Huntington Beach Union High School District 
board chamber to debate whether the gay support group should be allowed to meet 
on campus. The Henigans read a gripping letter from Patrick, recalling his 
desperate feeling of aloneness and wish to end it by hurling himself onto the 
San Diego Freeway. The Henigans urged that the support group be allowed to meet 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board met again Jan. 11 and this time, 300 people spilled out into 
anterooms. Half of the crowd favored the alliance, citing an equal access law 
that allows any student group to meet on school grounds. Half of the crowd 
argued that educators would be accepting homosexuality by allowing a gay 
student group meeting. The alliance won. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us don't necessarily understand homosexuality, but I think it's 
valuable to know that gay people are normal people," says Mike, who was 
initially reluctant to share his family's story because the student group 
deserved the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for people to know that Patrick is from a 'good family,' a 
supportive family, so what difference does it make. . . . We're lucky, and it 
is not over yet. A lot of people are very, very upset that, as a teacher and a 
coach at Fountain Valley, that I've stood up for this group." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Robert Dodge, a member of the track team and former football player, 
and now a member of the Future Good Boys of America, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge vehemently opposes the gay students meeting on school property. After 
the school board ruled that the alliance could do just that, Dodge says his 
friend vowed to start the Beer Club "and I'm thinking of starting the 
Heterosexual Student Alliance. It is to make a point." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Dodge says there has been no interest in the Heterosexual 
Alliance, so he is now starting the Bestiality Club, hoping to alarm parents 
into challenging the school board that defended its decision because the equal 
access law says all groups or none. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge thinks the Henigans should not have spoken out as district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, he's a nice guy," Dodge says of Mike Henigan. "I can understand 
him wanting to support his son and all but . . . he should be speaking as a 
father and not as an employee of the school." 
</P>
<P>
 They were perhaps understandably well-chosen words about Mike the morning 
after the Future Good Boys' stinging defeat at the volatile school board 
meeting. It was so tense and crowded that police had to monitor people leaving 
so that others could take their place. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through, Dodge says, he left the auditorium for a television interview 
and an officer refused to let him back in. It was Henigan who explained the 
unfairness of keeping Dodge out when he'd claimed his seat two hours before the 
meeting began. When the officer still refused Dodge, Henigan and others took it 
up with a supervisor, and Dodge was eventually allowed back in. 
</P>
<P>
 As parents of a gay son, Mike and Adrienne still have their adjustments cut 
out for them, of course, their awkward moments, their unanswered questions. 
When Patrick broke the news, he had not yet had a homosexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick is living with a friend now," Mike explains. "I said, 'Now, do we 
call him your boyfriend? Or . . . what do we call him?' He's in a relationship 
with a young man. They came to visit us, spent two weeks with us, went to Las 
Vegas. So it's real. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably for me as a man . . . I have a hard time with heterosexual young 
boys or girls being openly affectionate in public. . . . So for me, seeing men 
holding hands with men, that's a stage I'll still have to go through -- that 
still bothers me. But Adrienne's brother, and Patrick and his friend, they 
haven't been openly that way, so we haven't had to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Patrick says, his dad shows "in so many small ways" that he has 
accepted a gay son. Recently he mentioned that, perhaps next year, Patrick will 
have a boyfriend in the Henigan family portrait. His father also kidded him 
that he would tell people it was a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been easier to adjust, the Henigans admit candidly, because their son 
does not look or behave differently, that he is not feminine in appearance, 
that he does not suddenly seem like a stranger. That he is definitely "the same 
Patrick we've always known," says his proud mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the crying, worrying, fretting," says Mike, "you see that your 
picture of what your son's going to grow up and be is gone. You have to adjust 
it. Then after awhile, you realize you don't have to adjust to it that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the perfect family . . . but we let our children be who they are."

 SHOP TALK: Forget about quake damage to our psyches! Let's get down to what 
really matters: Where can we go shopping? Actually, a lot of places. Many of 
the malls made it through without too much damage, though some department 
stores may not open for weeks or even months.(B12) 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE CHANNEL: It may not get the ratings of the Home Shopping Network or MTV, 
but a new cable channel has emerged to give 24-hour earthquake information. 
It's the Recovery Channel, being shown at disaster assistance sites and 
recovery offices. . . . It is carried on KLCS Channel 58 and on a 
government-access channel. (F2) 
</P>
<P>
 ALMIGHTY BUCK: Never is that wonderful entrepreneurial spirit more alive than 
in the wake of natural disasters, and the quake is certainly no exception. From 
elaborate T-shirts with maps of the temblor's epicenter to broken souvenirs 
from freeways and the homes of celebrities, vendors (above) are cashing in 
big-time. . . . But weren't those no-quake cakes prepared by the West Hills 
Pavilions perhaps in slightly bad taste? "No, they taste great," said a 
spokeswoman. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 TAX RELIEF: The American Dream is in ruins, and you face foreclosure. What's 
that got to do with your taxes? Displaced Valley homeowners want to know. The 
IRS suggests calling (800) 829-1040 to request proper forms or visiting 
representatives stationed at FEMA sites. (A1) 
</P>
<P>
 COLLEGE GOAL: Crescenta Valley High's Sarah Hagman was blowing any opportunity 
for a basketball scholarship to college, and her senior year was only months 
away. But then Daddy came to the rescue. All summer, after her supportive 
father spray-painted a three-point arc on a court at a local park, Hagman 
practiced her long-range shooting. . . . It paid off. She has set three-point 
records, and both opponents and college recruiters are paying attention. (C14)

 MIGHTY CLIPPERS: The good news is that the Anaheim Arena reported 
record-breaking ticket sales Thursday. The bad news? Neither of the teams 
playing was from Orange County.The L.A. Clippers had borrowed the arena for a 
game against the New York Knicks since their own arena suffered earthquake 
damage. But Mighty Duck fans say it's no reflection on the home team. "The

 DIRECTOR COBB: Working Woman magazine lists Jewel Plummer Cobb, retired

"corporate divas" who pull down big bucks to serve on corporate boards. The 
February issue says Cobb hauled in $220,651 in 1992 to serve on the board of 
directors of several companies, including First Interstate Bank Corp. . . . But 
Plummer is downplaying the ranking, saying she knows of several women who made 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG SPENDERS: Imagine watching those 30-minute TV infomercials for a living. A 
Tustin firm not only reviews each one, but ranks them by the amount of money 
spent to air them. Jordan Whitney Inc. figures producers shelled out $450 
million last year for so-called paid programming. . . . The big spender at $25 
million: a half-hour production with singer Dionne Warwick called Psychic 
Friends, which offers viewers a 900-telephone line to discuss psychic 
phenomena.

SENTENCING DELAYED IN HOOD TRIAL; COURTS: JURORS IN MURDER CASE OF MILLIONAIRE 
NEWPORT BEACH DEVELOPER MAY HAVE IMPROPERLY DISCUSSED TESTIMONY. DEFENSE

<P>
 Adding another twist to an unusual murder case, a judge postponed sentencing 
Friday for millionaire Newport Beach developer James N. Hood after learning 
jurors may have improperly discussed the case outside of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing an orange jail uniform and looking thin from his month in custody, 
Hood, 50, sat silently as San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Michael A. 
Smith gave attorneys until Feb. 28 to investigate the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Philip C. Bourdette said he may seek a new trial if jurors 
violated a court order to limit discussions of the case to the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit solicited by the defense team, juror Daniel Aceves said he 
overheard fellow jurors talking about testimony, witnesses and the legal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discussing the case without being given instructions, or hearing all the 
evidence, that's improper," Bourdette said after Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the results of the last trial, and neither does Mr. Hood," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a first jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict, a second jury 
convicted Hood last month of first-degree murder for the March 22, 1992, 
shooting of Bruce E. Beauchamp, a former construction worker employed by Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Hood had earlier hired Beauchamp to kill his wife, Bonnie 
Hood, who was murdered at her Sierra Nevada lodge in Tulare County in August, 
1990, so that Hood could collect on a $500,000 insurance policy. Then, 
prosecutors believe, Hood decided to silence the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchamp was acquitted of any involvement in Bonnie Hood's murder, despite an 
eyewitness -- Bonnie Hood's lover, who was in bed with her at the time of the 
shooting and was wounded. Hood has always denied any involvement in his wife's 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hood claimed he was acting in self defense when he shot and killed Beauchamp 
in March, 1992, in Fontana. He faces 30 years to life in prison.

MIKE PENNER: PENS STOP WHEN BROADWAY JOE TAKES A BUFFALO STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Well," Joe Namath said as he sized up another Super Bowl in which the 
underdog has absolutely no chance whatsoever, "I got the Bills winning, 38-30." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years have passed, and Broadway Joe hasn't lost a step. As the 
E.F. Hutton of Super Bowl prognostication, he can still work a room, work it 
into a lather, and Namath grinned mischievously as he studied his handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportswriters stopped writing. Heads bobbed upward in unison. A wave of 
tittering started to swell. 
</P>
<P>
 "You playing?" someone asked Namath. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, but if I could play, I'd still be out there trying. It's a fun game to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Namath's New York Jets in 1969, Buffalo enters this Super Bowl as a 
double-digit underdog. Unlike those Jets, these Bills have no one cocksure 
enough to stare down the odds and declare, "We're going to win the game, I 
guarantee it" -- the most famous sentence uttered in 28 years of Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 This is possibly because the Bills know their place, which, for the past three 
Januarys, has been on the bottom of a dog pile. In 1969, the Jets didn't know 
any better. They were 0-0 against the favored Baltimore Colts and 0-0 in Super 
Bowls. They hadn't lost to anyone by a score of 52-17 -- not recently, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Jets knew about the Colts was what they saw on film, and, as Namath 
remembers it, none of his teammates were especially impressed by the special 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving to practice one day," Namath said. "Billy Mathis was driving, 
Babe Parilli was riding shotgun, and 'Big Boy' Pete Lammons, our tight end, was 
in the back seat with me. We'd just finished a meeting, and Pete leans back and 
says, 'Y'all know something? We keep looking at these films, we're gonna get 
overconfident.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We laughed, we giggled, but that was the underlying feeling. We really 
believed we were going to win. To a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Namath was the only one to put it on the record, though. Friday, Namath was 
asked if he had premeditated his attack, choosing his words intentionally to 
light a fuse, much the way Jimmy Johnson did before last week's NFC final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just came out, it wasn't prepared," Namath said. "I was at the Miami 
Touchdown Club accepting an award. I got up to the podium to speak, and this 
fella in the back yelled out, 'Hey, Namath, we're going to kick your 
you-know-what.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I said, 'Wait a minute. It's my turn. I'm at the podium now. I've been 
listening to you guys for 10 days now, and I got news for you. We're going to 
win the game, I guarantee it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just out of that old business of ballplayers wanting respect. How 
many times have you heard guys in baseball, football or whatever say, 'Well, we 
want to get the respect'? 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't feel our team had won any respect, even though we knew we beat a 
team that was excellent -- the Oakland Raiders -- to get the Super Bowl. It was 
still the AFL syndrome -- 'a second-rate league to the NFL.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad we had a hand in settling that." 
</P>
<P>
 Namath backed it up, 16-7, but before he could, he had to withstand three days 
of national ridicule, and one death threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weeb Ewbank, our coach, wanted to kill me," Namath said. "He was very upset 
the following morning, and justifiably. Weeb had done a brilliant job of 
downplaying our expertise and hyping the Colts' talent. He really believed he 
had the Colts thinking, 'Hey, the Jets are OK, but we'll wipe 'em up, we'll 
kill 'em.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Weeb thought they were overconfident and thought me opening my mouth would 
give them fuel." 
</P>
<P>
 The mind games would continue on the floor of the Orange Bowl that Sunday. The 
Jets didn't outhit or outplay the Colts so much as outthink them. With the 
Colts thinking pass, the Jets ran. With Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall 
throwing into the slot, the Jets swarmed the middle and left Jimmy Orr 
unattended yards downfield, intercepting the ball while Orr waved his arms in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr still laments that play, insisting history would have changed if Morrall 
had only looked to his left, but Namath tweaks him, teasing, "He thought he was 
open. Our free safety, Billy Baird, swears to this day that he could've closed 
on the throw and made the play. Now Billy swears on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, Namath returns to the Super Bowl to flip the coin 
that decides if Dallas receives and scores first, or Buffalo receives and 
fumbles. Twenty-five years. That makes Namath 50, a number he says "still 
confuses me." 
</P>
<P>
 After knee replacement surgery in 1992 -- on both legs -- Namath claims he 
feels better today than ever. "That's why the number throws me a bit," he says. 
"I have a buddy who's 35, and he's worried, talking about down the road. He 
says, 'You know, 25 years from now is not so far away.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Far away? It's a flash. Twenty-five years -- where did it go? It's scary. I 
have a hard time believing I'm 50, because 50 is such a big number." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe deals with it the same way he dealt with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicts he: "I plan on living till 100, so I'm only at halftime. I still got 
the third and fourth quarters ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 As for that other forecast, Joe finally had to fess up. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills, 38-30? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a hand in it," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I think Dallas is the team that's going to win, but, again, I'm 
hoping for the other guys. Having been an underdog myself, I'd like to see the 
Bills win. Dallas has won it already. Let's see somebody else do it and get to 
enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hand shot up from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 How would Namath and the Jets have fared against the Bills and the Cowboys 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different game, naturally. I doubt that we'd fare very well right 
now," Joe had to admit. 
</P>
<P>
 He was grinning that grin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are a little older than those guys."

HARDING CONTROLS HER SPIN; FIGURE SKATING: SHE FOLLOWS HER TEARFUL ADMISSION 
WITH ATTEMPTS TO SOFTEN IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, at week's end, perhaps a forthright comparison to a three-ring circus is 
in order -- call it the spectacle of American women's figure skating, under the 
Portland Big Top. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the suburbs is Tonya Harding, for everyone to see, in an all-out public 
relations press to save her place on the U.S. Olympic figure skating team. On 
Friday she's smiling, she's playing, she's telling the country she's just 
ordinary folk, but can be a lady when she needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry this happened, you know . . . ," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown at the courthouse is glowering prosecutor Norman Frink, slipping down 
a hallway, banging shut his door and forging ahead, widening still further the 
already colossal investigation of Harding and the attack on rival skater Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be fools to be on an Olympic schedule!" he snaps to those who are 
growing impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter officials of U.S. Figure Skating Assn., enlisting their own Portland 
attorney to dive into the scandal, asking whether Harding's half-way mea culpa 
of a day earlier is enough to to bounce her from the team for violating the 
Olympic code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "The highest standards of ethical behavior and good sportsmanship" are the 
stated terms for their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, supporters hoisted a Go-For-The-Gold-Tonya banner at the Portland 
convention center. Before long, it was vandalized by egg throwers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games women's figure skating begins with a draw 
Feb. 21 for the order of performance. No skater can be replaced after that. It 
is possible, now, to conceive that the drama of Harding could stretch to then, 
if she chooses to make it so. 
</P>
<P>
 Her public appearances Friday indicated nothing to the contrary. Back on the 
ice at a suburban mall, she was cheered on by a crowd that has grown in size 
and enthusiasm. Rather than merely a couple of hundred fans who watched her 
practice earlier in the week, there were more than 2,000 on hand to shout their 
approval. A spoilsport who booed was escorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the support, Harding turned in a controlled, relaxed 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Portrayed so often lately as a hard-scrabble, self-absorbed woman, Harding 
tried to show a softer side. She arrived early, mixed and played with younger 
skaters, and then joined in the traditional birthday hazing of a 9-year-old. 
After others pulled the boy's skates off, Harding took hold of his feet and 
dragged him around on the ice playfully. Supporters by the hundreds applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really nice," birthday boy Chance Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she kept it up in a televised interview with the tabloid newsmagazine 
Inside Edition. It was taped earlier, but aired Friday. In it, Harding sobbed 
and then apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "What do you have to say to Kerrigan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding: "That I'm really sorry that this happened, you know. . . . I just 
hope that she can some day forgive me . . . and we can go back to being friends 
and teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "What would you like America to know about Tonya Harding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding: "I'm just like everybody else. . . . A lot of people put me down 
because I drive a truck. . . . Well, I like to drive trucks. . . . Yet, you 
know, I can still mingle with the best. . . . When I need to act like a lady, I 
can act like a lady." 
</P>
<P>
 The show declined to say whether Harding was paid for the interview, but 
agents for such programs have offered less important figures in the case many 
thousands of dollars for their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 This attempt at image softening followed a Thursday appearance before cameras 
in which Harding confessed that she had withheld knowledge of the crime. Yes, 
she said, she had learned of the plot against Kerrigan after the fact and did 
not tell authorities. And yes, contrary to her earlier statements, people 
around her were involved. But no, she did not hatch the scheme and knew nothing 
of it beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 As theater, it might have succeeded. It was Harding's maiden attempt to 
address the case, she did it with a deep show of emotion. It was also her first 
personal expressions of sorrow for pain caused Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 23-year-old skater might have done more harm than good to her hopes of 
staying on the Olympic team. Until that moment, the figure skating association 
and the U.S. Olympic Committee had nothing to hold against Harding except the 
arrest of her former husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they have her own admission that she withheld the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 After days of frustration over the pace of the Portland investigation and the 
utter lack of sympathy by law enforcement officials for Olympic deadlines, the 
association said it would take its own steps. First, it formed a five-member 
panel to weigh the case against the broadly worded code of conduct for Olympic 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Friday, the panel hired Portland attorney John Bennett to gather 
evidence. He joins at least 10 other lawyers who are actively engaged in the 
case in one way or another. A first meeting of the panel was scheduled for 
Tuesday and a second for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But any action against Harding would be subject to ratification and a possible 
hearing before the USOC Games Administration Committee, which by then will have 
control of the team rosters. Any decision unfavorable to the skater can be 
appealed to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a sports organization endeavoring to provide due process to an 
athlete, but still enforcing the rules of the association in terms of its code 
of conduct, the highest standards of ethical behavior and good sportsmanship," 
said William Hybl, the former chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee. He was 
chosen to head the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC said it has received 70-80 phone calls a day and accumulated several 
hundred letters and faxes. So far, opinion runs 80% against Harding, with a 
good chunk of her supporters calling from the 503 area code in Portland. 
Naturally, officials said they will not be swayed by these numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was a first sign of serious pressure against Harding from the 
Kerrigan camp. While the Massachusetts skater continued her practice workouts, 
coach Mary Scotvold suggested Harding quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has never happened before in figure skating. There's just no precedent 
that I can even relate this to. I would probably say she would do herself some 
good to withdraw," Scotvold said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Portland prosecutors continued to amass evidence. On Friday, 
the district attorney issued subpoenas, marked secret, asking local television 
stations to produce videotape of anything broadcast with Harding speaking since 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan was struck on the leg and knocked out of the figure skating 
championships in Detroit on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding returned from the national competition -- which she won -- to 
Portland on Jan. 10, she told one local station she believed her former husband 
was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said. "I mean, why does someone want to discredit 
me? I just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 In her Thursday statement, Harding did not specify exactly when she learned of 
the plot. Police have arrested four men, including her former husband, Jeff 
Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly is widely reported to be bargaining with prosecutors for leniency in 
exchange for his testimony against Harding.

MIGHTY DUCKS GET THE BROOM OUT FOR RANGERS; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM'S 3-2 VICTORY ENDS 
NEW YORK'S WINNING STREAK AND GIVES THE EXPANSION FRANCHISE A SWEEP OF THE 
SEASON SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Rangers have won 32 games this season, more than any other team 
in the NHL. But no matter how many more they win, they won't win one against 
the Mighty Ducks in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who beat the Rangers at Madison Square Garden in the franchise's 
first road game Oct. 19, completed the improbable sweep Friday with a 3-2 
victory, sending most of the sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena into 
raucous cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win against the best team in hockey at home for our fans and our players 
is special," said Coach Ron Wilson, whose team won consecutive home games for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really pumped up to beat them," said goalie Guy Hebert, who made 28 
saves. "We held on against a great team and played hard for 60 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The early-season loss to the Ducks caused frustrated Ranger Coach Mike Keenan 
to break a stick over the crossbar at practice the next day. This time, he 
stood behind the bench in what looked like disbelief after the Ducks won their 
20th game of the season, its second at his team's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there was a revenge factor, but that was a long time ago," Wilson 
said. "It's tough for them to go back-to-back -- that was an emotional game 
they played (an overtime victory over the Kings Thursday night.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keenan: "We showed symptoms of a little bit of fatigue tonight, no 
question about it. We didn't have the normal jump we do in most games . . . but 
we still had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers came from two goals back to tie it, 2-2, but Duck defenseman Bobby 
Dollas broke the tie at 3:25 of the third with a hard shot from low in the slot 
after Troy Loney, while forechecking, helped separate Alexander Karpovtsev from 
the puck. Joe Sacco brought it around from behind the net to set up the play. 
</P>
<P>
 There was still a battle ahead though, because the Rangers went on a 
four-minute power play at 11:44 when Terry Yake was given a double-minor for 
high-sticking Alexei Kovalev. But the Rangers managed only one shot during the 
long power play, and after that, Hebert needed to hold them off only another 4 
1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a physical, fight-filled game, but the Ducks prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the team before the game, 'Expect to be hit, and let's answer a hit 
for a hit,' " Wilson said. "When we got up, 2-0, they put their big tough guys 
out. They were asking us to answer the bell and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Ewen answered it on one side of the ice against Nick Kypreos, and on the 
far boards, Stu Grimson tangled with Joey Kocur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-0, after the first period. Bob Corkum scored his team-leading 
17th goal at 8:41 when his pass meant for Tim Sweeney in the slot went in off 
the skate of Ranger defenseman Kevin Lowe. Sweeney made it 2-0 with a 
power-play goal from the bottom of the right circle off a pass from Yake at 
16:40. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had more and better chances than the Rangers, but goalie Glenn Healy 
-- who was a Duck for a day between phases of the expansion draft in June -- 
helped keep them from capitalizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They surprised me with their offense," Healy said. "They had as many chances 
against us as any team we've played lately. I thought we'd get just a sheltered 
defensive game from them, but that's not what it turned out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by the end of the second period, Ranger captain Mark Messier had scored 
twice, and the Rangers had caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier scored off an assist by Kovalev at 12:05, then sent the Rangers in 
tied at the second intermission by beating Hebert between the pads on a 
breakaway with 40 seconds left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only two goals they got, we made a couple of mental mistakes and a 
superstar scored both goals," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played a hell of a game," said Ranger Esa Tikkanen. "They deserved to 
win." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have signed junior hockey player Mike Maneluk, 20, to a multi-year 
contract, but he will not join the organization until next season. Maneluk, a 
left wing, has never been drafted but has 43 goals and 41 assists in 50 games 
with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Hockey League. He is likely to play 
for minor-league affiliate San Diego next year. "Maneluk is an extremely 
talented offensive player with great speed," said David McNab, director of 
player personnel. . . . Defenseman Sean Hill played after missing nine games 
with a sprained left shoulder. . . . Defenseman Alexei Kasatonov was scratched 
because of a foot bruise suffered Wednesday against Winnipeg. . . . Steven King 
has been the forward scratched the last two games to make way for the return of 
Anatoli Semenov.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER; MANY TRACKED PEARSALL, USC GOT HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER

<P>
 Grant Pearsall doesn't have great speed. He can't jump very high. And by most 
college football standards, at 6-feet-1 and 190 pounds, he isn't very big. 
</P>
<P>
 So, exactly why was Pearsall, a Times first-team All-Orange County selection 
from Villa Park High, one of the most heavily recruited defensive backs in 
Southern California? And why were coaches Terry Donahue (UCLA), John Robinson 
(USC) and Rich Brooks (Oregon) in his living room at various times the past two 
weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 First, let him try to explain: 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches tell me they need someone who's like a quarterback on the 
field, someone who can call the defensive signals," says Pearsall, who excelled 
as a tailback last season and also split time between strong and free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always size and speed that count the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rushing for 1,551 yards and scoring 23 touchdowns -- five on kick 
returns -- in his senior season, Pearsall leaves little doubt which platoon he 
prefers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense has always been my favorite," he says. "You get to be a little more 
wild, a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably my favorite thing about the game is to come up and make the big 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 College scouts and recruiters noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's aggressive, tough and does a lot of things well," says Dick Lascola, 
head of the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn., which provides videotape 
and written scouting reports on high school and junior college football players 
for nearly 100 colleges across the country. "He really makes things happen out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a Pacific 10 Conference defensive coordinator: "Grant Pearsall is a 
terrific player. You need guys like him on your team." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pearsall, tackling a ballcarrier in the open field was easy compared to 
picking a college. First, he narrowed his original list to four schools -- 
UCLA, USC, Arizona State and Oregon. Then he agonized over several factors: His 
oldest brother, Jay, has a year left at Arizona State (another brother, Brian, 
plays football at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo); his girlfriend, Kayli Whitley, 
attends Oregon. And, although he felt no pressure, Pearsall admitted that his 
parents, Jim and Linda, preferred that he stay close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 After his final recruiting visit last weekend, to USC, Pearsall talked things 
over with his family and made his announcement earlier this week: He would 
become a Trojan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough decision," Pearsall said. "(USC Coach) John Robinson has won a 
national championship before and that's always been a dream of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Pearsall: "John Robinson is a nice man. He came in early and offered 
Grant a scholarship early, and how can you forget that?" 
</P>
<P>
 High school and junior college football players can begin signing letters of 
intent Wednesday. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Both USC and UCLA seem on the verge of excellent recruiting classes. The 
Trojans' group should rank among the top five in the country, while the Bruins 
are putting together a solid top 10 or 15 class. USC could end up signing as 
many as 10 community college players, an unusually high number for a top 
program, in a large class numbering about 25. The latest of four community 
college players to enroll in time for the spring semester at USC was defensive 
end Israel Ifeanyi (6-4, 230) of Orange Coast, a native of Nigeria. In 
addition, USC has unwritten commitments from offensive linemen Richard Beatie 
(6-6, 290) of Glendale, Heath Baughman (6-7, 290) of Bakersfield and Jesse 
Gomez (6-3, 260) of Santa Ana Rancho Santiago, who was recruited primarily as a 
long snapper; cornerback Mario Bradley (6-2, 180) of Cerritos, and tailback 
Leonard Green (6-foot, 180) of Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, who attended 
high school in Silver Spring, Md., and picked the Trojans over Maryland. USC is 
still recruiting defensive lineman Anthony Sanford (6-6, 270) of Pasadena, who 
has also visited Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top running-back prospects in the country, Delon Washington (5-10, 
180) of Dallas, committed to the Trojans this week, along with another Texan, 
defensive lineman Antoine Simpson of La Porte. However, Washington, Simpson and 
another top recruit who committed to USC, Marlin Carey (5-10, 185) of San Diego 
Mt. Carmel, have not qualified academically. Other high school standouts who 
gave commitments to USC recently were: offensive lineman David Pratchard (6-4, 
245) of Canyon, linebacker Bob Aubrey (6-3, 215) of St. Francis, defensive 
lineman Marc Matock (6-5, 250) of Salinas, tight end Rome Douglas (6-7, 250) of 
Claremont, wide receiver Larry Parker (6-2, 180) of Bakersfield, linebacker 
Willie Perryman (6-4, 215) of Burbank, tackle Ken Bowen (6-7, 315) of Orlando, 
Fla., cornerback Prentice Hill (5-8, 170) of Dallas Carter, and defensive back 
Brian Kelly (6-0,185) of Aurora, Colo. Wide receiver-cornerback Leon Blunt 
(5-10, 180) of San Fernando, who committed to Notre Dame last month, took an 
official visit to USC last weekend. He has also visited UCLA. Blunt "changes 
his mind every hour" between Notre Dame and USC, according to a source close to 
the athlete. Blunt has said publicly that he would honor his commitment to 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are hoping to get some good news this weekend from All-American 
kicker Adam Abrams (5-9, 170) of La Jolla, who is expected to announce his 
choice -- USC or Notre Dame. Reportedly, Abrams, brother of Stanford sophomore 
kicker Eric Abrams, favors USC while his father would prefer that he attend 
Notre Dame. USC is also awaiting the decision of defensive line star Darrell 
Russell (6-5, 290) of San Diego St. Augustine. Russell, widely considered the 
West Coast's top prospect, will choose from among USC, Cal and Michigan. He has 
eliminated UCLA. According to his coach, Joe Medina, Russell had his best 
recruiting trip to Cal. . . . Add USC: Having lost their top quarterback 
prospect, Scott Covington (6-3, 175) of Dana Hills, who committed to Miami, the 
Trojans had been recruiting Brad Otten (6-6, 215), who left Weber State after 
showing promise last season as a freshman. Otten, from Tumwater, Wash., told 
USC coaches Friday that he has decided to attend Washington State. He will be 
eligible to play immediately as a sophomore, thanks to a rule just passed 
regarding transfers from Division I-AA schools to Division I-A. . . . Last add 
USC: The Trojans are still recruiting offensive lineman Caleb Brown (6-4, 290) 
of Santa Barbara San Marcos. Brown's short list includes USC, UCLA, Cal, 
Arizona State and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's recruiting class was dealt a blow this week when offensive lineman Rick 
Austin (6-2, 300) of Rialto Eisenhower, who committed to the Bruins last month, 
changed his mind and decided to sign with Washington State. However, UCLA did 
receive commitments from fullback Jarvis Watson (5-11, 215) of Downey Warren; 
safety-wide receiver Larry Atkins (6-2, 175) of Venice; tight end Ryan Neufeld 
(6-3, 210) of Morgan Hill, a suburb of San Jose, and junior college linebacker 
Tim Waddleton (6-3, 215) of Hutchinson, Kan. Atkins also visited Arizona State 
and Oregon. According to a UCLA assistant coach, Neufeld is a receiver in the 
mold of former Bruin and current Ram Sean LaChapelle. He also visited Cal, 
Washington, Arizona State and Oregon. . . . Add recruit: One of the passengers 
on Waddleton's flight from Kansas City for his recruiting visit to UCLA last 
weekend was USC Coach John Robinson, who got on the plane in Denver, took a 
seat in first class and apparently was unaware of Waddleton's presence. 
Waddleton picked the Bruins over Wisconsin, Indiana, Kansas and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent UCLA commitments: cornerback-wide receiver Javelin Guidry (5-10, 
165) of Cerritos Gahr, brother of UCLA freshman defensive back Paul Guidry; 
standout wide receivers Jim McElroy (5-11, 165) of Washington High and Tod 
McBride (6-2, 180) of Walnut, and offensive lineman Terry Williams (6-6, 260) 
of Placentia El Dorado. UCLA is hoping to sign wide receiver-cornerback Kenny 
Haslip (5-10, 160) of Pasadena Muir, an outstanding athlete who is also 
considering USC and Colorado. In addition, the Bruins may be the leader for 
highly regarded tight end Sheldon Jackson (6-4, 220) of Damien LaVerne. Jackson 
is visiting Cal this weekend; his other trips were to UCLA, Oklahoma, Arizona 
and Nebraska. The Bruins are also competing with the Cornhuskers and Miami for 
defensive lineman Jason McCullough (6-5, 250), a native of Allentown, Pa., who 
attends a prep school in Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lost two coveted prospects to Notre Dame: All-American wide receiver Ty 
Goode (6-1, 185) of Lincoln, Neb., and linebacker-safety John McLaughlin (6-4, 
215) of Hart High. Now the Bruins are going head-to-head with the Irish for one 
of the country's top running-back prospects, Clement Stokes (6-1, 195) of 
Washington, D.C., Archbishop Carroll. Stokes said Thursday that he would like 
to attend UCLA but his mother favored Notre Dame or Syracuse. His brother, Sim, 
is a freshman defensive back at Notre Dame. How highly regarded is Stokes? 
During a recruiting visit last weekend, Syracuse coaches told him that he would 
wear jersey No. 44 -- the same one worn at Syracuse by such legendary running 
backs as Jim Brown, Ernie Davis and Floyd Little. 
</P>
<P>
 Add UCLA: Contrary to a published report, the Bruins are not recruiting junior 
college quarterback Tony Banks (6-5, 210) of San Diego Mesa. However, the 
Bruins had hoped to sign another San Diego prospect, linebacker Terrell Cade 
(6-3, 220) of Lincoln High, but he committed to Colorado. Two other losses this 
week were linebacker Brandon Williams (6-4, 240) of Buffalo, who chose 
Wisconsin over UCLA, and defensive lineman Cliff Scott (6-3, 245) of Milpitas. 
Scott picked Cal over the Bruins and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford is assembling its second consecutive standout recruiting class under 
Coach Bill Walsh. More good news came this week when Placentia Valencia 
fullback-linebacker Chris Draft (6-1, 205), also a top baseball prospect, chose 
the Cardinal over UCLA and USC. Other players who committed to Stanford this 
week include defensive backs Corey Hill (6-1, 200) of Tucson and Jeff Allen 
(6-4, 195) of Olympia, Wash. Hill picked Stanford over Notre Dame. Though 
Stanford did lose its top tight end prospect, Stephen Alexander (6-5, 230) of 
Chickasha, Okla., to Oklahoma, the Cardinal remains the favorite to sign two of 
the best wide receivers in the country: Anthony Bookman (5-8, 170) of Dallas 
and Damon Dunn (5-9, 170) of Arlington, Tex. However, Bookman is still 
considering Texas, while Dunn also likes Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive lineman Jason Rempel (6-5, 250) of Calabasas is taking a recruiting 
trip to San Jose State this weekend. He has also visited UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Jelani Gardner, the 6-6 All-American point guard from Bellflower 
St. John Bosco, took a recruiting trip to Minnesota last weekend. He has one 
more official visit scheduled, to Syracuse, where he'll watch the Orangemen 
play Kentucky Feb. 12 in the Carrier Dome. Last week, Cal Coach Todd Bozeman 
and Arizona State assistant George McQuarn were at St. John Bosco to see 
Gardner score 16 points as the Braves beat St. Francis 52-46. Gardner, as 
unselfish as he is talented, attended the UCLA-Arizona game at Pauley Pavilion 
last week, and said his top three college choices were Arkansas, UCLA and 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Bozeman: Cal continues to recruit Gardner, too, and Bozeman's reputation 
as a "player's coach" and relentless recruiter could bode well for the Bears. 
Bozeman, as an assistant coach to the since-fired Lou Campanelli, was given 
much of the credit for Jason Kidd's surprising decision two years ago to spurn 
such national basketball powers as Kansas and Kentucky to sign with Cal. 
Ironically, the recruitment of Kidd is reported to be at the heart of an NCAA 
inquiry into the Cal basketball program that, according to sources close to the 
case, will be outlined in an official letter to the school within the next 
month. The timing couldn't be worse for Bozeman and his staff, what with the 
spring signing period for basketball players beginning April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharoah Davis, a 6-5 forward from Highland High in Palmdale who made an oral 
commitment to San Diego State last fall but ended up not signing, has played 
well enough this season to attract interest from such schools as Arizona State, 
Oregon, Utah and Loyola Marymount, in addition to San Diego State.

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE / BOYS' BASKETBALL; CENTURY BACKS ITS ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Century went to Trabuco Hills on Friday night and insisted on a share of first 
place in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions administered a 80-57 beating to the Mustangs on their court, in 
front of their normally rabid fans, who sat stunned throughout. Century even 
beat the Mustangs at their transition game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a satisfying moment for the Centurions, who are tied with the Mustangs 
for first. The Centurions can even now forget that 57-54 overtime loss to 
Trabuco Hills earlier this season -- a game in which Century made only 11 of 27 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our kids were upset about that game," Coach Greg Coombs said. "I 
think they knew they should have won. I think they were tired of hearing about 
those free throws." 
</P>
<P>
 Those frustrations were taken out on the Mustangs, especially on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (17-5, 5-1) averages more than 70 points but had only 21 through 
2 1/2 quarters. Ryan Karnoff was averaging 20 points but scored only eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The freewheeling Mustangs, ranked third in Orange County, were stifled at 
every turn. They scored only two points off the fast break in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Their half-court offense was limited to one shot, usually a poor one. Second 
opportunities were almost nonexistent. Trabuco Hills had only two offensive 
rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 As for three pointers, one of the Mustangs' specialties, they made one. 
Karnoff, who had 67 three-pointers entering the game, had none. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if it wasn't for Rob Warnick's 22 points, it would have been a 
complete embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted come here and tell them (pause) to show them, who plays defense," 
Century guard Hector Negrete said. "All those points we scored were because of 
our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions (19-3, 5-1), ranked eighth in the county, were as aggressive on 
offense as they were on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete, who averages nine points, scored a career-high 25. The Mustangs 
concentrated their defensive efforts on Thomas Harmon and Ike Harmon, leaving 
Negrete free to do as he pleased. He scored 14 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That relieved the pressure on the Harmon brothers. Ike scored 16 and Thomas 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Century led 22-9 at the end of the first quarter and 34-17 at halftime. The 
lead swelled to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions shot 50% from the field and made, yes made , 30 of 39 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here on a mission," Negrete said. 
</P>
<P>
 And left tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 51, Laguna Beach 48 -- Mike Scaglione scored 26 points to lead 
the Hawks (8-11, 3-3).

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; HOT-SHOOTING SANTA MARGARITA BEATS UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Santa Margarita's leading scorer, Brian Finneran, sidelined because of a 
broken foot and the Eagles coming off an overtime loss to Woodbridge, the 
Eagles appeared ripe for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita, ranked fifth in the county, even played University's up-tempo 
style game Friday night . . . and still won, posting an 84-72 Sea View League 
victory over the Trojans at Santa Margarita High. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita shot 57% (35 for 62) from the field, including six for 14 from 
three-point range, and Brian's twin brother, Brad, had 22 points and seven 
rebounds to lead the Eagles (16-5, 8-1 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 But Brad was only one of many Eagles to step up their play. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Jeff Hopkins had 16 points and three three-pointers and forward Brenden 
Mulligan finished with 11 points, 11 rebounds, and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Dennis Keane came off the bench to score 18 points, including 15 in 
the second quarter when he made seven consecutive shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give them credit, they shot really well tonight," University Coach Mike 
Dinneen said. "We had our opportunities, but every time we'd make a run, they 
would make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Demitrius Zeigler, who had 24 points and four three-pointers, made three free 
throws after he was fouled attempting a three-pointer to bring University to 
within 68-62 with 6 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (12-8, 5-4) pressed on the inbounds play and Ali Amiri stole the 
ball. But University turned the ball over without getting a shot, and the 
Eagles responded with Keane's layup and free throw to push the lead to 71-62. 
</P>
<P>
 University's offense sputtered in the final quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Although point guard Amiri, who had 10 points and eight assists, made two 
three-pointers in the fourth quarter, Zeigler missed all five of his shots in 
the period. Dustin White, who had nine points in the first quarter, finished 
with 11 and made only one of five shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita led, 22-18, after one quarter, but expanded the lead by making 
11 of 16 shots (69%) from the field in the second quarter. 
</P>

 Hopkins made back-to-back three-pointers to give the Eagles a 13-point lead 
with 2:45 left in the quarter. After University closed to within 39-31, Keane 
scored nine consecutive points in the final 1:30 of the quarter to help push 
the Eagles' halftime lead to 48-33.

 "Actually, we wanted to control the tempo in the first half," Santa Margarita 
Coach Jerry DeBusk said. "But when the players got hot, we let the horses run 
and why pull the reins in?"

 Santa Ana Valley soccer player Francisco Islas, whose age was questioned by 
Orange High, was declared eligible Friday by Santa Ana Valley Principal Robert 
Nelson.Islas, a Times All-County player last year, received a birth certificate 
Friday that indicated he was born in 1976, making him 17 years old. 
Administrators at Orange High had claimed Islas was born in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Hellyer, a Southern Section administrator, said: "(Santa Ana Valley) 
apparently has verified that the kid is 17 years old. They're going to be 
forwarding that information to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Islas, who has scored 11 goals this season, had missed Valley's last six games 
while his eligibility was being questioned. DAVE McKIBBEN

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BOYS' SOCCER; MATER DEI A STEP CLOSER TO TITLE AND PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Mater Dei Coach Martin Stringer didn't want to talk about the playoffs or a 
possible league championship, even though both appeared likely Friday after the 
second-ranked Monarchs' 1-0 South Coast League victory over San Clemente in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't even mention it until we've mathematically clinched it," Stringer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stringer's players weren't so cautious. Senior Ryan Chaput, who assisted 
Kevin Quigley on the game's only goal 20 minutes into the second half, said the 
team can sense a league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted this one bad," Chaput said. "With three games left, we're two 
points clear of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei improved to 18-1-3, 5-1-1 league. San Clemente's title hopes 
disappeared as the Tritons fell to 7-8-6 and 1-2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got six points and I think we'll need 10 to go to the playoffs, which 
means we'll have to win two of our last three games," San Clemente Coach 
Michael Pronier said. "The guys played well. Mater Dei is one of the best teams 
in the county and we were right with them." 
</P>
<P>
 On the scoreboard, yes, but not on the shot chart. The Monarchs controlled 
play for much of the 80 minutes, with 11 shots to San Clemente's five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons' best chance to score came late in the first half when Brock 
Munson missed a wide-open shot from in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei had scoring opportunities all day, but finally cashed in when Chaput 
headed Mike McCabe's corner kick to Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike does a heck of a job looking for me," Chaput said. "All I've ever been 
taught is to head the ball back the way it came." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 2, Mission Viejo 1 -- Jud Nester and Marc Springer each 
scored second-half goals for Capistrano Valley (12-5-3, 4-2-1). Robert Rodgers 
scored for Mission Viejo (3-11-4, 2-3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 5, Dana Hills 0 -- Jose Lopez, Chris Linkhorn, Deiter Segura, Joe 
Karlan and Mark Janji each scored to lead El Toro (14-3-4, 4-2-1), the 
eighth-ranked team in the county.

SIMI VALLEY LAYS DOWN LAW IN ABSENCE OF BRADSHAW; PREP BASKETBALL: WITH COACH 
SUSPENDED, PIONEERS ENLIST LEGAL HELP AND BEAT CAMARILLO, 59-49. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Got problems? Call a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Simi Valley High athletic director George Ragsdale did when he 
needed someone to coach the Pioneer basketball team during Dean Bradshaw's 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley lawyer Brian Saunders coached the Pioneers to a 59-49 Marmonte 
League victory over Camarillo on Friday night at Apollo High in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw was indefinitely suspended after he pushed senior reserve Sam 
Rodriguez to the floor during Simi Valley's game Jan. 14. In a show of support 
for their coach, Bradshaw's assistants refused to replace him, Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that event, Saunders seemed a natural choice, because he coached most of 
the players in youth basketball leagues. He also played for the Boston Celtics 
during the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great guy," Simi Valley senior Nathan Simmons said. "He was our coach 
when we were little, so we have a lot of confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders was assisted by Dave Detmer, a shop teacher at Simi Valley who 
coached the varsity at that school in the early 1970s. Detmer is currently the 
freshman girls' basketball coach at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Detmer said he was talked into taking the position by Ragsdale on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm the faculty representative here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders was not approached until Friday morning. He did not have a practice 
with the team. Detmer had only a shoot-around with the Pioneers on Friday 
morning. Ragsdale ran Simi Valley's practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders said he and Detmer will coach the Pioneers again tonight against 
Newbury Park, a game postponed last week because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stay with them (tonight)," Saunders said, "and then hopefully they'll 
get this thing resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw did not attend the game, which was held at Apollo High, a 
continuation school, because Simi Valley's gym was damaged by the earthquake. 
"Had he chosen to be here," Ragsdale said, "he'd have been welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy, and the fact the earthquake prevented them from 
playing in two weeks, the Pioneers (13-5, 4-2 in league play) played a strong 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons led Simi Valley with 19 points and Vernon Simmons, no relation, added 
15. Each scored six in the pivotal fourth quarter. Simi Valley trailed by one 
at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo (9-10, 5-4) was led by Kevin Nathaniel's 13 points and Nathan Kaup's 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to prove we are still a team," Nathan Simmons said, "no matter what 
the circumstances."

INJURY CAUSES YARD TO MISS REST OF SEASON; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TORN LIGAMENT IN 
RIGHT KNEE SIDELINES CENTER FOR CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Yard, Cal State Northridge's top rebounder and post player, will miss 
the remainder of the basketball season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament 
in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lestor Cohn, Northridge's team orthopedic specialist, discovered the tear 
during arthroscopic surgery Friday at Encino Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just what we feared," Cohn said. "That is exactly the type of thing 
that causes the knee to give out continuously." 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, a senior from Las Vegas, has been a starter since joining the team last 
season after transferring from Lassen (Calif.) College. The 6-foot-6 forward 
was averaging 5.9 rebounds and 12.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors will start either Shane O'Doherty, a 6-11 junior, or Brent 
Lofton, a 6-5 senior, in Yard's place tonight against Northeastern Illinois in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard incurred what was thought to be a sprained right knee during the first 
half of a game against UC Irvine on Jan. 8. He went on to complete that game, 
finishing with 14 points and 11 rebounds as Northridge upset the Anteaters, 
68-66, in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting out a Jan. 11 game at St. Mary's, Yard returned to the lineup 
against Colorado on Jan. 17 in Boulder. He lasted only one minute 12 seconds 
before his knee gave out again. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pulled from the game and did not play again. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard's health problems were compounded Wednesday when he slipped while 
climbing stairs and broke his right hand trying to cushion his fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn set the break with a plate on screws after he finished working on Yard's 
knee. The hand, Cohn said, "was markedly displaced and unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any one of the two injuries probably would have ended his season," Cohn 
added.

IT'S OFFICIAL: HEITMANN TO JOIN CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The call Cal State Northridge men's volleyball coaches wanted to make and 
Oliver Heitmann wanted to take finally occurred Friday night -- or Saturday 
morning in Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, a starter on the German National Team, was told to catch the next 
available flight to Los Angeles. He was officially accepted for admission by 
Northridge officials Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Price said Heitmann could make his debut in the Matadors' next 
match, a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opener at USC on Feb. 4. "He's 
obviously a great player," Price said of the 6-foot-7 middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what the coach has heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen him play," Price admitted. "Not even on tape. I've seen his 
picture in Volleyball Monthly (magazine), though. Does that count?" 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is banking heavily on blind faith, but Price does not considering 
the more than $7,000 it will take to cover the player's tuition a risky 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those giving glowing scouting reports were U.S. national team coaches 
Rod Wilde and Jim Coleman, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, 24, was a standout player on Germany's entry in the World League, an 
international circuit of Olympic teams. For Northridge, he is expected to start 
in the middle alongside Craig Hewitt, a returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Northridge will secure the money for Heitmann's scholarship by 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge Grass Volleyball Series just became the Oliver Heitmann 
Volleyball Series," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has been interested in Heitmann since the German star was brought 
to the attention of coaches by Axel Hager, another Hamburg product who started 
for the Matadors the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was pessimistic about him being eligible," Price said. "But we've 
jumped through every hoop." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to damage their offices sustained in the Jan. 17 earthquake, Northridge 
administrators still have not completed the paperwork necessary for Heitmann to 
get a student visa from officials in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said Heitmann will come to the U.S. on a three-month tourist's visa, 
then apply for a student visa after he settles in at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann will replace 6-7 Coley Kyman, a three-time Northridge All-American 
who completed his eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had Coley I was a good coach," said Price, who last season was the 
NCAA's volleyball coach of the year after guiding CSUN to the final. "Hopefully 
(Heitmann) can make me a good coach again."

LICENSED TO SHOOT; THREE-POINT SPECIALIST HAGMAN GIVEN PLENTY OF FREEDOM BY 
COACH BUT NOT BY OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The teen-age girls come hurtling through the air toward Sarah Hagman. They try 
to distract her with piercing screams, or they push, jostle and wave a hand in 
her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aieeeeee!" One shrieks at Hagman. 
</P>
<P>
 Thud. Another one bumps into her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman is neither a rock star trying to navigate a hotel lobby nor a casting 
director at an audition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman plays basketball for Crescenta Valley High, and at the moment she is 
trying to shoot a three-point shot. The airborne girls play for rival Muir and 
are desperately attempting to prevent her from shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most three-point shooters don't receive such manic attention from defenders, 
but such is life for Hagman since she made a Southern Section-record 13 
three-point shots in a game last Friday. Now the 5-foot-9 senior plays under 
closer scrutiny, which is wearying, difficult and pressure-filled -- yet a 
welcome change from the anonymity from which she burst free this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an incredibly skilled basketball player and has been for some time," 
said Hagman's father, Bob. "But skills don't make the headlines. The 
three-point shot has been really good for her because it's given her publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needed something to get attention from the college recruiters, and the 
three-point shot is what has done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman's three-point prowess has indeed made her a center of attention, and it 
was obvious in Tuesday's contest against Muir. The Mustangs employed a rotating 
zone to defend against Hagman -- "My assistant and I stayed up until 2 a.m. 
Sunday designing this defense," Muir Coach Corinne DeJong said -- and one or 
two defenders blanketed Hagman if she so much as looked at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked, sort of. Because of Muir's focus on Hagman, Crescenta 
Valley center Heather Brown was constantly left open near the basket and she 
scored 21 points, including several layups on passes from Hagman. But Hagman 
made only three of 11 three-pointers and Crescenta Valley lost, 62-59, its 
first Pacific League setback this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is aware of where I go," she said after the game. "It's tough. Today 
I didn't feel good shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 But the disappointment from the loss will fade. Hagman's aspirations will not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get a (college) scholarship," she said. "That's my personal goal." 
</P>
<P>
 As goals go, it didn't look attainable until recently. Before this season, 
Hagman was a relatively nondescript point guard who mostly drove to the basket 
and sporadically shot from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But second-year Falcon Coach Marc Ward is a true believer in the merits of the 
three-point shot. After last season, he switched Hagman to shooting guard. Next 
season, he told her, you will shoot, shoot, shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 So last summer, her father spray-painted a three-point arc on a court at a 
local park. "I don't know if that's illegal or what," Hagman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who cares? A gunner needs to leave her conscience at home. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent her summer raining in jumpers at the park and further improved her 
game under the tutelage of her club team coach, Mel Sims, who also coaches the 
Ganesha boys' team. Hagman returned to school and in the Falcons' first game of 
the season made six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I knew I'd have a good three-point season," she said. "Before 
that my coach said I would but I didn't really believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it. Hagman has burst into Southland basketball prominence by averaging 
more than 25 points a game and sinking 105 of 234 three-point shots, tops in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And one memorable game a week ago made everyone take notice. Earlier this 
month, Hagman tied the section record for three-pointers in a game with 11. But 
last Friday against Arcadia she sank seven of 10 three-point shots in the first 
half. At halftime, Ward told his team about the possibility of Hagman breaking 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team was all for it," Hagman said. "But . . . I kind of had my doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley already held a huge lead, so the second half became a contest 
to see how many bombs Hagman could hit. By the end of the third quarter, she 
had made 11 of 18. Her legs tired, she made only two of eight three-pointers in 
the fourth quarter. But she finished with 48 points and a record, bettering the 
one she shared with Nicole Erickson of Brea-Olinda. The state and national mark 
is 14, held by Danielle Viglione of Fair Oaks Del Campo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward listed Pacific, Colorado State and Cal State Northridge, among others, as 
recruiting Hagman, and he has sent out highlight tapes to several other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're finally coming to see her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They might see her break the section's season record for three-pointers, 112, 
set last year by Chino's Aimee Pina. Crescenta Valley has made 138 
three-pointers this season, 13 short of the section record. Plus, the Falcons 
(16-5, 6-1 in league play) almost certainly will advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistically, she has established that three-point shot," Bob Hagman said. 
"Now that she's got the attention, it's important that she show the all-around 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
 She is as much point guard as shooter, and behind-the-back dribbles and 
no-look passes are staples of her game. But Hagman knows that dialing in from 
long distance is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assists can be more fun," she said. "But they don't go down in the 
newspaper."

STEVENS REPLACES BUENAFE AS GARDEN GROVE COACH 
</P>

<P>
 Ralph Stevens was named head football coach at Garden Grove High, replacing 
Jeff Buenafe, who compiled a 27-37 record in his six years with the Argonauts. 
Stevens was Buenafe's defensive coordinator the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Athletic Director Ron Zajec said he made the change two weeks 
ago, but decided to announce it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there was desire to go in another direction," Zajec said. "Jeff spent 
six good years here in building the program. We had 142 kids participating in 
football last year. There were 47 when he started." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, Buenafe's teams reached the playoffs twice, in 1991 and 
'92. In 1992, the Argonauts reached the Division VII semifinals before losing 
to Sunny Hills. But last season, Garden Grove slipped to 3-7, 3-4 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Zajec said Buenafe will remain at the school as a math teacher. DAVE McKIBBEN

KEEPING TABS: TARVER COUNTS HIS BLESSINGS AS CAPTAIN OF NO. 1 UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD and VINCE KOWALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, Shon Tarver pulled out of an oral commitment to attend Nevada 
Las Vegas on a basketball scholarship in favor of UCLA. Today, life is so good 
in Westwood that decision seems like decades ago to Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm blessed," Tarver said. "How often can you be a senior captain of a highly 
ranked team, graduating with a degree from a highly regarded institution like 
UCLA. Living in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver, who played at Santa Clara High, omitted that he is playing for the No. 
1 college basketball team in the country. On purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to be in the situation we're in," Tarver said. "We've worked hard 
as a team. We just want to be consistent, and we're improving. The No. 1 
ranking is more for the media and the fans. It's more important for us to win 
the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver, a 6-foot-6 guard, has been around long enough to know No. 1 rankings 
are fleeting. The Bruins (14-0, 7-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference), winners of 
10 NCAA championships, haven't been at the top of the poll since Feb. 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver also knows that rarely does a team win a Pac-10 championship by going 
undefeated. The Bruins are likely to lose one game in conference play and yield 
their top ranking at the same time. That's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not worried about being undefeated," he said. "We just want to win the 
Pac-10 and get the No. 1 seed in the (NCAA West Regional.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Including Thursday night's 69-65 victory at Stanford, UCLA leads the Pac-10 in 
six of 12 statistical categories, including field-goal percentage (51.5%), 
rebounds per game (45.1), average margin of victory (19.0 points) and 
field-goal percentage against (39.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Tarver played on a team that reached the West Regional final -- 
a team that included future NBA players Don MacLean, Tracy Murray and Mitchell 
Butler. But Tarver hints that this one -- with forward Ed O'Bannon, who ranks 
in the top five in the Pac-10 in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots, and 
point guard Tyus Edney, second in the conference in assists -- is better. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sophomore-year team had the most straight-up talent," Tarver said. "But 
this year we have talent, work ethic and we just want to win. No one's worried 
about their stats. I guess that's why we're in the position we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver's statistics -- 14.1 points and five rebounds per game, a field-goal 
percentage of 46.8% -- have suffered slightly because he suffered a sprained 
ankle in the Dec. 18 Louisiana State game that developed tendinitis. But Tarver 
said he finally is approaching peak form. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best is yet to come," he said. "Even last week (in big victories over 
Arizona and Arizona State), I was just starting to move around. Once I can push 
off and really explode off that ankle, I will make an impact in every area: 
driving, passing, deflecting passes, blocking shots. My shooting will be 
better. I'll be able to run the point if we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Arizona, Tarver scored 11 points and added five rebounds, two assists, 
two blocked shots and a steal while holding Khalid  
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, the Pac-10's second-leading scorer at 23.2 points, to 13. Two days 
later, Tarver scored 17 and held Arizona State point guard Stevin (Hedake) 
Smith to six points two days after he scored 35 against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Tarver is within range of some UCLA luminaries on the 
school's all-time scoring list. He ranks No. 16 with 1,370 points, one behind 
Curtis Rowe, 10 behind Kiki Vandeweghe and 31 behind Walt Hazzard. 
</P>

 Hitting home: Among the local athletes touched by tragedy because of the 
Northridge earthquake was David Muir, who led area City Section passers in 1992 
as quarterback of Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, a redshirt freshman at Washington State, received a telephone call Jan. 
17 informing him that his 30-year-old stepsister, Karen Osterholt, was killed 
along with her fiance when the Sherman Oaks home they were living in collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just shocked," Muir said. "I had to break the news to my brothers (in 
Michigan and Massachusetts) and they took it hard. I realized I had to go home 
for the funeral and see what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Muir spent five days in the Southland helping his family recover. Muir said 
Washington State coaches graciously arranged for his trip home. "I told them my 
mind really wasn't on football and they understood," Muir said. "I helped clean 
up the house and put together some of the pieces. I felt like I was a calming 
figure because I hadn't been through it. I guess my family kind of rallied 
around me." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: St. Mary's forward Ali Peek (Hart) is averaging 4.6 points 
and 3.3 rebounds per game but hit career highs in both scoring (14 points) and 
rebounds (11) in a recent game against Sonoma State. . . . Marion Jones 
(Thousand Oaks) scored 20 points to lead fourth-ranked North Carolina to a 
71-48 victory over Florida State last week. The freshman point guard wasn't 
pegged as a starter before the season but eventually earned the role after she 
was put into a game and recorded steals on seven consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Martin, a volleyball and basketball standout at Hart High, will 
continue to play both sports at Point Loma Nazarene College. Last spring, 
Martin accepted a volleyball scholarship to Arizona but left the Wildcat team 
late in August and transferred to the NAIA school in San Diego. Martin, a 
6-foot-2 outside hitter, helped Point Loma Nazarene to a fifth-place finish in 
the NAIA tournament. She is taking a redshirt year in basketball but plans to 
play both sports next season.

 In football, defensive back Eliel Swinton (Montclair Prep) was named 
Stanford's freshman of the year. He started five games, three at cornerback, 
two at strong safety. DANA HADDAD and VINCE KOWALICK

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: RUMBLE PUT BASKETBALL IN RUMBLE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worrying about the recent misfortunes of his Glendale College men's basketball 
team took a back seat -- way back -- in Coach Brian Beauchemin's priority list 
after the earthquake last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's epicenter in Northridge wasn't far from his home in Granada Hills 
and Beauchemin spent several days afterward shoveling broken glass and 
assessing the damage to the property.  
</P>
<P>
 The house is livable, but the family -- including wife Kathy and daughter Amy, 
17 -- is still staying with friends at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a dish or a glass left, and there are a lot of cracks inside. 
Every day there (were) more cracks," Beauchemin said. "This is the most 
incredible thing I've experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 To compound the coach's problems, the Vaqueros dropped their fifth consecutive 
game on Monday night, losing to Valley, 102-92, in overtime. CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Battle of Wounded Knee 
</P>
<P>
 If the limp in his gait and the look on his face mean anything, Andy Shaw's 
left knee could feel a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term availability of Shaw remains very much up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, a sophomore transfer from College of the Canyons and the 1993 Western 
State Conference player of the year, had his injured left knee examined 
recently and received a cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a follow-up exam scheduled for next week, when a decision on additional 
surgery could be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, a first baseman, had surgery two years ago to repair a damaged patellar 
tendon, but the injury remains a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 He bats left-handed and the weakness in the knee doesn't allow him to stride 
into the ball as effectively. He already has used his redshirt season. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said Shaw -- also a candidate at 
designated-hitter -- is probably the team's "best overall hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw hit .405 with 12 home runs and 51 runs batted in for Canyons last spring, 
all team highs. Northridge opens the season at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Feb. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen isn't optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can hardly walk," the coach said. "I'm not really counting on (his 
availability)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Allen Jackson and pitcher James Hines -- the first junior college 
transfers in Kernen's six years at Northridge to join the team at the semester 
break -- jumped headlong into workouts this month and haven't had much spare 
time since. 
</P>
<P>
 Since school is not in session, the team has been practicing from sunrise to 
sunset.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never practiced this hard in my life," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Hines: "I've worked hard before, but not quite this hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is a junior from Foothill College in Los Altos Hills and Hines is a 
sophomore right-hander from East L.A. College. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said the addition of the two to the roster was necessitated when 
infielder Erik Lazerus unexpectedly transferred to Mission College last fall 
and Eddie Hernandez, a promising freshman pitcher from Bishop Amat, decided to 
sign a professional contract late last summer. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Expletive Being Deleted 
</P>
<P>
 Making a point to his players in loud, explicit language during games always 
went with Philip Mathews' territory. If he had a bone to pick or someone to 
admonish, then damn, er, darn the sensitive folks within earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Ventura men's basketball coach says he is measuring his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referees can (assess a technical foul) now for your language," Mathews 
said. "I do watch what I say now on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who heads one of the most successful programs in the country, could 
often be heard in the uppermost reaches of the bleachers. At Ventura, where the 
gym is typically packed, that means hardly anyone is spared. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he says nobody ever told him to tone down his remarks during games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fans are used to me," he said. "It's a matter of, 'This is how he runs 
the program. We accept it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his players, however, sometimes don't let it slide so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Brandon Jessie, for instance, occasionally talks back to 
Mathews. But the coach says his relationship with the team's top player is 
sound and not affected by their exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yell at him and he says something back," Mathews said. "But I always have 
the last word. It's in the heat of the battle. He thinks he's playing hard and 
I don't sometimes. It's very hard to play to a coach's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "His thing is usually an answer to a question, a criticism of why he didn't do 
something and he says he did. It's over in a matter of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how long it would take for an official to slap a technical foul on 
Mathews. But the coach has avoided it so far and is trying to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I slip," he said. "Sometimes you can't help it." Around the 
Campuses . . .

 * Paul Tapp of Cal Lutheran has averaged 15.8 points a game -- entering 
tonight's contest against Caltech -- since replacing injured Jason Smith on 
Jan. 12 at the beginning of Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference play. Since becoming a starter Tapp, a senior from Burbank High, 
shot 51.2% from the field and 58.6% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite an extraordinary 17-for-26 shooting performance from Damon Ridley, 
Cal Lutheran shot under 50% from the field (30 of 62) in last week's 96-77 
victory over Pomona-Pitzer. The Kingsmen had shot 52.2% or better from the 
field in five previous games. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Master's men's basketball team (19-3) needed to win only five of its 
final eight games in the regular season -- entering Friday's game at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills -- to guarantee itself a school record total for victories in a 
season. The Mustangs posted a 23-12 mark in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master's has moved into the top 25 in the NAIA national poll for the first 
time in the program's 29-year history. The Mustangs are ranked 24th in the 
latest rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master's had outscored the opposition by an average of 22 points during its 
eight-game winning streak entering Friday's game.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL; WHITLOCK GETS 34, SADDLEBACK WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tes Whitlock continued his torrid scoring pace and Saddleback continued its 
hot streak as the Gauchos beat Fullerton, 91-73, in an Orange Empire Conference 
men's basketball game Friday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock, a sophomore guard from Loara High School, had a game-high 34 points, 
including two key three-pointers late that allowed Saddleback (17-6, 7-1 in 
conference) to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock made 12 of 15 shots from the field including six of seven three-point 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Walsh of Saddleback made 10 of 11 shots and scored 22 points for 
Saddleback, which has won six consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock was coming off a career-high 41 Wednesday in the Gauchos' 108-94 
victory over Irvine Valley. He is averaging 32 points over his last four games 
and 27 in conference. He is averaging 22 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have touched the (tip of the) iceberg when it comes to how 
much he can score," Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel said. "He's been working 
harder without the ball. He's not really concentrating on the scoring. It's 
coming naturally. I don't think we ran but one play for him tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock, who averaged 33 points in high school, holds the Orange County prep 
single-game scoring record of 68 set in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like earlier in the year I felt like I had something to prove 
putting up some big numbers," Whitlock said. "Now, I'm not too worried about 
it. But I'm not doing it by myself. My teammates are working together setting 
screens and Josh (Borella) is getting me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback made 21 of 30 shots in the first half to open a 49-42 lead. The 
Gauchos were 36 of 56 (64%) from the field in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (20-7, 5-3) did manage a second-half rally, though. The Hornets went 
on a 16-8 run to cut it to six, 73-67, with eight minutes 43 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had a chance to get closer, but Floyd Payne missed the front end of 
a one-and-one with 7:50 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock then made a three-pointer from about 24 feet with 7:20 left to give 
the Gauchos a 76-67 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton scored the next five points to get within 76-72 with 4:11 left. But 
Whitlock made another three-pointer with 2:30 left and added two free throws 
with 3:10 left to put Saddleback up, 81-72, with 3:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory keeps Saddleback tied for first place with Riverside. The Tigers 
beat Golden West, 86-79, Friday. The teams meet at 7 p.m. Wednesday at 
Saddleback. Riverside beat the Gauchos, 91-78, this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like this team is really coming together," Whitlock said. "This is 
what we wanted, to set-up the rematch with Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
 In other conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 86, Golden West 79 -- Visiting Golden West (8-16, 1-7) cut the lead 
to five points with 1:13 left on a three-point play by Greg Vanden Ordel but 
got no closer. Vanden Ordel, a sophomore center, made 12 of 13 shots from the 
field and finished with a career-high 30 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Raimonds Miglinieks had 23 points and nine assists for Riverside (21-5, 7-1). 
He made 18 of 19 free throws. Riverside had won 13 of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley 95, Orange Coast 78 -- Triantaflos Pantazis scored 25 points and 
Damon Sims had 19 and 12 rebounds for visiting Irvine Valley (17-9, 5-3), which 
is tied for second with Fullerton and Rancho Santiago. Chauncey Woolridge had 
23 points and eight rebounds for OCC (11-12, 1-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 86, Cypress 73 -- Sean Amos had 22 points and Matt Kordik 
added 20 for host Rancho Santiago (17-8, 5-3). Amos made seven of 10 shots and 
Kordik made seven of 11 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Kennedy made four three-pointers to set the Cypress single-game and 
career mark with 82. Jeff Cummins scored 22 points for Cypress (10-18, 1-7).

GLENDALE'S BOMBS MOSTLY DUDS, 68-40 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some teams live by the three-point shot, others die by it. 
</P>
<P>
 And by the time the first quarter ended Friday night in a game between 
Glendale and Muir highs, Glendale was just about dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir hit five three-pointers in the opening quarter, then coasted to a 68-40 
Pacific League victory which put the Mustangs in first place and knocked 
Glendale out of the top spot and clear back into third. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (16-6, 4-2 in league play) missed its first 12 three-point attempts, 
not connecting from long range until a minute into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the Mustangs (13-11, 5-2) had the game well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir forward Kenny Wagner led the assault with three first-quarter three-point 
baskets, including two in the final minute to stake the Mustangs to a 22-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had something to prove," Wagner said. "We had our momentum back, 
came out and played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Muir handed Glendale its only other loss in Pacific League 
play, though the margin in that game was only four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang guard Adrien Reyes, star of the first Muir-Glendale game, was held to 
eight points, but it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale missed four three-pointers in the opening quarter, but that was 
nothing compared to the outset of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters went nearly six minutes without scoring a point, while Muir 
built a 40-20 lead from an 11-point halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had high expectations for this game and we had high results," Muir Coach 
Rocky Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They came out in a zone defense but we came out with good ball movement and 
played well throughout." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Jose led Glendale with 10 points but made four of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale hit only three of 20 shots from three-point range and was 16 of 60 
from the field. Forward Tamar Iskander scored eight points, all in the fourth 
quarter, for the Dynamiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Curtis had 18 points and Jamal Johnson added 12 points and 11 rebounds 
for Muir.

QUARTZ HILL FIGHTS PALMDALE TO A DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palmdale boys' soccer team, leading the Golden League, meant to deliver a 
knockout punch to second-place Quartz Hill. Instead, the Falcons settled for a 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel midfielder Matt Matalon scored on a 20-yard free kick midway through the 
second half of Friday's match, salvaging a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Matalon's shot, which curled around a wall of Palmdale defenders into the 
upper right corner of the net, prevented defending champion Palmdale (16-1-2, 
9-0-2 in league play) from taking a commanding lead over the Rebels (10-3-3, 
8-1-2) in the league standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This season is far from over," Quartz Hill Coach Mike Kuper said. "There are 
four more matches to play. But one more goal would have been nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Goals were scarce, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale took a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute on senior forward Mike Dibbini's 
shot into the lower right corner of the net. The goal was Dibbini's 29th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dibbini, who was marked closely by one or two players at all times, could 
not create another successful scoring opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant no goals for the Falcons, because their offense is built around 
Dibbini. Virtually every time a Palmdale player gained possession, he kicked a 
long pass in Dibbini's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great player," Kuper said. "When he gets the ball, you've got a 
problem. He'll always get a shot off." 
</P>
<P>
 But he couldn't get off any good ones off in the second half, when Quartz 
Hill's attack, dormant for most of the match, came alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels nearly scored on several occasions, finally breaking through on 
Matalon's equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all fairness, it wasn't defensed right," Palmdale Coach Mike Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the kick, goalie Beau Cline, who had two saves, did not direct his 
wall of defenders far enough toward the right side of the goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Matalon took advantage, bending a perfect line-drive shot into the vulnerable 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a real sharpshooter shot," Kuper said. "I'm glad we got it." 
</P>
<P>
 But will it be enough? Four more matches will tell.

COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CHAPMAN NEEDS ALL THE HELP IT GETS IN VICTORY 
OVER BETHANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time it was Chapman's turn to face a shorthanded team, and the Panthers 
had their hands full with Bethany College's six-man roster before finally 
prevailing, 86-79, Friday night at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky suspended half his team for violating team 
rules, the Panthers won two games on the road last week with a six-man roster. 
Friday, Bokosky needed all hands to offset Bethany's Joe Woods and Clint 
Ladine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see only five or six players, and you think they're not that good," 
Bokosky said. "But they're scholarship players at an NAIA school and that can 
make a difference. It was a carbon copy of our situation last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, the leading scorer and rebounder in the NAIA District 3 the last two 
seasons, scored 27 points and pulled down 15 rebounds. Ladine scored 20 of his 
game-high 32 points in the second half, as Bethany went on a 26-12 run to take 
a 66-62 lead with 7 minutes 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman (12-6) fought back and took an 80-79 lead on Toby Curto's two free 
throws with 1:17 remaining. A turnaround jumper by Stefan Mumaw in the key and 
two more free throws by Curto gave the Panthers an 84-79 lead with 12 seconds 
left. Mumaw led Chapman with 23 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethany (7-13) of Scots Valley, near Santa Cruz, is coached by former USC 
All-American center John Block. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to compete with this good a team, I'm just as pleased as can be with 
these guys," Block said. "It could have gone either way." TOM BIRSCHBACH

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; DUCKS FIND SECRET TO GOOD MERCHANDISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, you're going to a Mighty Duck game and you'd like a little souvenir. Maybe 
you can afford something a bit more expensive than the 10-buck duck call. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a $350 goalie stick autographed by each player on the Ducks' 
opening-night roster? A $400 signed set of season-ticket replicas? A $600 
team-autographed jersey? Or the $700 inaugural team autographed-puck set? 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hundred dollars for 27 pieces of vulcanized rubber signed by the 
castoffs of 24 other NHL teams?  
</P>
<P>
 These are the prices Disney Sports Enterprises is asking, and getting. 
</P>
<P>
 The line to get into the Mighty Ducks Team Store at Anaheim Arena is sometimes 
40 deep during Duck games, though most of the purchases are of the T-shirt, 
baseball cap, keychain, coffee cup, baby-bib variety. 
</P>
<P>
 But the limited-edition autographed Mighty Duck inaugural team collectibles 
have sold, too, as the team tries to cash in on the clamor for first-year 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the items worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 No, says Bill Adams, who appraises sports memorabilia for Leland's, a New York 
dealer. He estimates the value of the $600 official jersey signed by the 
opening-night players and Coach Ron Wilson at $100-$200 less than the Ducks are 
asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was not worn in a game, it's probably worth $400 or $500, and in a few 
years it will drop to $200 or $300," he said. "With any expansion team there's 
a lot of excitement the first year. It starts at a premium and actually would 
slide in value the next few years. It wouldn't be until well down the line that 
it would take off again -- like 20 years, once the team has established itself, 
especially if the team had future success." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Sanders, manager of the Field of Dreams sports memorabilia stores at 
MainPlace and South Coast Plaza, says the jerseys signed by Guy Hebert, Anatoli 
Semenov and teammates have a retail value of $700-$800, and the ones he has had 
in his stores have sold. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a jersey signed by Wayne Gretzky might go for $400 if it wasn't 
worn in a game. A jersey worn by Gretzky in a game might sell for 
$8,000-$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the Duck memorabilia be worth down the road? 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on how many are on the market," Sanders said. (The Ducks say their 
high-end items are limited editions of 250-1,000). "With all the hype, I see 
them going nowhere but up. They won't be worth more in two or three years, but 
in 10 or 15 years, when the team's been established a while, I can see them 
being a quality item." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What Disney is doing is relatively new in pro sports: The team is claiming the 
profits usually made by collectors and autograph seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew these things would be a hot item, and wanted to be involved 
financially," said Andy Roundtree, vice president of finance and administration 
for Disney Sports Enterprises. "You go in the parking lot, and there are all 
these guys with sticks. Some want them for themselves, but we have a problem 
with somebody who takes a stick like that and sells it for 500 bucks, so you 
don't get anything for it and they're making money off you." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Ducks decided to make the money themselves, enlisting players in an 
unusual arrangement under which they give players 50% of the profit added by 
their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about the only way you'd get professional athletes to stop and sign 
their autograph a wrist-cramping 200 times on goalie sticks as they leave 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other teams should be doing this," said Ted Saskin, NHL director of 
licensing. "It's the appropriate thing to do; unfortunately, not all the other 
teams are as enlightened as the Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 The team says the players have been "unbelievably cooperative," about the 
constant signing demands and team captain Troy Loney says the agreement is good 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks aren't perennial All-Stars, and their autographs have never been so 
sought after. "It's incredible," defenseman Bobby Dollas said. "I never thought 
they'd get so much for them, but more power to them, if people want to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who bought programs at the inaugural game Oct. 8 against Detroit in 
hopes of selling them at a profit one day might as well put them in the 
recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have reprinted the programs and are still selling them in their 
stores and through their new catalogue. There are more than 50,000 in 
circulation.

DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES? YAKE DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 The final seconds ticked off the scoreboard, the sellout crowd stood roaring 
and it seemed clear the night had been an unqualified success. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks 3, New York Rangers 2: Biggest home victory in the Ducks' short 
life span, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, Duck forward Terry Yake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake played a crucial part in the Ducks' victory, assisting on first-period 
goals by Bob Corkum and Tim Sweeney, but he wasn't ready to blow Friday's 
events out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he figured it, there were good reasons not to get too carried away 
after the Ducks defeated the NHL's points leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always nice to beat the so-called best team in the NHL," Yake said. "But 
the bottom line is two points is two points." 
</P>
<P>
 How could he say it was just another victory? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1: The Ducks had already beaten the Rangers, 4-2, Oct. 19 at Madison 
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2: Hooked up in an honest-to-goodness playoff battle with the Kings, the 
Ducks are more concerned with staying ahead of their conference rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3: If, and when, they beat San Jose, then it will be a big deal. The 
Sharks have tormented the Ducks by winning all five meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that Friday's victory meant little. It was the Ducks' 20th 
victory and put them two points ahead of the Kings and three ahead of San Jose 
in the fight for the eighth, and final, playoff berth in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big confidence builder," Yake said. "We know the Rangers are a good 
team and we played them tough from start to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks almost let it slip away because Yake picked up a double-minor for a 
high-sticking penalty that resulted in a four-minute power play for the Rangers 
11 minutes 44 seconds into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake and Ranger Alexei Kovalev got tangled up along the boards trailing a 
play. When the puck came around to the other side of the ice, Yake delivered a 
stick smash to Kovalev's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a penalty and I deserved it," Yake said. "I knew I screwed up. It was 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 It was far from the most heinous crime committed in an often brutal test of 
toughness. The Ducks were ready for anything the Rangers delivered, though. 
Yake's involvement came as a surprise. Normally, he leaves the rough stuff to 
bruisers Todd Ewen and Stu Grimson.

<P>
 "We're the last team that's going to back down" said Yake, 5-feet-11, 175 
pounds. "If anything I think it distracted them from their game. It played 
right into our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly might have been a different game if the Rangers' relied on their 
superior skating and offensive firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Yake wondered why the Rangers embraced such a Duck-like style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing a real ugly style now," Yake said. "That clutch and grab 
stuff makes it tough for everybody. But we battled them to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers managed only one shot on goal over their four-minute power play as 
Yake's penalty didn't prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' 3-2 lead stood up and now they play the Kings tonight at the Forum 
with a chance to increase their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right from the start, we believed we could make the playoffs," Yake said. 
"Now, we're starting to make others believe."

 When Robert L. Yohe was asked to help Olin Corp. restructure, he knew he'd 
have tough decisions to make.Yohe showed how tough he was: He cut his own job. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin, a chemicals, metals and defense company, announced in December that it 
would cut 600 jobs. The company said this week that Yohe's job (vice chairman 
for corporate resources) would be one of those to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the buzzword today, making companies leaner and meaner," said Yohe, 
57. "Lean and mean means you do it at every level." 
</P>
<P>
 But you probably won't find him in the unemployment line: Yohe's severance 
package includes a year's salary -- we're talking $350,000 -- plus other 
bonuses. Now that's a buyout.

'93 RANKS AS O.C.'S WORST YEAR FOR JOBS IN A DECADE; LABOR: COUNTY'S AVERAGE 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CLIMBED TO 6.3%. SOME TEMPORARY HOLIDAY HIRING EASED THE 
GLOOM, BUT LOTS OF CUTBACKS ARE PERMANENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Establishing 1993 as the worst year for jobs here in a decade, the state 
Employment Development Department said Friday that Orange County employers 
lopped more than 18,000 jobs from their payrolls last year. 
</P>
<P>
 December's jobless rate actually dropped to 5.3% from 5.6% in November, but 
the improvement was entirely because of temporary retail hiring for the 
holidays. For the year, the county's average unemployment rate climbed to 6.3% 
-- the highest since 7.1% for 1983, at the end of the last recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual number came as no surprise to Alan J. Meister. The 45-year-old 
Mission Viejo man was laid off in December as controller of FHP International 
Corp.'s insurance division -- victim of a so-called re-engineering. The health 
maintenance organization's regrouping, prompted by its acquisition of another 
company, resulted in 400 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meister, the father of seven children -- five of whom still live at home -- 
was one of 800 service industry workers who lost jobs with Orange County 
businesses in December. 
</P>
<P>
 What he and thousands like him are experiencing, employment professionals say, 
is much more than the typical temporary joblessness that accompanies a 
recession.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies have cut back permanently," said Sue Foigleman, area 
manager for Manpower Temporary Services Inc. "They have reduced middle 
management ranks substantially, automated their production. Their need for 
people is less and will stay less." 
</P>
<P>
 Foigleman and others in the temporary employment field say their businesses 
have benefited from the cutbacks. Companies are reluctant to add permanent jobs 
when things pick up and are using temporary workers everywhere, from factory 
assembly lines to corporate strategic planning offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Career development specialist P. Anthony Burnham said that many companies also 
use temporary workers "to test-drive people" before deciding whether to hire 
permanently. As a result, the job market "is tough and is going to remain 
tough," he said. "There is no great optimism that we'll see a return to the 
open job markets of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham's ProActive Institute, based in Costa Mesa, is retained by companies 
to help laid-off workers develop career goals and job-finding skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Management Assn. found in its 1993 survey of major corporations' 
employment plans that more than 25% intend to make further cuts in their 
payrolls this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This downsizing is not a child of the recession," the editors of the survey 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 For Meister, that means accepting that he may have to live with unemployment 
for a while. "It is a real roller-coaster ride out there," he said. "Some days 
are positive -- maybe you've got a good lead or even an interview -- but others 
can be real disappointing. You have to learn to rise above the effect on you 
and your family of not having a job." 
</P>
<P>
 It also means a change in job-hunting approaches. It is no longer an interview 
but a business meeting, and successful applicants aren't looking for work, they 
are marketing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Meister, a ProActive client, talks the talk: "You have to market yourself as a 
product. . . . I tell prospective employers the results I can obtain for them, 
based on my past achievements. . . . I see the market improving, but one 
opening can result in 100 resumes, so you have to be aggressive and creative." 
</P>
<P>
 That means not limiting the job hunt to the obvious. Meister was trained as an 
accountant, and his career has been in financial management, but he tells 
employers that his strengths are in organization and general administration as 
well as finance. "I try to look for positions in which I could utilize any of 
these skills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also looking across the nation -- something others among the county's 
unemployed may be forced to do if the economy in Southern California remains in 
a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, according to state labor market analyst Eleanor Jordan, payrolls based 
in Orange County declined by 1,000 positions in December despite a gain of 
3,300 temporary retailing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The local employment count provides a better look at the county's economic 
health than the broader unemployment rate published by the state. Because the 
local tally counts jobs actually located in Orange County, it helps track how 
well or poorly local businesses are doing. The jobless rate, by contrast, is an 
estimate of the number of unemployed county residents, no matter where their 
jobs were. So a Fullerton resident laid off from a job in Los Angeles would 
show up in the statistics as part of Orange County's unemployment. (A1) Jobless 
Rate Declines 
</P>
<P>
 After peaking at 7.4% in July, Orange County's unemployment rate slowly 
declined to 5.3% by December. The 6.3% annual average, however, made 1993 the 
worst year for county joblessness in a decade.

36-ACRE AUTO MALL PLANNED FOR RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA and FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Co. said Friday it will build a 36-acre auto mall in its 
master-planned community in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. has already agreed to buy six acres in the new center, which 
the development company said will eventually have about a dozen dealerships. 
Construction is scheduled to begin this summer in a 450-acre business park 
being built as part of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The company projects that the auto mall, to be just north of Santa Margarita 
Parkway near Avenida Empresa, will generate $1.7 million in annual sales tax 
revenue and create 520 jobs. The site, originally slated for light industrial 
use or manufacturing, is near the planned Foothill Transportation Corridor toll 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall will have what the company calls an early California look: tile 
roofs, fountains and stucco exteriors. The dealerships will encircle two 
interior parking plazas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will undoubtedly be successful," said Dan Kelley, vice president of 
governmental relations at Santa Margarita Co. "The enthusiasm by Ford, the 
construction of Foothill Corridor and the creation of an auto center unlike any 
other gives us strong confidence this will be extremely successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is drawing criticism, though, from some local residents, many of 
whom have homes overlooking the site. When company officials unveiled the 
proposal at a town hall meeting Thursday night, homeowners in developments such 
as Estrella Vista and Las Portillas expressed concerns about night lights, 
hours of operation and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved out here to get away from urban ways of life," said Martha Della 
Ripa, one of about 100 homeowners who attended the meeting. "We have nice views 
and a beautiful panorama, and we don't want to see anything with a lot of 
lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are discussing whether to form a group opposing the auto mall, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials, however, argued that environmentally sensitive lighting 
will be used and that dealerships' service areas will be enclosed to reduce 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident that what will be there won't be unpleasant or obtrusive to 
the residents," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at least one auto industry expert questioned whether Orange County 
needs another cluster of car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Irvine auto mall close and the strip of dealers in San Juan 
Capistrano and Mission Viejo, do you need another mall just a few miles 
inland?" asked George Peterson, president of AutoPacifc Inc., a real estate 
consultant in Santa Ana. "These people are probably doing detailed studies of 
population growth, but I wonder if we need another one." 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimates that 531,000 people live within a 12-mile radius of the 
proposed center and projects that the population will increase to 611,400 
within four years. Auto Rejection Santa Margarita Co. plans to build an auto 
mall have been met with objections from local homeowners.

BANKAMERICA TO ACQUIRE CONTINENTAL BANK; MERGERS: BOFA'S PARENT AGREES TO PAY 
$1.9 BILLION FOR CHICAGO INSTITUTION. CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE 
AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Consumer banking giant BankAmerica Corp. on Friday took a cross-country leap 
to expand its corporate banking business by agreeing to buy Continental Bank 
Corp. of Chicago for $1.9 billion in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based BankAmerica is the parent of Bank of America and, with 
$187 billion in assets and 2,000 branches in 10 states, the nation's 
second-largest bank holding company, behind New York-based Citicorp, which has 
assets exceeding $221 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental, whose $22.6 billion in assets place it 33rd among U.S. banks, is 
Chicago's oldest bank. But it does not operate retail branches, focusing 
instead on providing financing for medium-sized and large corporations, 
particularly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the merger is expected to have little or no impact on 
BankAmerica's millions of retail customers in California and elsewhere who have 
checking accounts, credit cards and loans with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a BofA customer, you're not going to feel a thing," said Bert Ely, 
a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 In corporate banking circles, however, the union could give BankAmerica a 
major competitive lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger "may cause the people in New York to quit referring to BofA as a 
regional bank," said Stephen McLin, a former BankAmerica executive who is now 
president of America First Financial Corp. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the deal would be the latest feather in the cap of BankAmerica's feisty 
chairman, Richard M. Rosenberg, who led BankAmerica's own recovery from near 
ruin in the late 1980s and turned it into an enormous financial powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 His previous biggest move was BankAmerica's blockbuster purchase two years ago 
of California rival Security Pacific Corp. for $5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The Continental merger was also actively pursued by Lewis W. Coleman, 
BankAmerica's vice chairman, an odds-on favorite to eventually succeed 
Rosenberg and a longtime friend of Continental Bank Chairman Thomas C. 
Theobald, according to sources close to the banks who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this merger would not require the massive layoffs seen after 
BankAmerica bought Security Pacific, the companies said their marriage would 
eliminate between 500 and 800 jobs over the next two years. BankAmerica employs 
96,400 people worldwide; Continental has 4,200 in several U.S. and Latin 
American cities and in London and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those leaving would be Theobald, who said he would resign after the 
merger. Continental would be renamed Bank of America Illinois and would be 
headed by a Continental vice chairman, William M. Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, BankAmerica said, it would acquire Continental for 21.25 
million shares of its common stock and $939 million in cash, giving the deal a 
current indicated value of $35.80 per Continental share. 
</P>
<P>
 After the announcement, Continental's stock soared $6.125 a share to $34, 
while BankAmerica slipped $.375 cents to $45.375, both in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading.  
</P>
<P>
 While the merger represents a shift for BankAmerica, which has generally aimed 
at expanding its base in the West, it would also be only the latest step in the 
industry's overall migration toward interstate banking. 
</P>
<P>
 Owing to a glut of financial institutions and relaxing interstate banking 
regulations, BankAmerica and several other big banks have been rapidly buying 
financial institutions to enhance their competitive positions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most of the previous big mergers, BankAmerica's purchase of 
Continental would not involve the task of blending two banks' multi-state 
networks of branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
 BankAmerica's purchase would also come after Continental achieved a remarkable 
comeback from a decade ago. Then called Continental Illinois Corp., the bank 
nearly collapsed under a mountain of bad loans in 1984 and required a 
multibillion-dollar bailout by the federal government that was not completed 
until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 By instantly gaining Continental's foothold in the Midwest, BankAmerica would 
bolster its share of a corporate lending market that includes such other 
"super-regional" banking companies as Banc One and NationsBank, which have also 
been aggressively buying other banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Continental deal would also help BankAmerica's competitive stature against 
the likes of venerable New York-based banks Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and 
Bankers Trust New York Corp., which are leading specialists in providing 
corporations with financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Continental's California-based customers are Vons Cos. and Unocal Corp.; 
its Midwest clients include Illinois Power Co. and UAL Corp., the parent of 
United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Rubens, president of California Research Corp., a consulting firm in 
Santa Monica, said another benefit of the merger is that it "makes BofA's 
profits less dependent on California's economy. The Midwest is doing super now, 
but it could take three or four years for California's economy to turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 But others questioned how well BankAmerica's corporate bankers can work with 
their new Midwest colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be interesting to see how those cultures will be able to merge," said 
William C. Ferguson, president of the bank research firm Ferguson & Co. in 
Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nod toward Continental's recovery, BankAmerica said that after the merger 
it would move its corporate banking arm from San Francisco to Chicago and merge 
it with Continental's. 
</P>
<P>
 Although BankAmerica stressed that it doesn't plan to break into consumer 
banking in the Midwest, some analysts said it could change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bank might wait a year or so to digest this merger, but I wouldn't be 
surprised if they buy a retail bank here in the future," said Tom Mair, an 
analyst with Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago.

A NEAR-CRASH, A BAILOUT AND REDEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the boisterous days before Oklahoma City's Penn Square Bank failed in 
spectacular fashion, one of its brash young executives entertained out-of-town 
clients by guzzling beer out of a boot at a local watering hole called Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 A Manufacturers Hanover banker from New York City happened by and told 
colleagues, "There's no way we'll ever do business with this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 If only Continental Illinois Bank had been that astute. Once a paragon of 
conservatism, the Chicago institution got lured by Penn Square into a quagmire 
of ill-fated energy loans that brought down the Oklahoma bank in 1982 and 
helped take Continental to the brink of insolvency before a federal bailout two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a much smaller, revamped and renamed Continental Bank -- dedicated 
to corporate banking -- drew a $1.9-billion surprise purchase offer from 
BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest banking company. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the rich price appears to justify the game plan of Thomas C. 
Theobald, the onetime Citicorp executive hired in 1987 to fix Continental.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was sort of the light at the end of the tunnel that made that strategy 
pay off," said Douglas W. Diamond, a finance professor at the University of 
Chicago's Graduate School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
 That Continental is around and about to become a wing of BankAmerica is 
something of a wonder. Formed in 1857 as the Merchants' Savings, Loan & Trust 
Co., the bank had its first trial by fire in the Chicago Fire of 1871. Though 
its records were destroyed, the bank lost just $55,000 in making refunds to 
depositors based on their own honor-system estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chicago's oldest bank suffered its biggest calamity by believing in Penn 
Square Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late 1970s, an OPEC-inspired surge in energy prices brought to 
prominence the go-go little bank based in an Oklahoma City shopping center. 
Penn Square courted customers aggressively, ignoring the fact that many 
wildcatters seeking loans provided little evidence of oil and gas reserves. At 
one point, the bank's advertising theme was "The Wild Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to tap into the hot energy market but lacking oil patch connections, 
Continental wound up buying more than $1 billion worth of Penn Square's loans. 
But those proved to be dregs unwanted by even the high-flying Texas and 
Oklahoma banks, and it didn't take long for a series of dry holes to spell 
doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarked at the time on a growth-at-any-cost strategy, Continental executives 
took no action in 1981 when they discovered that their Penn Square investment 
was unsound. 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1982, tumbling energy prices were threatening to topple Penn Square. 
Government regulators, moving away from the "too big to fail" concept, let the 
medium-sized bank go under in midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Continental, meanwhile, soon found itself with $1.9 billion in 
uncollectible loans, including significant exposure in Latin American 
countries. News reports of a liquidity crisis triggered a global panic, and a 
run by depositors quickly drained Continental of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the entire banking system would suffer, the government 
reluctantly decided in 1984 to put up $4.5 billion to ensure the bank's 
survival and assumed an 80% ownership in the bank.  
</P>
<P>
 The government took total control of the operations, selling its last shares 
in Continental to the public seven years later -- an event that Theobald 
celebrated by distributing hot dogs to employees during a lunch hour party at 
its ornate headquarters on Chicago's LaSalle Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental's last two years have been profitable, but not profoundly so. 
Analysts say the bank has been hampered by a weak credit rating, which has 
boosted its cost of funds. It has also had to dig out from a hefty portfolio of 
soured loans for California residential real estate and corporate buyouts.

TICKETMASTER, SONY AND OTHERS PLAN MTV RIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A consortium of major entertainment companies composed of Time Warner, Sony 
Corp., Thorn EMI, PolyGram and Ticketmaster are expected to announce Monday 
plans to launch a global video music channel to compete against MTV, industry 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new music video channel is conceived as a high-tech version of MTV where 
viewers would also be able to shop for concert and sports tickets, CDs and 
other music and entertainment industry merchandise, according to people 
familiar with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The four entertainment companies -- among the world's biggest producers and 
distributors of recorded music -- would be able to supply the new channel with 
a steady flow of music videos and other entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But a key element of the plan is the inclusion of Ticketmaster, the national 
ticketing service, which was taken over by Seattle investor Paul Allen last 
year. Allen is a shareholder and co-founder of computer software giant 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Allen wants to use Ticketmaster as a launch pad into the coming 
age of interactive television and has been having talks with several of the 
cable industry's biggest players, including Liberty Media Corp., the 
programming arm of Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium is not expected to launch its music channel until 1995 and will 
concentrate initially on fast-growing overseas markets that are just beginning 
to receive cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of mixing MTV's lucrative child and young adult audience with home 
shopping has also spurred MTV to begin testing the sale of CDs and other music 
industry merchandise later this year, with the possibility of launching a new 
MTV-oriented home shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Time Warner is the country's second-largest cable TV operator and 
would be able to support a domestic launch, most cable systems nonetheless do 
not have the space to add more channels. Additional channel capacity on U.S. 
cable is not expected for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, challenging MTV domestically will not be easy. The pioneer video 
music channel is in almost every cable TV home, and its sister service, VH-1, 
reaches 47 million. MTV claims that worldwide it is available in 251 million 
homes. In the mid-1980s, cable mogul Ted Turner tried to launch a competitor to 
MTV, but it failed after a few months.

MACY TO CUT 700 JOBS IN WEST, 200 IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. on Friday said it will eliminate 700 jobs in its Macy's West 
division, including about 200 in Southern California, as part of its bankruptcy 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate announcement, the New York-based retailer said it plans to 
rebuild its Bullock's store at Northridge Fashion Mall, which was badly damaged 
during the Jan. 17 earthquake. About 250 workers at the Northridge store will 
be idled, bringing the total Southland layoffs to about 450. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is offering severance packages to the Northridge employees 
but will try to rehire them when the store is replaced.  
</P>
<P>
 The other layoffs, which are unrelated to the earthquake, are part of Macy's 
efforts to cut costs in a bid to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
Of the 700 affected Macy's West employees, 650 are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest are in the four other states in which Macy's West operates: Arizona, 
Nevada, Texas and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's West operates 52 department stores under the Macy's and Bullock's 
names. The job reduction program will not affect the 13-store I. Magnin chain. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of the affected California employees are executives at the company's 
West Coast headquarters in San Francisco. The remaining 600 work in the 
company's 44 Macy's and Bullock's stores in the state, about one-third of them 
at the 16 Bullock's stores in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 600 layoffs will include employees who operate in alterations, stock 
inventory, window display, bridal registries and fitting rooms. Sales positions 
will not be eliminated, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These staff reductions are a painful but necessary step in our ongoing 
efforts to remain competitive and return Macy's to profitability," said Michael 
Steinberg, chairman of Macy's West. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores, which bought a large stake of 
Macy's debt earlier this month, has expressed an interest in merging with Macy, 
but Macy has said it plans to continue to operate independently. Macy is 
expected in March to ask a New York Bankruptcy Court for an extension on a 
scheduled presentation of a complete reorganization plan.

 Channel 11 General Manager Quits: Tom Capra, general manager of Fox-owned 
KTTV, resigned, saying he wants to focus on producing television 
projects."Recent events in my life and my family's life led me to examine what 
I want to do from here on out," said Capra, citing the extensive damage to his 
Woodland Hills home in the recent earthquake and the death earlier this month 
of his father-in-law, film producer Joe Juiliano. The resignation is effective 
immediately. Capra joined Fox in November, 1992. He was director of KNBC-TV 
Channel 4 in the 1980s and, until 1991, was an executive producer of NBC's 
"Today Show."

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; HUMOR IS 'BEAUTY'S' BEST FEATURE; THIS BROADWAY ON 
TOUR PRODUCTION KEEPS TONGUE IN CHEEK AS IT RECOUNTS THE TALE OF A ROYAL FAMILY 
BEWITCHED BY A GRUDGE-BEARING FAIRY.

<P>
 As any wide-awake young prince knows, to be truly gallant, you must encounter 
risk. Fire-breathing dragons could give you a nasty burn, and the local giant 
could smoosh you faster than you can say fee-fi-fo . . . well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse. You may find yourself (ewwww!) kissing a virtuous maiden to 
free her from a wicked fairy's spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Prince Charming looks at it in Broadway on Tour's "Sleeping 
Beauty," a musical one-act adaptation with music by Norman Sacks and book and 
lyrics by Barbara Fried. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by a cast of nine 8- to 15-year-old actors, this "Beauty" keeps 
tongue in cheek as it recounts the tale of a royal family bewitched by a 
grudge-bearing fairy. Rhesa Gloeckler directs this bite-sized musical, which 
continues through March 6 at the Broadway on Tour's theater in The City 
shopping center in Orange. The show is suitable for children ages 3 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Disney film version, in which the prince is seen but briefly, this 
telling allows viewers to get to know him more intimately. The fairy 
demographics are altered, too: Instead of three fairy godmothers, Princess 
Beauty is aided by just one, and Prince Charming (or "P.C.," as his pals call 
him) has a fairy godfather all his own -- a Rodney Dangerfield/Marlon Brando 
hybrid who provides many of the show's funniest moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried's script keeps within shouting distance of the familiar tale. The family 
of king, queen and baby Beauty are intact, and the foul-tempered fairy who was 
passed over as the child's godmother still wreaks her vengeance by casting a 
spell that, on the child's 16th birthday, sends the kingdom into a deep, 
presumably eternal sleep. As mentioned, the prince arrives on cue, plants a 
peck on the lady fair and breaks the spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolerably presented, "Sleeping Beauty" can usually hold young children's 
attention, and this production does that handily. Laurie Holden's 
straight-from-the-storybook costumes don't hurt either (the fairy godmother's 
gown is a confection of pink netting and glitter that any 5-year-old girl would 
covet). 
</P>
<P>
 But Fried's script also sneaks in some puckish humor for older children and 
adults, both in the dialogue and in lyrics spiked with wordplay and the 
occasional, truly awful pun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gloeckler has given the whole shebang a melodramatic gloss that's appealing as 
well. Front-row audience members (the first two rows in the house are reserved 
for children) are included in the action from time to time, and children and 
adults are encouraged to boo the bad guys, applaud the hero and shout advice to 
the characters whenever the mood strikes. At Saturday's performance, the mood 
struck often. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast, featuring children who have appeared in past B.O.T. shows or are 
enrolled in the company's theater-training program, carries the whole thing off 
rather well. The kids seem at ease in their roles, suggesting that each of them 
helped develop their characters, rather than being shoehorned into them by the 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen-year-old Ryan Buttes, nattily turned out in gangster pin-stripes and a 
fedora, is a riot as the fairy godfather who must arrange a suitable adventure 
for his charge. Garret Baker, 11, and Stephanie Boyd, 14, complement each other 
as the prince desperate to be a hero and the bewitched princess conveniently in 
need of one; and Carlos Ascencio and Lisa Stier, both 11, make a comic 
sweet-and-sour match as the king and queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-olds Daina Baker and Melissa Shaw have some prime moments as the 
Fairy Godmother and the Bad Fairy; imagine Barbie and Roseanne Arnold going 
head to head, and you have an idea of what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Beauty isn't the only one looking for a hero at this theater. 
According to a company spokeswoman, come June Broadway on Tour will lose the 
space at The City the troupe has occupied since last summer, and so far, board 
members have been unable to find a new permanent venue.

COMEDY REVIEW; SHORTCHANGED ON 'MONEY'; WAY OFF BROADWAY PROFITS FROM 
IMPROVISATIONS BUT IS IMPOVERISHED IN SKETCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every once in a while someone decides that money is funny. It has been the 
subject of songs, plays and films. Now, Way Off Broadway is devoting an entire 
evening to it, from scripted sketches to improv. 
</P>
<P>
 How funny is "Money Makes the World Go 'Round"? Depends on your point of view. 
A lot of the sketches are media oriented, which general audiences might find a 
bit esoteric. WOB's tendency to overstate, overact and over-mug further reduces 
the material's potency. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little subtlety either in the writing, by various members of the 
company, or in the performing. Excess is the order of the evening whether it's 
the continuing saga of repulsive private eye Spit Phlegmster (a length of 
mucous dangling from his nostril) or another of those organ-slinging operating 
room capers WOB finds so amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politically incorrect ethnic humor -- including a reprise of an idea from 
an earlier show about two Jewish matrons hustling savings coupons -- could be 
deleted without hurting the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The written material has something of an advantage in that director Tony 
Reverditto keeps it moving so fast that it doesn't get dull, except during 
those moments when the performers' concentration wanders or they look as though 
they're trying to remember their lines, which on opening night was often, 
prompting members of the audience to supply their own punch lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the most honest laughs came during the improv sections, which 
Reverditto ran as smoothly as a TV show warm-up comic. His enthusiasm and 
persuasion saved these sections, and for once the audience participation was in 
keeping with the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the whole shebang, what worked best was a bit in which Reverditto and 
Karen Kawolics created dramatic scenes from audience-provided sayings and 
one-liners about money. It had freshness and a sense of invention that was 
missing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other performers, only Steve Andreno and David Alan Nelson 
demonstrated some of the restraint and control they all should have had. 
</P>

TELEVISION REVIEW; 'FORAY' TUNES INTO MUSIC, SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How to sustain visual interest in televising a musical event remains a 
challenging and unsolved problem. Teresa A. Merloni, producer of "A Musical 
Foray" (at 3 p.m. today on KOCE Channel 50), tackles the issue through an 
enhanced music-in-attractive-sites approach. 
</P>
<P>
 For performances of works by Mozart, Haydn and Bach, she places the musicians 
in, respectively, the Marion Davies House (reportedly built for her by William 
Randolph Hearst), the Pilgrim Lutheran Church and the Heritage Museum, all in 
the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The players wear stylish outfits evoking the 1920s and '30s, presumably 
because the locations were built or are otherwise connected to these periods, 
although none of the music is. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the costumes are charming, but poor pianist Eric Kinsley, in 
suspenders, slacks and open-neck shirt, looks rather like a janitor who 
wandered into the church and sat at the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera discreetly floats -- sometimes swimmingly -- between the 
serious-faced musicians and the locales. But the emphasis remains on the music. 
There are few technological tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the local players look fairly fresh out of the conservatory, and their 
interpretations tend to be youth-driven, secure, competent, but also cautious 
and lacking in expressive character. 
</P>
<P>
 Oboist Kathleen Light, clarinetist Kathryn Nevin and bassoonist Angela 
Anderson play Mozart's Divertimento in B-flat, K. 439b, with perky charm but 
limited variety in character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsley, probably the most familiar name among the players, plays Haydn's 
Sonata in C minor, H.XVI:20, with fluency, but he treats the music as purely 
abstract. There is surface clarity but no inner tension or drama. 
</P>
<P>
 He returns as harpsichordist to join flutists Robert Shulgold and Tsutomu 
Carton and cellist Joo Won Kim in Bach's Trio Sonata in G, BWV 1039, played 
with tight ensemble and avoidance of affect.  
</P>
<P>
 Some nits: Most close-ups of the scores do not show what is being played at 
that moment, which is distracting. The light filtering through the 
stained-glass windows of the church creates a strange fog around the piano and 
the player. Still, this is Merloni's first effort at such a presentation, and 
overall the results are positive. 
</P>
<P>

and Mozart, airs at 3 p.m. today on KOCE Channel 50.

FERGUSON WILL NOT SEEK REELECTION TO ASSEMBLY; POLITICS: AFTER FIVE TERMS, HE 
HOPES TO MOVE TO STATE SENATE. WOULD-BE REPLACEMENTS LINE UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Veteran Assemblyman Gil Ferguson surprised county Republicans Friday and 
announced that he will not seek reelection so that he can pursue a campaign 
next year for an expected opening in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), serving his fifth term in the Legislature, said it 
would be inappropriate for him to seek election to the Assembly in November and 
then announce within a few weeks that he plans to leave the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson authored a bill recently that would prevent state lawmakers from 
doing exactly that. He said the special elections required to fill vacancies in 
the Legislature -- sometimes costing $1 million -- can be an unnecessary burden 
for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ask you for your vote and then turn around and run for another 
office," said the burly ex-Marine, known in Sacramento as an outspoken 
conservative. "I think this is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said he plans to run next spring for the state Senate seat now held 
by Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is a heavy favorite to win election 
this year to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's current term does not expire until 1996, so if she wins the county 
seat, a special election would likely be ordered next spring to fill the time 
remaining in her term. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), whose district also overlaps with 
Bergeson's, has indicated she may run against Ferguson for a Senate vacancy, 
setting up a major showdown between two veteran Orange County lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly something I'm looking at, (but) in this business, you don't 
know what's going to happen a year from now," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also said she rejected Ferguson's claim that he was trying to save 
taxpayers money. She charged that he was not running because he feared that he 
would lose to an expected moderate Republican challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound too jaded," she said, "but I would say that would 
probably be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's announcement quickly set off a mad scramble among ambitious 
candidates interested in filling one of the most coveted Republican seats in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's 70th Assembly District spans the coast between Newport Beach and 
Laguna Beach, stretching inland to include Irvine. It is rich in both wealthy 
constituents and Republican voters. GOP voters account for 60% of the 
district's electorate, outnumbering Democrats by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours of Ferguson's morning announcement, Republican insiders 
identified nearly a dozen potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Reinecke, an attorney and the son of a former California lieutenant 
governor, was the first to announce that he will definitely seek the office. By 
Friday afternoon, the candidate issued a press release announcing his plans 
under the campaign letterhead: "Reinecke, conservative for Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republicans who said they are considering a bid for Ferguson's seat 
included Chuck DeVore, a former congressional staffer and White House aide in 
the Reagan Administration; Jo Ellen Allen, a former Assembly candidate and 
California director of the Eagle Forum; John Moorlach, an accountant and the 
assistant treasurer for the county Republican Party; Bruce Peotter, a Newport 
Beach lawyer, and Phillip B. Greer, an Irvine lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no doubt one of the most attractive seats in the entire state," 
DeVore said. "You've got a dynamic, business-oriented, entrepreneurial 
district. This is not a depressed area." 
</P>
<P>
 GOP officials also offered a list of potential candidates that included 
Newport Beach City Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart; Costa Mesa Councilwoman Mary 
Hornbuckle and Marilyn Brewer, a staff assistant to County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Toledano, an Irvine lawyer, said he plans to run as a Democratic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incumbent for the seat will not file for reelection, the deadline 
for candidates to register with the county is extended until Feb. 14.

'BLACK ORANGE' MAGAZINE MAKING ITS MARK; MEDIA: 2-YEAR-OLD PUBLICATION GAINS IN 
READERSHIP AND REPUTE AS IT COVERS NEWS AND ISSUES AFFECTING COUNTY'S AFRICAN 
AMERICANS.

<P>
 When Joyce and Randall Jordan moved here from Chicago nine years ago, they 
left a city with one of the largest black populations in the U.S. for one where 
blacks constitute less than 1% of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 What ensued, the couple said, was culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer could they go to a nearby food market to purchase grits and other 
"soul food," or visit the local hair salon to get the latest black styles. Most 
of what they needed was available in Los Angeles, but the couple still longed 
for the camaraderie of other African Americans closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on this day in 1992, they did something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Jordans published the first issue of what would later 
become The Black Orange, the only publication that regularly compiles events 
and services aimed at Orange County's tiny black community. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four monthly issues later, the publication has grown from a single-page 
schedule of events to a small magazine that includes community news and offers 
hard-hitting commentary. The Black Orange lists everything from job 
opportunities to a church directory and recently has begun tackling local 
controversies such as the fatal shooting of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy 
Darryn Robins by a fellow deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that the black community had been longing for. When we 
started to do this, we quickly realized what a big void we were filling," Joyce 
Jordan said. "People were excited and amazed at what was going on throughout 
the county. Without the support and calls from the community, this magazine 
would not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jennifer Randolph, 28, a Santa Ana resident: "It's been a real gift. I'm 
glad that someone is taking the time to do this. I read it regularly and try to 
go to as many events as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Jordans never envisioned an ongoing publication. In fact, 
the first issue was intended to be the only issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Jordan had volunteered to work for the county's Historical Commission 
after learning that the group was having difficulty organizing events and 
activities for Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assignment: create a list of the month's events and activities, and 
distribute it during the Black History Month Parade and Cultural Fair the first 
weekend in February. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only days after passing out 500 copies of the free list, the cost of which was 
absorbed by the Jordans, the couple began receiving numerous calls from people 
who wanted one or wanted to add their event to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so well received, the response was so good, that we came out with a 
special edition," she said. "By the time February was over, we had requests 
from businesses to advertise in future issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, we were kind of shoved along," Joyce Jordan said.  
</P>
<P>
 In mid-1992, the Jordans made their first "leap of faith" into the business 
when they decided to stop photocopying the magazine at a copy center and 
purchased their own copying equipment. A computer system and a copier cost them 
at least $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 From their garage and an adjoining makeshift office, the couple -- who had no 
experience producing a publication -- wrote text, updated listings of events, 
handled advertising and printed the magazine with the help of friends who 
volunteered their time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Orange's circulation has grown to 2,500, and the $1.75 publication 
now can be found at 10 different locations in Orange County and one in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's issue includes a "special news" commentary by the couple that 
questions safety procedures and circumstances surrounding the death of Robins, 
a black deputy who was shot on Christmas Day during a training exercise. The 
Sheriff's Department has called the shooting accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Jordan said such commentary is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black community had an obligation and a right to look into all aspects of 
the shooting," he said. In fact, when he and his wife talk about the Black 
Orange, they describe it as the community's publication. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert MacLeod, the general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriff's 
Assn., said that Jordan and other black leaders should not have made the 
incident into a racial matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problem with his publication. My quarrel is that they're trying to 
turn this into a racial issue, and it's not," MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeffery Baxter of Irvine, a 38-year-old sales executive who buys the Black 
Orange every month, said, "I think the questions they raised about the shooting 
were valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said he considers the publication "an indispensable source of 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for five years so I can attest that things were pretty lonely 
for a while," Baxter said. "I read all of their material. It's pretty 
interesting." He added that "through the Black Orange, I've been able to find 
out about a lot of ethnic organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Jordans were given appreciation awards by at least five 
different black organizations in Orange County. Such feedback, the couple said, 
makes their job worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 But the publication has a way to go before it becomes an influential voice 
with local policy makers. Local officials, including Sheriff Brad Gates, said 
they had not heard of the Black Orange or did not regularly read it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Breton, former mayor of Mission Viejo and now a City Council member 
here, said that he knows of the publication only by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard about it through the local newspaper but have never read it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, speaking through an aide, said that he was unfamiliar with the Jordans' 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jordans said they are working toward the day when their magazine is a 
voice for African Americans, a publication that can unite a community that has 
no hub in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide an outlet for people to express themselves," said Joyce Jordan. 
"This vehicle represents the community's voice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Orange is not yet a profitable venture. The Jordans' costs total 
$3,000 a month, but they earn less than half that amount in advertising 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Jordans made their second "leap of faith" by leasing an 
expensive printing machine to take the place of their copier, which could no 
longer handle the demands of the publication's monthly circulation.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Jordan, 42, gave up a full-time job in favor of part-time work in order 
to concentrate on the publication. This month, Randall Jordan, 43, who had been 
working as a computer network specialist, was laid off when his company reduced 
its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, they have been working from "sunup till sundown" with the 
Black History Month edition. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of income from work has instilled a sense of urgency in the couple to 
turn a profit on the magazine. They said that they are getting closer to 
achieving that goal and should be breaking even by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Joyce said, she would like to hire a full-time employee to run the 
magazine when profits allow. In the meantime, the couple supplement their 
income from the magazine by operating a separate printing and mailing service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep saying to ourselves that we're going to take a vacation, but we never 
have the time," Randall Jordan said. "If I knew then about the amount of time 
that had to go into this, I wouldn't have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Jordans will celebrate the Black Orange's second anniversary with a 
party at Images, a Santa Ana store that specializes in merchandise for the 
county's black community.

'IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN JAIL'; LOCKED ACCESS GATE TRAPS SHANTYTOWN'S 40 TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA and FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A standoff at high noon on a rambling canyon ranch with a history as long as 
any Western tale left Aaron Salgado wondering Friday what would become of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to do," said Salgado, standing behind a locked metal gate 
literally separating his home from the outside world. "It's like we're in jail, 
but we're not in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding territorial feud between rancher Sam Porter and his neighbors 
stranded Salgado and about 40 other tenants of a shantytown on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest action in the saga of the settlement known as Porterville came 
Friday when the Trabuco Highlands Community Assn., backed by a court order, 
locked a newly installed gate that blocks the shantytown from the subdivision 
of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Chadd, a spokesman for the association, called the situation unfortunate 
but unavoidable, and one that's causing homeowners anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Another roadway onto the ranch through two neighboring nurseries off Trabuco 
Canyon Road remained blocked because of an easement dispute with Porter, 
leaving tenants with no way onto the ranch except by walking at least a mile 
along a rugged, dry creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants, trapped in the middle of the dispute, pleaded for more time to raise 
money for moving. They wondered how their children would get to and from 
school, and how two pregnant women would receive medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is to live here in peace," said Eusebio Salgado, an 18-year-old 
who lives in predominantly Latino Porterville. "We can't afford to go anywhere 
else. We make very little money." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of people from nearby St. John's Episcopal Church and School in 
Rancho Santa Margarita arrived at the gate to help the families find new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This breaks my heart," said Fernando Pedraza, a school employee. "We want to 
do whatever we can to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Porterville, which sits next to the Cleveland National Forest, has survived 
floods, windstorms, the Great Indian Trail fire of 1980 and long periods of 
drought. But this latest action is "the end of it," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter said the only way he can help his tenants, who pay an average of $50 
per person per month in rent, is to give them two-week eviction notices. He 
said he informed them more than a week ago about the impending gate closure and 
doesn't want them risking their lives on the creek trail when the rains start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, you have an island of 233 acres without any legitimate access," 
he said. "Obviously, I'm not content with what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter has said his namesake settlement was established because "it is my 
Christian, charitable obligation to provide people who work for a living a 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 But others have accused him of exploiting his tenants for rent, while allowing 
them to live in what some say are deplorable conditions in the ramshackle 
community of travel trailers and homemade cabins. The settlement has communal 
toilets and showers, but no electricity. The county has tried to dismantle the 
camp several times in the last decade, citing numerous fire, safety and health 
code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A court agreement reached between Porter and the William Lyon Co. in July, 
1992, gives the association the right to build a gate blocking the 645-home 
subdivision from the ranch, Chadd said. Porter and his immediate family have a 
key to the gate and are the only ones allowed in. The Orange County Fire 
Department also has access in case of an emergency, Chadd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadow Rock Lane, the street that ends at the ranch, is not built to handle 
the excess traffic generated from the ranch, and residents have complained 
about speeding cars, noise and people passing into the encampment at all hours 
of the day and night, Chadd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to respond to our constituency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadd said the association has given Porter and the tenants plenty of notice 
about the gate, which was completed last week. They were also given advance 
warning that a security firm allowing people through the gate all week would be 
leaving at noon Friday, meaning the gate would be closed for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tenants did make a getaway minutes before the gate closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the saga of the people of Porterville played out, some of the neighbors 
in Trabuco Highlands said they felt the tenants were the victims of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of makes me mad," said homeowner Rhonda Kyrias, as she delivered a 
child of one of the migrant families -- her son's schoolmate -- at the gate 
Thursday evening. "These people are trying to make a living, and they're not 
being allowed to come and go as they please. This is America. You can't lock 
people in like this." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, like Stella Esmilla Lawson, who lives right across the street from 
the gate, said it was not a question of discrimination but of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been construed as a racist thing, but it is not," she said. "I say 
it is good that they're closing the gate permanently because of the traffic 
issue. This road wasn't designed for so many cars. There are about 100 homes 
along this block and that's a lot of cars. It's a matter of safety, not 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Sakaida, manager of Sakaida Nursery next to the ranch, said he, too, 
feels bad about the situation, but believes Porterville poses serious fire, 
health and safety problems that should have been resolved by the county years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Porter runs a slum encampment," Sakaida said. "He's trying to make 
this into a racial issue. But basically, what it is to us is a safety, security 
and health issue."

UNION BLAMES BUDGET CUTBACKS FOR FIRE DEATH; LABOR: A WESTMINSTER FIRE CAPTAIN 
SAYS REDUCED STAFFING HAS COMPROMISED PUBLIC SAFETY. CITY OFFICIALS ASSAIL HIS 
CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL and BERT ELJERA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the beleaguered Westminster firefighters union charged Friday 
that the City Council's decision to cut the Fire Department budget some months 
ago has compromised public safety and contributed to the fire-related death of 
a mentally disabled man two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragedy is the direct result of the mayor and council placing politics 
above the safety of the people," Capt. Mike Garrison, director of the 
Westminster Firefighters Assn., said during a news conference at Fire Station 
No. 2, in the heart of Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark D. York, 33, died early Thursday evening as flames engulfed the rear of 
Christian Residential Care, a board-and-care home on Candlewood Street. His 
body was found in a bathroom on the bottom floor of the two-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The bold charge about York's death brought a swift rebuke Friday from City 
Council members, including two who are targets of a recall drive backed by city 
firefighters. They said the firefighters are using the York case to argue their 
point even though it has yet to be determined whether there was any chance York 
could have been rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it somewhat disturbing that the union can reach this type of 
conclusion when the investigation by the state fire marshal has not been 
concluded," said Councilman Craig Schweisinger, who faces a recall drive 
because he voted to cut the fire service budget. "It's apparent this union 
official would stoop to anything to maintain their money and power grab in the 
city," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Battalion Chief Chief Glen Hines said the state fire marshal is 
investigating the fire because the building was a state-licensed facility. Any 
conclusion about York's death or the cause of the fire is premature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison said during the conference that staff cuts at the station nearest 
Christian Residential Care meant that there were not enough firefighters to 
conduct an adequate search of the building immediately after they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up two melted fire helmets and face masks, he said that the first team 
was driven back by intense heat because there was no second crew to punch holes 
in the roof and vent the heat from the burning interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the professional opinion of not only the Westminster Firefighters 
Executive Board but the on-scene battalion chief that had Station 2's (second 
engine) . . . been in service, this fatality would not have happened," Garrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two fire engines previously stationed at the firehouse was removed from 
service after city officials -- concerned over excessive overtime costs -- 
ordered spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's assertions about the tragedy represent some of the strongest public 
statements firefighters have made in a bitter ongoing dispute with the City 
Council over staffing and over whether department personnel improperly billed 
the city for inordinate amounts of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say the city and new Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. are simply 
out to break their union. City leaders contend that the Fire Department has 
been poorly managed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, the City Council asked the Orange County district 
attorney's office to look into whether firefighters and their superiors 
improperly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime pay. An 
investigation of that matter is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison predicted Friday that the district attorney will not find any 
evidence that firefighters improperly claimed overtime pay or engaged in any 
broad scheme to defraud the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions about fraud were raised last month when city auditors disclosed 
that about $1 million in overtime was paid in fiscal year 1991-92 (the overtime 
budget had been set at about $710,000). 
</P>
<P>
 The audits indicated that some firefighters, some of them high-ranking, had 
been collecting $20,000 to $40,000 a year in overtime pay. City officials say 
they suspect that some firefighters were paid overtime for hours that were 
never worked and improperly collected cash for sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Paul Gilbrook is facing termination proceedings after a city 
investigation indicated he collected money for sick leave he had used and had 
driven a fire engine when his driver's license was suspended. Gilbrook has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to overhaul the department and reduce overtime, the City Council 
passed a reorganization plan last summer that took one ladder truck out of 
service at Station 2, eliminated six firefighter positions, and made use of 
floaters to reduce overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 After the plan went into effect, a recall drive was launched against Mayor 
Charles Smith and council members Schweisinger, Charmayne Bohman and Tony Lam. 
About 7,000 signatures are needed to qualify the recall for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the firefighters association, which represents everyone on 
the 63-member department except the chief, say they back the recall movement 
because the council's efforts to streamline the fire service have seriously 
jeopardized public safety. They say the council's failure to hire enough 
firefighters to fill all shifts has led to a need for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffing had been reduced from 20 firefighters on duty at any one time to 16, 
a 20% reduction, Garrison said. Overall, the firefighter ratio in Westminster 
is 0.63 per 1,000 residents. The National Fire Protection Assn. recommends one 
firefighter per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison also charged Friday that the cutbacks were little more than 
retaliation against the Fire Department because its members supported Joy 
Neugebauer for mayor instead of Smith. He quoted Schweisinger as having told 
firefighters: "Joy lost. Chuck won. Chuck is anti-fire, and you people are 
going to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what they tell you, the City Council is reducing fire protection in 
the community," Garrison said. "The people are going to pay the ultimate cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger has denied ever making such a statement about Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Fry said the decision to eliminate the fire truck from 
Station 2 was "primarily a money matter" that was made after Fire Department 
officials, including the fire chief, assured the council that public safety 
would not be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger said the union's assertions about York's death and public safety 
are irresponsible and show a lack of concern for taxpayers and for the 
possibility of exposing the city to "tremendous liability" before all the facts 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
 These charges are being leveled merely to "distract the people from the 
criminal investigation of the Fire Department, and to take the heat off the 
firefighters union for a while," Bohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, Capt. Craig Campbell, the department's spokesman, said that an 
autopsy showed that York's death was caused by smoke inhalation and said that 
"the fire started on his bed." He said investigators "have ruled out foul play 
or arson and determined that it was an accident."

STATE AGENCY LETS STAND CITY BEACH CURFEWS; CRIME: COASTAL COMMISSION, WHILE 
PRAISING EFFORTS TO FIGHT CRIME, WILL INSTEAD DRAFT GUIDELINES TO PROTECT 
RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A top administrator of the California Coastal Commission told representatives 
of six Orange County cities Friday that the state will not challenge the 
curfews the cities recently imposed to curb late-night crime on their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the commission will draft a set of guidelines to be used in 
determining when and how curfews may be enacted without violating state laws 
and ensuring the public's right to beach access, said Peter Douglas, the 
commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is not to get into a debate, but to look at the issue and find 
sensible solutions," Douglas said at a meeting at Huntington Beach City Hall. 
"This is a very emotional issue, and I'm trying to get it down to a rational 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was the first in a series of scheduled meetings between state 
and local officials to iron out their differences over the curfews. The 
argument was sparked last October after Douglas issued warnings to 73 cities 
and counties along the state's 1,100-mile coastline that beach curfews are 
illegal without state approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities -- including four in Orange County -- had recently imposed curfews 
to curb late-night crime. But Douglas' letter characterized the actions as 
violations of the state Coastal Act, which assures public access to California 
beaches, and suggested that state approval of such actions would not be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 A chorus of outrage ensued from city and county officials who argued, among 
other things, that local governments could no longer afford the extra police 
patrols necessary to assure peace at their beaches after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about the imposition of regulatory control," Orange County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder told Douglas at Friday's meeting, which was 
chaired by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). "That translates into 
dollars to the taxpayer. It almost implies that you know better than we do, 
that we are not to be trusted. I feel that our jurisdictions need to be trusted 
without needing Big Brother to be validated." 
</P>
<P>
 Those sentiments were echoed by other local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are closest to the problem and know what our problems are," said 
Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson.  
</P>
<P>
 After imposing curfews, Moulton-Patterson said, her city experienced a 
dramatic reduction in crimes on the beach. "I think you have to give us some 
credit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Christoph, the mayor of Laguna Beach, said that while her city had not yet 
enacted beach curfews, it may want to do so in the future. "It's not a simple 
issue," she said. "At some point, the city may have to do something, and we 
want the authority to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas mentioned several issues that he suggested could be addressed in the 
Coastal Commission's curfew guidelines. Among other things, he said, the 
guidelines could help cities determine when beach closures are really 
necessary, under what circumstances crime could be reduced by limiting hours to 
such areas as parking lots and fire rings, and how to ensure the right of 
law-abiding citizens to engage in such harmless activities as fishing and 
strolling on wet sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in the front line in the struggle against crime and violence," he 
told the local officials, "but I think we can outline an approach that can be a 
model for other jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said he would meet with coastal commissioners on Feb. 16 to draft the 
new curfew guidelines. Then, he said, the guidelines would be made available to 
local officials at another meeting in Huntington Beach later the same month.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMBLOR PUTS VALLEY LIBRARIES IN ANOTHER BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already reeling from recent budget cuts, city libraries were severely pummeled 
by the powerful Northridge earthquake, which toppled bookshelves, broke windows 
and felled light fixtures and ceiling tiles in more than a dozen branches, and 
left three San Fernando Valley sites with structural damage and indefinite 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills, North Hollywood and Woodland Hills branches of the Los 
Angeles Public Library were hit hardest by the temblor, and deemed unsafe to 
enter by city officials. The three are closed indefinitely, pending further 
inspection and damage estimates, but library officials expect the closures 
could last more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 County libraries also suffered in the quake, but only the Valencia branch in 
Santa Clarita will be closed for more than a few weeks. It may be closed as 
long as four months because of severe damage from flooding. The San Fernando 
Library and the Newhall Library will probably reopen early in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, five more libraries will reopen early next week, leaving 14 closed. 
Six of those suffered damage that will require extensive repairs. Libraries 
already were struggling to serve their communities, strained by more a 25% 
reduction in staff in the past three years, and a 25% reduction in materials in 
the last year. Now, with more than a dozen branches closed, including Granada 
Hills -- the busiest of the city's 64 libraries with more than a half-million 
in circulation annually -- the task of providing library services is even more 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating," said Elizabeth Martinez, the city librarian. "It's 
obviously going to affect service in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the crunch caused by the indefinite closures of the busy branches, 
library officials plan to extend hours at other sites, using staff members from 
the closed branches to fill the gaps. But library users who have materials 
checked out from the damaged buildings should keep them -- without accruing 
fines -- until their own branch reopens, said Robert Reagan, a library 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the library foundation donated $100,000 for cleanup and minor 
repairs of the less badly damaged libraries. Officials also are hoping to 
receive funds from the federal government and private citizens to cover more 
extensive rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had two branches burned in the riots, we raised $900,000 to replace 
them," Reagan said. "Of course we are concerned. But we're not going to keel 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the Granada Hills branch, in Porter Ranch, Reagan's optimism took 
the form of a groundbreaking Thursday for a new library -- one of three Valley 
branches expected to be open by the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to expect the fiscal picture to improve," Martinez said. "You have 
to believe in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Los Angeles County and city libraries damaged, Burbank and 
Glendale libraries also had their share of toppled shelves and interior damage. 
This week, Burbank reopened its central library and its Buena Vista branch and 
will open its Northwest branch Monday after shelving books and clearing ceiling 
debris knocked loose in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, two of five branches, the Chevy Chase Library and the Brand Park 
Library, remain closed to the public.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ILLNESS SPREADS AT CAMPS FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colds and coughs have spread rapidly among earthquake victims living outdoors, 
adding to the misery of those displaced from their homes and prompting some 
health officials to worry that outbreaks of more serious diseases could follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no statistics are available, doctors say they are seeing a high 
number of flus, colds, digestive ailments, ear infections and bronchitis among 
earthquake victims, especially small children. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are sending more people to hospitals for what should be minor 
ailments. Mark Perez, a doctor with El Proyecto Del Barrio in Pacoima, said of 
the children he has diagnosed with flu, an usually high number -- about 5% -- 
have been hospitalized for dehydration, a result of being in camps where water 
was in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and other health workers say they are also concerned that the camps may 
be fertile ground for chickenpox because of the difficulty of quarantining 
children living in the tents. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to stave off such problems, Kaiser Permanente announced an 
emergency $120,000 grant to six local health clinics Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kaiser grants will be used for extra doctors and supplies, such as 
injectable antibiotics. The demand has been great for antibiotics in pill form, 
which must be refrigerated, and many earthquake victims have no way to keep 
them cold, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Los Angeles County health officials have treated more than 10,000 
earthquake victims at local clinics and mobile emergency medical units. Medical 
services have also been provided through a wide array of volunteer efforts 
organized through local hospitals and medical groups as far away as New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking help included Pacoima resident Maria Esther Diaz, who fled her 
home the night of the earthquake clutching a naked baby in her arms.  
</P>
<P>
 A night outdoors without proper coverings was too much for 11-month-old 
Everett Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two days he started this cough, very bad, this agh . . . agh . . . agh ," 
Diaz said. Everett developed such a severe case of asthma and bronchitis that 
when Diaz brought him to a clinic, doctors rushed to strap his small face onto 
an oxygen mask, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For doctors, medical practice in the camps has meant dealing with extreme 
forms of ordinary complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez shook his head as he examined the leg of an elderly Panorama City woman 
who nearly developed gangrene after receiving a deep gash while escaping her 
home during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Beatriz Navarros, waited five days to go to a doctor, and in the 
meantime developed a severe infection that spread rapidly down her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something we usually would have seen," Perez said. Speaking in 
Spanish, Navarros said she didn't have the time or money to deal with the cut 
after the quake left her homeless. Charged with caring for her 89-year-old 
mother outdoors, she simply poured hydrogen peroxide on the wound and hoped for 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these miseries, some public health officials are counting their 
blessings.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the camps have bred colds aplenty, there has been no outbreak of any 
severe intestinal illnesses, always a danger when clean water is in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real test of health conditions in the camps is still weeks away, 
according to some doctors and nurses working in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious infectious diseases, such as hepatitis A and chickenpox, take 
several weeks to incubate. So for the moment, their spread in the camps is 
invisible, said Kaiser Permanente doctor Linda Croad, who specializes in 
infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Croad and others are already anticipating new outbreaks of chickenpox 
resulting from the camps, and they say influenza cases may also rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of a chickenpox outbreak was downplayed by Caswell Evans, director 
of public health programs and services for Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, as he breezed through Valley emergency health clinics Friday 
as part of a fact-finding tour with Philip R. Lee, U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services assistant secretary for health.  
</P>
<P>
 Evans dismissed the concerns, adding that there is "no more likelihood of 
children catching chickenpox in camps than if they were in school." 
</P>
<P>
 But his statements were belied by his own staff in the field, who maintained 
that kids stay home from school if they're sick, but can only be removed as far 
as the next tent in a camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, the doctor in Pacoima, said that he has already seen at least 20 cases 
of chickenpox in east San Fernando Valley camps. In many cases, the victims 
were not quarantined until well after the infection had set in and were living 
in close proximity to other children in the meantime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A child infected with chickenpox will not show symptoms for two to three 
weeks. Moreover, the disease can be transmitted before any spots appear on the 
skin, so even quarantining the visibly sick won't keep it from spreading, said 
Bernie Nelson, director of nurses for the Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said that other ailments, such as hepatitis A, take two weeks to a 
month to incubate. Because people in camps are using outhouses and have fewer 
opportunities to wash their hands than if they were living indoors, there is a 
greater likelihood that hepatitis will appear and spread, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croad said she is also worried that the camps may promote the spread of 
tuberculosis, already increasing at epidemic rates in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates of tuberculosis are high among immigrants and homeless people, groups 
that are thought to be well-represented in the camps, she said. Tuberculosis 
can be transmitted by exposure to airborne microbes over days or hours. 
Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people out there with coughs, right now. This is something 
we are very worried about," Croad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis carriers may assume they have a minor cold and cough all night in 
crowded tents without realizing they risk exposing their neighbors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs for the county health 
department, said such risks are decreasing hourly as the camps empty out and 
medical services become progressively more organized. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some, even fear of illness cannot conquer their dread of returning 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aseda Corona, who brought her 3-year-old son, Mario, to Perez's clinic for 
treatment for a cough and ear infection, said she knew that living more than a 
week outdoors was hurting the boy. But going back indoors is no simple matter. 
The boy still cries with fear as soon as he crosses the threshold, she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SEISMIC SELLERS; ENTREPRENEURS FILL GAP WITH 
QUAKE SHIRTS, HAIRCUTS AND CAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the Rubble Rush of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Gold Rush that lured prospectors to California in 1849, 
fortune-hunters are hoping to strike it rich on the collapsed structures and 
frazzled emotions of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 From T-shirt hawkers selling a sense of survival only blocks away from San 
Fernando Valley death traps, to Hollywood collectors marketing "Genuine 
Celebrity Earthquake Ruins," there seems no limit to these shaky 
entrepreneurial ventures -- which also include earthquake menus, earthquake 
haircuts and even a "No Quake Cake." 
</P>
<P>
 "They sell so good it's sickening," said Ricardo, who took the red-eye from 
Miami a week ago to peddle shirts in Granada Hills. Printed with a map of the 
Valley and the slogan "I Survived the Great California Earthquake," the shirts 
were being sold for $10 each by the grizzled vendor. A veteran of the trade, he 
said his last lucky break was Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 How many people are rushing to profit off the disaster? There is no official 
count, but one shirt wholesaler alone -- Shirtique of San Francisco -- says 
it's cranking out shirts for 40 vendors working the corners of Los Angeles. And 
vendors say their ranks will soon increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Super Bowl ends, the vendors will be all over here," said 
70-year-old Bob of Garden Grove, working the same corner as Ricardo on Tuesday. 
"They'll come from New York, Boston, Michigan, all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these vendors will not give their full names (because they do not 
carry the appropriate business licenses). But they freely admit their 
intentions -- to make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, perhaps, many Southland residents who have been affected by the 
quake seem to admire, rather than resent, their attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts some humor in the quake," said Mike Madelon of Canoga Park, who has 
bought six shirts. "It's like going to Magic Mountain and buying a T-shirt 
saying, 'I survived the Colossus.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Barber Mike Dimente agrees that humor -- and a soothing haircut -- is the best 
medicine for quake jitters. In red lettering on a board that replaced a 
shattered barbershop window, he scrawled "Shake and Haircut, Two Bricks" -- a 
play on the old slogan, "Shave and a haircut, two bits." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it would make a few people smile and forget their scary 
experience," said Dimente, who works at Archie's of Hollywood in Studio City. 
"Actually, we had somebody come in with two bricks. We honored it because he 
was one of our regular customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies have found that security sells better than humor, such as 
Russell/Packard Development Inc., which is taking orders for steel-framed homes 
in a 140-home tract in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company does not market the homes as "earthquake-proof," the 
response to newspaper ads since the Northridge earthquake indicate that many 
simply do not feel safe in their brick or wood-framed homes any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phones have been ringing off the hook from people who want us to build 
the houses in Hawaii and people who want us to build the houses in Sherman 
Oaks," spokeswoman Irene James said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who find themselves literally trying to eat away their quake-caused 
anxieties, Pam Bono created an appropriate face-stuffer: the double chocolate 
"No Quake Cake" with a yellow circle and slash through the word "Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "You need chocolate during times of trouble," said Bono, a baker for Vons 
Pavilions in West Hills. She sold all two dozen of the $3.95 cakes in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no more cakes are being made, Vons spokeswoman Julie Reynolds said it 
was not a matter of halting production because they were in bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they taste great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still earthquake-themed munchies in the Valley. At Il Tiramisu in 
Studio City, a new earthquake menu features "Shake Rattle and Roll" pasta, a 
traditional Italian dinner specially discounted to $7 for quake-rattled 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 To work off any extra pounds caused by quake-related overeating, personal 
trainer Michelle Hazlewood is offering 10 sessions at a special earthquake 
discount of 50%, or $275. Actually, she said, she does not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm out of work," said the 29-year-old mother of two from West 
Hills. "I usually go to my clients' homes, but my clients aren't in their homes 
anymore because they're condemned or they're yellow-tagged and they don't want 
to risk me coming over." 
</P>
<P>
 Other enterprising efforts offer ways to contribute directly to earthquake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Hospital Medical Center -- located almost exactly atop the quake's 
epicenter -- is selling a $10 shirt that crosses out "Medical Center" with a 
seismic wave and replaces it with the word "EpiCenter." All money from the sale 
goes to help the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a limit to what these "quaketreprenuers" can sell? At "Baby Jane of 
Hollywood," a movie-memorabilia shop in West Hollywood, owners Charles Moniz 
and Roy Windham used their Hollywood contacts to scrounge up quake-rubble 
tossed from celebrity homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices -- half of which goes to the purchaser's earthquake relief charity of 
choice -- range from $10 for scraps of a wall from Jimmy Stewart's house to 
$1,500 for a slightly damaged lamp from Barbara Streisand's. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our best piece . . . the Barbara Streisand Nose Lamp," Windham said. 
"It has six different noses" -- large, ceramic fake schnozzles protruding from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Windham admits that there are some quake-related items that even a major 
celebrity cannot sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen some rubble we decided to pass on," said Windham. "I won't say 
who it's from, but it was a broken toilet. We're not going to be that tacky."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NO OPINION DUE ON NEWPORT COAST DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren has rejected a lawmaker's request for a 
legal opinion on the fate of Newport Coast Drive, a portion of which will be 
converted into a toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) fired off an angry response to 
Lungren on Friday, complaining that the attorney general failed to address his 
bid for a full-scale investigation into possible malfeasance, not just a legal 
opinion on the fate of the disputed road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know if there's been any malfeasance here, and why no public 
hearings were . . . held before the county made a deal with the Transportation 
Corridor Agency that was buried in the bowels of an environmental impact 
study," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Ferguson requested a review by the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar and North Laguna residents rely on Newport Coast Drive for 
their daily commutes and to bypass traffic on Coast Highway and MacArthur 
Boulevard near Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 But tollway officials contend that the San Joaquin Hills tollway needs the 
right of way occupied by a northern stretch of Newport Coast Drive. When 
completed, that section will cost drivers a 50-cent toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Corona del Mar residents believe the fee will discourage people from 
using the road, resulting in more traffic congestion on local streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-mile, $1.1-billion tollway will connect the southern end of the Corona 
del Mar Freeway near John Wayne Airport with Interstate 5 near San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, whose legislation helped authorize toll roads in Orange County, 
nevertheless has argued that it's illegal to take a public road and turn it 
into a toll road, at least without public hearings. As a result of the Newport 
Coast Drive controversy, he has introduced a bill that, in future cases, would 
require authorities to provide toll-free parallel routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials contend that a free bypass will be built before the tollway 
opens. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Ferguson, Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Rodney O. Lilyquist 
wrote that "responses are not prepared . . . to resolve factual disputes or to 
resolve conflicting inferences which may arise from certain facts." JEFFREY A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CAPTAIN BECOMES 1ST BLACK BATTALION CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Austin never thought about becoming a firefighter until one day about 20 
years ago when a high school clerk said he would make a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'I can't be a fireman,' " Austin said, recalling that 
day at Valley High School in Santa Ana. "I've never seen a black fireman." 
</P>
<P>
 And through 19 years of working his way up the Anaheim Fire Department's 
ranks, he had never seen a black battalion chief from Orange County -- until he 
looked in the mirror Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, who was the department's first African American, was promoted Friday 
to battalion chief, the Fire Department's second highest rank. He is the first 
African American in county history to achieve that rank. His promotion ceremony 
will be held Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always said I'm going to be a fire chief, so this is the next step 
up," said Austin, 39. There are 10 battalion chiefs in Anaheim and Austin is 
one of six assigned to fire suppression. Two of the six are on duty at all 
times. Each supervises half of the city and takes command at the scene of large 
fires or incidents in his area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never set out to get recognition as the first black anything," Austin 
said. "But I made a decision a long time ago that I was going to get myself 
into a position to make things better for the black and minority firefighters 
coming up behind me. I want other black and minority firefighters to see what 
they can accomplish if they are dedicated and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the International Assn. of Black Professional Firefighters in 
Washington, about 8% of the nation's firefighters are African American, but 
less than 1% of the battalion chiefs are black. And there are only 37 black 
fire chiefs, the association said. Nationally, 12% of the population is African 
American. In Orange County and Anaheim, that figure is 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire service has historically not embraced African Americans as part of 
its force," said Romeo O. Spaulding, the association's president. "It wasn't 
until the late 1950s that most fire departments began to desegregate and it 
wasn't until the late 1960s and early 1970s before departments actually began 
to hire African Americans in numbers. And in many departments, it takes 20 
years" to work up to battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin said that when he started in Anaheim in 1974, a handful of people made 
it clear they didn't like him because of his race. He said a battalion chief 
told him once, "As long as I'm around, you'll never get promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some days when I didn't want to come to work," he said. "I never 
went public with the problems. I didn't want to be a whiner. I figured out ways 
to diffuse the problems without alarming anyone. . . . But I never said anybody 
has to like me. I just want them to respect me." 
</P>
<P>
 But through the years, Austin got promotions. He has been a fire inspector, 
arson investigator, public education officer, fire marshal, engineer and, since 
1986, a captain in the 210-member department. For the past five years, he has 
led a hazardous materials crew. 
</P>
<P>
 He also volunteers to organize the department's Christmas toy and food drives, 
directs a nonprofit day-care center and is active in a program that recruits 
minority and female firefighters. Last year, he won the county fire 
association's Msgr. John Sammon Award for his charity work. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; LAWS OKD LIMITING ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week passed three ordinances regulating adult businesses 
in what council members hope is a preemptive strike against pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws include a ban on nudity, tight regulations on massage parlors and 
restrictions on adult businesses to four areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members hope the ordinances, totaling 37 pages, will deter adult 
businesses from locating in Mission Viejo. No adult businesses exist in Mission 
Viejo, although one massage parlor will be affected by the new city laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when they look at our ordinances, (adult businesses) will want to go 
somewhere else," said Councilman Robert D. Breton. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had expected a large turnout from residents living near the 
adult business zones. However, after a year of controversy marked by more than 
a dozen public hearings and workshops, only a few citizens spoke against the 
anti-pornography package. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a community, we understand and accept the need for an adult business 
ordinance," said Betty Porche. "However, we feel the areas you have chosen for 
(adult business) zoning will create slum areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, more than a hundred people have attended meetings to protest the 
ordinance. Council members said the small turnout Monday showed that the many 
hearings and workshops held in the past year made it clear that the U.S. 
Constitution forbids an outright ban on adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community has come 180 degrees in its understanding of our dilemma," 
Breton said. "We are bound by the First Amendment protection of freedom of 
expression. We can't restrict their right to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of overlay zones in less desirable areas of the city was the best 
way to protect residents from the offshoots of adult businesses, such as higher 
crime rates, said city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A maximum of nine adult businesses will be allowed in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult business ordinance passed on a 3-1 vote. Councilman William S. 
Craycraft objected to one zone off El Toro Road north of Marguerite Parkway 
because children walk through the area after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the anti-nudity law, topless and nude dancing is prohibited. The massage 
ordinance requires masseuses to have at least 100 hours of training. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; QUAKE DELIVERS A HARD PUNCH TO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the most dramatic images of the Northridge earthquake -- felled 
buildings, flames and water spouting simultaneously from the ground and 
collapsed freeways -- came from Granada Hills in the immediate aftermath of the 
powerful temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the tremendous destruction inflicted by the quake is visible on 
nearly every street in the sprawling community, from an entire block of 
red-tagged buildings on Kingsbury Street, to boarded-up storefronts in the 
area's main business district on Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that everybody got major damage," said Gary Farajian, president of 
the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. "It's just that nobody was spared." 
</P>
<P>
 Farajian, who owns a heating and air-conditioning company, said that although 
residences sustained more structural damage than commercial buildings, 
businesses in the community were hit hard. "It's troubling," Farajian said. "We 
were just starting to dig ourselves out as a community. We were just starting 
to hold our own. This could push a few operations out of business."  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most obvious evidence of the destructive power of the quake in 
Granada Hills is the collapsed Kaiser Permanente building and the ravaged 
portion of the Simi Valley Freeway over Hayvenhurst Avenue. But many other 
businesses, from gas stations to restaurants to supermarkets, remained closed 
this week as owners assessed property damage and began the arduous process of 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Council 
District 12, which includes Granada Hills, Northridge, Chatsworth and portions 
of Sylmar, North Hills and West Hills, was the hardest hit by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Delli Quadri, a senior structural engineer for the department, said 6,075 
buildings in the district were damaged, 354 of which were red-tagged as unsafe. 
Of those, 276 are residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither were Granada Hills churches and schools spared by the quake. Three of 
the eight schools dubbed the "Big Eight" by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for the severity of the damage were in Granada Hills: John F. Kennedy 
High School, Robert Frost Middle School and Van Gogh Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Mike Slattery of St. John Baptist de la Salle on Chatsworth Street, 
which suffered severe structural damage to its 100-foot bell tower and other 
buildings, said repairing the church is not the first priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll start with building the people back up -- renovating them and giving 
them hope," Slattery said. "The buildings will come later." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents living in the Knollwood section of Granada Hills lost block 
walls and suffered significant damage to their homes. But John Moranville, 
president of the Knollwood Property Owners Assn., said that for most residents, 
the damage is just an expensive inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are just saying, 'who cares?' " Moranville said. "I have the same 
attitude. My family is safe. The rest doesn't matter." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; AREA ASSESSES THE CHALLENGES OF REBUILDING

 Like most of its neighbors along Ventura Boulevard, Studio City suffered 
widespread damage during last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most vivid reminder of the temblor's fury lies in a pile of 
smashed Spanish tile, stucco and glass resting on a hillside off Sunswept 
Drive.The rubble was once a majestic Mediterranean-style home with a commanding 
view of the San Fernando Valley. But the 3-year-old house imploded during the 
powerful temblor, burying 75-year-old Beatrice Baitman. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are less dramatic reminders as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment buildings marked with telltale red and yellow tags are a common 
sight on the community's residential streets. The damage and restrictions will 
likely leave thousands looking for new places to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Boarded-up storefronts dot a popular stretch of Ventura between Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, the heart of the Studio City 
commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commercial areas suffered a great deal of damage not only from buildings 
being condemned, but also from loss of inventory," said Sondra Frohlich, 
executive director of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Frohlich worries that businesses already reeling from the recession would have 
a tough time rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Frohlich said Jerry's Famous Deli, Bank of America, CBS and City National Bank 
all reported damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One well-known business hit especially hard was Art's Delicatessen, which was 
badly damaged in a fire following the quake. Art's has been a landmark eatery 
in the community since 1957. It's slated to reopen in three months.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be back, bigger and better than ever," said Caryle Bryan, a waitress 
and hostess for 17 years at the family-owned deli. SCOTT GLOVER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SCHOOL DISTRICT, CITY OK JOINT-USE PACT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified School District trustees and the City Council this week 
approved the joint use of two district elementary schools, their adjacent city 
parks and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At their respective meetings Monday, the two agencies unanimously agreed that 
during school hours the city will give Fred Newhart Elementary School, at 25001 
Oso Viejo, priority use of Oso Viejo Park, and Bathgate Elementary School, at 
27642 Napoli Way, priority use of Napoli Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the district will provide an easement to the city to build a bus 
turnaround area, expanded parking lot and fence for the Norman P. Murray 
Community and Senior Center, next to Fred Newhart Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The district and city will split the expense of landscaping maintenance in the 
joint-use areas, which will cost each entity an estimated $37,200 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district and city agreed to give each other preferential use 
of facilities such as recreation centers, swimming pools, gymnasiums, ball 
fields and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reached updates a 1987 pact that was signed when Mission Viejo 
was an unincorporated community services district. That agreement was limited 
to the joint use of Fred Newhart Elementary and Oso Viejo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks and recreation officials for Mission Viejo, which became a city in 1988, 
recently approached the school district requesting the change. RICHARD CORE

 With eyes open wide, Lisa Cao, 10, leaned forward for a better view of the 
colorful dragon that thrashed and danced its way through the elementary school 
assembly room. She smiled as two boys, cloaked beneath the dragon costume, 
danced past her in a celebration of Tet, the lunar New Year that falls this 
year on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on the floor at Andrew Jackson Elementary School in Santa Ana, Lisa was 
one of hundreds of students who watched an assembly Friday focusing on the new 
year holiday, which is observed in China and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside an auditorium festooned with paper lanterns and dragons, student groups 
performed traditional dances and songs from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia and 
displayed authentic silk robes and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Lisa said the assembly provided students with a better 
understanding of other cultures and an appreciation for diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all living together, so we should all know what our differences are. It 
helps us learn about each other and about how to get along," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she added, "it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming Tet will mark the beginning of the Year of the Dog. Local events 
celebrating the occasion will include cultural festivals at Golden West College 
in Huntington Beach and Asian Village Mall in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West College festival will be held Feb. 5 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
and Feb. 6 from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. More than 50,000 people are expected to 
attend the event, which will include traditional dances, firecracker ceremonies 
and authentic cuisine. The events will be held on the campus athletic field, at 
Gothard Street and McFadden Avenue, said spokeswoman Lori Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster's Little Saigon, the three-day cultural festival will begin on 
Feb. 11. Events will be held from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily at the Asian Village 
Mall, in the 9100 block of Bolsa Avenue at Magnolia Street. Spokesman Van T. 
Tran said festivities will include martial arts demonstrations, carnival rides 
and hundreds of game and food booths. JON NALICK

 In an effort to save money, city workers will extend working hours Mondays 
through Thursdays and take every other Friday off beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said employees will work from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every other Friday.Streets that are

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; EARTHQUAKE CAUSES ONLY MINOR DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake Village, which straddles the border between Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties, fared better during the Jan. 17 earthquake than its neighbors on 
either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it every bit as hard as people in Thousand Oaks, Calabasas and other 
places," said City Manager Ray Taylor."But, for some reason, we were spared any 
real damage." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen residents requested safety inspections for their homes after the 
quake, Taylor said, but no serious structural damage was found. Part of a 
cinder-block wall in the city's Canyon Oaks neighborhood crumbled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village residents lost electrical power for about eight hours, Taylor 
said. Water service was not interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several audiocassettes at the library were shaken off the shelves, but were 
not damaged. The books stayed put. At City Hall, a picture fell from the wall, 
but did not break. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring towns were less fortunate. Several miles to the west, in 
Calabasas, nearly 40 homes were declared uninhabitable. Several miles to the 
east, in Thousand Oaks, the public library suffered $2 million in damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted, but I'm almost embarrassed," Taylor said. "We didn't get our 
share of damage." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VALLEY VILLAGE; SOME FEEL SLIGHTED BY CITY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's powerful earthquake caused relatively minor damage in Valley 
Village compared to many neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
 While many homes sustained cracks or collapsed chimneys, only three major 
structures have been red-tagged by city building inspectors as unsafe, said Tom 
Paterson, a member of the Valley Village Homeowner's Assn. who surveyed the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Those include the First Presbyterian Church at Colfax Avenue and Addison 
Street, and an apartment complex at the same corner. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a 40-unit, five-story apartment complex at Riverside Drive and 
Gentry Avenue has been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the limited quake damage, many residents, such as Lori Dinkin, 
president of the homeowner association, say they wish their elected 
representatives would have at least asked about their welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard one word from (Councilman Joel) Wachs. I haven't heard one 
word from (Councilman John) Ferraro," said Dinkin, whose organization 
represents about 3,500 homeowners. "I'm very angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky came to my house last week. He wanted to know how 
I was doing and to reassure us that he would try to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Weitzer, an aide to Ferraro, defended the councilman. She said she had 
instructed his Valley field office to contact all homeowner association 
presidents in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs aide Mark Freed said the councilman's staff received two calls from 
Dinkin last week asking why no one from that office had called her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Lori called upset, she was asked if she had any problems and she said 
no," Freed said. "Our office told her we were working on helping those who had 
called for help first." 
</P>
<P>
 Freed added that he and several other Wachs aides took time to survey the 
damage in Valley Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Freed and Weitzer pointed out that Valley Village is only a tiny portion 
of the council district, and that they were busy fielding requests for aid from 
other communities, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, you try to cover those that call you and have a problem," 
Weitzer said. "I wish we had staff to cover 230,000 people, but we don't." JEFF

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PLANS DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal believes it's a good idea. So do most of the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents are against a proposal to turn James A. Whitaker Elementary 
into a year-round school. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park School District Board of Trustees this week held a public hearing 
on changing to a year-round calendar at the school, which has 650 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker teachers addressed the board on the benefits and several parents 
voiced their opposition. No parents spoke in support. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Terry Hay said that 85% of those parents who returned a school survey 
about the change favored a year-round curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hay also said that nearly all of the school's 25 teachers support a year-round 
program, in which children would attend school for 12 weeks, then be off for 
about four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staff would like to have a continuous learning plan," she said. "It provides 
the opportunity for learning and practice on a routine basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our population, it's an advantage, a chance for them to be in the school 
and learn continuously." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees is expected to decide in March whether to make the 
switch from a traditional school calendar -- where students go to school nine 
months and are off three months in the summer -- to a year-round program 
starting in August. 
</P>
<P>
 A second public hearing is scheduled for Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Juanita Ayers, who works at a telephone company and has a fifth-grade 
son attending the school, said that one of her concerns is arranging day-care 
for her child. She also said that a year-round program will interrupt family 
summer vacations and valuable time she spends with her son during those summer 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers also said that both she and her husband work and that scheduling time 
off is difficult. "I work for a large corporation, and time off is scheduled a 
year in advance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of a year-round program say it improves students' learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students learn more -- it's less forgetting and less review," said Principal 
Dick Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Lloyd G. Davis said he also supports the 
philosophy of a year-round program because of the enhanced learning, especially 
for limited English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said about 50% of Whitaker's students have language needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hay said during the four-week break of a year-round program, courses will be 
offered for students who need extra help in certain subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Hay also said students would get about six weeks off during the summer so they 
can attend summer school or vacation with their family. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PROGRAM ADDRESSES NEEDS OF AMERASIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing a white smock and plastic gloves to protect her hands, Oanh Vo 
squeezed a bottle of hair color on a customer's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 At another booth in the salon, her husband, Thach Bui, with a pair of scissors 
in his right hand, a comb in the other, practiced by giving a doll a precision 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dream is to open a beauty salon and become financially independent in 
this, their adopted country. Toward that end, the couple are getting help from 
a special program geared for Vietnamese Amerasians, who were ostracized in 
Vietnam and find themselves strangers in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- for people who grew up in Vietnam but have American fathers -- 
is a joint effort between Fountain Valley-based Coastline Community College and 
the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique collaboration. We combine our expertise and resources to serve 
the special needs of the Amerasians," said Nghia Tran, executive director of 
Vietnamese Community, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, Vo, who is Amerasian, and Bui, whom she married in 
Vietnam before they emigrated, are enrolled at Tam's Beauty College in Garden 
Grove. Three nights a week they also attend classes offered by Coastline, where 
they learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Miklich, Coastline's dean of instruction for basic skills and English 
as a second language, said a two-year, $100,000 federal education grant was 
awarded to start the program, taught in Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's goal is to integrate the Amerasians into society by finding them 
jobs and making them self-sufficient, Miklich said. A main part of the program, 
started last November, is to teach the newcomers English. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also builds self-esteem, offers counseling and cultural experiences, 
assistance to find jobs and plans to recruit Amerasian tutors to serve as role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Pat Roemer said 11 students are currently enrolled in the class, 
with plans to expand the program to 40 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui and Vo, parents of a 6-year-old son and with another baby on the way, live 
in a one-bedroom Garden Grove apartment. They left Saigon four years ago 
because Vo, 29, came looking for her American father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to find my father," said Vo, after her mother abandoned her, "To see 
him would make me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a struggle since the pair, married eight years, came to America. 
They live in a crime-ridden area and feel unsafe, they said, but do not have 
enough money to move from their government-subsidized apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roemer, who's been teaching English to Vietnamese refugees since 1989, said 
the Coastline program for Amerasian refugees fills a significant need in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Amerasians were ostracized in Vietnam because they are half American and often 
were kept out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, often they lived on the streets and survived by selling 
cigarettes or peanuts. Some never had a formal education, and a lot of them are 
orphans," Tran said. "In their mind, their sufferings were a direct result of 
being an abandoned child of an American. By coming to the United States, some 
of these Vietnamese Amerasians believe their sufferings would be alleviated and 
that the United States holds a better life and better future for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once they get here, culturally and linguistically they are Vietnamese and 
they don't fit in the mainstream either." 
</P>
<P>
 Literacy problems with a new language created other difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need basic literacy skills to get a job here, because they want to be 
independent," Tran said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; TANAGER BASKETBALL HOOPS TO STAY DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Park commissioners decided this week to leave the Tanager Park basketball 
hoops down for another three months, after hearing almost three hours of heated 
public argument about troubles at the basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks, Recreation Facilities & Parkways Commission in October ordered four 
basketball hoops removed after residents complained that players were unruly, 
rude and were threatening to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was set to consider in April reinstalling the two 10-foot 
baskets and two eight-foot baskets. But two Estancia High School basketball 
players complained about the loss of the facilities at a December City Council 
meeting and the issue was sent back to the parks commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the more than 125 people at Wednesday's meeting suggested solutions 
besides keeping the hoops down. These included installation of two back-to-back 
hoops on each court to eliminate full-court games; raising the two eight-foot 
hoops to 10 feet; posting signs banning foul language, and having police patrol 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman John De Witt said the commissioners will set study 
sessions this spring to work out a solution. He said two residents from each 
side of the issue will be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent city study said 14 additional basketball courts should be built to 
satisfy the enthusiasm of local players. The city now has 11 outdoor courts, 
including the two at Tanager, which are considered the city's best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Profanity, litter and graffiti were common," said resident Patricia Howell as 
she described the basketball courts before the hoops were removed. Resident 
Jackie Handleman said she had collected 430 signatures from neighbors who want 
the courts removed permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sarah Noland, a junior at Estancia and a member of the varsity basketball 
team, said she collected signatures from 535 students, faculty and parents who 
want the hoops replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Noland told the commission that players do not act to intimidate others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've met a lot of really nice people there," she said, as she described 
playing at the courts with her teammate and friend Sara Mooney. "We just want 
our courts back."WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; SAND ISSUE IMPERILS BEACH PANEL'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last month, all four members of the Beach Commission have resigned in 
frustration over the city's policy on sand replenishment, raising questions 
about the panel's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the commissioners, Tom Quinn, submitted his resignation at Monday 
night's City Council meeting.The council will decide in February whether to 
appoint new people to the commission or to abolish the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon LaBedz, a well-known environmentalist and a leader of the Surfrider 
Foundation, was the first commissioner to resign. "It just didn't seem like it 
was a fruitful use of time anymore," he said. "We've been pushing very hard 
that the main thing the beach needs is sand. It just seemed like no one is 
listening." 
</P>
<P>
 The erosion of sand off city beaches has long been a problem. If it continues 
unchecked, officials fear high surf could one day threaten beachside homes and 
businesses. But city officials said the millions of dollars it would cost to 
ship sand to the beach from gravel yards makes the idea prohibitive for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city is working with the Navy to see if the city can buy sand 
that is dredged from nearby Anaheim Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The former beach commissioners acknowledged that there are no easy answers to 
the sand erosion quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 But LaBedz criticized the city for recently allocating more than $100,000 to 
repair a cement groin under the pier. He contends that the money would be more 
wisely spent on a sand replenishment program.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 4 TEACHERS ACCUSED IN CAR, TOOL THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has requested that the district attorney file criminal 
charges against four teachers with the Orange Unified School District for 
allegedly stealing shop tools and donated cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The request, stemming from an investigation that began almost a year ago, 
involves three auto-shop teachers who allegedly failed to properly notify 
school authorities about vehicles donated to the district.Investigators are 
also checking into what became of the donated cars. A fourth teacher in special 
education has been accused of taking welding equipment, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials contacted would not provide details about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the case is filed, and it goes to the grand jury, which I hope it does, 
then we can release more details," said Detective Barry Weinstein of the Orange 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 However, David Reger, president of the teachers' union, denounced the charges, 
claiming that the four instructors are being "railroaded." Reger, who is 
confident the four will be vindicated, said they did not violate any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the problems in our district right now, for them to single out 
hard-working shop teachers who are trying their best to help out their students 
seems to me absurd," Reger said. "I think it's a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 The news represents another bruise for a district already seeking to fire one 
top administrator and demote two others in connection with a sexual harassment 
investigation. One of the administrators accused of sexual harassment, Deputy 
Supt. Richard Donoghue, told police about the alleged employee auto thefts 
nearly a year ago. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MAYOR CITES CITY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city accomplished a number of things in 1993 in spite of the recession, 
Mayor Frank Kessler told a gathering of about 150 business and city leaders in 
a state-of-the-city address Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Innovative approaches, grants, bond sales and a partnership with business 
helped the city "move ahead and accomplish quite a lot," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major developments for the year cited by Kessler included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a program to keep businesses in the city by removing "red tape" 
and creating an ombudsman to help firms deal with government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * A boost in public safety by the addition of six police officers through a 
federal grant and the creation of a community policing program where officers 
work closely with residents to remove crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * The beginning of construction for two new water wells to improve quality and 
emergency supplies through 1993 water bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * The purchase of the Orange County Transit Authority building as a new City 
Hall. The current City Hall, built in 1923, "is being held together by 
termites" and posed health and safety risks to employees, Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of property to expand the city auto mall on Trask Avenue next to 
the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new outdoor soccer arena that was paid for by a private company that will 
create revenue for the city in the form of rent and a percentage of gross 
receipts.ROBERT BARKER

INTEREST UP IN DISASTER RESCUE TRAINING; EMERGENCY: MORE AND MORE EMPLOYEES ARE 
LEARNING RELIEF SKILLS FROM FIRST AID TO USING AIR BAGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nine Xerox workers from El Segundo spent part of the day Friday in clouded 
darkness looking through fallen debris and broken structures for any signs of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not rescuers coping with the aftermath of the devastating Northridge 
earthquake or its many aftershocks, but rather a group of volunteers going 
through a weeklong training program designed to prepare them for just such an 
eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine workers, all full-time employees with jobs ranging from computer 
specialists to maintenance workers, are members of the company's volunteer fire 
team who practice twice a month. The group has been together for about three 
years. Most of them also went through the state fire marshal's heavy rescue 
training about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's disaster training was undertaken at JS Seminar's Disaster 
Simulator Training Center in Huntington Beach. They put in 40 hours taking 
written and practical tests involving everything from emergency first-aid to 
how to operate the same type of air bags and "Jaws of Life" used in the 
Northridge earthquake to free trapped survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it virtual reality earthquake training -- right down to the chalky smoke 
billowing through the simulated wreckage of office spaces to the make-believe 
victims, played by a handful of Cypress High School students who volunteered to 
play the role of survivors pinned beneath huge wooden blocks and Styrofoam 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the senior instructor had seen firsthand what the Northridge 
earthquake did, and said the re-creation looked very similar to some of the 
actual quake areas he had surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not unrealistic in our representation," said Jim Mclain, the senior 
instructor for JS Seminars and also a member of the Orange County Search and 
Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stockdale and Nina Johnson, co-owners of the training center, have been 
in business for almost two years. Along with an instructional staff of seven, 
they specialize in teaching workers in major businesses such as FHP and UC 
Irvine how to deal with disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale has 25 years' experience as a firefighter and emergency room 
technician and is the retired chief of Orange County Search and Rescue, while 
Johnson spent six years with the California National Guard and worked for three 
years with Orange County Search and Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the demand for training is definitely increasing," Stockdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox maintenance worker Jay McGrath said that in wake of the recent 
earthquake, such training is invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very vulnerable to earthquakes and if the Big One does hit, we'll be 
prepared and maybe able to save some lives," he said. "I feel pretty confident 
with this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garey, deputy fire chief for Xerox, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely beneficial. Not only can this be used at work, but what 
these guys are learning right now can also be used at home or anywhere," he 
said.

STUDENTS, LAGUNA OFFICIALS DISCUSS FLYERS; EDUCATION: HIGH SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 
LEADERS TELL CITY ABOUT POSITIVE ASPECTS AT CAMPUS WHERE RACIST HANDBILLS WERE 
DISTRIBUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Several Laguna Beach High School students and staff members met with city 
officials Friday to discuss the racist flyers that were distributed on campus 
earlier this week and programs to promote racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Four student leaders spent an hour at City Hall with the police chief, mayor, 
school principal and school activities director, after student government 
President Sarah O'Rourke received Principal Barbara Callard's permission to set 
up the first-ever meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after school Tuesday, someone went to the high school's outdoor 
atrium where 300 lockers are located and stuffed each with a flyer that 
Assistant Principal Tim Sullivan described as a "disgusting, racial, white 
supremacist diatribe" against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke said she told officials that most students are still concerned about 
the incident. She said she wanted the city to know about positive aspects of 
the school amid a flurry of emotions the flyer had caused. She also requested 
funding to have the theater group Stop-Gap present interactive performances 
that aim to stop racial stereotypes and prejudice.  
</P>
<P>
 The school's activities director Dawn Mirone told city officials she thought 
they might have a negative view of the school after reading recent newspaper 
stories that explored racial tensions on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to let the City Council know what positive things we have done" to 
promote racial harmony, she said. "We thought (the stories) made students look 
like 'rich white snobs,' in the words of one student."  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said the city did not have that impression. "We think it's 
a good school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, students and faculty members on campus expressed anger and concern 
over the flyers. Corey Soria, a 17-year-old senior whose father is from South 
America, said, "I was pretty outraged that someone would do something that 
low." 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction of the school has been one of hurt and disgust," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he suspects the culprit is part of a white supremacist 
organization that is recruiting new members after reading about the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, police said, no suspects have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any solid leads at his point, but sometimes these people come 
forward themselves . . . to proclaim that they are the ones behind it," said 
Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said the distribution of the flyers was "a hate crime." However, he 
said that unless the school asks for it, there are no plans to add extra 
patrols around the campus, which is often open in the evenings for adult 
education classes and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 What the school is asking for now is less attention from the media, campus 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To keep stirring it up is what the outside group (responsible for the flyers) 
wants to happen," Sullivan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Callard agreed. "The students are real anxious to return to normalcy and 
privacy," she said.

RESIDENTS CONTINUE FIGHT OVER 5 MOTELS; ZONING: NEIGHBORS AND MERCHANTS 
COMPLAIN THAT PROSTITUTES FREQUENT THE AREA. POLICE URGE OWNERS TO CHECK 
IDENTIFICATIONS BEFORE RENTING ROOMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Van Nuys residents again denounced five Sepulveda Boulevard motels as magnets 
for vice and crime at a zoning hearing Friday held to consider ways to clean up 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision will be announced within three weeks, according to Daniel Green, 
associate zoning administrator who conducted the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents asked that the motels -- Cinema, El Cortez, Chateau, Town House 
and Bali Hi -- be closed, contending that restricting operations would not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joe Mariani said the Police Department does not 
advocate closure of the motels or limitations on operating hours. Mariani 
called on owners to check patrons' identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Both residents and business owners from the nearby Palms Plaza told similar 
tales of finding syringes and condoms on sidewalks near their homes and in 
alleyways. They said they have voiced the same concerns for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many female residents said they were regularly propositioned by customers 
mistaking them for prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Worthe, property manager for Palms Plaza, said he spent more than $25,000 
in security to keep prostitutes off his property.  
</P>
<P>
 "I walk the girls off and I watch where they go -- right up to the El Cortez 
Motel," Worthe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of both the Cinema and El Cortez motels denied that they catered to 
prostitutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cohen, Cinema owner, said he had taken the telephones out of his motel 
rooms and that "not having phones keeps out prostitutes and drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the owners of El Cortez said her clients regularly chased 
prostitutes away and would rather leave the motel vacant than rent to 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suggestions included removing the public telephones in front of the 
motels and putting them in the motel lobbies instead, and moving a nearby bus 
stop where prostitutes congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 If conditions are imposed on motel owners, they will be given time to comply. 
If they fail to comply, they could face closure, Green said. "The review period 
could be three months or three weeks based on some reasonable expectation of 
how long it takes to comply," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wait too long, people may feel we're doing nothing. If it's too short, 
(business) people may feel it's not an adequate probationary period."

MAN WHO KILLED BOY IN PARK SHOOTOUT SENTENCED; CRIME: LARRY DEAN SHAW GETS 20 
YEARS TO LIFE ON THAT CONVICTION AND 14 MORE YEARS IN WOUNDING OF TWO MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A judge sentenced Larry Dean Shaw to the maximum term in state prison Friday 
for the murder of a 2-year-old boy who was picnicking on Easter Sunday in a 
park where a gang shootout erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This obviously was a horrific type of crime," Superior Court Judge John 
Fisher said. "It seems to me this was one of the worst (crimes) in the Valley 
-- if not the entire city -- in 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Shaw in November of second-degree murder in the death of Ryan 
Brown, who was hit in the back of the head as his mother tried to flee the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Lee had testified she was trying to grab her son and run as the 
shooting erupted in Encino's Balboa Park following an Easter egg hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher sentenced Shaw to 20 years to life in prison for the boy's slaying, and 
then added another 14 years and four months for wounding two men during the 
shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Shaw, holding a gun in each hand, took up a position 
behind the car where Ryan Brown was hiding. The evidence indicated Shaw fired 
into the car, striking the boy with a 9-millimeter bullet. At least three other 
people were believed to be firing guns at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wounded in the shootout were Damon Napier, 26, of Sherman Oaks, and James 
Wright, 32, of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, a 32-year-old Van Nuys man with several prior convictions and a history 
of gang activity, attempted to persuade the jury that he was not the man 
witnesses identified as holding two guns during the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is fair the way I was found guilty," Shaw told the Probation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher said the evidence was overwhelming that Shaw fired the shots that 
killed Ryan Brown and wounded the two men, one of whom was left paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Shaw's two guns, recovered after a brief car case, had fired at 
least 17 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the horrendous nature of the crime . . . he should serve the maximum 
amount of time under the rules," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen Cady, who prosecuted the case, agreed and filed 
documents asking prison officials to keep Shaw locked up for the rest of his 
life. "He should never be released back into society," she said.

PIPE BOMB INJURES RESTAURANT OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a restaurant was injured slightly Friday by a pipe bomb found in 
a shoe box outside the eatery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second pipe bomb in the box failed to detonate. Kam Yee, 61, of Santa Ana 
was burned slightly on the legs after opening the shoe box, which he found near 
the front door of the Texas Cantina Restaurant in the 1400 block of East 17th 
Street, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Anthony J. Levatino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department Bomb Squad and paramedics responded to 
the restaurant, which has been closed since September. Deputies deactivated the 
second pipe bomb in the shoe box, and paramedics treated Yee for his injuries.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; UNSAFE TO DRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water service has been restored to nearly all customers of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, but an advisory to boil tap water remains in 
portions of the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the shaded area, residents should boil water for at least five minutes 
before using or consuming.To disinfect water with bleach, add 8 drops of plain 
household bleach per gallon of water if it is clear and 16 drops if it is 
cloudy. Mix well and let sit for 30 minutes. Water disinfected with bleach will 
have a faint chlorine taste and odor. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley areas in which the DWP advisory is still in effect include: 
</P>
<P>
 * North of the Simi Valley Freeway (118), between Reseda Boulevard on the west 
and the Golden State (5) and San Diego (405) freeways on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 * North of Devonshire Street, south of Rinaldi Street, east of De Soto Avenue 
and west of Woodley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers with questions should call (818) DIAL DWP or (800) DIAL DWP outside 
the 818 area code. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the advisory is lifted, residents should flush their plumbing system by 
running water in the bathtub or shower for at least five minutes. In addition, 
each faucet on the property should be run for at least a minute. If your water 
heater contains water delivered during an advisory period, drain it if 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clarita Valley, the following areas are advised to keep boiling 
their water: 
</P>
<P>
 * Newhall customers of the Newhall County Water District. Information: (805)

BOY, 10, FATHER WOUNDED; NEIGHBOR ARRESTED; VIOLENCE: SHOOTING FOLLOWED 
SUSPECT'S INTERVENTION IN DISPUTE AMONG FOUR MEMBERS OF ONE FAMILY, DEPUTIES 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A domestic dispute involving a family and a neighbor left a 10-year-old boy 
and his father wounded Friday night, the father critically, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor, Arthur Harry Triebel, 39, was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder and booked into Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told Orange County sheriff's deputies that the incident began with 
an argument involving four members of the same family in the driveway of their 
home in the 200 block of West Escalones. 
</P>
<P>
 Triebel attempted to intervene in the dispute, and shooting began, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies responded, Triebel turned himself in, saying "I'm the one you're 
looking for," according to Sgt. Steve Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
 A semiautomatic pistol was seized, and Triebel was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded man, 32, was taken to Mission Community Hospital, where he was 
reported in critical condition, undergoing surgery for a bullet wound to the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 His son was being treated at Samaritan Medical Center in San Clemente for a 
bullet wound to his index finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's wife and younger child, who were involved in the dispute, were 
not injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they were unsure of what prompted the family argument 
or the shooting, which was reported at 6:40 p.m. The names of the victims were 
not available late Friday.

 SURVIVOR'S GRATITUDE: Two days after the Northridge earthquake, Dutch-born 
Sidney Niekerk wanted to help people camped out in lots and the alleyway behind 
his lighted-sign business in Van Nuys. He knew bottled water and supplies were 
available from relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Niekerk went to the bank, drew out hundreds of $10 bills and made a lengthy 
excursion, handing out one bill to each person he encountered that day, and 
repeating the gesture the following Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought tears to my eyes. People are very nice, and they make the best of 
things," said Niekerk, whose Chainlight store and Grand Am Ltd. motion picture 
company is on Odessa Avenue in Van Nuys. He did not want to say how much he 
gave away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Jacobson, 41, an unemployed salesman who received a bill, was impressed 
with Niekerk's generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was walking the whole block, giving bills to everyone he met," Jacobson 
said. He said that Niekerk also assured people forced out of their apartments 
by quake damage that they could live temporarily on his parking lot if they 
needed to. Some did, and the last of the families left Thursday night. "They 
left the parking lot spotless," Niekerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his own background in an interview, Niekerk said he and his 
immediate family survived the Holocaust because he and his siblings scattered 
and were hid by friends. Reunited after World War II, his family emigrated to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God that I'm alive and living in a great country," Niekerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 GRATITUDE LIST: Father Sean Flanagan, pastor of St. Catherine of Siena 
Catholic Church in Reseda, is one of the three priests living at St. 
Catherine's, each with his own "favorite medium of spirituality," as he put it 
-- aside from the usual prayers and devotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake put a little extra into the trio's contemplative routines. 
</P>
<P>
 A 76-year-old retired priest living at the parish rectory always says his 
rosary, "but he was really crankin' 'em out that day," Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35-year-old colleague is into meditation. "But he lengthened it quite a bit" 
on Jan. 17, the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, 58, is involved in a recovery program that features making 
"gratitude lists." 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a long list that morning, especially that a 7-foot dresser that fell 
across my bed missed my legs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LUTHERAN DOLLARS: In 1992, a little-known Lutheran fraternal society raised 
$3.6 million for victims of Hurricane Andrew. In 1993, the same amount was 
raised for people affected by the Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL), based in Appleton, Wis., 
has allocated an initial $80,000 beyond its regular donation-matching program 
for victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that many of our 1.6 million members around the country will 
respond to this tragedy," said Ray Kuhlow of Reseda, a local representative of 
AAL, which offers insurance plans and community service activities through its 
8,520 branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised for victims of natural disasters is matched by the national 
office and disbursed through local Lutheran churches. Among the AAL agencies 
receiving an extra $25,000 in matching funds from the national office was the 
Donald Majer Agency in Calabasas.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; GROUPS WIDEN QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT; AID: RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE VALLEY MAKE LONG-RANGE PLANS TO ASSIST VICTIMS. THEIR 
GOAL IS $500,000. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as emergency relief centers scale down operations in coming weeks, 
religious leaders in the San Fernando Valley are making long-range plans for 
material and spiritual help to people missed by government aid months after the 
Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council, whose extensive social services 
consume much of its $2.5-million annual budget, is expected to be the major 
beneficiary of a $500,000 appeal for Northridge quake victims to be launched by 
Church World Service among mainline Protestant and Eastern Orthodox 
denominations. An undetermined portion of the appeal's proceeds will go to the 
Los Angeles-based Southern California Ecumenical Council, administrators said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley Interfaith Council is more organized to meet people's needs than 
any we have seen (at other disaster-struck areas) in the country," said Arlene 
Kool of Byron Center, Mich. She and her husband, Bill, are disaster response 
consultants with the Christian Reformed Church who were dispatched to the 
Valley to represent Church World Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of $500,000 may not be enough and may have to be increased, the 
administrators emphasized. The World Council of Churches has already 
contributed $10,000 to that appeal fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other donations are expected to find their way directly to the Chatsworth 
office of the interfaith council from religious groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got $4,500 from a group in Victorville, $1,000 from a ministerial 
association in Louisiana and a check from a church in Massachusetts," said 
Barry Smedberg, executive director of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the Salvation Army -- actually a church body but best 
known for its social work -- will be leasing up to 100 condominium units from 
the federal government to provide low-rent, transitional housing for people 
made homeless by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving out of the crisis stage into an intermediate phase for several 
months," Russell Prince, executive director of development for the Salvation 
Army's Southern California Division, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already placed about 10 families in the condominiums," Prince said. The 
condominiums, primarily in the Valley, are part of the Army's new Project EARTH 
(Earthquake Relief for Relocation and Transitional Housing), which had not 
previously been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Seventh-day Adventists, a group that had emergency supply 
centers at their San Fernando, Pacoima, Van Nuys and Northridge churches and 
ran two mobile feeding stations with Southern Baptists, are looking toward what 
relief official Dan Robles called long-range rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are putting some families back on track, especially in the Hispanic 
community, by helping them through the maze of filling out assistance forms," 
said Robles, who is based at the regional Adventist headquarters in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also are trying to help people cope . . . because indeed life goes on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presbyterian churches in the Valley, like other congregations in a nationwide 
denomination, are receiving offers from outside the state of money and other 
kinds of help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Steve Frank, earthquake relief coordinator for the Presbytery of San 
Fernando, said some donations will have to go toward rebuilding damaged church 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fulfilling the church mission to help others even as it hurts, Frank 
said the presbytery will be linking up with other cooperative relief efforts, 
notably the long-term effort of the Valley Interfaith Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council might not have been able to forge plans for a yearlong relief 
project except for the timely donation -- by Arthur Stevens of the Harmony 
Coalition -- of the use of a 1,300-square-foot warehouse in Chatsworth to store 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, 54, a financial services salesman whose background is Reform Jewish, 
said that he is following a religious experience, or vision, that appeared to 
clarify what he should do to help the needy. He formed a nonprofit corporation 
and acquired the warehouse Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Food, clothes, tents and other supplies -- as well as toys -- were trucked to 
the warehouse Thursday from Mormon Church sources. Another three truckloads 
were expected to follow, said Kimberly Schuler Hall, a Mormon public affairs 
representative based in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which coordinates relief efforts with such agencies as Catholic 
Charities and Lutheran Social Services, has more than 270 affiliated 
congregations -- Protestant, Episcopal, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Bahai and 
Unitarian, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of this project, it will be a stronger interfaith community," 
predicted Smedberg, the council's full-time administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is holding an open, information-sharing meeting on long-term needs 
at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
building, 5338 White Oak Ave., Encino. Red Cross, community agencies and 
government aid leaders will be there along with a wide range of religious 
representatives, Smedberg said. 
</P>
<P>

Council (818) 718-6460; Salvation Army Project EARTH (818) 781-5739; 
Seventh-day Adventist Church (818) 409-0114, Presbytery of San Fernando (818)

CALARTS STUDENTS FACE DIFFICULT DECISION; AFTERMATH: THE SCHOOL HAS SUFFERED AN 
ESTIMATED $10 MILLION IN EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE. THE WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE IS FEB. 11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with damaged facilities, lost supplies and limited access to their 
living quarters, CalArts students have until Feb. 11 to decide if they want to 
continue their education at the specialized school now hampered by an estimated 
$10 million in earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a frank talk with students this week, CalArts officials discussed the 
condition of the campus, plans for satellite classrooms, student concerns and 
the chances of getting a quality education this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I know I tell you," said John Fuller, CalArts vice president, "What I 
don't know I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, sounding weary from his efforts to help the campus recover from the 
6.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Jan. 17, said damages are still being 
assessed at the campus but some trouble spots have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos testing is ongoing in the main building, which encompasses 500,000 
square feet. A wall under the cafeteria had to be reinforced with steel beams. 
And while water and power have been restored, the college's boiler system must 
be repaired before heat will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 There is believed to have been minimal damage to most of CalArts' highly 
technical equipment, although campus officials are unsure how many students 
will be able to retrieve their project materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Several satellite classrooms have already been established. The music school 
is working out of Temple Beth Shalom in Newhall and faculty members' homes, the 
film school is using Vista Village Shopping Center in Valencia, the theater 
school is using tents on campus and a theater at Magic Mountain, and the dance 
school is transporting students to studios in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts are under way to secure a larger site to house CalArts departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The college is negotiating with Lockheed to use its abandoned laboratory 
testing site and hangar in Valencia. CalArts has offered half of Lockheed's 
asking price, and is hoping for a donation from the aerospace firm, said Steve 
Lavine, CalArts president. 
</P>
<P>
 Students must decide by Feb. 11 whether the modified offerings at CalArts are 
acceptable, as the deadline looms to withdraw for the semester and still 
receive a full refund. Tuition was $12,875 for the 1992-1993 school year, and 
enrollment included about 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The college was in its first week of the spring semester when the Northridge 
earthquake rocked the campus. The deadline to add or drop classes was extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Both students and administrators seemed frustrated at not knowing how much of 
the campus and project materials they will be able to retrieve from the 
earthquake debris. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter drafted and circulated by some students in the music school said 
tuition and other fees should be cut by at least one-third to reflect the 
reduction in facilities and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavine said he was doubtful tuition would be cut, but tried to assure students 
they would not skyrocket next semester either.

DOW RECORD, LOWER YIELDS FOLLOW REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks finished the week with another record-setting session 
Friday, as a government report showing strong economic growth accompanied by 
mild inflation cheered investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields tumbled on optimism about the low inflation figures. Gold 
stabilized after Thursday's big drop. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials rolled into record territory from the opening bell 
and never looked back. The Dow finished the day up 19.13 points at a record 
3,945.43. For the week, the blue-chip index gained 30.95 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelling stocks aloft was the government's first official reading on how the 
economy fared in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department said economic 
growth ran at a surprisingly fast 5.9% annual pace in the final three months of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Dow, broader market indicators also beat their previous highs, as 
investors bet that a healthy economy would lead to continuing corporate profit 
growth. The New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 1.04 points to a 
record 265.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Also setting a new high was the Nasdaq Stock Market composite index of mostly 
smaller stocks, which jumped 3.65 points to 796.53, topping the previous record 
of 794.28 set Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 12 to 7 on the NYSE, though 
volume eased from Thursday to 312.6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks led the market rally, boosted by the merger announcement 
between BankAmerica and Continental Bank, and by expectations that low 
inflation will allow interest rates to remain low as the economy expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp jumped 1 1/4 to 43 1/8, Barnett Banks surged 1 3/8 to 42, Federal 
National Mortgage gained 1 3/8 to 89 1/8, First Interstate leaped 3 to 71 3/8 
and Bancorp Hawaii added 1 1/2 to 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among insurers, Aetna Life jumped 1 3/4 to 59 7/8 after saying it will cut 
4,000 jobs. Also gaining in that group were Cigna, up 2 to 68 1/4, and Aon, up 
1 1/4 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks pulling the market higher included Clark Equipment, up 2 
1/2 to 57 1/4; GM Hughes, up 1 1/4 to 39 1/2, and Phelps Dodge, up 2 1/2 to 53 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * A stronger than expected earnings report boosted America Online 7 1/2 to 60 
3/4. But communications equipment supplier Scientific-Atlanta plunged 4 7/8 to 
26 7/8. Its earnings fell short of estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another loser was conglomerate Teledyne, down 2 1/8 to 23 5/8 after 
suspended cash dividends on its common stock.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa gained 30.29 points to 2,743.2, another new high, driven 
by hopes for a peaceful ending to the Chiapas conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also gained in Frankfurt, London and Paris. However, Tokyo's Nikkei 
average closed down 133.91 points at 18,757.88. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell to 6.21% from 
Thursday's 6.26%, despite the report of robust fourth-quarter economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, a surging economy should send bond yields higher on the premise that 
more aggressive economic activity could lead to inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's government report also contained data indicating that, while the 
economy is growing, inflation remains benign: The so-called GDP implicit price 
deflator, a broad-based measure of inflation, came in at 1.3% (annualized) in 
the quarter, well below the 3% some economists were expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold, which had plunged $7.10 on Thursday, eased 50 cents to $376.90 an 
ounce on the New York Comex, stabilizing despite the low inflation report. 
Silver finished the week at $5 an ounce, up 4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grain prices tumbled under waves of selling tied to diminished prospects for 
U.S. exports.  
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar surged on the economic news. It closed at 109.80 Japanese yen in 
New York, up from 108.55. It also closed at 1.743 German marks, up from 1.729.

MAINTENANCE; RUST AND DUST ARE TWIN THREATS TO GAS FURNACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuning up your gas furnace is something you can do yourself in less than an 
hour with a few simple hand tools and a vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the entire job consists of cleaning and lubricating the blower 
unit and cleaning and adjusting the burner assembly. This simple maintenance is 
your best front-line defense in the battle against the twin threats to furnace 
life and efficiency -- dust and rust. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as you stay clear of the control valve and limit switches and put back 
everything as you found it, there's little chance of error. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see if your burner is improperly adjusted by watching the burners in 
operation. A standard gas furnace will have two, three or four burners, each 
with some sort of ignition crossover device. 
</P>
<P>
 When the furnace starts, ignition should progress evenly from one burner to 
the next and without hesitation or a late flash. Once lit, the burners should 
operate with a steady blue flame. 
</P>
<P>
 If you see a burner-to-burner start-up ignition that displays a noticeable 
puff and small flash, then gas is not moving through the crossover pieces that 
ignite each burner in sequence. In all likelihood, one of these crossover 
members is clogged with dirt or rust. 
</P>
<P>
 If you see a burner that doesn't ignite at all, or only puffs on and off 
sporadically, it's a good bet that the gas jet that feeds it is partially 
clogged with dirt or rust. 
</P>
<P>
 A burner that shows flame gaps along its length during normal operation 
suggests that some of the gas ports are clogged. If you see a burner whose 
flame lifts off its ports, you can bet that the air mixture on that burner is 
too rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, a flame that burns orange and lazy (wavering from side to side) 
means there's too little air in the mix. Before attempting to regulate the air 
intake, the burner assembly should be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Before working on the furnace, shut off the electrical disconnect switch so 
the furnace can't come on. If there's no switch, turn the gas control from "on" 
to "pilot." Then vacuum the inside of the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove a burner for cleaning, remove the securing clip that holds the 
burner to the feed pipe. Then carefully lift the burner and slide it out of its 
seat below the heat exchanger cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it's removed, turn it so the open end faces down and tap the burner 
repeatedly on the floor or some other hard surface to dislodge rust particles 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've noticed gaps in the flames on that burner, poke a thin wire or small 
Allen wrench into each of the burner openings. Then tap the burner on the floor 
again. Finally, clean the openings in the crossover member with a thin-bladed 
knife and vacuum the entire chamber thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 To service the gas jet, back the entire jet from its threads in the feed pipe 
and then clean it with a thin wire or small Allen wrench. When the jet is 
cleared, thread it back into its opening until snug. No joint compound is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Burners are usually adjusted by either sliding sleeves or rotating end caps to 
align their openings to a greater or lesser degree with openings on the burner.

OUTDOORS; BIRDS WING IT WITH A LITTLE PLACE IN THE 'BURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Orange County birds live here year-round, and some are just passing 
through. Local residents of the human variety can provide food and shelter to 
both with little effort and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing a bit of hospitality can pay off by turning ordinary suburban yards 
into mini-wildlife sanctuaries. And this is a good time of year to try it out 
-- migratory birds not seen in these parts at other times of the year come in 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoted bird-watchers and novices alike will find it a relatively simple task 
to make their yards user-friendly. All it takes is a place for the visitors to 
eat, drink and catch a good night's sleep -- sort of like an avian Howard 
Johnson's. In addition to the migratory birds, locals will also take advantage 
of the offerings and visit often. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting up even the most rudimentary bird feeders and baths will draw 
visitors. Birdhouses are less likely to have residents but can be hung for 
aesthetic purposes to enhance gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds just seem to prefer to nest in natural dwellings and are only likely to 
inhabit a human-made birdhouse if it is near the foothills or if the yard backs 
up to one of the county's wilderness parks, according to Dick Purvis with the 
Sea & Sage Chapter of the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a nesting box in my yard for 15 years and have never had a bird use 
it," Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The handcrafted nesting boxes he supplies to the Audubon Society do attract 
nesting birds, but they are always in wilderness areas or parklands. Audubon 
has a program to try to replace nesting sites for birds in an effort to 
maintain the county's bird populations even as habitat is dwindling from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to attract bluebirds right now, and we have about 100 nest boxes 
in the county and about 75 pair of nesting bluebirds," Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purvis' nesting boxes -- the preferred term for birdhouses -- are made of 
scrap pine about an inch thick. The shape of a nesting box is not as important 
as the size of the entrance hole. It must be big enough only for the species of 
bird it is being set out for and too small for other birds who may prey on 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a box measuring four inches wide, four inches deep and eight 
inches high with a 1 1/2-inch in diameter entrance hole will accommodate 
ash-throated flycatchers, house wrens, plain titmice and house sparrows. But it 
is too small for European starlings, which displace many domestic species. 
FEEDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Placing feeders in a yard is probably the best way to attract birds. You can 
even influence the type of birds you attract by the type of feeder and food 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few standard types of feeders. Vertical tube feeders are made of 
clear plastic with perches and feeding portals along the length; they are seed 
feeders and usually attract smaller birds such as chickadees. Shelf feeders can 
be as simple as a platform nailed to a post or as elaborate as those made with 
storage hoppers that automatically spill more food onto the shelf as it is 
eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird tables provide feeding opportunities for birds that cannot cope with 
hanging feeders. There is usually a rim that prevents food from falling off and 
a roof to protect against rain. These type of feeders will attract sparrows, 
spotted doves and mourning doves. There can also be wire mesh surrounding the 
table to allow smaller birds in but keep larger ones out. 
</P>
<P>
 Covers on table feeders need to be at least 30 inches in diameter so that when 
it rains, the water rolls off, leaving the food dry, according to Purvis. 
</P>
<P>
 All feeders should be at least five feet off the ground to keep cats from 
jumping up and partaking in a little feeding of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of food put out for birds is as important as the design of feeders. 
The most universally attractive food is sunflower seed, especially the small 
all-black variety known as oil sunflower. According to "The Practical 
Ornithologist" (Simon & Schuster, 1990) white or red porso millet is favored by 
mourning doves and most sparrows. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to attract hummingbirds, it is necessary to hang a bottle feeder 
filled with sugar water, preferably one with the glass or feeding spigot 
colored red or orange. Hummingbirds are attracted to the bright color (do not 
color the water with food dye and do not use honey to sweeten it). 
</P>
<P>
 Hummingbird feeders should be sterilized periodically with hot water to keep 
fungus out, said Doug Willick, consulting biologist with P & D Technologies in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 But hummingbirds need some protein for a balanced diet, said Ray Munson, 
manager of Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary in Modjeska Canyon. "They can't live by 
eating just that sugar water stuff. Their teeth would fall out," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit flies provide the protein most favored by hummingbirds. Leaving a banana 
peel near the feeder will attract the flies and the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Placement of the feeders is also important. There should be plenty of brush 
nearby so birds can hide from predators. It's also a good idea to have feeders 
over grass so bird droppings do not become a nuisance on patios. BATHS 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think that just because it's not summer, birds no longer need a cool 
respite. Bathing in winter helps birds insulate against the cold by keeping 
their feathers clean, allowing for air to get trapped between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdbaths can be an eye-catching addition to a back-yard garden, provided they 
are kept clean and algae-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Baths need to be shallow but with plenty of room for splashing. Most birds 
bathe by wading in water no deeper than their legs. Two or three inches is 
usually sufficient. Sides of the bath should slope gently; some birds have 
trouble judging a bath's depth if the sides are too vertically sharp. Placing a 
flat rock in the center will give them an island to stand on.  
</P>
<P>
 A bath of 24 to 36 inches in diameter will allow for more than one bather at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around here baths should work well in attracting birds because it's 
relatively dry," Willick said. "Once they find they have a regular source, 
they'll keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to keep a bath clean is to change the water regularly and scour 
the bottom when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The only drawback to baths is that they tend to be a magnet for cats ready to 
pounce on unsuspecting bathers. The best ways to guard against this are to not 
have a cat or put a bell around its neck.

HEALTH GROUPS WRANGLE OVER RICH CONTRACT; INSURANCE: $3.5-BILLION CHAMPUS PACT 
IGNITES NASTY FIGHT BETWEEN AETNA AND FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The competition for a huge military health care contract in California and 
Hawaii has devolved into a gut-punching melee between rival health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the fight over the $3.5-billion contract -- the biggest of its 
kind in America -- is but an early glimpse of the corporate warfare that will 
spread across the country when giant new health purchasing alliances put even 
richer purses up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a warm-up fight," Dr. Jacque J. Sokolov, a Los Angeles health 
care consultant, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna Life & Casualty Co. in July was awarded the five-year contract under the 
Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (Champus), 
serving 800,000 military retirees and their dependents in California and 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Defense Department's largest such program and its most visible 
because it is the showcase for managed care techniques that have proved so 
effective in controlling costs. The strategy is so popular with beneficiaries 
that the Pentagon plans to adopt it nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sacramento-based Foundation Health Corp., which has run the program since 
its inception five years ago, cried foul over the bidding and has fought 
bitterly ever since to keep Aetna from taking it over Feb. 1 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation and another losing bidder convinced the Pentagon that there were 
problems with the bid evaluations, and the contract will be rebid this spring 
and awarded anew in July. But in the interim, the Defense Department ordered 
Aetna to assume the contract for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation has twice failed to reverse that decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The antagonism is intensified by the fact that Aetna is Foundation's key 
subcontractor on the existing Champus contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna runs the network of health care providers that serve Champus in Southern 
California, where three-fifths of the beneficiaries live. Foundation runs the 
Northern California and Hawaii panel and handles overall administration. 
</P>
<P>
 As Aetna scrambles to replicate Foundation's Northern California network by 
the Tuesday deadline, many doctors and hospitals are resisting its efforts to 
cut their fees and have refused to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a lot in our group who aren't signing," said Dr. Philip J. 
Reilly, president of Sacramento Physicians Network, a group with more than 150 
primary care physicians and 600 specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly personally agreed to join the panel, but he said the attitude on the 
part of some of his colleagues is that it's a seller's market for our services, 
so why sell cheap? 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that at least 13,000 Champus beneficiaries by Aetna's estimate 
-- more than 20,000 by Foundation's -- are faced with having to switch 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are especially high for Foundation, for which the Champus contract 
has provided 40% of all revenue. Losing the contract forces it to lay off 500 
to 700 claims processing employees in Sacramento -- 15% of the company's work 
force. Layoffs will begin Tuesday unless a last-minute court appeal is 
successful, Foundation spokesman Kurt Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna, for its part, says that all major contract transitions are turbulent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident that the beneficiaries will be very satisfied," Vice 
President Robert Kaplan said. For beneficiaries whose physicians have not 
joined the panel, Aetna is granting them a 60-day grace period before they must 
switch. In the meantime, Aetna will try to recruit such physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But many may not sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been squeezed enough," Monterey pediatrician Pierre LaMothe said. 
Foundation paid his practice group $40 per office visit five years ago and has 
since pushed the fee down to $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna offered $27. It later raised its bid to $34, but when LaMothe and his 
colleagues held fast, Aetna threatened to bring new doctors to nearby Ft. Ord 
and set them up in direct competition for LaMothe's patients, he said.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; REPAIRING THERMOSTAT IS NO SWEAT, BUT BE SURE TO SHUT OFF THE 
POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thermostats that control home heating and cooking systems seldom break, but 
when they do, most are easy to diagnose and fix. Even replacing a broken or 
outmoded thermostat usually is not too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 If a furnace or central air conditioner fails to start, try turning the 
thermostat's setting up (on a heating system) or down (on a cooling system) 
about 10 degrees. Doing so should start the unit. If not, go to the main 
service panel or fuse box and check for a tripped circuit breaker or blown 
fuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reset the breaker or replace the fuse if necessary and try again. If the 
system still does not start, check that the furnace or air conditioner itself 
has not shut down because of a malfunction. After eliminating these 
possibilities, suspect a faulty thermostat. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all room thermostats operate on low voltage that carries little risk 
of harmful electric shock. However, it is always wise to shut off power to a 
thermostat at the service panel before examining or working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tamper with a thermostat that controls an electric baseboard heater; 
these usually carry full-strength household current and can deliver a fatal 
shock. Have the unit inspected by a heating technician or an electrician 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To work on a thermostat, remove the cover and blow away any dust clinging to 
the inner parts. Look for small metal buttons called contacts that spring 
together when the thermostat works, completing a circuit that starts the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all thermostats have contacts. On those that do, adjust the thermostat 
setting to close them, then slide a coarse paper between the contacts to clean 
them. Do not use sandpaper or other abrasive material. 
</P>
<P>
 Also check for broken parts -- especially the coiled bimetallic spring that is 
the heart of most thermostats. If you find broken parts, replace the 
thermostat. Refasten loose wires by wrapping them clockwise around their 
terminal screws and tightening the screws firmly. Sometimes the screws are on 
the back of a thermostat plate. Remove the plate to reach the screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Burned wires can signal an electrical or fire hazard. Have any such condition 
inspected by a heating technician or an electrician immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Restore the power and try to start the system again with the thermostat. If 
nothing happens, bare the ends of a spare piece of any insulated copper 
electrical wire; then, while holding the wire by the insulated portion, touch 
the wire ends to the terminals on the thermostat marked "R" and "W." If the 
heating or cooking system starts, the thermostat is defective; replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above tests can be made on newer electronic thermostats, which 
have printed circuit boards. If these fail, consult the owner's manual and try 
installing new batteries. Replace the thermostat if the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace a thermostat, first shut off the power at the service panel. Remove 
the cover and plate, and then label the wires with pieces of masking tape 
identifying their terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfasten the wires. Unscrew the thermostat from the wall and lift it away, 
being careful not to let any wires slip into the wall where they will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Thread the wires through the rear of the new thermostat and attach the 
thermostat to the wall, using a level to make sure it is horizontal. 
</P>
<P>
 Connect the wires by following the labels and the directions supplied with the 
thermostat. Attach the front plate and any batteries; then attach the cover, 
restore power and test the thermostat by using it to turn on the system. Finish 
by programming the thermostat or setting it as required.
