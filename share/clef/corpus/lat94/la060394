MOVIE REVIEWS; 'COWBOY': ROUNDUP AT THE N.Y. CORRAL; WOODY HARRELSON IS THE 
SOLE BRIGHT SPOT IN A REWORKING OF THE 'COOGAN'S BLUFF' RIFF OF 'BUMPKINS' OUT 
OF THEIR ELEMENT.

 Woody Harrelson is the only reason to subject yourself to "The Cowboy Way," 
but to be a straight-shooter about things, he is not reason enough. Instead of 
enhancing his surroundings, Harrelson's breezy, amusing performance simply 
underlines everything the rest of the film is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on yet another idea from the cornucopian mind of producer Brian Grazer 
who, if the press notes are to be believed, came up with this gem "while 
horseback riding in his native California," "Cowboy" will be recognized by film 
buffs as a reworking of the tip-top "Coogan's Bluff," directed by Don Siegel 
and starring an especially laconic Clint Eastwood as an Arizona lawman out of 
his element on the steamy pavements of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps a sign of cinematic inflation that this time around "The Cowboy 
Way" is forced to send not one but two stand-up Western gentlemen into the 
wilds of Manhattan to right a wrong and see that justice is done. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico cowboys Pepper Lewis (Harrelson) and Sonny Gilstrap (Kiefer 
Sutherland) are a formidable team-roping combination and best pals since they 
were toddlers. But, in one of the film's many bogus plot contrivances, Sonny 
has been giving his partner "the Eskimo treatment" since Pepper was a 
mysterious no-show at the finals of a key tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "There we were, one steer away from the national championship," grouses Sonny 
in one of the many pieces of presumably authentic Bill Wittliff dialogue. 
Pepper, you may be sure, had his reasons for staying away, but once revealed 
they, like much else here, turn out to be as lame as an overworked plow-horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny and Pepper's best pal is a wise old Latino named Nacho (Joaquin 
Martinez) who accuses cranky Sonny of having "the heart of a tiny raisin." But 
before he can explain where he got such a gift for metaphor, Nacho is called to 
New York to try to rescue his daughter Theresa (Cara Buono). 
</P>
<P>
 She, illogically enough, is a dewy illegal just off the boat from Cuba who is 
in the unfortunate clutches of a bunch of slimeballs ramrodded by the nefarious 
Stark (Dylan McDermott). Forced to work in a sweatshop while Stark practically 
drools over her needlework, Theresa is clearly in need of the kind of help only 
two hopelessly naive cowboys in Manhattan can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 As directed by Gregg Champion, whose only previous theatrical feature was the 
forgotten "Short Time," "The Cowboy Way" has a tendency to milk every 
bumpkin-in-the-big-town situation it can think of. As a result, elements of 
"Midnight Cowboy" (Pepper catching the lascivious eye of effete fashion folk) 
awkwardly joust for position with cartoony violent echoes of "Home Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting bruised in the melee are some usually reliable actors, including Ernie 
Hudson as a mounted policeman who loves the West. Especially lost is 
Sutherland, whose thankless role as the straight-arrow, censorious Sonny mostly 
calls on him to frown and say, "I've had it with you," to the irrepressible 
Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing patience with Pepper is always understandable. A macho pain in the neck 
who never stops talking and preening, he could exasperate a saint. But thanks 
to Harrelson's casual flair and his considerable comic energy, Pepper grows on 
you so much that his rare absences from the screen bring the picture to a dead 
halt. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is not a performance that wins awards, it does demonstrate the kind 
of star presence that the movies can never have too much of. What "The Cowboy 
Way" does best is underline how much more there is to Woody Harrelson than how 
he looks in his underwear or with a hat over his private parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13 for "violence, some language and comic sensuality." Times 
guidelines: It includes considerable brutality and a comic scene of Harrelson's 
hat apparently defying gravity. 'The Cowboy Way'

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BLACK HAT' TRIES TO GIVE THE 'SPINAL' TREATMENT TO RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fear of a Black Hat" is designed to be a rap version of the classic mock rock 
documentary "This Is Spinal Tap," and the idea is so funny that for a long time 
the film coasts on our good will. But it should be funnier than it is. 
Writer-director Rusty Cundieff, who also stars, along with Larry B. Scott and 
Mark Christopher Lawrence, as one of the three members of the rap group N.W.H., 
has a loose-limbed comic sense, and there are hilarious bits poking through the 
tedium. What the movie lacks is any kind of smart, sociological sense. It's a 
defanged spoof. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest in-joke about gangsta rap, after all, is that its largest audience 
is white. Black rappers, many from middle-class backgrounds, market the white 
audience's worst racial fears. Instead of getting into this kind of material, 
Cundieff goes for more obvious (and safer) targets: Vanilla Ice types and 
cringing money-grubbing managers.  
</P>
<P>
 The rap group's numbers aren't particularly well-staged, or funny, but a few 
of their MTV clips are almost indistinguishable from what's really on the 
network. (That's the joke.) There's a funny interview with one of the rappers 
about the meaning of the group's name where he goes into a long diatribe about 
how slaves weren't allowed to wear hats, and another where the group's 
recurring use of the word butt is explained away as a social statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The titles for their rap hits are the most inspired thing in the movie, but 
you'll have to see the movie -- or read something besides a family newspaper -- 
to find out what they are. The tamest one is "Guerrillas in the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for pervasive strong language and for sexuality. Times 
guidelines: It includes much cussing, some violence and lots of explicit sexual 
references.

MOVIE REVIEW; DEVITO STRENGTHENS A SOPPY 'RENAISSANCE MAN'; THE ACTOR TONES 
DOWN HIS USUAL DEMEANOR AND PARTS OF THE FILM DELIGHT, BUT MANY INCIDENTS SEEM 
TRUMPED UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Renaissance Man" wants to own your tear ducts. It's got a sop for every 
audience and happy endings coming out of its ears. There's a fine line between 
delighting an audience and pandering to it. "Renaissance Man" leapfrogs across 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 What complicates the issue is that, in snatches, the film does delight. Phony 
hokum becomes heartfelt hokum. Danny DeVito plays out-of-work ad exec Bill 
Rago, Princeton graduate, who grudgingly takes a job through the local welfare 
office teaching eight educationally disadvantaged Army recruits at a nearby 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Dead Poets Society"/ "Corn Is Green" setup always seems to work on some 
level -- movies about the inspirations of education can be inspiring -- and the 
liveliest moments in "Renaissance Man" involve Bill's classroom wheedlings and 
back talk. Initially marking time while hunting for a "real" job, he finds 
himself roused to help his troops. He discovers an improbable way to reach them 
-- by teaching them "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Jim Burnstein reportedly worked a job very much like Bill's, but 
many of the incidents in the film seem trumped up. Bill's washout students are, 
of course, not really washouts; they just need to be cared for. They're like 
racially mixed Dead End Kids for the dysfunctional '90s. Most of them have sob 
stories: Miranda (Stacey Dash) was ditched by her mother; Brian (Peter Simmons) 
never knew his father who was killed in Vietnam; Jackson (Richard T. Jones) was 
a great pro football prospect before he became injured; Mel (Greg Sporleder) 
comes from an abusive family and dozes to blank out the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the soldiers who don't seem touched by grief or anger -- like country boy 
Tommy Lee (Mark Wahlberg, a.k.a. Marky Mark) or the well-read Roosevelt (Khalil 
Kain) or the jokester Jamaal (Kadeem Hardison) -- seem stunted not by lack of 
aptitude but by lack of opportunity. Donnie (Lillo Brancato Jr.) starts out 
reading comic books and ends up reciting the "St. Crispin's Day" speech from 
"Henry V" to his flabbergasted drill sergeant (well played by Gregory Hines). 
It's an inspiring moment, but it would have been funnier -- and probably truer 
to experience -- if Donnie, an expert mimic, had recited the speech in his Al 
Pacino voice from "Scarface." 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers get fired up about "Hamlet" by relating the play to their own 
lives -- it's Shakespeare as therapist, as career adviser. The film's view of 
education is inspiring but also a bit bogus. It reduces great drama to a 
catalogue of shibboleths and life lessons. (This is also what the movie does to 
its own meanings.) And Bill's transformation is self-serving. He comes to 
recognize that his former advertising world lacks the "truth" of his new 
crusade but Burnstein and director Penny Marshall plug the Joy of Learning with 
slick commercial fervor, as if they were framing an ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Renaissance Man" never really shows us how Bill's brood might bring him into 
their culture. Through them he discovers his real calling, but the educational 
process is mostly one-way -- his way. (The big dance number where the students 
do a rap version of "Hamlet" is the film's phoniest scene.) Bill is too busy 
getting his comeuppance in other ways: as a divorced father whose daughter 
wants his respect; as a former draft resister who learns, from the company 
colonel (Cliff Robertson), the true value of the military life. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVito is required to plod Bill through a lot of hare-brained paces, like the 
scene where he enters an endurance test to win the respect of his students. But 
DeVito is remarkably good in the role anyway; it seems to have touched 
something genuine in him. He's toned down his usual bug-eyed squalling, and the 
result is his best screen work since Barry Levinson's "Tin Men." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in Bill's early scenes, where he stands humiliated before his jobless 
life, that Penny Marshall's tact as a director comes through best. It doesn't 
come through often enough, though. She's a graceful, intelligent director who 
doesn't appear to have her heart in all the graceless grandstanding in 
"Renaissance Man." She doesn't have the gift for shamelessness, and that's why 
the film, with its pileup of sentimentalities, seems so processed. She's trying 
to engineer our emotions, but she's smart enough to know that an artist -- not 
an engineer -- is required for the job. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE PRINCESS AND THE GOBLIN' RAISES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Princess and the Goblin," a new animated feature opening today, feels 
like 82 minutes of audio-visual junk food -- cloying, devoid of significant 
content and ultimately unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the 1872 novel by Scottish writer George MacDonald, this fairy tale 
focuses on Princess Irene (voice by Sally Ann Marsh), who leads a sheltered 
life in her father's castle with only her bumbling governess and her cat, 
Turnip, for company. On a walk, she meets Curdi (Peter Murray) a miner's son, 
who learns that subterranean goblins are plotting to seize the kingdom. Curdi 
foils their plan with a little help from Irene and the royal guards because he 
knows the goblins' weaknesses: They hate singing and stepping on their feet is 
the only way to hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 All ends happily, although the screenplay by producer Robin Lyons leaves many 
loose ends dangling. Why is Curdi the only person who knows how to defeat the 
goblins? While sneaking through the underground kingdom, he discovers the Queen 
Goblin (Peggy Mount) has six toes on each foot, while her subjects have only 
one: Why is this significant-sounding discovery never mentioned again? How do 
the goblins manage to flood a castle on a hill by unleashing one underground 
stream? (Can they teach my landlord how to generate that much water pressure?) 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who sit through the film will have ample time to devise answers, as 
the characters aren't interesting enough to hold the viewer's attention. Irene 
and Curdi are perfect Victorian children who make waxworks figures seem lively. 
Curdi just wants to do good deeds; Irene will only go where the magic thread of 
her great-great-grandmother's ghost (Claire Bloom) leads -- she takes no real 
risks and therefore doesn't really grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The animation, done by crews in Wales and Hungary, looks like Saturday morning 
kidvid. Director Jozsef Gemes, is widely respected for his epic paint-on-glass 
feature, "Heroic Times" (1982): He deserves better material -- as do the 
children who'll be parked at a matinee of "Princess" while their parents shop 
in an adjacent mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA Rating: G; Times guidelines: It contains slapstick cartoon violence, 
unresolved story points and stiff animation. * In general release throughout 
Southern California.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ENDLESS' A TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO THE WAVES OF SUMMER; TWO FRIENDS 
RETRACE THE GLOBE-TROTTING PATH THAT THEIR SURFING COUNTERPARTS TOOK NEARLY 30 
YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Endless Summer II," creator-narrator Bruce Brown takes pains to tell 
us how much has changed since he began filming his definitive surfing movie, 
"The Endless Summer," 30 years ago. He takes pride in the international 
popularity of the sport he helped popularize and ticks off its various 
innovations. He does not shy away from showing how crowded some Hawaiian 
beaches now are or how the once-deserted beach at a still-choice surfing spot 
near Capetown, South Africa, is now covered with expensive condos and tract 
houses. To his credit, he makes a passing acknowledgment of polluted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 What Brown is really doing, however, is shrewdly getting such matters out of 
the way in order to celebrate all that mercifully hasn't yet changed: fabulous 
beaches that attract world-class surfers to ride the most spectacular waves. 
Brown's conceit is that a couple of likable young surfer pals, Robert (Wingnut) 
Weaver -- he has the dark hair -- and the blond Patrick O'Connell, are such 
fans of the original "Endless Summer" that they dip into some surfing prize 
money to finance a globe-girdling retracing, more or less, of their surfing 
counterparts in the first film, Robert August and Mike Hynson, who were in 
search of the perfect wave. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's anybody's guess if Brown's mix of awesome surfing sequences 
interspersed with travelogue material and good-natured cornball antics will 
play as well as it did decades ago, this "Endless Summer" is no less endearing 
than the original. That this sequel is as fresh as it is is probably in large 
part due to the fact that Brown deliberately backed off from further surfer 
movies after making the first "Endless Summer" (which was part of an entire 
cycle of surfer epics, all the others lesser efforts).  
</P>
<P>
 Working with far more sophisticated equipment this time out, Brown, backed by 
a large crew, once again displays a sense of the visual that's in key with the 
ebb and flow of the waves. Indeed, what makes both films work is that in their 
friendly, unpretentious way they celebrate man coming into harmony with nature 
in truly beautiful images. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wingnut and Pat's journey takes them from Southern California to Costa Rica 
(which Brown intercuts with side trips to Alaska and Hawaii not involving his 
stars), to France, South Africa, Fiji, Australia, Bali and Java, which from the 
looks of it just might be the most glorious, unspoiled place to surf on the 
face of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way Wingnut and Pat meet champion surfers like Tom Curren (in 
Biarritz) and Laird Hamilton and Gerry Lopez (in Java). They also meet several 
men from the first film, hearty rugged types like Capetown's John Whitmore and 
Brisbane's Nat Young, a veritable Crocodile Dundee, who takes Wingnut and Pat 
riding the rapids in a rubber raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by Gary Hoey and Phil Marshall's driving score, "The Endless 
Summer II" is such a pleasure to watch, so effective in its ability to take you 
away and into the healthy, carefree world of surfing, at once exciting and 
uncomplicated, that you're actually sorry when it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for brief nudity and mild language. Times guidelines: The 
brief nudity consists of some passing glances at topless female bathers; the 
language is a couple of cusswords. 'The Endless Summer II'

TV REVIEW; 'NAKED WASHINGTON' THESIS HANGS BY THREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thesis goes something like this: The press loved JFK and even LBJ before 
Vietnam; but after that debacle and Watergate, the press and the White House 
have been on a crash collision course paved with distrust, disillusion and 
deception. 
</P>
<P>
 If reality were thesis, then "Naked Washington," on A&E's "Investigative 
Reports" tonight, would make sense. But it isn't, and it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The central problem is that this report, care of BBC-TV producer Colleen 
Toomey, tells a historical narrative, tracking from the sweet, naive days of 
Camelot to the new, nasty grind of Whitewater and (as some wags have already 
dubbed it) Zippergate. And history tells a more complicated story of White 
House/media relations than this report would have it. 
</P>
<P>
 The press did feel duped by LBJ on Vietnam (a clip here shows an obviously 
perturbed and snippy Morley Safer in the jungle, basically telling LBJ where to 
get off). But the White House press corps wasn't so permanently altered that it 
collectively swooped down on Richard Nixon after the Watergate break-in. In 
fact, much of the Fourth Estate thought that the Washington Post's dogged 
coverage of the burglary was misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the names and faces of both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter are missing 
here, and it could be argued that the press didn't bring their administrations 
to task nearly as much as they should have. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Naked Washington's" thesis truly collapses when considering Ronald 
Reagan. If it's true that the post-Watergate press would no longer tolerate 
White House duping, then how to explain the Reagan White House's brilliant 
media manipulations, and that the White House press pack never uncovered 
Iran-Contra for themselves? Is the pack's own self-disgust at being fooled 
again the reason that it is going after Clinton? Or has Clinton brought it on 
himself? "Naked Washington" doesn't answer any of these questions, but it 
surely begs them.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Naked Washington" airs at 6 and 10 tonight on A&E.

 Because Latinos have such little presence on television, there's a natural 
tendency to herald every inroad made on the tube. But what should we make of 
"Loco Slam," HBO's showcase for Latino stand-up comics? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a major step for Latinos on cable's premium channel? Or just a 
tried-and-true vehicle that suggests Latino comedians curse better because they 
do it bilingually? 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after HBO's showcase for black comics, "Def Comedy Jam," "Loco Slam" 
features a host (Carlos Mencia) and three or four other comics on each of the 
30-minute shows in this four-episode experiment. (Each show premieres on Friday 
and repeats several times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Taped at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles, the tone on tonight's outing is set 
by Mencia, whose opening monologue is flooded with the "F" word. Mencia can be 
wildly funny, as he proved in his stint as host of "Comedy Compadres," the 
forerunner of "Loco Slam" that had a short run on KCOP-TV last year. But 
freedom of speech doesn't necessarily help Mencia or many other of his cohorts. 
It's no longer shocking to hear expletives or graphic references to sex and 
body parts, and the repeated uses here quickly become numbing. 
</P>
<P>
 But each of the comics in tonight's premiere has his or her moments. And they 
certainly represent the spectrum of Latinos in stand-up, including a Puerto 
Rican (Herb Quinones), a Dominican (Ludo Vika), a Chicano (Jeff Garcia) and a 
self-described "white Latino" (Pablo Francisco). Quinones does a funny bit 
about the most dangerous weapon in any Latino home: a mother's house slipper; 
Francisco is a gifted sound-effect comedian.  
</P>
<P>
 And there are laughs aplenty throughout the four episodes, especially from 
those who focus on solid material and not on shock value. Hey, I'm no prude, 
but there's no substitute for talent -- in any language. 
</P>

 Let's hope they have no field trips: The Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences

 Only in L.A., Maker of Stars: The Santa Barbara French Festival, no less, 
phoned us to ask how to contact the curator of the Museum of Modern Poodle.

 Spokesman Steve Hogerman said he had read in this column about Doren Garcia, a 
Downtown L.A. artist who has amassed a collection of more than one thousand 
knickknacks exemplifying "bad taste in poodles." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds like a natural for us," said Hogerman. The event is July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia wasn't home when we phoned to notify him of the honor. Perhaps he was 
out walking his two poodle boot trees.

 The real estate market is even worse than we thought: Richard and Helena Marsh

 Wheredunits: In our recent discussion of Harry Bosch, author Michael 
Connelly's fictional homicide cop, we meant to point out that Bosch lives in 
Studio City (where he has a fine view of the tourist trams at Universal City). 
His hometown is significant because the San Fernando Valley is a region largely 
ignored by mystery writers until now.

 After all, you can already find detectives, private eyes, shamuses, sleuths,

"Horse Latitudes" (Robert Ferrigno's salute to Belmont Shore) and "Pomona 
Queen," and "Tapping the Source," both by Kem Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tapping," by the way, is a look at the dark side of Huntington Beach's beach

RON HARRIS: ONE CHAPTER ENDS AND A NEW DREAM BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dreams and aspirations. Sometimes, I think that with all the disappointments 
and difficulties we face day to day, they are all that keeps us getting up the 
next morning. Dreams and aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most everybody has at least one. Oh, it could be anything from owning a house 
or getting married to playing center field for the Dodgers, making a hit record 
or just hoping dad will rent that limo for the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Me? I'm greedy, so I have lots of dreams. Winning the Lotto is one. Another is 
to sail around the world in a 41-foot, center-cockpit ketch with my best friend 
and two gorgeous women, one of them preferably my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that one is a few years off. I don't own a boat and I don't 
have a wife, but I'm hopeful. My more immediate dream has been to be a foreign 
correspondent. Yeah, that's right, one of those people traipsing across distant 
continents and filing fascinating reports on life and death and the struggle 
for power in places most of us will never even visit. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the idea intriguing and challenging -- different people, different 
culture, different language, different mores and different philosophies on 
life. To me, America is just one country in this huge, wonderful world. I've 
been here all my life. I'd like to see how the rest of the world lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been dreaming this dream for eight years now, and I'm finally going to 
get my chance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning June 13, I'm off for Rio de Janeiro, one of The Times 26 foreign 
bureaus. I'll be there for four months covering a sundry of issues. Contrary to 
popular belief, Brazil is not all dental-floss bikinis, beautiful women, 
Carnaval and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge place. It has the largest African population outside of Africa. It 
has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan. There are farms in Brazil 
bigger than all of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends keep asking me what I'll be doing. For one thing, they've got a 
presidential campaign coming up soon, which should prove pretty interesting 
stuff, considering that their first president after years of military 
dictatorship got booted out for corruption and everybody thinks the current guy 
is a stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll also be trying to figure out how they live with 8,000% inflation, which 
is mind-boggling to me. Then there's the story about how many of the poor kids 
have adopted America's gangster rap as their anthem, and another about 
Quilombos, these African villages set up by runaway slaves that exist even 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 There are stories about the rain forests, homeless children murdered by 
corrupt policemen hired by local businessmen as kid death squads, tourism, gold 
miners and hopefully a lot of quirky stuff that I don't even know about yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, if I'm in Brazil, I won't be writing a column about Los Angeles for 
a while. L.A. is a pretty tough town to cover from Rio. Actually, I'm going to 
miss writing this column. I never thought I'd say that. It was never a position 
to which I had aspired, but I have come to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, since I won't be here, I'd like to close out this chapter with these 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I'd like to say thanks and so long to all the people who read my column 
regularly, particularly Donovan's mom, whom I have never met but who I 
understand reads me religiously. When my column is not in the paper, Donovan 
calls me for an explanation because his mother has already called him. 
</P>
<P>
 I think if it wasn't for people like her, this job would be a lot harder. I've 
really appreciated the letters of support. I am sometimes amazed that some of 
you think my column really has something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those readers who wish I would disappear permanently, I'm going to miss 
you too. Nothing like hate mail to brighten up a day. I just wish you would 
enclose a return address with your letters so I could write back. Now that 
would be really fun. Maybe we could even have lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 As for all of the bad people who I wanted to dump on before I left, I missed 
you this time. And for all the heroes and heroines who I've encountered, I 
applaud you, and I regret that I didn't write more stories about you. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, I'd like to say thank you, thank you for taking time to listen to 
the ramblings of an often-crazed man.

FREE SPEECH WATCH; BOO BROUHAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By most accounts, Don Bondi has been a dynamic, if sometimes obstreperous, 
teacher of dance. He helped found the Los Angeles County High School for the 
Arts nine years ago.But for now at least he is tied to a desk writing arts 
curricula at another school while the county Office of Education decides 
whether he should be punished for professional misconduct for booing at a 
school play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's offense was to have remonstrated too vocally at the play April 21, 
booing when a student actor portrayed Gov. Pete Wilson as a racist when it 
comes to Latinos. While no admirer of Wilson's, Bondi found the lines vulgar 
and tasteless, which they were, and said so publicly. That was not politic of 
him, but certainly within the boisterous tradition of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in the audience not appreciative of Bondi's outburst was Maria 
Elena Gaitan, whose son was in the play and who happens to be a member of the 
county board of education. She got into a shouting match with Bondi, who is 
Anglo, ordering him to "Control your racism!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some see all this as another sign of ethnic frictions in a fast-changing 
region, as part of a struggle for control of public institutions like the 
schools. Perhaps. But, while the full facts are not yet known, we see it as 
more a matter of artistic expression and free speech. The student had a right 
to criticize the governor; Bondi had a right to criticize the performance. 
Gaitan, appointed by County Supervisor Gloria Molina, will not speak to 
reporters. But it may be that it is her behavior rather than Bondi's that 
should be under scrutiny.

ART AND ETHNIC HATRED; ANTI-SEMITISM IS FAR FROM DEAD IN FORMERLY COMMUNIST 
EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Monday, Germany formally returned seven major French artworks to France. 
The seven -- including two important paintings by Claude Monet, "The 
Louveciennes Road" and "Snow at Sunset" -- were among 28 works confiscated from 
French Jews by the Nazis and held in more recent years by the communist regime 
in East Germany.All 28 works are now to be returned. The ceremonial transfer of 
the first seven by Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl to France's President 
Francois Mitterrand opened a two-day conference on a variety of political and 
economic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer made little news in the United States, but it may be read as yet 
another reminder that communism did not just keep the lid on the caldron of 
ethnic hatreds in Eastern Europe; in many ways it actively kept that pot 
boiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationalist in its founding years, communism in power covered over its 
failings by appealing to majority chauvinism against ethnic minorities. The 
Russification of national minorities in the Soviet Union is the best-known 
example of this, but there were others: Communist Romania, for example, was 
brutal with its Hungarian minority. 
</P>
<P>
 And virtually everywhere in the Eastern Bloc anti-Semitism was not just 
tolerated but fostered. Bolshevism-come-to-power appealed to supposed peasant 
authenticity against capitalism as Jewish and as "cosmopolitan" just as 
pre-World War II fascism had pitted peasants against allegedly Jewish, 
"cosmopolitan" Bolshevism. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Europe's postwar recovery from prewar anti-Semitism, such as it has 
been, has not been matched in Eastern Europe. Reunited Germany's return of East 
Germany's loot to the French is a clear and honorable step in the right 
direction, but it is also a reminder of how long a journey remains to be made.

N. KOREA PUSHES IT TO THE BRINK; KIM SEEMS TO BE DARING THE WORLD TO ACT IN 
NUCLEAR CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is now facing his biggest foreign policy crisis. North 
Korea, breaking a written promise, has prevented international inspectors from 
examining the spent fuel rods it is withdrawing from its only operating nuclear 
reactor. At a minimum, that action feeds worries that Kim Il Sung's regime is 
indeed covertly diverting plutonium to build its own nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal also effectively ends U.S. efforts to coax North Korea into 
compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by offers of closer 
diplomatic ties and economic aid. The Administration's next step is to ask the 
U.N. Security Council to impose economic sanctions. Kim's regime, now in its 
fifth decade of iron control, has already warned that it would regard sanctions 
as an act of war. Responsible world powers may soon decide they have no choice 
but to test the threat implicit in that declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and South Korea know the risks of confronting an antagonist as 
nuttily irresponsible as North Korea. With a million-man army and with far more 
artillery pieces and tanks than the South Korean army and the 38,000 U.S. 
troops that directly support it, Kim Il Sung could risk all on one roll of the 
dice and rapidly strike south, as he did 44 years ago this month. There is no 
chance that North Korea could win a second Korean war. But before it was thrown 
back and militarily annihilated it could inflict enormous damage on Seoul, home 
to 25% of South Korea's 44 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this possibility that prompted the Clinton Administration to seek a 
diplomatic solution to the challenge posed by the North 15 months ago when it 
announced it was quitting the NPT. All good-faith efforts have now failed. The 
International Atomic Energy Agency, along with Washington, has been repeatedly 
bamboozled. 
</P>
<P>
 If North Korea succeeds in making a mockery of the NPT, other nuclear 
aspirants -- Iran, Iraq, Libya -- will not be far behind. If North Korea can 
build nuclear weapons and put them aboard the medium-range missiles it is 
developing, South Korea, Japan, much of China and parts of Russia will fall 
within its target zone. Pressures within South Korea and probably Japan to go 
nuclear would be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy getting a U.N. Security Council consensus on sanctions; China 
and Russia both have expressed their distaste for such an approach. But with 
its economy a shambles, North Korea could be highly vulnerable even to partial 
sanctions. If, for example, Japan acted to halt money transfers to the North 
from Koreans living in Japan, Pyongyang's primary source of hard currency would 
be gone, and its ability to pay for vital imports would shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should promptly speak to the American people, and to the 
world, about just how serious the threat now emanating from North Korea is. He 
should candidly concede that there are grave risks in implementing sanctions. 
He should be no less clear in emphasizing that the ultimate risks of doing 
nothing in response are immeasurably greater.

VOTING ON SCHOOL MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday California voters will be asked to approve Proposition 1C, which 
will provide $900 million in investment bonds for California's 136 public 
universities and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 With Proposition 1C, our colleges will make the critically important 
technological, safety and other improvements to our already existing campuses. 
Without it, these essential projects will go undone. These projects include 
seismic upgrading to ensure our campuses can withstand future earthquakes; 
buying new computer, science and high-tech equipment; and updating classroom 
science labs and learning centers. It's important to note that Proposition 1C 
includes an estimated $151.9 million in funding for Los Angeles County 
projects. This includes: $25.9 million for UCLA to upgrade several buildings to 
earthquake standards; $38 million to renovate Cal State Northridge and Cal 
State L.A.; and $38 million for Compton, East L.A., Harbor, Pierce, Trade Tech, 
Los Angeles, Southwest and West Los Angeles City Colleges to make overdue and 
needed campus improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Our public colleges and universities provide important career training and job 
retraining opportunities for all Californians. Proposition 1C is an investment 
in these critical institutions and an investment in a strong and healthy 
California economy.  
</P>
<P>
 DIANE E. WATSON 
</P>
<P>
 State Senate, D-Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * On Tuesday we have a chance to vote on Proposition 1B, a proposal to build 
and improve elementary and secondary schools in California. A lot of us here in 
the high desert are retirees. Of course we don't want to pay for another 
generation's education, right? In my opinion, wrong, very, very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 We are leaving a legacy of major unsolved problems; huge debts all over the 
country; hordes of permanently unemployed citizens. If these problems are ever 
to be solved, great skills and exceptional brainpower will have to be 
exercised.  
</P>
<P>
 We're telling our kids that they will have to get college degrees in order to 
make it in the years ahead. In the meantime, we've managed to make that goal 
much more difficult. Tuition costs and other expenses have increased 
dramatically, while part-time jobs are less available. In the meantime, we 
should send our kids to old, overcrowded, undermanned, ill-equipped preparatory 
schools?  
</P>
<P>
 Bequeath massive problems and deteriorating preparation of our upcoming 
generation and we will all be losers -- guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed billion-dollar bond issue will cost nearly $2 billion, including 
interest. This comes to something like $80 for every Californian. Spread over 
20 years, that's $4 per year, 33 cents per month! Vote yes on Proposition 1B. 
It is important. 
</P>

 * On May 20 The Times ran an editorial describing several top candidates for 
superintendent of public instruction. I hope voters throughout California 
understand how vitally important this election is. Max Rafferty, Wilson Riles, 
Bill Honig. Whatever your perspective on these past superintendents there is no 
denying they each left an indelible imprint on a decade of public education in 
our state. An effective superintendent of public instruction will help 
determine whether our public schools reshape themselves as comprehensively and 
rapidly as is absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a superintendent who has a sophisticated understanding of the task 
before us. A superintendent who is focused on the child in the classroom, who 
understands the reality of that child's life, and of exactly what it takes to 
work with local schools, school boards, parents and community members to effect 
productive systematic change.  
</P>
<P>
 Each individual voter needs to decide how he or she will vote in this 
election. As an individual voter I will be casting my vote for Maureen DiMarco, 
who I passionately believe is best qualified to get the necessary job done as 
California's next superintendent of public instruction.

RODRIGUEZ ON SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have always admired the writing of Richard Rodriguez. But I am sad that he 
uses tobacco as a metaphor for misplaced priorities (Opinion, May 22). 
</P>
<P>
 I used to try to write and think as broadly and holistically as Rodriguez. But 
after I became ill and disabled because of cigarette smoke in my workplace, I 
became a one-issue person. I truly regret that I have had to become so narrowly 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
 But I have come to understand that all of my adult life I have had to separate 
myself from the community. I was born with asthma and could not be in any 
location where people were smoking, whether it was in a university hallway, in 
a workplace, or simply in a place to have a good time. My son also has asthma 
and discovered in his first full-time job after graduating from college that he 
too cannot work or play in an environment where there is secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent of the population have asthma and other lung diseases. Our 
segregation from the community because of secondhand smoke should be labeled 
what it is, a denial of civil rights. For us, tobacco smoke is a weapon as 
lethal as the weapons used in a drive-by shooting. But it is not as visible it 
doesn't make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 A smoking ban is not a futile attempt to avoid the inevitable death. It is a 
long overdue restoration of the civil rights of persons with respiratory 
disabilities. I do not hate the people who smoke. Certainly I cannot hate my 
parents, who both died prematurely of smoking-related illnesses. They smoked 
while I struggled to breathe and could not see the connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and I both empathize with the people trapped in this sad addiction. 
We cannot control much in this life, but Los Angeles can begin to become the 
brighter and happier place that Rodriguez yearns for if the air is cleared in 
nightclubs and places where young people go to have a good time. My son says 
amen to that.

 * Rodriguez' essay did my heart good. After 24 years in Los Angeles, having 
been mugged, burglarized, rear-ended three times, overcome by heat and smog in 
all seasons, no longer able to go out for a leisurely meal where I could linger 
over coffee and a cigarette (need I mention riots, floods, fires, earthquakes), 
I am determined to escape to someplace where I can at least ease the strain 
with a smoke. I'm outta here -- back to New York City.

 In response to "Sales Pitches Swayed DMV, Report on Computer Debacle Says," 
(May 25): You insult the intelligence of your readers.The problem was not 
technology but bad management. Somebody should have questioned what was going 
on when Ernst & Young pulled out.  
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that in the same issue (Business) you highlight "client-server"

BRAWLEY'S MEASURE R 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is unfortunate that The Times chooses to turn its attention to the 
community of Brawley only when our city can provide "news" in the entertaining 
form of political controversy (May 24). How delightful it would be if a Times 
reporter could follow California 86 south when we have community consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning the article on Measure R, what is important to note is that the 
people who are against the sale of alcohol in public recreation areas and the 
people who promote it do not disagree in their intent, which is to bolster our 
city. What we disagree on is method. 
</P>
<P>
 As the entire country is implementing measures banning alcohol in public 
places, it is too bad that some well-meaning, but uninformed individuals seek 
to establish this hazard in spaces which are utilized by the Girl Scouts, 
public schools and children's recreation programs. There is a long history of 
community support for children in Brawley's public parks, but no precedent for 
the sale of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know how the city of Brawley would combat the liability it would be 
exposed to if Measure R should pass. I do know that our community has the 
talent and intelligence to reach a workable solution without being represented 
by this paper as a bunch of hee-haws. We are not teetotalers and rednecks 
facing off with pitchforks for the amusement of urbanites. We are good friends 
who presently disagree.

MIDEAST AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli opposition leader, says that Israelis are 
unhappy with the way in which the Palestinians are implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement with Israel (Commentary, May 20). As evidence, he refers 
to a poll conducted by Israel's leading daily, Yediot Aharonot.Not 
surprisingly, he fails to mention another poll that appeared in the same paper 
on May 22. The survey asked which leader is best suited to lead Israel in the 
current period; 50% favored Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, while only 38% 
preferred Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not difficult to be frustrated with a complex peace process or with the 
behavior of Israel's negotiating partners. It is quite another matter to know 
how to deal with those frustrations. Rabin insists that both sides honor the 
agreements. He also understands that the process must move forward, which is 
why he remains engaged in the negotiations. Netanyahu wants the talks to stop. 
He would return to the same policies that were advocated for over a decade by 
his mentor, former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and that were finally 
rejected by Israeli voters two years ago. Difficult as the road may be, 
Israelis do not want to reverse the progress they have made.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; FUNDING SERVICES IS A 2-WAY STREET; THE PRESIDENT 
IS ASKING CONGRESS FOR A 30% BOOST IN ASSISTANCE FOR HARD-HIT STATES, WHICH 
STILL HAVE TO SHOULDER THEIR FAIR SHARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEON E. PANETTA, Leon E. Panetta is director of the Office of Management and 
Budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Through much of our history, immigration has been among this country's most 
emotional political issues. We are a nation of immigrants. Yet too often we 
have forgotten our heritage and used immigrants as scapegoats for our problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, in a period of tight budget constraints, immigrants are in the 
political cross hairs. There is a genuine need to curb illegal immigration and 
to assist states with costs related to illegal immigration. However, in the 
rush of political rhetoric, the public needs to distinguish between the 
exploitation of these issues and responsible efforts to address them. 
</P>
<P>
 All agree on the need to combat illegal immigration. That is a central federal 
responsibility, and this Adminstration is overcoming years of inertia at the 
federal level to strengthen border enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 As to fiscal relief, however, we are hearing some very easy answers to very 
complicated problems. They range from assertions that Washington should write a 
blank check to cover traditional state and local services to all immigrants to 
proposals that all benefits be cut off for legal and illegal immigrants alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies at neither extreme but in a strong partnership between the 
federal and state governments.  
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement. President Clinton has directed the Immigration and 
Nationalization Service to make a comprehensive effort to secure our borders 
and deter illegal immigration. His budget, now before Congress, would add more 
than 1,000 agents at the border and 200 inspectors at land ports of entry, 
provide agents with better equipment, fund deportation of aliens who commit 
serious crimes after they complete their sentences, increase enforcement of 
sanctions against those who hire undocumented aliens and improve the asylum and 
naturalization processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistance. Regardless of these efforts, millions of undocumented aliens are 
here already. Previous administrations looked the other way when it came to the 
states' costs of providing services to them, but the President believes that 
these costs are a shared responsibility. His budget contains billions for 
states relating to immigrants, around 30% more than in previous 
Administrations; included is $350 million to assist states for the first time 
ever with the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants who are convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the states cannot send the entire bill for health, prison and other costs 
to Washington. These are, after all, not just federal responsibilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Before Congress will approve additional funds, it must have the facts, and 
states have provided widely varying estimates of their costs. For example, the 
governor of Texas estimates that undocumented immigrants cost her state $166 
million annually, or an average of about $300 per immigrant. The governor of 
California is asking for $2.3 billion. His estimate of undocumented immigrants 
is 2.1 million, one-third greater than the INS estimate of 1.6 million. And 
because he does not count taxes, lottery receipts and other revenues that the 
state collects from undocumented immigrants, he wants $1,000 for each one, more 
than three times what Texas is asking. 
</P>
<P>
 To separate facts from rhetoric, a working group of affected states and the 
federal government has asked the respected, nonpartisan Urban Institute to 
provide an objective estimate of the costs and revenues associated with illegal 
immigration. This will help determine what additional assistance might be 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Administration is committed to working with the governors of 
the states with the largest numbers of illegal immigrants to obtain support 
from Congress. In a tight federal budget, a powerful case must be made that a 
relatively few states are entitled to special help.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some elected officials seem more interested in scoring political 
points on this issue than in solving the problem. Lawsuits have been filed that 
legal experts give virtually no chance of success, resulting in wasted legal 
costs that the states can ill afford. Clearly, some politicians are laying the 
groundwork for blaming Washington when the inevitable tough state budget 
choices are made. For example, California has built its budget around a 
so-called $3-billion immigration gap that is somehow, mysteriously, to be 
filled by federal funds that simply do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody should be under any illusions. In the zero-sum budget game, every 
dollar spent on this problem must be taken from somewhere else. Therefore, we 
had better work together instead of pointing fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 As our nation decides on a policy path, we should remember our immigrant 
heritage. My parents came to this country looking for the opportunity to work 
for a better life for themselves and their children. Most immigrants still come 
to this country for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we should not tolerate people immigrating illegally. But we need to treat 
this issue honestly and fairly. If public officials at all levels can do that, 
this problem can be solved in keeping with the great spirit and heritage of 
this nation.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: A SMIDGEN OF PERSPECTIVE ON D-DAY; SO MUCH OF 
THE HEROIC REMEMBRANCE DISREGARDS REAL HISTORY, INCLUDING RUSSIA'S ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other

<P>
 The June 6, 1944, D-day landing, quite aside from its relative weight in the 
defeat of Hitler (16 days after the Western Allies put five divisions on the 
Normandy beaches, the Soviet Union launched an operation that destroyed 30 
German divisions in 30 days), was a different event from the one being 
portrayed in celebrations of the 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 For a sense of the grimness of that day, it's worth looking at S.L.A. 
Marshall's "The Soldier's Load," published by the Marine Corps Assn. Addressing 
the argument that since fear weakens a man, every extra ounce he carries will 
further drain him of muscular power and mental coordination, Marshall wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the initial assault waves at Omaha Beachhead, there were companies whose 
men started ashore, each with four cartons of cigarettes in his pack -- as 
though the object of operations was trading with the French. They dropped in 
deep holes during the wade-in, or they fell into the tide nicked by a bullet. 
Then they soaked up so much weight they could not rise again. They drowned . . 
. the greater number were cast up on the beach. It impressed the survivors 
unforgettably -- the line of dead men along the sands, many of whom had 
received but trifling wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Many soldiers felled with their heavy loads in the water lacked even the 
strength to keep ahead of the tide, which moved inland at the pace of a slow 
walk. Marshall concluded from his interviews with survivors that "weight and 
water were the cause of the greater part of our losses at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the 40th anniversary of D-day was hijacked by Ronald Reagan's PR men 
as opportunity for martial posturings on the Normandy beaches by the old actor, 
whose closest actual contact with war was the percussion of a movie-set six-gun 
next to his ear (though this didn't stop him from boasting later that he had 
witnessed the liberation of Auschwitz). Actual veterans were regarded as mere 
stage props for the media blitz staged by Reagan's communications maestro, 
Michael Deaver. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pravda correspondent sourly observed at the time that the President, "having 
weathered the war far from the front line, in the rear, travels to the scene of 
the fighting, not so much to dramatize the turmoil of war as to exploit the 
glory of the dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The same words could be written about President Clinton, whose own in-house 
propagandists have been consulting with Deaver on how to manipulate the event 
to extort the maximum favorable exposure for their boss. A commander-in-chief 
who has been outmaneuvered by the warlords of Mogadishu and Port-au-Prince 
should have the modesty to keep off the Normandy beaches and stay at home. 
</P>
<P>
 D-day itself was a sideshow in the defeat of Adolf Hitler. The war had already 
been won on the Eastern front by the Russians at Stalingrad and then, a year 
before D-day, at the Kursk salient, where the Russians mangled 100 German 
divisions. Compared with these epic struggles, D-day was a skirmish. The 
Russians, after all, lost 20 million men in the war with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 The D-day landings had mostly to do with the postwar shape of Europe. The 
German general staff bore this as keenly in mind as the Western commanders. 
Hitler's generals knew that the war was lost and the task was to keep the 
meeting point of the invading Russian and Western armies as far east as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not fashionable these days to recognize that the Soviet Union had the 
lion's share in defeating Nazism. At the 40th anniversary, Reagan's people even 
doctored Eisenhower's June 6 Order of the Day to omit reference to "our Russian 
allies." 
</P>
<P>
 Were he still alive on some Argentine hacienda, the aged Adolf would be 
smirking with satisfaction at the shape of the world 50 years after the 
Normandy landings: a dismembered Soviet Union; his wartime puppet state of 
Croatia promptly recognized by Germany and then by the United States, thus 
precipitating the whole Bosnian crisis; fascist renaissance in Italy, with 
President Clinton praising Italian neo-fascists on the eve of the D-day 
anniversary. These neo-fascists include Gianfranco Fini, who recently remarked 
that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fuehrer must be itching to get on the phone to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to 
ask him how long it will be before Deutschland demands its lost Polish 
territories and Kaliningrad, a.k.a. Koenigsberg. "In truth," Hitler mumbles as 
he wraps a blanket round his skinny shanks, "I really did win the war."

 BIGGER & BETTER: Don't talk to Angels outfielder Tim Salmon about any 
sophomore jinx. The American League 1993 Rookie of the Year's numbers are up in 
every category this year, including a 30-point jump in his batting average. . . 
. Escaping injury -- which hurt his statistics at the end of last season -- 
Salmon should easily have 100-plus runs batted in and a 30 home-run year. That 
hasn't happened for the Angels since 1987, when Wally Joyner hit 34 homers and 
had 117 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 TOO LAID-BACK? Hollywood knows how blase the locals can be about the movie 
biz. . . . Director William Dear explained to Premiere magazine that's why he 
shot the new Disney movie about the California Angels -- "Angels in the 
Outfield" at Oakland Stadium instead of the Big A in Anaheim: "We needed to 
conjure up vast amounts of crowds. You do that in (Southern California), 
everybody goes, 'Uh-huh. Not today, thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 SHOPPING AROUND? After 20 years in downtown Fullerton, the Blue Frog, a 
landmark consignment shop for craftspeople and artists, faces closure June 25. 
Reason: Co-owner Cindy Kendrick's two partners are retiring, and no 
replacements have been found. "When you're not ready to retire, it's hard to 
let go," she says. . . . Run as an artists' cooperative, the shop represents 
300 artists working in pottery, painting and other media. The store at 129 N. 
Euclid St. will have a farewell party-sale Saturday.

 AN ORANGE CRUSH: After three months as Orange city manager, David F. Dixon saw

Betsy helped -- to promote Orange pride. . . . Councilman Mike Spurgeon 
responded, smiling: "The nice thing about it is that you don't have to declare 
it." No Sophomore Jinx

 Negotiations between the Los Angeles police union and the city are near an 
impasse just as the city is preparing to welcome thousands of soccer fans for 
the World Cup games. Police have threatened to refuse voluntary overtime and 
take other job actions that may embarrass the city just as the eyes of the 
world turn to Los Angeles again. The Police Protective League membership 
rejected a city offer of a 3% pay raise for each of the next two years that did 
not include retroactive pay for the two years police have been working without 
a contract. This week, police conducted a three-day "blue-flu" sickout with as 
many half of the officers calling in sick. The union also rejected Mayor 
Richard Riordon's proposal to bring in an outside mediator to help settle the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do Los Angeles police officers deserve a pay raise?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Bagelman, police community representative for the Lake Balboa 
Neighborhood Watch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely. I think that policing in the '90s is more than just being a law 
enforcement officer. It's a commitment to public safety requiring placing your 
life on the line during the hours in which you are on duty. I think that it's 
time the professional law enforcement people are treated with the respect and 
dignity they deserve and be compensated very well. . . . I don't think what 
they're asking for is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Karol Heppe, executive director of Police Watch, a nonprofit lawyer referral 
service for victims of police abuse: 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, pay raises are based on some degree of merit. If one were to take 
into account the recent evidence that the LAPD routinely uses excessive force 
against members of the community; that 'problem' officers are not adequately 
dealt with; that officers suffer from a serious attitude problem. . .; that the 
department has not adequately reformed itself within the past three years and 
has resisted numerous reforms, and that the overall problem of police brutality 
and lack of departmental accountability still exists . . ., (then) it is hard 
to find any meritorious reason for pay raises." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Chick, Los Angeles city councilwoman: 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, yes. They deserve a pay raise. That's what the City Council has 
been trying to give them. There's absolutely no disagreement on the council 
that the police officers deserve a raise and we have offered them one. What 
people don't understand, the question that should be asked of the public, is 
'Do you think we should pay police officers everything the police are 
demanding, which is $40 million more than the city budget can handle.' . . . If 
we give the (Police Protective League) exactly what it's demanding, we have to 
use up a huge chunk of the money that would have been used for police overtime 
and that is the quickest and most effective way of getting officers on the 
streets . . . This is, to me, a very very serious question and I have great 
concern that the public doesn't understand. . . . Do you understand that giving 
them everything they want means less officers on the streets?" 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garfield, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League: 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is absolutely yes. They have a unique and special responsibility . 
. . unlike other city employees, police officers put their lives and physical 
well-being on the line. They, therefore, should be treated as unique and 
special when it comes to compensation. The city makes the argument that other 
city employees in their contract negotiations chose as their priority job 
security over a cost of living increase. Job security is not an issue, 
particularly when elected officials unanimously agree that public safety is the 
city's No. 1 priority . . . The mayor's ambitious Project LA plan has at its 
heart a reliance on the present police officers working overtime. That is 
merely recycling the same angry and frustrated police officers in using 
overtime to compensate them instead of a truly deserved cost-of-living 
increase."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: HUNGRY FOR THE MOTHER'S MILK OF POLITICS? CALL A CASH COW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NO FUN FUNDS: Dialing for dollars is the name of the game in the Capitol 
political arena these days, with the primary election only days away and 
campaigns in overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible, in fact, that some members of the Legislature are getting a 
mild case of cauliflower ear from the constant application of a telephone 
receiver to the ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Try to reach a lawmaker these days and often you'll get a staff member 
explaining that the boss is "across the street" or "out making calls." Those 
are two common euphemisms used when lawmakers hoof it over to their hired fund 
raiser's office -- or to party leaders' rented quarters -- to phone key 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone, it seems, is beating the bushes for legal tender nowadays. 
Many speak freely about how much they hate it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice was a rude awakening, for example, for former Glendale Municipal 
Judge James E. Rogan, who arrived in Sacramento last month after winning a 
special election to fill the seat of his friend, Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), who resigned to serve a prison sentence on federal political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, who as a judge refused to let lawyer friends buy him lunch, said 
telephoning potential supporters for money has been "the hardest part" of 
adjusting to life as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I have to make a fund-raising call, my stomach starts to churn. 
There's got to be a better way to run the airline," the new assemblyman said. 
"I just don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for some political action committees to sense a 
sympathetic vote in the antiabortion, conservative Republican. Among those 
pitching in to help Rogan through the primary and general elections is the 
National Rifle Assn.'s Political Victory Fund, which sent a check for $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE WHAMMY: Another who, despite decades of practice, still cringes at 
having to raise campaign funds is longtime state Sen. David A. Roberti, who 
took on the double duty of a state treasurer's bid amid the heat of a recall 
battle over his Van Nuys district seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti reports that, somehow, it was a lot easier to call people to support 
his recall fight against gun-rights groups retaliating for his assault-weapons 
ban. A public alarmed with the proliferation of guns was responsive, apparently 
more so than in the race for the ho-hum treasurer's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Roberti has scraped up enough to pay for an 11th-hour blitz of 
10-second TV ads that are so brief, the message comes across as nearly 
subliminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect is blurred snatches of themes: "Roberti . . . assault weapons . 
. . smear campaign . . . don't let the NRA win." Viewers hardly have a chance 
to focus on the fact that he's selling himself as California's next top fiscal 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti's opponent, former state Democratic Party Chairman Phil 
Angelides, on Thursday unveiled his fourth and latest TV ad in a $1.5-million 
statewide air-time buy. 
</P>
<P>
 This one departs from earlier barbed attacks of Roberti as a Senate leader in 
an era of corruption and extols Angelides' attributes as a businessman and 
potential state officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the nod's statewide appeal is limited, Angelides is fond of citing one 
local endorsement in particular: that of the Democratic Party chapter of the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the group wholeheartedly backed Roberti in the recall, chapter 
Chairwoman Carol Blad said that when it came to the primary, "this is a 
different race, with different issues." 
</P>
<P>
 No one mentioned that Blad's daughter works full time for the Angelides 
campaign. Except Roberti, of course. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 HOPING TO BE HIZZHONOR: One Valley-area state assemblyman who is not suffering 
from telephone-induced repetitive stress injury -- and is happy about it -- is 
Democrat Terry B. Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, who has represented Encino and portions of the West Side for eight 
years, is giving up his nearly daily commute to Sacramento in hopes of finding 
something a little closer to home and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to capitalize on his expertise in the law, attorney Friedman passed up 
another run for the Assembly in favor of a bid for a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judgeship. An expert in tenancy law, he is the primary author of a 1,500-page 
reference book on the topic that earns him upward of $10,000 a year in 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning for the bench is decidedly less costly and lower key, Friedman 
notes. "The fund raising has never been something I enjoyed," he said. "It's 
something I'm glad I won't have to do anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents in the primary are trial attorney John L. Moriarity of Van Nuys 
and Robert Schirn, a prosecutor in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CELEBRITY BACKING: Short of a job change, it seems the only other way to avoid 
having to raise huge sums in campaign contributions is to be independently 
wealthy -- a luxury enjoyed locally only by state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the Santa Monica Democrat has limited individual contributions to no more 
than $94 for his unconventional run at the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the maverick candidate has attracted about 1,200 contributions from 
people backing his alternative message, said Duane Peterson, campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the well-heeled of the entertainment world are responding, Peterson says. 
Among those sending in checks are comedian Chevy Chase and his wife, Jayni 
Chase, singer Bonnie Raitt and former basketball star Bill Walton, who saw a 
Hayden ad in the New York Times, clipped the coupon and attached his $94 check. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY TRAILS: After 20 years of working with the Legislature, Maeley Tom, 
Roberti's longtime chief of staff during his reign as Senate president pro tem, 
is leaving the halls of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom will remain in Sacramento to start up the West Coast offices of Cassidy & 
Associates, which specializes in government relations and public affairs. She 
was widely thought to be job hunting. But then, so is her boss, who will be 
booted from the Legislature in December by term limits.

THE NIGHTMARE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is breathing a sigh of relief now that the city has reached the 
end of what we very sincerely hope is the last of the trials stemming from the 
Rodney King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury that awarded King $3.8 million in trying to compensate him for the 
beating he suffered at the hands of Los Angeles Police Department officers said 
this week that individual officers did not have to pay King punitive damages. 
That surprised some people, but the jury said something else that generally is 
being overlooked -- that former LAPD Officers Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. 
Koon, who were convicted of violating King's civil rights, did indeed act with 
malice in the 1991 beating. So although the jury said that individual officers 
did not have to pay King, it by no means absolved them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's important to remember as various lawyers cite the jury's judgment as 
vindication of their own points of view. Making a decision was easier in the 
first phase of this civil trial than in the second: The City of Los Angeles, as 
the employer of the police officers, was responsible for compensating King for 
medical bills and pain and suffering. Wisely, the city didn't fight the 
obvious, and the jury awarded King $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the second phase, which dealt with determining penalties for 
individual officers, there's been some grumbling that although the taxpayers 
got stuck for the King beating, those who actually did the beating paid 
nothing. That's absurd. Powell and Koon remain in prison; Timothy Wind, a 
rookie at the time, was fired; Ted Briseno was suspended and is still trying to 
get his job back. Daryl F. Gates, though he would disagree, is no longer police 
chief in part because of the tremendous public backlash over how poorly some 
officers, under his leadership, performed during the King beating and its 
aftermath, the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 So everyone paid. Particularly the people of Los Angeles. Let us hope that the 
city never again will endure such a traumatic, and expensive, nightmare.

FAMILIAR RANGERS BREED CONTENT; STANLEY CUP: MESSIER, ANDERSON GANG UP ON 
CANUCKS TO SCORE SHORT-HANDED GOAL AND LEAD 3-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between them, Ranger center Mark Messier and left wing Glenn Anderson have 10 
Stanley Cup rings, 458 postseason points and an unshakable trust in each other. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, when he intercepted a pass by Trevor Linden during a Canuck power 
play Thursday and broke up ice, Messier knew Anderson would be there to finish 
what Messier had started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played long enough to know that he would be on my tail," Messier said 
of his former Edmonton Oiler teammate after New York had beaten the Canucks, 
3-1, to tie their Stanley Cup final series, 1-1. "I knew once the puck went by 
the net, if it somehow got in front, he'd find a way to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson found a way to poke the puck past Kirk McLean at 11:42 of the second 
period and give the Rangers a lead they defended with the help of steely nerves 
and the metal crossbar. They needed a last-minute save by Mike Richter and an 
empty-net goal by Brian Leetch with four seconds left to close out the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as a send-off, the Rangers' trip to Vancouver for Games 3 and 4, 
Saturday and Tuesday, promised to be a happy one. If not for Anderson's goal, 
the trek West -- their first trip outside the Eastern time zone since late 
March -- would certainly have been more tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the series opener, 3-2, in overtime Tuesday, the Rangers believed 
they couldn't afford to have to win twice at the Pacific Coliseum to stay 
alive. They played the Canucks to a standoff in the first 30 minutes Thursday, 
after a rare goal-mouth dash by former Canuck Doug Lidster 6:22 into the game 
was matched by Sergio Momesso's sharp-angle shot from the right side at 14:04. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sense of determination, for sure. I don't know if that is 
translated by some as a sense of urgency," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said. "It 
was more a sense of commitment and effort. I thought the effort was 
exceptionally strong in the first game, and we deserved to win that." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Messier, who rank second and fourth, respectively, among alltime 
playoff scorers, would not accept a loss Thursday. Their teammates sensed that 
and expected them to make the difference, even though Messier was scoreless in 
Game 1 and Anderson had scored only twice in his previous 17 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting at lunch today and Adam Graves said (about Anderson), 'That's 
one of the best money players in the game. Before this is over, he's going to 
score a goal,' " Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing aggressively as the Rangers were killing a tripping penalty against 
Graves, Messier and Anderson dashed up ice on a clear breakaway. Canuck goalie 
McLean came out of his crease to poke the puck away from Messier, but it 
bounced off Messier's leg and stayed around the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to force my way into the play and avoid (defenseman Jyrki) Lumme 
backchecking on me," Anderson said. "I just went to the net as hard as I could. 
Mess fed it out to me and I had an empty net. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that playing with a great player such as Messier, he 
definitely tends to bring your game up to another level. He's like a Wayne 
Gretzky or a Doug Gilmour or a Mario Lemieux." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the two combine, winger Stephane Matteau said, "was a special moment 
for the Rangers. They've done it so many times. Even if Glenn Anderson only has 
two goals in the playoffs, he's a plus for us from the physical standpoint. His 
statistics don't show how well he's playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks played as well or better than they did Tuesday. Pavel Bure was 
more involved in the offense and had several good chances, including a blast 
that clanged off the junction of the post and crossbar one minute into the 
second period. Cliff Ronning hit the crossbar later in the second period, and 
Greg Adams did the same about two minutes into the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, but it's a good sign," Bure said of the crossbar hat trick. 
"In the first game we were awful, but right now we are playing much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canuck Coach Pat Quinn: "The game was much more even (than Game 1), and 
we happened to make an error. I believe it's going to be a good series. . . . 
We're not going to make it easy for anybody to go by us."

WHEN PIERCE SAYS ALLEZ , GRAF BIDS ADIEU TO STREAK; FRENCH OPEN: AFTER 33 
CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES IN GRAND SLAM MATCHES, NO. 1 PLAYER FALLS IN PARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf's remarkable string of victories had to end. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of 33 consecutive matches in Grand Slam events was seeking her 
fifth consecutive major title when the French Open began last week, but it 
appeared there was no one to challenge her. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday. In an unimaginable turn of events, women's tennis was jolted 
when 12th-seeded Mary Pierce displayed a mastery of Graf seldom seen since 
Monica Seles was grunting her way to Grand Slam tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing almost superhuman tennis, Pierce, 19, swept aside top-ranked Graf in 
the semifinals at Roland Garros Stadium as if she were a first-round qualifier, 
6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving women's tennis an injection of freshness, Pierce will play in 
Saturday's final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who defeated Conchita 
Martinez, 6-3, 6-1, in an uninspired semifinal of Spanish clay-court 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who lives in Florida but is playing out of France, particularly when 
in Paris, ended Graf's streak of having reached tournament finals at 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel I was out there," said Graf, whose last defeat in a Grand Slam 
event was inflicted by Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals of the 1992 U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf wasn't out there long. Play lasted 1 hour 17 minutes, and about the only 
thing that seemed to slow Pierce was the weather. After breaking Graf for the 
second time in the second set, the match was postponed for 40 minutes because 
of a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't want to stop," said Pierce, who lost in the fourth round of 
the last two French Opens to Jennifer Capriati. "(It) entered my mind that she 
was waiting for that." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it was doubtful whether the women's semifinals would be played at 
all. The roller-coaster weather had gone from cold to hot, to very hot, to 
humid, to thunderstorms during the week. But the sun poked through Thursday 
long enough for Pierce and Sanchez Vicario to make their marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain delay gave Graf a moment to collect her thoughts and consider 
changing her strategy. Instead, she did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just changed clothes and waited," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the match resumed, Pierce needed only 12 more minutes of slam-bang tennis 
to call it a day. She has lost only 10 games in six matches, a tournament 
record, and is the first French woman to reach the final since Francoise Durr 
won the title in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, whose mother is French, is enjoying the adulation of French fans but 
seems to be having an identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know if I am either-or," she said when asked if she were 
French or American. 
</P>
<P>
 She was definitely feeling French on Thursday. Yelling "Allez!" to herself 
when her potent ground strokes hit the deep lines, the bilingual Pierce blew 
kisses to the appreciative Center Court crowd after the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very happy and a little shocked at the way I won so easily," Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was surprised, too. Although she had not played well in reaching the 
semifinals, she is so dominant that most opponents celebrate a moral victory 
when winning a set against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce had not been challenged in her blitzkrieg to the semifinals, and many 
thought her flawless game would crumble under the pressure of the indomitable 
Graf. After all, she had beaten Pierce in straight sets in their only previous 
encounters, both last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boris Becker, who has become a good friend, told Pierce on the eve of her 
biggest match, "If you think you are nervous, Steffi will be twice as nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce was nervous, but kept smacking the ball as if it had been shot from a 
cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had no chance to attack me because I was playing very deep," Pierce said. 
"And I was changing the rhythm all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The ease with which Graf was broken was the most surprising aspect of the 
match. Pierce showed from the opening moments that she was not intimidated, 
either by Graf or the idea of playing in her first Grand Slam semifinal. She 
broke Graf for a 1-0 lead, and then did it again to go up, 3-0 and 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf could recall only a few other times when she faced such a devastating 
opponent. Even when losing to Seles, who has not played since she was stabbed 
during a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, in 1993, Graf usually was not 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her disappointment, Graf realizes Pierce could revitalize women's 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has definitely been very healthy," she said of Pierce's emergence as a 
force. "I think it is a good thing. It is difficult for me to say that right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, there was little tension in the Sanchez Vicario-Martinez match. 
Martinez, ranked No. 3, lost her serve in the first game and went downward from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving her Barcelona rival a chance to win the French Open again, Martinez 
made 48 unforced errors in 72 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Sanchez Vicario, who won here as a 17-year-old in 1989, has defeated 
Martinez five times in six meetings. But Martinez will get a big assist for 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole match was unforced errors," Martinez said. "It was all my mistakes. 
She was just putting the ball in the court."

 Roger Bannister, who broke the four-minute mile barrier in 1954, told Track & 
Field News that he once competed in Philadelphia in a race called the Benjamin 
Franklin Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got back to Oxford a few days later, an elderly don said to me, 
'You've just been to America, haven't you?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes,' I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Weren't you running a Benjamin Franklin mile?' the don added.

 "I played with Walter in Detroit and we honestly feared him during layup

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES; GIANTS' ROGERS HAS SURGERY 
FOR CLOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco Giant reliever Kevin Rogers was recovering Thursday from surgery 
on a clotted shoulder artery, a dangerous condition that has affected other 
hard-throwing pitchers and in 1980 ended the career of J.R. Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, doctors at Stanford University Hospital tied off a blocked 
artery in Rogers' left shoulder, an operation that will keep him out of action 
for several weeks and could sidetrack his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery came six days after tests determined that the coldness and 
numbness Rogers felt in his throwing arm and fingers were caused by a blood 
clot in a small artery in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, 25, is expected to recover in three weeks, but his return to baseball 
will depend on how quickly his circulation improves.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; JACKSON RETURNS TO CHICAGO, LEADS PHILLIES PAST CUBS, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Jackson, who struggled through a 5-14 record in two seasons with the 
Cubs, pitched four-hit ball over eight innings for his 100th career win 
Thursday night to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-2 victory over his 
former team at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really worried about what happened here in Chicago," said Jackson, 
who was 23-8 with Cincinnati in 1988."That was three years ago. Now, I'm back 
to where I was in '88." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (7-1) gave up two singles to Mark Parent and a home run and a double 
to Shawon Dunston. Doug Jones gave up one hit in the ninth and earned his 13th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kruk and Kevin Stocker were activated from the disabled list and both 
started for the Phillies, who handed Anthony Young (3-4) the loss. AMERICAN

 Baltimore 11, Detroit 5 -- Cal Ripken Jr. homered and drove in four runs and 
rookie right-hander Scott Klingenbeck won his major league debut, as the 
Orioles broke a three-game losing streak at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingenbeck (1-0) pitched seven innings and gave up four runs on six hits. 
Ripken's four RBIs came after the game was tied, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory helped the Orioles avert a four-game sweep to the Tigers, who had 
pitcher Storm Davis leave the game with a stiff back after pitching a scoreless 
third inning.

TRACK AND FIELD / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; USC'S MILLER WINS 100 HEAT BUT LAGS 
BEHIND SHARP HYCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana State sprint star Holli Hyche, overshadowing USC's Inger Miller, 
showed Thursday that she is again on target for a second consecutive double in 
the women's 100 and 200 meters at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyche won her quarterfinal heat in 11.09 seconds, the third fastest time in 
the world this year, after winning her quarterfinal heat in the 200 Wednesday 
night in 22.41, fourth best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyche also has won the 55-meter and 200-meter dashes in the last two NCAA 
indoor championships, and if she wins both outdoor races again, she would be 
the first to sweep the indoor and outdoor sprints two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU's Cheryl Taplin, the co-world leader this year at 11.07, and Miller, the 
two biggest challengers to Hyche, won their heats, but were not nearly as 
impressive. Taplin was timed in 11.30 and Miller in 11.46. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyche will run the 100 and 200 semifinals tonight, and both finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Erick Walder of Arkansas won a record-tying third long jump 
title and Diane Guthrie of George Mason became the first athlete from an 
Eastern school to win the heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Walder and Roland McGhee of Middle Tennessee State tied for the best jumps at 
27 feet, 4 1/2 inches, but the Razorback senior won on a better second jump -- 
27-0 1/2 to McGhee's 26-10 1/2. He tied a record set by Ed Gordon of Iowa from 
1929-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthrie also became the first to win a multi-event title and an individual 
championship in meet history, adding the heptathlon to the long jump crowns she 
won indoors and outdoors in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthrie, who was third in the long jump Wednesday, easily won the heptathlon 
with 6,032 points. Defending champion Kelly Blair (5,877) of Oregon was second. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Jenkins, the only Tennessee high jump champion, won his second 
consecutive title at 7-7.

TITAN'S FEAR STRIKES OUT; RICABAL STOPS PITCHING SCARED AND HELPS TAKE 
FULLERTON TO OMAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Ricabal remembers vividly the day his pitching hit rock bottom. He 
wondered if there was any point in going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal reached the crossroads in his baseball career in Cal State Fullerton's 
15th game this season against the University of San Diego. He didn't complete 
an inning, retiring only two batters, and gave up four walks, a hit and three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I try to think of what my worst nightmare as a pitcher would be, this 
doesn't even come close (to being topped)," Ricabal said. "This was a lot worse 
than anything I could imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 But if that day was the bottom, then this week is clearly the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal and his teammates are in the College World Series, but they might not 
be here, ready to take on second-seeded Georgia Tech at 12:36 p.m. (PDT) today 
in the opening game at Rosenblatt Stadium if it hadn't been for Ricabal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a key to the whole thing," said George Horton, the Titan assistant 
who coaches the pitchers for Coach Augie Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal was the winning pitcher in two of Fullerton's four victories in the 
NCAA Midwest I Regional at Oklahoma State, and he appeared in three of five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 He started and was the winning pitcher in the regional opener Friday against 
Northwestern State of Louisiana, giving up only six hits and two runs, one of 
them earned, in 6 2/3 innings of an 11-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after Fullerton was beaten by Oklahoma State on Sunday, he was back on 
the mound against Memphis State Monday afternoon in a game the Titans had to 
win to stay alive. Ricabal went the last five innings, holding the Tigers to 
four hits and one run. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't end there. With the Fullerton pitching staff stretched thin by 
five games in four days in temperatures that ranged from the low 80s to the 
mid-90s, Ricabal came on to pitch again for 2 1/3 innings in the championship 
game against Oklahoma State later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 In 14 innings of three games, he had a 1.93 earned-run average, giving up only 
nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave us everything he had in those three games," Horton said. "His 
resiliency was really phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly the same Ricabal who was in the depths of despair in February. 
In his first five starts he had given up 27 hits, 25 runs and 20 walks in 22 
1/3 innings. Fullerton's most consistent pitcher the previous season with a 
11-3 record suddenly couldn't find the strike zone. When he did, the ball was 
hit sharply, time after time. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing was worse than the game against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was the worst period of time I had since I started playing baseball 
16 years ago when I was in Little League," said Ricabal, who was a star pitcher 
for San Gabriel High and Cerritos College. "I thought then that my career was 
probably over. That's the worst feeling you can possibly have. I just couldn't 
believe that after pitching so well all those years, it had come down to one 
game that was so painful." 
</P>
<P>
 He knew he was going to lose his spot in the starting rotation. He swallowed 
his pride and went to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to do that after you've been a starter, but I did a lot of 
thinking then," he said. "What happened was that I decided I definitely wanted 
to show people that I still could compete at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ricabal thought about the slump, he had no doubt that the problem dated 
back to his days in an Alaska collegiate league. He had been successful there 
the previous two years, but last summer was strangely different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I went there a little tired," he said. "I'd just come off a season 
where I'd pitched 130 innings, and I was on a plane to Alaska 10 days later. 
The team I played for was short on pitching at the start. I had three starts in 
the first week and my record was 0-3. My arm didn't feel that sore, but I could 
tell I just didn't have any juice in my pitches. My fastball was down to 77 . . 
. . 78 m.p.h. and my curve had no bite in it. I had nothing on the ball, so I 
started being fine with my pitches and people were hitting the ball on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal finished the summer with a 2-7 record and it gnawed at him throughout 
the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence was really low when we started our season because of that," he 
said. "I was still pitching too carefully. I felt I had to make the perfect 
pitch every time, and I was always falling behind batters." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Ricabal decided it was going to be all or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt my career was on the line, and that I was going to take whatever risks 
I had to take," he said. "If a ball hit me in the middle of the forehead, then 
that was that. I decided I was going to attack the game, not let it attack me. 
I started throwing the ball again, not aiming it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal said his more aggressive approach has worked. His sharpness returned, 
and the batters no longer were having their way with his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've learned is that this game cannot be played scared, and that's 
helped me as much as anything," Ricabal said. "You've got to play it 
aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last 12 appearances of the regular season, Ricabal was 6-1 with a 2.00 
ERA. In one 40-inning stretch, he gave up only three earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really become a valuable commodity for us because of all the things he 
can do," Horton said. "We can use him as a starter or in long or short relief. 
Dan can give you 12 innings, or one out if that's what you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal just hopes he can keep it going now in the College World Series. It 
is, of course, a big moment for him personally, one that three months ago he 
doubted he would ever experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real rush of excitement," he said. "One of the things I said to 
myself last February was that the past was gone, and I couldn't do anything 
about any of that. All I could do anything about was the future." Today's

FRENCH OPEN / MEN'S SEMIFINALS; BRUGUERA CAN'T SNEAK UP ON COURIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Sergi Bruguera was an unheralded, unappreciated and largely 
unsuccessful player who came to the French Open and wound up showing two-time 
and defending champion Jim Courier the door. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-hour 59-minute final, Bruguera outlasted Courier, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 3-6, 
6-3, for his only Grand Slam tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Courier gets a chance to return the favor when they meet in a men's 
semifinal at Roland Garros Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinal features two lesser-known players. Bruguera's fellow 
Spaniard, 20th-ranked Alberto Berasategui, will play No. 46 Magnus Larsson of 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruguera-Courier matchup pits two of the world's best clay-court players, 
although they are ranked sixth and seventh, respectively. Bruguera, as does 
Berasategui, concentrates on clay tournaments. Courier, despite his drop in the 
rankings this year, is dangerous on all surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin today's match with impressive quarterfinal victories over 
higher-ranked opponents. Courier defeated top-ranked Pete Sampras, who was 
trying to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major 
tennis titles at the same time. Courier's four-set victory was followed by 
Bruguera's defeat of No. 4 Andrei Medvedev. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera has yet to drop a set, effectively using a powerful spinning forehand 
that opponents have trouble returning on the slow red clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost impossible to explain what I felt," Bruguera said of last year's 
victory. "I was in heaven for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the moment is over. Bruguera said he played better last year, before he 
had to bear the added pressure of being defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is much tougher to play (this year)," he said, "Sometimes (I) can't sleep 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinalists should not be having those problems. Few knew much 
about Berasategui and Larsson when the tournament began 12 days ago. Still, 
Berasategui, 20, of Barcelona, was considered a player who could succeed on the 
clay at Paris, even though this is only his fourth Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson is playing in his 17th Grand Slam tournament, but has never advanced 
this far. He survived a five-set match against Henrik Dreekmann of Germany to 
reach the semifinals. Berasategui routed No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic in straight 
sets in the quarterfinals.

HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS / CITY CHAMPIONSHIPS; DORSEY'S WILLIAMS GRABS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GREG SANDOVAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trailing, 5-3, in the tiebreaker of the final set, Dorsey High's Robert 
Williams scored four consecutive points to defeat Dylan Mann of Woodland Hills 
Taft, 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), in the City Section individual singles final 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann appeared to have the edge early in the battle of sophomores.He went ahead 
in the first set, 4-1, and had Williams down three set points at the Studio 
City Racquet Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams used lobs to win several key points and came from behind to win 
the set in a tiebreaker, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't concentrating early," Williams said. "My dad showed me that 
lob, and after winning the first set I knew I had to just take it point by 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 In a doubles final featuring a pair of teams from Palisades, the No. 1 duo of 
Oliver Catlin and Jeff Manson defeated Jason Ebin and Daniel Elperin, 6-2, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare same-school matchup came about after the sixth-seeded team of Ebin 
and Elperin upset favored Eric Aron and Jeff Labovitch of Chatsworth in the 
semifinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the defending champions and we never thought they would be the ones we 
would face," Manson said of Ebin and Elperin. "It was just in the last month 
they began to really improve their play." 
</P>
<P>
 After dropping the first set, and trailing in the second-set tiebreaker, 5-0, 
Ebin and Elperin scored seven consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams were about even all year," Palisades Coach Bud Kling said. "Ebin 
and Elperin have been coming from behind all year. How many times do you see 
someone score seven straight points in a tiebreaker?"

LOS ALAMITOS; DASH OF CIDER SPICES 'CUP FUTURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dicey Secret might have started the $101,314 California Sires Cup Futurity 
last Saturday night as the most promising 2-year-old, but Dash Of Cider 
finished the race as the most accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Brian Koriner, Dash Of Cider earned the winner's share, $38,812, 
while running the 350 yards in 17.89 seconds. The second-fastest qualifier, 
behind Dicey Secret, Dash Of Cider left the gate as the 4-1 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors made Dicey Secret the even-money favorite off her dazzling 
17.77-second qualifying time, but were disappointed when she could not repeat 
that performance. Dash Of Cider broke from the far outside and dug in to beat 
My Thumb Tack by a neck, with Dicey Secret another half-length behind in third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dicey Secret) slipped a little leaving the gate and that shot her in toward 
the (No. 2) horse," trainer Danny Mitchell said. "She ricocheted off her, and 
it took about 100 yards before she really got to run. She tried to recover, but 
350 yards doesn't give a lot of time to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell added that the trial two weeks earlier might have taken more out of 
Dicey Secret than she showed. She came back from Saturday's race a bit sore, 
and Mitchell might give her some time off. She's eligible to run in the Miss 
Kindergarten Futurity, but those trials are on June 11 and that might be too 
soon. Mitchell will decide after taking the filly to the track and discussing 
the matter with owner Cathy Monji. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash Of Cider probably will skip the Kindergarten Futurity on June 24 for the 
same reason, Koriner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's paid up for every race through the year, so he doesn't have to run that 
soon," the trainer said, adding that he would consult with owner and breeder 
Gordon Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a steel company, Shultz began racing quarter horses 35 years ago. 
He owns 22 horses and breeds six or seven mares a year. As for Dash Of Cider, 
Shultz said, "He's improved every step along the way. He's got the body and the 
breeding to run like this." 
</P>
<P>
 A son of First Down Dash, Dash Of Cider placed second his first time out and 
won his futurity trial by half a length over My Thumb Tack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a tremendous stride," Shultz said. "We expect him to do even better 
when he gets into 400 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the upset of the night Friday, Rainbow Sun defeated the favored Moo Vin 
First to win the $103,500 El Primero Del Ano Derby. The two horses broke 
together and raced side by side until the final strides, when Rainbow Sun 
out-finished Moo Vin First by half a length. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved our position," winning jockey Jim Lewis said. "Anytime you are next 
to the class horse in the race, you have a great advantage because you can 
gauge your mount so much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Moo Vin First had run the fastest qualifying time and had shown 
talent while winning both of his races last year, Rainbow Sun's trainer still 
held out hope. With four victories and two thirds in 13 starts, the Calyx 
gelding had earned $54,712 before the El Primero, and then collected another 
$40,862. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little disappointed in his qualifying race, but I've always been very 
confident with this horse," said Dennis Givens, who trains Rainbow Sun for 
owner-breeder Jim Schlagel. "He just goes about his business." 
</P>
<P>
 Givens, who received Rainbow Sun when the colt's 1993 trainer left for Texas, 
is going about his business with increasing success lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 27 days of the meeting, Givens had 12 winners, five seconds 
and seven thirds in 44 races. A quarter horse conditioner since the late 1970s, 
he counts this as his most successful start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a team operation back there," Givens said, referring to his barn. 
"Everyone is happy and that makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the fastest qualifiers in the El Primero Del Ano Derby and the Sires Cup 
Futurity had been upset, bettors still favored Artesias Special Gal in 
Saturday's $113,000 La Primera Del Ano Derby. But it was won by Pretty 
Sensation, who had the second-fastest time in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty Sensation didn't see Artesias Special Gal at the start of their trial 
-- Pretty Sensation broke from the third post position and Artesias Special Gal 
was on the outside -- and Pretty Sensation finished a length back. In the La 
Primera, there was only one horse between them at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really competitive and she likes to hook up," trainer Danny Cardoza 
said of Pretty Sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Vessels, who owns and bred the filly, gave all the credit to the 
trainer, saying: "She's shown a lot, but (Cardoza) had her perfect tonight."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; WORST KIND OF PAYOUT SHOWS BEST SEVEN IS 
THE POOREST OF BETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian McGrath, the new commissioner for the 55 or so tracks that belong to the 
Thoroughbred Racing Assns., emerged from his low profile at the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, who has an entertainment, television and international sports 
background that doesn't include racing, seems like the kind of guy you would 
trust to fix your watch. When he took the job in January, few in racing had 
heard of him. Don Klosterman, former general manager of the Rams and a one-time 
board member at Hollywood Park, was one of McGrath's golf partners when both 
lived in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope they give him a chance," said Klosterman, who will be back in 
racing, sort of, if he gets state approval to be part of the outside management 
team for Hollywood Park's new card-playing casino. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's salary has been estimated at more than $500,000 a year, and is 
probably closer to $750,000. David Vance, president of the TRA, said when 
McGrath was hired, part of that salary would come from profits yielded by a 
national pick-seven bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite expectedly, racing isn't calling the pick seven the pick seven, because 
that would make too much sense. Never a proponent of K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, 
stupid), racing prefers calling a bet an exacta one place, a perfecta another. 
The triple in California is really a pick three; in New York, the triple is 
really a trifecta. The rule of thumb is, confuse the fan. 
</P>
<P>
 So the pick seven is officially known as the National Best Seven, and it had a 
lurching start on Monday, with seven stakes races spaced between five and 14 
minutes apart at seven tracks. Although the Best Seven was approved by the TRA 
four months ago, McGrath had to scurry to put the program together in time for 
Memorial Day, and after all the contracts were signed, he still didn't have New 
York, Kentucky and the Las Vegas race books participating. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the handle was a mere $371,000, about 20% of that coming from 
Hollywood Park and its off-track outlets. The races were so formful that 919 
tickets were sold with all seven winners. The payoff for each ticket, based on 
a 50-cent minimum bet, was $190.75. Seldom has so much handicapping astuteness 
been worth so little. 
</P>
<P>
 The low payoff aside, there's something inherently wrong about a project that 
carries the baggage of needing to partially pay the person running it. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only one of many things wrong with the Best Seven. McGrath has said 
that one of the purposes of the bet is to attract new fans, but instead the 
Best Seven epitomizes almost everything that keeps new fans away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when he was chairman of the New York Racing Assn. tracks, Dinny 
Phipps addressed racing's need to chip away at the things that discourage 
first-time patrons. For a new fan, handicapping races at seven tracks, with 
many unfamiliar horses, is the ultimate intimidation. Running seven races 
within an hour's time is an overwhelming exercise as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Racing Form is offering past performances on the Best Seven races 
for $1.50. This is tantamount to intimidation of the pocketbook; fans are 
already paying $2.85 -- plus tax in California -- for the Form's past 
performances of the races at the track they're attending. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath ought to call the Best Seven what it is: A lottery-type bet that the 
TRA hopes will grow until the carryover reaches multimillion-dollar 
proportions. At Golden Gate Fields, fans are already approaching the Best Seven 
with a lottery mentality. Parimutuel clerks there said some bettors were asking 
them to pick the seven numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until only one bettor sweeps the seven races, 7% of the net pool goes into the 
carryover. Monday's carryover was only $19,000. The new fan, who's betting 
small tickets, is virtually dealt out of the game when the carryover 
multiplies. The larger the pool, the more the deep-pocketed syndicates sweep 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Seven will have the same effect on racing as an interactive TV 
betting network will have: It will serve the customers the sport already has. 
No new fans will come from marketing strategies that preclude actually 
attending the track and watching live horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Best Seven gives all participants in racing -- owners, trainers, jockeys 
and track operators -- something to rally around," McGrath told the Racing Form 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly, I thought racing already had that when the American Championship Racing 
Series was being run. That series, which was killed after last year, committed 
horrible crimes: It kept the best handicap horses together for a succession of 
races, rewarded their owners with bonus money and gave television something to 
sink its teeth into along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Political squabbling all too endemic to racing scuttled the series, after 
which Vance said that the TRA would be revving up substitutes. Now that the 
Best Seven is here, the new, improved replacements for the championship series 
have landed on the far back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's term in office is also being marred by a conflict between the TRA 
and the Racing Form on one side and the National Turf Writers Assn. on the 
other over the future of the Eclipse Awards. The TRA and the Form have strongly 
suggested that the public be included in the annual voting. Track racing 
secretaries, Racing Form personnel and turf writers have done the voting since 
the Eclipse program began in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The turf writers are adamant about keeping the status quo, as well they should 
be. Fan voting is an idea whose time will never come. Getting fans more 
involved in racing is admirable, but the game's championships shouldn't be the 
vehicle. The stuffing of the ballot box would be shameless and insurmountable, 
starting with the breeding farms that have potential monetary gain if they're 
connected with a champion. Once the public starts voting, an embarrassment for 
racing will be only the next election away. 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA and the Racing Form, which is in a severe circulation slump, are 
apparently not going to let go of their idea. The forecast here is that they 
will run their own championship balloting, and the turf writers will have a 
separate vote, giving racing a dual set of champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Form will then give one paragraph of coverage to the turf writers' 
champions, and the turf writers' newspapers and magazines will devote the same 
amount of space to the TRA-Racing Form winners. Other news agencies, starting 
with television, will tsk-tsk this madness and turn their backs on the awards. 
Then racing takes a giant step back into the 1960s. You wonder which century 
this sport is really heading into.

GOLF ROUNDUP; BROOKS' 65 UPSTAGES GALLERY'S FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The huge gallery that followed John Daly and Phil Mickelson Thursday was 
treated to a dazzling display of golf by the first-round leader of the Kemper 
Open . . . Mark Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in a threesome with two of the top young players on the PGA Tour, 
Brooks shot a six-under-par 65 on the TPC at Avenel course in Potomac, Md., to 
take a three-stroke lead. His bogey-free round included three consecutive 
birdies that enabled him to pull away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he felt out of place before a crowd obviously more interested in his 
playing partners, Brooks said: "I'm leading the tournament. They were lucky to 
get paired with me, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson, playing in his second tournament since he suffered a broken leg 
while skiing in March, was one of nine players at 70. Daly shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Levi, Ed Dougherty and Bobby Watkins had 68s; Scott Hoch and Mark 
O'Meara were among five players at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Daniel and Ellie Gibson each shot a five-under-par 67 to share the 
first-round lead in the $600,000 LPGA Oldsmobile tournament at Walnut Hills 
Country Club in East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Kiggens, Amy Benz, Meg Mallon, Nancy Ramsbottom and Marianne Morris were 
one stroke behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel rallied with three consecutive birdies and four in five holes on the 
back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Putting from either the left or right side, depending on the break and 
position on the green, Notah Begay III of Stanford shot a 10-under-par 62 to 
tie an NCAA record and share the lead with Georgia Tech's Mikko Rantanen after 
two rounds of the NCAA Division I men's golf championships at the Stonebridge 
Country Club course in McKinney, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Begay, from Albuquerque, N.M., matched the 62 by Arizona's Robert Gamez, shot 
in 1989. Begay also set a tournament record, bettering the nine-under scores by 
Arizona State's Phil Mickelson in 1992 and Oklahoma's Jim Begwin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Begay and Rantanen are tied at 134, three shots ahead of Oklahoma State's Alan 
Bratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford took over the team lead, shooting a 15-under 273, after opening with 
a 292 on Wednesday. Stanford stands at 565, two shots ahead of Arkansas.

ART REVIEW; THE MET'S RARITY FROM THE RENAISSANCE; EXPLORATORY NATURE OF 
CHRISTUS' WORK OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because they're so rare, exhibitions of Northern Renaissance painting rank as 
big-deal events. "Petrus Christus: Renaissance Master of Bruges" measures up. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, points out 
in the first paragraph of the chunky catalogue to the show, which is on view at 
the Manhattan museum through July, that there hasn't been a significant display 
of Northern Renaissance art in the United States since a landmark presentation 
at the Detroit Institute of the Arts 34 years ago. That's a long time between 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiatus is not for lack of interest. Appropriate caution is the main reason 
for the rarity of such shows: 15th-Century Netherlandish artists typically 
painted on wooden panels and, especially after 500 years, panel paintings are 
exceptionally sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. Bringing them 
together from far and wide can be risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrus Christus, whose known body of work amounts to fewer than 30 paintings, 
usually painted on panels made of oak. All but one little manuscript 
illumination (and four drawings) in the Met's modest but absorbing show are 
painted on wood, 15 of the 17 panels identified as oak. 
</P>
<P>
 Those panels deemed too fragile to move -- including the wonderful little 
"Lamentation" from the Louvre Museum and a small portrait of a young man from 
London's National Gallery -- have not traveled to New York. However much their 
presence is missed, caution is crucial to observe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Met already had a leg up on putting together a Christus 
survey -- the first ever attempted. Five of his early paintings, including a 
fragmentary "Annunciation" (circa 1450) commonly attributed to the artist, are 
in the museum's own collection. Curator Maryan W. Ainsworth had an in-house 
core on which to build. 
</P>
<P>
 A good part of the charm of Christus' art can be located in the savvy sense of 
nimble curiosity these paintings represent. When he began to paint shortly 
after acquiring citizenship in the prosperous merchant city of Bruges in 1444 
(his date of birth in the early 1400s isn't known), all of Europe seemed to be 
in dramatic flux, economically, socially, politically and artistically. Looking 
at Christus' paintings, you have the feeling of an artist puzzling things out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples stand out. One is the transition from manuscript illuminations, 
made in books for private devotion, to the more publicly conceived format of 
panel painting. It's unusual to find a one-artist show that spans a dramatic 
ensemble chronicling "The Death of the Virgin" (circa 1460-65) and measuring 6 
feet in height and more than 4 1/2 feet in width, and a tiny manuscript 
painting of the "Trinity" (circa 1470-75), just a few inches square. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Christus' panel paintings are also very small, such as the hauntingly 
strange "Madonna of the Dry Tree" (circa 1465), which is just under 6-by-5 
inches. A crystalline Madonna and Child are portrayed standing in the crook of 
a dead tree, whose spiky branches encircle them in a clever reference to the 
crown of thorns. Tiny letter a's suspended from the branches shimmer with a 
golden light against a deep brown-black background, creating a visual chorus of 
ave Marias from out of the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 A latent, jewel-like preciousness born of manuscript illumination is one 
ingredient that makes Christus' panel paintings so oddly compelling. Especially 
in his portraits, such as the uncannily intimate "Portrait of a Carthusian" 
(1446), the intensely observed pictures have the feel of devotional images. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestration of linear patterns across the panel surface and the painted 
play of light across the planes of a face can together create a subtle tension 
between form conceived by the mind as an organizing idea and form regarded as 
something empirical, seen by the eye. Worshipful piety begins to become 
unmoored from eternal religious texts and transferred to the fleeting secular 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Christus is one important link between earlier traditions of manuscript 
illumination and emergent conventions of panel painting, but there's a second 
aspect to his art that commands attention. In an unusual way, this development 
is related to the more public nature of panel painting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's startling to realize that, among other greatly revered Netherlandish 
painters, such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, Petrus Christus holds 
a unique position as the artist who painted the first Northern image with a 
fully realized one-point perspective. Already prominent in Italian art for a 
quarter century, the perspective method for precise rendering of objects in 
space arrived late in Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna Enthroned With Saints Jerome and Francis" (1457) was inexplicably cut 
down along its left side at some awful moment in its history; still, the 
coherence of the panel's one-point perspective remains clear. At the Met, a 
display of infrared and X-ray pictures of the panel in a gallery adjacent to 
the show demonstrates how Christus worked out the one-point scheme. Through 
highly finished underdrawing, he painstakingly laid out the arrangement of 
figures in mathematically derived space. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting about this use of perspective is not just that it's the 
first example of a Northern artist fully grasping the new Southern convention 
of one-point perspective, which had developed in Florence. Italy's mathematical 
device isn't intrinsically more "true to life" than, say, the optically 
adjusted space that Van Eyck had so brilliantly mastered. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the arrival of one-point perspective to Northern Europe in 1457 says 
a lot about dynamic changes in international commerce and its relationship to 
art. Bruges was a commercial city of substantial significance; among its active 
patron class was a sizable and powerful group of Italian businessmen. (For 
example, the most important foreign branch of the Florentine Medici bank was in 
Bruges.) Ainsworth and catalogue essayist Maximilian P.J. Martens speculate -- 
convincingly -- that Christus' urge to figure out the Italian system of 
one-point perspective came as an effort to satisfy demands of the marketplace. 
He wanted commissions from Italian collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicting techniques of empirical observation and formal method, the 
differing requirements of manuscript illumination and panel painting, the 
expansion of secular subject matter alongside religious imagery, the 
transformation of patronage -- all of this and more is glimpsed in the handful 
of pictures left from Christus' career. He was not an artist who worked in a 
comfortable niche and stuck with it. Instead, the complicated, shifting, 
exploratory nature of Christus' art is the source of its compelling energy -- 
especially for our present period of equally disorienting tumult.

 " I ducked my head under the sharp cracking that was going overhead. " -- War 
correspondent Ernest Hemingway with U.S. troops under fire in a landing craft 
approaching France, June 6, 1944 
</P>
<P>
 Good morning, Normandy! 
</P>
<P>
 This is an invasion. The D-day documentaries, black-and-white newsreel footage 
and testimonials from military veterans and former riveting Rosies are this 
spring's blitzkrieg, dusting off memories while massing on television in such 
force that you can hardly keep count. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 50th anniversary of the Allies' liberating invasion of France so 
near, U.S. media are hitting Normandy with everything they've got, waves and 
waves of camera crews scurrying across its beaches like sand crabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the elements of spectacle are ever present, it's encouraging, at 
least, to see television cover an event not of its own making. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion cost the lives of 23,000 American troops. "Only those who were 
there know how horrendous it was," ABC's Peter Jennings reported on videotape 
from the French coast during Wednesday night's "Turning Point." Surely most on 
the home front never understood the horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially the children. Reared on simplified war movies that were as 
dispensable as popcorn and isolated from the actual killing fields by their 
geography, that generation of American kids sealed themselves inside an 
impenetrable play world where war was a dreamy reality at best and death was an 
abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no television to speak of during World War II and the immediate 
post-war years. No slaughters in Los Angeles, Bosnia, Haiti, Sudan, Gaza or 
Rwanda that anyone could see, no nightly pictures of rotted, fly-buzzed corpses 
baking in the sun. No wretched victims dying right there on the screen, nothing 
on a mass scale that could convey to the very young just how gory and grim war 
was. That wouldn't happen until Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real war is never like paper war," Hemingway wrote, "nor do accounts of it 
read much the way it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 To many kids of that era, it looked this way: Bang-bang, you're alive. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember playing lots of baseball with my friends as a kid in Kansas City, 
Mo. Just as vivid are my memories of having fun playing guns. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, only one thing could compare to the crack of a bat hitting a ball, and 
that was the crack of gunfire, at least as we innocently imagined it. We 
provided our own sound effects, even our own danger (dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum) 
music. There was something very romantic about the fantasy of both shooting 
someone and pretending to get gunned down yourself, grunting and clutching your 
chest in mock agony while keeling over, then getting back up and starting the 
game again. To us, war was a game, an exercise in heroism minus real 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things stay in your head. One afternoon in the winter of 1949, my 
neighbor Jody Aldrich and I returned from the Fiesta Theater excited and 
energized after watching a Saturday matinee of "Battleground," a movie about 
Americans fighting and dying in the Battle of the Bulge. Hearts pounding, we 
tore into our houses and in only a few minutes were back outside with our 
plastic guns (I think mine was a Thompson's submachine gun), brown infantry 
helmets and other soldier gear, re-fighting World War II in the snow. Being two 
years older than I, Jody pulled rank and, as a result, I got killed probably a 
dozen times that afternoon, hitting the white ground so often that my clothes 
took on a glacial rigidity. What fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came back to me while watching "Turning Point." I contrasted my 
childhood war games with the recollections of Normandy survivors, their voices 
at times cracking with emotion after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I curled up as small as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty or 30 G.I.s who had gotten up ran smack into a shell." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just mowed down." 
</P>
<P>
 "Men were getting hit, you know, drowning." 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyeballs . . . were hanging down." 
</P>
<P>
 Reuniting America with its dead sons, the 90-minute program ended with an 
overview of white crosses at Normandy's military cemetery, where so many 
soldiers are buried beneath a bit of the ground they fought to free. 
</P>
<P>
 During "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS Tuesday, artist and Normandy 
survivor Tracy Sugerman asserted that the memory of what happened there will be 
"dusty and meaningless" to today's children and future generations. A 
disturbing thought. Yet sadly, he's right, and it's something that cannot be 
changed by all the history lessons in the world. Time is too great a barrier to 
overcome, rendering us all uncaring amnesiacs when it comes to the major crises 
experienced by our predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a lot of people are probably tiring of this history lesson that is now 
preoccupying so much television, even though it memorializes a seminal event of 
a war that changed the 20th Century. It must seem as abstract to them as it was 
to war-playing kids in 1949, especially compared to the contemporary violence 
that intersects their lives nightly via their favorite newscast. On CNN 
Thursday came this report from Rwanda: "We saw nine bodies. When we got closer, 
we could see five were alive, barely alive. Then we witnessed a government 
soldier shooting one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it's hard for many to get worked up over Normandy when there's 
so much in the present that competes for our attention and fear, as television 
relentlessly reminds us of today's killing fields both abroad and in the United 
States, where even children -- no longer the innocents of yesteryear -- have 
access to firearms. And instead of toys, these guns are real. 
</P>
<P>
 Bang-bang, you're dead.

'TALES OF THE CITY' SEQUEL SEEKS SUPPORT; TELEVISION: PBS STILL REFUSES TO FUND 
A FOLLOW-UP. BUT 'TALES' AUTHOR ARMISTEAD MAUPIN AND PRODUCER ALAN POUL ARE 
SEEKING OTHER BACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the San Francisco saga "Tales of the City" take heart: There may yet 
be a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although PBS remains steadfast in refusing to provide funding for a follow-up 
to the acclaimed miniseries (which is being rerun tonight on KCET-TV Channel 
28), "Tales" author Armistead Maupin and producer Alan Poul are hopeful about 
their attempts to raise the money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get it made," says Poul. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Britain's Channel 4, which produced and financed the original, is still 
willing to put up half the $8-million budget for a sequel. But executives 
there, dumbfounded and embittered by PBS' decision, are not as optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PBS withdrawal, in our view, has killed the show," says Peter Ansorge, 
Channel 4's deputy head of drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Maupin and Poul feel they may be close to something. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting together a financial package that consists of money from 
Channel 4, money from Canada and then money from an American broadcast entity," 
says Poul. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian production company has agreed to put up $1 million for Canadian 
broadcast rights, providing that interior shots are filmed in Vancouver and 
some Canadian actors are used, according to Maupin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the American money," says Poul, "we're pursuing several options." 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is to obtain funding from a consortium of "30 to 40 of the 
leading PBS stations," which all have expressed interest in getting the sequel 
made, says Poul. In that scenario, the sequel would appear on those PBS 
stations without being on the PBS network.  
</P>
<P>
 Poul says he also is in talks with TV companies outside the PBS system, 
including cable.  
</P>
<P>
 And Maupin, who first wrote "Tales" as a serial in the San Francisco Chronicle 
and then saw his stories become internationally best-selling novels, says he is 
pursuing another fund-raising source: "I'm making personal pleas to everyone I 
know who can write a check." 
</P>
<P>
 When Channel 4 decided to make the original "Tales," it sought co-production 
funding in the United States but was turned down by every company it 
approached. Then, a week after filming began, PBS agreed to pay just under $1 
million of the $8-million budget for U.S. broad-cast rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-hour miniseries drew lavish praise from critics and the highest 
ratings PBS has received for drama in more than a decade. But it also brought 
the wrath of some conservative religious activists and politicians who objected 
to the program's portrayal of sybaritic San Franciscans, gay and straight, 
circa 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the program's success both in the United States and Britain, where 
"Tales" won the British equivalent of an Emmy for best drama serial, Channel 4 
decided to go ahead with the sequel. This time, the channel asked PBS to put up 
half the money, saying it could not afford to finance the miniseries alone 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS said no. Since then, the network has taken a severe beating from media 
commentators across the United States for abandoning the sequel. Although the 
network says its reasons were strictly financial, there is widespread belief 
that it feared political repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they're publicly funded," says Maupin, "they're desperately afraid 
their life's blood will be taken from them for making homosexuals look like 
regular human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Channel 4's Ansorge, "I suspect it's a combination of commerce and 
cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
 From the financial point of view, he believes PBS' move follows a longtime -- 
and somewhat deceptive -- tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "PBS has a history of acquiring prestige productions from Britain for very 
little money," Ansorge says. "I think the prestige they've gained from British 
television productions has been a slight cover-up of the (economic) reality." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tales of the City" begins a rerun at 10 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

BBC GETS TOUGH ON (GLAMORIZED) VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISON ROBERTS, THE TIMES OF LONDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The British Broadcasting Corp. plans to adopt tough new guidelines to prevent 
the glamorization of violent crime in its news and current-affairs programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations follow three months of intense debate within the BBC in 
response to suggestions that excessive media coverage had fueled public fear of 
violence. Particular concern has been expressed about programs that feature 
dramatic reconstructions of serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft guidelines for journalists were unveiled Wednesday at a seminar on 
crime organized by the BBC's board of governors.  
</P>
<P>
 Editors of news bulletins and current-affairs programs will be required to 
reassess the amount of time devoted to crime stories. The guidelines warn them 
against "regurgitating" lurid crime stories on early-morning news and "copying" 
stories that have appeared in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ayre, controller of editorial policy at the BBC, said: "The fact that 
a crime is new and fresh doesn't necessarily merit a place in our bulletins." 
He agreed that the guidelines, to be published later this month, may reduce the 
number of crime stories seen on BBC news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 They will require extra care over shots of blood at the scene of a crime, and 
close-up shots of weapons will be censored. Also, emotive adjectives will be 
discouraged. "We must avoid hype and sensationalism," Ayre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime reconstruction sequences also face a tough reappraisal. Dramatic music 
and speculative details or dialogue will be banned and camera angles that 
illustrate a criminal's viewpoint will not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll placed public fear of crime above that of unemployment for the 
first time. Mary Tuck, a Home Office criminologist who attended the BBC 
seminar, said that violent personal crime still accounted for only 5% of 
recorded offenses. But she said that popular fear of personal attack and rape 
had increased dramatically so that the perception of danger was out of all 
proportion with reality.

ART REVIEWS; POSADA'S POLITICAL PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dancing skeletons, ruthless bandits, serene saints and rapacious politicians 
populate the raucous, multifaceted world depicted in the cheap broadsheets by 
Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913) at Bryce Bannatyne Gallery. Before 
photography satisfied (and stimulated) modern society's appetite for 
sensational images of the news, Posada's prints illustrated stories, conveyed 
the gory details of natural disasters and outlined the back-stabbing 
viciousness of frontier politics. 
</P>
<P>
 His etchings, engravings and occasional woodblocks also editorialized freely. 
Some were intended for poor Native Americans and Mexicans who could not read, 
others were aimed at the literate. Both types regularly ridiculed the hypocrisy 
and greed of the privileged classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Posada was a working-class artisan trained in the time-consuming process of 
lithography. After moving to Mexico City in 1888, he turned to a little-known 
process of zinc etching that allowed him to turn plates out in less than an 
hour. Speed was essential to keep up with fast-breaking news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Posada's popularity grew as his topical, timely prints appeared in newspapers, 
chapbooks and satirical weekly journals. He produced an estimated 15,000 
images, many generic enough to be re-used whenever a publisher needed to 
illustrate another robbery, murder or government scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything unifies Posada's prodigious output, it's the restless, ribald 
humor of his ubiquitous calaveras , or skeleton caricatures. He did not invent 
these playful Day of the Dead characters, in which human foibles look petty in 
contrast to the mortality everyone shares, but his graphics popularized them. 
</P>
<P>
 After Posada's death, Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco claimed him as an 
artistic forebear. The muralists saw, in his mass-produced images for non-elite 
audiences, a compatriot in their revolutionary struggle for a broad-based art 
that would define the needs and aspirations of a people. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it's impossible to read a consistent political position in Posada's 
prints. He poked fun at all strata of society, mocking narrow-mindedness 
wherever it appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many of the papers in which Posada's work was published were run by the 
government and subject to strict censorship. The politics of some of his 
pictures probably represents a balance between his own opinions and those of 
his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 He also appears to have been much more concerned with traditional religion 
than the muralists. A portrayal of Our Lady of Guadalupe is among his most 
elaborate prints. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bryce Bannatyne Gallery, 2439 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 396-9668, 
through June 18. Closed Mondays. * Empty Elegance: In the last five years, 
Claudia Matzko has made an impressive number of sculptures whose delicate 
beauty often takes your breath away. Ten new pieces at Angles Gallery 
disappoint because they do not live up to her earlier achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Matzko fashioned nearly invisible works out of map tacks, 
monofilament, sheets of glass, traces of evaporated water and cast shadows. 
Exceptionally fragile, these meticulously installed materials almost 
disappeared into their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before vanishing, however, they sent a sensual quiver of energy through 
your body's perceptual machinery, stimulating your eyes, resonating in your 
brain and echoing in your memory. Matzko's best sculptures seemed to put 
viewers in touch with intangibility itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Her precise art, which often had the presence of a science experiment, 
stripped abstraction of its spiritual residue, focusing instead on the poetry 
of empirical experience. Her new work replaces this eloquence with empty 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricated from more substantial materials, such as tooled steel, cast bronze, 
industrial-strength electronics, broken musical instruments and gallons of 
mineral oil, it lacks the charge of previous pieces and seems static, even 
clunky by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 A stadium light bulb whose cord is too short to reach the nearest socket has 
been suspended from the wall at eye level. If it were plugged in, it would 
blind you. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite wall, a series of hinges runs from the floor to the ceiling. 
Although they're meant to suggest that the wall can fold back, this idea never 
takes on physical force: The hinges merely look like a zipper or set of toy 
train tracks affixed to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Matzko's new sculptures bypass your eyes to appeal directly to your mind. They 
don't explore the activity of looking, but elide sensory experience in favor of 
engaging the imagination and triggering abstract associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Without its astute scrutiny of perception, Matzko's art loses its 
individuality and power. 
</P>
<P>
 * Angles Gallery, 2230 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 396-5019, through June 
11. Closed Sundays and Mondays. * Intimate Anonymity: Dan McCleary lures 
viewers into his images by keeping himself out of the picture. At Kohn Turner 
Gallery, poignancy stirs just beneath the surfaces of paintings, drawings and 
photographs that patiently probe the territory where intimacy meets anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The best painting is also the biggest. It depicts a woman waiting for an usher 
to tear her movie ticket. Nostalgia and romance are palpable in this seemingly 
insignificant ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Meaning resides in the details. The woman, whose back faces the viewer, stands 
unusually close to the usher. The tilt of her head and the angle of her eye 
suggest that she's giving him a pretty good looking over. His downward glance 
could be a bashful attempt to keep some distance between himself and her casual 
intrusiveness. Or, he might just be bored by his job and completely unaware of 
her gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleary's picture intimates that psychological worlds separate people whose 
bodies practically touch. Two other paintings, of a couple dancing and another 
lying on a bed, give vivid form to the emotional distance that can drift 
between individuals. The small still-lifes and portraits are less captivating 
but still possess some of the understated alienation of McCleary's more 
ambitious works. Ten color photographs serve as studies or sketches, freezing 
saleswomen at a cosmetic counter, a stranger at a bus stop, a couple hugging 
and two men absorbed in conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Precedents for McCleary's paintings include Edward Hopper's stark depictions 
of urban isolation, Alex Katz's chilling portrayals of high-class vacuousness 
and Eric Fischl's uneasy images of suburban sexuality. More placid, restrained 
and subdued than these, McCleary's art is suffused by a touch of warmth, 
suggesting that withdrawal and distance provide their own security and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kohn Turner Gallery, 9006 Melrose Ave., (310) 271-4453, through June 28. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays. * Natural Progression: At Kiyo Higashi Gallery, a 
pair of previously unexhibited collages and five rarely seen paintings from the 
early 1960s neatly trace the rapid, step-by-step progression that led to Larry 
Bell's signature glass cubes, which secured his reputation as a founding member 
of the Light and Space group. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1963, Bell has worked often with cubes, varying the size of his 
sculptures, refining his high-tech craftsmanship and playing with the ways 
different types of vacuum-coated glass catch and reflect light. 
</P>
<P>
 To viewers familiar only with the cubes that have become synonymous with 
Bell's name, his early shaped canvases and collages come as a surprise. In 
retrospect, they make perfect sense. This small, well-selected survey concisely 
illustrates Bell's early movement away from the flatness of abstract painting 
and toward the three-dimensionality of actual space. 
</P>
<P>
 In the collages, bits of broken glass look like charming little pictures of 
clear skies. In the flat, hard-edged acrylic paintings, positive and negative 
space flip back and forth as silhouettes of cubes seem to describe volumes or 
merely outline six-sided shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's biggest jump occurs in "Ghost Box," a shaped painting that frames a 
central window of mirrored and sand-blasted sheets of glass. From here, it's 
easy to see where the cubes came from. 
</P>
<P>
 They're basically paintings that have been taken off the wall and had their 
stretcher bars deepened until they became armatures for the cubes. This taut 
exhibition captures the youthful, experimental component of Bell's oeuvre , 
when discovery outweighed refinement and loose ends had not been eliminated in 
favor of highly focused reductions. 
</P>

 The long line outside Stigmata may suggest that folks wish to partake in the 
club's activities, which continue until 4 a.m. Inside, however, nobody appears 
to be having much fun. The Friday night club at the Probe in Hollywood seems to 
be locked in a creepy warp, circa '85.Although the '80s -- shudder -- are 
already inching their way back into vogue, Stigmata reflects a period that 
surely no one willingly wants to recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys wear frowns and tights, gals wear Siouxsie & the Banshees 
makeup-by-numbers. Fights break out over requests to bum a cigarette by people 
who don't appear to be 18 -- the required age to get inside the cavernous, 
two-level club. Those who aren't dressed to depress appear just as exquisitely 
bored as their black-clad brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 The deejays' music, which focuses primarily on new wave and industrial, isn't 
inventive enough to breathe much life into the club, though a recent set's 
sandwiching of Revolting Cocks' industrial version of Rod Stewart's "Da Ya 
Think I'm Sexy?" between some prerequisite Nine Inch Nails and Siouxsie gave 
the scene a momentary shot in the arm.

THEATER REVIEW; 'POTESTAD': POWERFUL VIEW OF POWERLESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A knock at the door, a flash of paperwork, and a child is taken away -- never 
to be heard from again. No explanations, no resistance, no right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We take our civil liberties so much for granted that it's hard enough to 
imagine life under a regime like the military junta that ruled Argentina from 
1976 to 1983, in which such disappearances were an everyday occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Potestad," a devastating one-act by Argentine psychiatrist turned 
actor-playwright Eduardo Pavlovsky, takes us even further into this alien 
territory, exploring the psychological consequences for a population victimized 
by totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Grounding the nightmare alienation of Beckett in an all-too-factual social 
context, Pavlovsky's is an urgent voice that deserves attention in any language 
(the piece was previously presented by Stages Theatre Center in Spanish and 
French). Now, thanks to Paul Verdier's finely nuanced adaptation, 
English-speaking audiences can follow the play's mental labyrinths of 
self-delusion, humiliation, and ultimate helplessness in the face of absolute 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a journey impossible to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potestad" (whose loose translation "Paternity" belies the title's complex 
associations -- both familial and political -- of power and authority) is 
primarily a monologue about a "disappeared" child recited by her adopted father 
(Joe Spano), a nameless doctor who recognized too late his paralyzing illusion 
that "these things only happen to others." 
</P>
<P>
 His confession follows the elliptical path of truths too painful to reveal all 
at once. Working slowly inward from the most impersonal physical details, and 
punctuated with often humorous digressions, his narrative brings us at last to 
the harrowing afternoon when the authorities arrived to seize his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Most chilling of all is his reaction to the official who appeared at his door 
-- not a thug, but a "classy guy" radiating compassion and total understanding. 
"I was so terribly moved that I felt like embracing him," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching his daughter glide out the door in an air of harmony, even intimacy, 
the doctor's own seduction by the human face of fascism is evident. In the end, 
there's no mistaking the full depths of his own complicity -- a warning to us 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a taut laser beam of a performance, Spano carefully doles out each 
revelation with weighted eloquence amid director Tony Abatemarco's sparse 
staging, in which every gesture is a precious, telling commodity. Leslie Neale 
is a haunting, enigmatic presence as the nearly silent Tita to whom the doctor 
pours out what's left of his soul.  
</P>
<P>
 While abstract presentation that leaves so much to the viewer's interpretation 
often runs the risk of emotional distancing, the effect here is quite the 
reverse -- as Pavlovsky puts it, it's when we try to make connections ourselves 
that the full magnitude of human tragedy reveals itself. 
</P>
<P>

CERRITOS CENTER UNVEILS ITS 3RD-SEASON PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and singing 
hoofer Liza Minnelli highlight the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts' 
eclectic third season, being announced today by center officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley MacLaine will kick off the 1994-1995 season on Sept. 16. Also among 
the 41 groups and performers coming to the center are concerts by Neville 
Marriner with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in its only Southern 
California appearance, the Vienna Symphony and a recital by soprano Leontyne 
Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet star Julio Bocca with Ballet Argentino -- making its United States 
debut -- a touring ensemble with eight principal dancers from New York City 
Ballet and the traditional Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company of China headline the 
center's dance offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Newman, Johnny Cash, Little Richard, the Chieftains, Art Garfunkel and 
Tony Bennett top an expanded pop menu. 
</P>
<P>
 In theater, the 18-month-old facility will present the national touring 
production of "Fiddler on the Roof," starring Theodore Bikel, and the L.A.-area 
premiere of a national touring production of "Barrymore," a play based on the 
late veteran actor John Barrymore's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The RSC's presentation, a U.S. premiere, will incorporate sections of the 
second and third parts of Shakespeare's "Henry VI" trilogy and is subtitled 
"The Battle for the Throne," a center spokeswoman said. The RSC and the Royal 
Philharmonic appearances are part of UK/LA 1994, a regional British arts 
festival slated for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Center general manager Victor Gotesman, who has vowed to lead rather than 
follow the community's tastes, on Wednesday characterized the new season's 
programming as "very mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said in a phone interview, "we're still building our foundation and 
vision for the center" and educating a community "that's never had a performing 
arts center. . . . We will eventually have more adventurous programming on the 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 (One potentially challenging work, Philip Glass' 4 1/2-hour opera "Einstein on 
the Beach," which Gotesman had tried to book, turned out to be too expensive, 
he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the center's current season, which completed its first full 
season on May 15 -- it opened with an abbreviated season in early 1993 -- will 
not be available until July, Gotesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total budget of $8.3 million for the coming fiscal year has been submitted 
to the Cerritos City Council, which is expected to chip in $2 million, as it 
has annually, to bridge the expected gap between expenses and revenues, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance figures are not ready either, but the number of days that the 
facility was occupied last season by performances or with technical 
preparations was 135, Gotesman said. That figure is expected to rise to 179 or 
more in the season ahead, he said, as other productions are booked.

JAZZ REVIEW; WECKL QUINTET EXPLODES AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drummer Dave Weckl, who had longtime success working with Chick Corea, opened 
Tuesday at Catalina. He's such an explosive percussionist that some of his 
solos suggest orchestrated thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 His quintet, playing mostly original material, is a tightly knit unit that 
seems to substitute energy for elegance and rhythmic convolution for melodic 
innovation. The standout sideman, without question, is John Patitucci. Equally 
brilliant on upright bass, electric bass and bass guitar, he left the upright 
home on this occasion because the group's character doesn't call for it. 
Nevertheless, he was in superlative form, particularly in a feature number that 
had a haunting raga-like quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tavaglione is the other key player, using various saxophones and an 
electronic wind instrument that was effectively employed on a West 
African-influenced tune called "Afrique." Two keyboard players, Dave Goldblatt 
and Jay Oliver, complete the group, adding their sounds to a powerful, 
tension-building ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 If the quintet has a fault, it's the excessive use of repetition of the theme. 
The riffs are satisfactory up to a point, but then comes the point of too many 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave Weckl Quintet at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga, Hollywood, 
(213) 466-2210. Two sets nightly at 9:15 and 11 through Sunday. $12 door charge 
($15 Saturday) plus two-drink minimum.

JAZZ NOTES: LEADER MULGREW MILLER PUTS PIANO IN THE FOREGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While he's made numerous performance visits to Los Angeles, when Mulgrew 
Miller opens a six-night stand Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill, it will be the 
acclaimed, appealing pianist's first trip to Southern California as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "After so many years of gaining experience, you finally get to the point where 
you have confidence in yourself to do it," says Miller, 38, who has been a 
sideman with Art Blakey, Betty Carter and Tony Williams from 1983 to 1993, when 
he started leading a trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted this major step to be a natural, evolutionary one. I was in no 
hurry, there was no big publicity program to push me as a leader," he says in a 
conversation from his home in Easton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 At Catalina Bar & Grill, Miller will head up a threesome featuring Tony Reedus 
(drums) and Richie Goods (bass). Touring in support of a new Novus release, 
"With Our Own Eyes," Miller says that he decided he wanted to work without a 
horn because the piano itself is an "orchestra." "The trio allows me more 
possibilities to explore the instrument," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On "With Our Own Eyes," Miller demonstrates that he has developed into one of 
jazz's foremost pianists. Performing selections that include the gliding 
"Words," the perky "New Wheels" and the somewhat edgy "Somewhere Else," he 
mixes garlands of melody with more angular remarks, resulting in a style that 
is eminently listenable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel my playing has become smoother and more fluid as time goes on, though 
I don't intend to smooth it into oblivion," the pianist observes. "Still, I 
have made a conscientious effort to physically refine my playing, develop a 
smoother touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller feels that jazz musicians are in an interesting position, for, in an 
ideal case, their wares offer listeners a provocative mixture of art and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of entertainment as something that takes you away from yourself, 
while art challenges you to become more aware of yourself in relation to 
something that's going on at that point in time," he says. "So part of the 
philosophy of the jazz artist is to challenge the audience to meet us on that 
ground, where we're not necessarily making you comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, though a youthful veteran of the jazz business, is still not getting 
the visibility of such younger stars as trumpeter Roy Hargrove or pianist Benny 
Green. That's OK, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any bitterness with regards to the success of the younger 
players, though I do feel record companies have been remiss in their handling 
of some of the more veteran and experienced players," he says. "But the bottom 
line is that I play music for the love of it, and none of that other stuff 
really matters. I believe in the power of the music. If the music is really 
strong, then all of the good things will happen because of that strength." 
Information: (213) 466-2210.

<P>
 Heart Attack Fells Guitarist: Sonny Sharrock, regarded as one of the most 
adventurous of modern guitarists, died unexpectedly of a heart attack May 26 at 
his home in Ossining, N.Y. He was 53. Sharrock, who recorded with Pharoah 
Sanders, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Mann and Material, worked outside the standard 
jazz style, eschewing linear solos in exchange for gritty, often stunning sonic 
bombast. He began recording as a soloist in 1969, and his most recent Axiom 
album, "Ask the Ages," which featured Sanders, received critical acclaim. 
Sharrock was on the verge of signing his first major label deal, with RCA, at 
the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choices: Boney James will represent the entertainment aspect of jazz, 
while the B Sharp Jazz Quartet will stand for the art side at a free concert 
Sunday at 1:30 p.m. at Santa Monica College's Corsair Field. Sponsored by the 
Playboy Jazz Festival, the event also features Cecilia Noel and the Wild Clams 
and Ernestine Anderson. Information: (310) 449-4070. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned master Harold Land, the delightful tenor saxophonist, holds forth 
tonight and Saturday at the Club Brasserie in West Hollywood, (310) 854-1111, 
while the powerful younger tenorman Chuck Manning appears as part of the L.A. 
Jazz Quartet on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Pedrini Music in Alhambra, (213) 
283-1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Brazilian sounds won't want to miss the wondrous Dori Caymmi, who 
makes a rare local appearance tonight and Saturday at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, 
(818) 986-2662.

THEATER BEAT: AIDS IN THE FAMILY IN 'MIJO' AT NOHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mijo," the title of Michael Kearns' new drama at Noho Studios, is the 
Americanization of mi hijo, Spanish for "my son." The phrase can also be used 
as a term of endearment among friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by Artists Confronting AIDS, the play dramatizes the confrontation 
between the mother of a young man dying of AIDS and that man's longtime friend 
and lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen (Laura James) has been nursing her son Juan through his agonizingly 
protracted illness. Michael (Jay Arlen Jones), Juan's longtime sex buddy and 
pal, has been ill himself and hasn't seen Juan in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Michael is horrified to learn that the offstage Juan -- now blind, deaf 
and completely bedridden -- has been in a state of persistent agony for weeks. 
An angel of death in black leather, Michael persuades Carmen to help nature 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 This dramatically ripe situation yields many genuinely moving moments -- as 
well as a few frustrations. Kearns' play disorients from the outset when 
Michael, a stranger to Carmen, enters Juan's apartment spouting a blue streak 
of nasty talk that should send Carmen scurrying to dial 911. Granted, Carmen 
feebly brandishes a baseball bat for a moment, but her quick acceptance of 
Michael's outrageous behavior is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen may not use that baseball bat, but director Alec Doyle does, beating 
the audience over the head with the emotional content of the piece. The actors 
rant at one another in operatically grand style, frequently substituting 
stridency for subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 A situation this fraught with drama doesn't require over-the-top histrionics 
to put the point across. When playwright, actors and director settle into the 
mellower, more mystical elements of the piece, the audience finally experiences 
unassailable emotion, honestly come by. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: 'REALITY' SHOWS WRITER'S PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the decade after their college graduation, four idealistic women find they 
have to scale back their dreams of world conquest to make room for "Reality and 
Other Nightmares." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly uncharted territory -- there aren't many surprises in this amiable but 
slight new play by Victoria Karess that owes more than a passing nod to Wendy 
Wasserstein's generational chronicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Implicitly acknowledging its genre, the production at Theatre Geo features 
Wendie Jo Sperber (recently seen in Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic?" at the 
Pasadena Playhouse) at the top of her outrageous, caustic and neurotic form as 
the incurable flirt who forsakes her passion for publishing to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Content with an episodic structure of four loosely interlocking stories that 
never really coalesce, the play deals predictably with familiar modern dilemmas 
(career choices, sexual orientation, parental domination, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 But a willingness to poke fun at itself helps "Reality" sidestep the overly 
precious self-importance that often undermines Wasserstein's introspective 
works.  
</P>
<P>
 Deborah LaVine's lively, slapstick-filled direction steers her appealing cast 
through their turbulent crises with considerable charm. And Karess' obvious 
flair for smart, hilarious dialogue holds great promise, although this 
embryonic effort hasn't gotten beyond mistaking lifestyles for lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, neither has our entire culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Reality and Other Nightmares," Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland, Hollywood.

THEATER BEAT: ENGAGING ACTORS IN FLAWED 'PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Gramercy Park Is Closed to the Public," at the Hudson, has a sweetly 
ingenuous quality, as if a young schoolgirl had opened her personal diary for 
our perusal. Unfortunately, the play also contains florid plot twists more 
appropriate to a daytime soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Ann Johnson, who wrote the play, also appears as Luna, the offspring of a 
biracial marriage, caught between two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 After her white boyfriend is killed in a senseless incident on the subway, 
Luna gives birth to his child, opens a small health club, and begins getting 
back to her black roots, much to the delight of her proudly black grandma 
(Vivian Smallwood). 
</P>
<P>
 Luna's star-crossed relationship with a white cop, Neil (James Dumont), 
culminates in the shooting of an impoverished black youth (Damian Cagnolatti), 
a tragedy for which both Luna and Neil blame themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's characters relate their feelings a bit too glibly, and the various 
crises, particularly the death of the near-saintly youth, seem forced. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors are engaging, particularly Smallwood as the feisty grandmother, but 
their efforts cannot ultimately redeem Johnson's well-intentioned but faulty 
dramaturgy. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 10 REASONS TO CELEBRATE PREGO'S 10TH; RESTAURANTS: IN A CITY 
GLUTTED WITH ITALIAN CUISINE, WHERE MOST ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE THE LONGEVITY OF 
ROCK 'N' ROLL BANDS, THE BEVERLY HILLS EATERY IS STILL COOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 10 years now, Prego has done the steady, prosperous business most 
restaurateurs only dream about. Lunch and dinner, the rooms fill with 
customers, the kitchen clinks and clatters, the staff moves briskly, food and 
wine flow. In a city glutted with Italian cuisine, where most establishments 
have the longevity of rock 'n' roll bands, one can't help but wonder what makes 
Prego cook, year after year, despite both recession and dramatically increased 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 I made some visits recently, with a varied assortment of companions, and what 
I found were both general and specific reasons that this cafe flourishes: 10 
good reasons, as it were, to celebrate Prego's 10th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Whether I came in by myself, as part of a couple or a group, with or 
without reservations, we were always greeted promptly and warmly -- no 
attitude, no edge -- and seated as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Prego's brick-walled dining rooms predate much contemporary restaurant 
design, and while they may seem tame by today's standards, these rooms are also 
classic: Booths and banquettes are especially comfortable, the art tasteful, 
the flower arrangements grand. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The service tends to be excellent. Waiters not only take their work 
seriously, they actually appear to enjoy it. At one ladies' lunch, we ordered 
course after course and shared it all. We were constantly supplied with clean 
cutlery and plates; our drinks were replenished; our every little need -- move 
this, more bread, coffee, please -- cheerfully met. When I thanked our very 
patient waiter, he said, "Oh, that was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 4) Prego functions like a practical European cafe and, as such, has that 
rare-in-L.A. capacity to make the lone diner feel completely at home. On the 
other hand, a large group of us had no trouble having a festive, celebratory 
dinner -- all of which is to say that Prego's hospitality has range. 
</P>
<P>
 5) If you do have to wait for a table, or if you want to smoke, or if you just 
want to stop in for a drink and a few bread sticks, or an espresso and a peek 
at the latest Abitare, the bar is pleasant indeed. Bartenders are affable and 
generous and there's a great selection of reading material. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Prego's wood oven has probably been around as long as any other in town and 
clearly, cooks have mastered its use: Breads and pizzas are terrific. Soft, 
chewy, hot pane, baked to order, is fragrant with rosemary, drizzled with olive 
oil. An amusing appetizer for the table or a varied individual meal, pizza 
mista , a long, almost rectangular pie, has four different topping zones: 
pesto, mushrooms and artichokes, tomato and basil, and roasted peppers. But the 
Rustica, with smoked mozzarella and prosciutto, is my unabashed favorite. 
Prosciutto, after a brief stint in the wood-burning oven, acquires the 
wondrously smoke-haunted flavor usually only found in bacon pan-fried over a 
High Sierra campfire.  
</P>
<P>
 7) Starters are one of Prego's longest suits. Try grilled shrimp served 
chilled in a lime and mint vinaigrette with slices of creamy, fresh feta or a 
selection of marinated, grilled fresh vegetables. Great hot appetizers include 
a big bowl of mussels and clams in brodo , and a large plate with grilled hunks 
of radicchio, eggplant, a huge portobello mushroom and grilled bundles of 
prosciutto filled with soft, hot goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 8) No waiter volunteers this information, but ask about the night's selection 
of rotisserie-cooked meats. If available, pounce on the half-chicken; the thigh 
pops with juice when touched with a fork. 
</P>
<P>
 9) While there are specific dishes that will bring me back to Prego again and 
again, it should also be said that the food in general is just plain good. 
Portions are generous, ingredients absolutely fresh, and the seasonal menu 
always holds a few surprises.  
</P>
<P>
 10) Finally, Prego's prices remain reasonable. Very reasonable. After the 
quality of food and service, I am invariably stunned by the bill -- pleasantly 
so.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's to Prego's next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prego 362 N. Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 277-7346. Open for lunch 
Monday-Saturday, dinner seven days. Full bar. Valet parking. American Express,

MUSIC REVIEW; PACIFIC SYMPHONY ENDS SEASON WITH NOISY DESI ARNAZ TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A brief contemporary novelty, a standard violin concerto and, to close, a 
rousing, proto-Romantic repertory staple. Such was Carl St.Clair's 
season-ending program for his Pacific Symphony: Michael Daugherty's brief but 
noisy "Desi," the familiar Mendelssohn Violin Concerto and Berlioz's equally 
well-worn "Symphonie Fantastique." 
</P>
<P>
 In the event, Wednesday night in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center (scheduled to be repeated Thursday), this agenda, though 
hardly ground-breaking, emerged splendidly played and carefully paced. It 
became a tribute to the reliable, growing skills of the orchestra, and to 
St.Clair's persuasive podium manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was much to admire: strong soloism from within the ensemble's ranks, 
dependable balances and instrumental niceties, single-minded attentiveness to 
the conductor's clear direction. 
</P>
<P>
 What seemed to be missing, then? In a layered probing of Berlioz's musical 
psyche, genuine gravity, the full range of emotional complexity, a sense of 
conflict between the musical materials. Transparent to a fault, what this 
otherwise convincing narrative lacked was the extra dimension of outside forces 
acting upon the storytelling: demons, negative spirits, the occult. Without 
such forces, what tends to dominate is the simply mundane -- as here. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly earthbound, though also handsomely rendered, violinist Kyoko 
Takezawa's debut appearance with the orchestra in the E-minor Concerto 
contained many beauties and emerged almost pristine in its clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 The young musician from Japan has everything she needs for this test-piece: 
solid technique, a full and resonant tone of great carrying power, a 
Mendelssohnian reserve and what seems to be -- not paradoxically -- a natural 
eloquence. St.Clair proved a considerate collaborator, though the orchestra 
often overplayed its hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Daugherty's 4 1/2-minute tribute to Desi Arnaz utilizes fewer than 30 players 
-- winds and percussion and string bass -- to produce a loud '40s-type dance 
band sound. It's not unpleasant or offensive, but it seems to have little 
substance beyond the "Cubana rhythms," as St.Clair called them. Surely 
Daugherty, an Iowan born in 1954, has written something of greater interest. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Guest concertmaster for this final pair on the "Classics" series -- the actual 
season-closers are two pops concerts tonight and Saturday featuring singer 
Davis Gaines and conducted by Richard Kaufman -- was Peter McHugh of 
Louisville, Ky.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT: ON LASER: CASE OF MISSING 'HOLMES' FOOTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be wonderful to report that the Image Entertainment release of Billy 
Wilder's "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" ($60) is the 1970 film as the 
co-writer/director originally intended it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it is not. But it is as close as we are likely to come in the 
foreseeable future, unless Holmes himself unearths the original roadshow 
edition shot by the fabled director but never released by United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 What Image's laser wizards have done, however, is reassemble as closely as 
possible a glimpse of what might have been had the studio kept faith with the 
director of "Some Like It Hot" and "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 The original "Private Life . . . ," written by Wilder and longtime 
collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, was a two-hour, 45-minute exploration of the 
previously untold private life of Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary master of 
deductive reasoning. Wilder said that he designed the film as a symphony in 
four movements, structured around a prologue in which Dr. Watson's grandson 
discovers four of his grandfather's unpublished stories from 221-B Baker St. 
</P>
<P>
 One of many road-show films that dotted the late '60s to lure "Laugh-In" and 
"Welby" couch potatoes into theaters for "event" movies, it had the misfortune 
to follow several failed events ("Star!," "Paint Your Wagon"), and so the 
studio hacked it down to two hours and five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 What was trimmed was the prologue and two cases that helped reveal what Wilder 
intended as "a serious study of Holmes," an attempt to explain the cerebral, 
ascetic "dope addict" and "misogynist." Starring as Holmes is Robert Stephens 
(Wilder's original choice was Peter O'Toole) and Colin Blakely (Peter Sellers 
was the original choice for the good doctor). 
</P>
<P>
 The missing elements are diabolically frustrating. First, the producers of the 
two-disc laser found the video of the missing "The Dreadful Business of the 
Naked Honeymooners" but not the audio track. The clever reconstruction includes 
the video with subtitled dialogue from one of the found original scripts. As 
such, it's a chance for true interactivity for aspiring thespians and Holmes 
fans: Just assign the parts to viewers in your living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the producers found only the audio of the second missing sequence, "The 
Curious Case of the Upside Down Room." No video was ever found. The audio alone 
is wonderfully effective, like listening to an old radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the missing pieces seem to come together to give us more than a 
hint of what Wilder originally had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The film itself, in a sharp digital film transfer using the original 2.35:1 
Panavision aspect ratio (annoying to those who hate large black borders and 
narrow video), is an enjoyable piece of work even in its abbreviated version. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmospheric Miklos Rozsa score can be heard without dialogue and sound 
effects since it has been isolated on the right digital and analog tracks. 
Music cue sheets also are included. Excellent liner notes detail Wilder's 
vision, from writing the film itself to using Rozsa's passionate Violin 
Concerto, Opus 24. The concerto, originally written for Jascha Heifitz, 
ultimately served as the skeleton around which the movie was fleshed out.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT: A $65-MILLION SALES JOB FOR 'JURASSIC' VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last video you'd expect to need a giant ad campaign is "Jurassic Park," 
the world box-office champ. You'd think that an ordinary campaign plus word of 
mouth would be enough to trigger stampedes to video outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it debuts on video Oct. 4, priced at $25, "Jurassic Park" will be 
supported by a whopping $65-million promotional and advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Overkill? A waste of ad dollars? Andrew Kairey, MCA/Universal's senior vice 
president of marketing and sales, doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is an easy sell," he said. "You have to make consumers aware of the 
tape and make it an attractive purchase." 
</P>
<P>
 This video, though, has to be the lock of the year in the video market. The 
betting is that "Jurassic," which will be routinely discounted to the $14-$15 
range, will gobble up the sales record of Disney's "Aladdin," which has topped 
24 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet video retailers are unhappy about one aspect of MCA/Universal's 
promotional plan -- a tie-in with McDonald's. Starting Nov. 18, by making a 
purchase at the hamburger outlet, you can buy for $6 one of four MCA/Universal 
videos: "The Land Before Time," "An American Tail: Fievel Goes West," "Back to 
the Future" or "Field of Dreams." Each tape will include a $2.50 mail-in rebate 
on a "Jurassic Park" video. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers simply don't want McDonald's meddling in the video business. Not 
only is a tape sold at a fast-food outlet money out of their pockets, it also 
primes consumers for further purchases at such restaurants, rather than video 
stores. And the low price undercuts the retailers, prompting fears that 
customers will balk at paying the average store cost of $15-$20 for a video. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal's Kairey defends the rebate deal, arguing that it sends 
consumers back to video stores. "They have to purchase the ("Jurassic Park") 
tape at a retail store, which increases traffic at the retail level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns are in on "The Return of Jafar," Disney's direct-to-video 
sequel to "Aladdin." The company reports that nearly 5 million of the 8 million 
units shipped were sold in the first week. Consumers were obviously responding 
to the ads and ignoring the negative reviews. . . . MCA/Universal is following 
in Disney's footsteps with a direct-to-video sequel to its 1988 animated 
feature "The Land Before Time." The tape, "The Land Before Time: Great Valley 
Adventure," is due Dec. 27 at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the Jackie Onassis tapes is A&E's documentary "Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis," priced at $20. . . . The market is jammed with tapes that are the 
video equivalent of elevator music, but "Coral Sea Dreaming" is much better 
than the norm. It features gorgeous visuals of the Great Barrier Reef 
accompanied by an intriguing score. From Small World Music for $30, (800) 
757-2277. . . . Cabin Fever Entertainment has just put out four new Laurel and 
Hardy titles at $10 each: "Scram!," "Their First Mistake," "Towed in a Hole" 
and "Twice Two." . . . On June 15, CBS-Fox will put out, at $15, "Dream Team 
II," showcasing the NBA players on the team participating in the world 
basketball championships in Toronto Aug. 4-14.

 Portable CD players are a lot more attractive these days. The hot models are 
equipped with anti-shock memory buffers, which cut down on sound skipping that 
happens when the machine is moved around. These machines, which had been 
retailing in the $300 range, are selling as low as $150 -- from Sony and 
Sanyo/Fisher. Also, more companies, such as Kenwood and Panasonic, have 
introduced models this year. Two more have joined the bandwagon. Aiwa has a 
$190 model coming next month and Magnavox has one, priced at $219, due in early 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Short Cuts" (Columbia TriStar). For about three hours, co-writer/director 
Robert Altman weaves together myriad mini-dramas about unhappy Californians, 
featuring a star-studded cast including Andie MacDowell, Robert Downey Jr. and 
Madeleine Stowe. The film earned Altman an Oscar nomination for best director. 
If you prefer movies with linear story lines and few subplots, you'll likely 
have a hard time getting into this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firecreek" (Warner, $30). An excellent but often overlooked 1968 Western 
about a kindly sheriff (James Stewart) battling a gang of bad guys, with Henry 
Fonda playing the chief villain. FILMS ON VIDEO 
</P>
<P>
 Recent films coming out on video: HBO/Savoy's "Shadowlands," featuring Anthony 
Hopkins and Debra Winger, is due July 13. Also: "Wayne's World 2" and "My Life" 
(Wednesday); "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" (June 14); "The Getaway," "Dangerous 
Game" and "The Air Up There" (June 15); "Six Degrees of Separation," "Geronimo: 
An American Legend," "Tombstone" and "Gunmen" (June 22); "The Pelican Brief," 
"Philadelphia," "In the Name of the Father" and "Iron Will" (June 29); "Grumpy 
Old Men," "Sugar Hill," "House Party 3," and "Romeo Is Bleeding" (July 6);

VALLEY-AREA COLLEGE NOTEBOOK; CLU COMES AWAY EMPTY IN BASEBALL

 For the third straight year, the Cal Lutheran baseball season ended in 
disappointing fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Kingsmen blew a two-game lead in the best-of-five NCAA Division 
III West Regional against UC San Diego.The previous two years, Cal Lutheran 
reached the Division III World Series as the No. 1-seeded team only to come 
away empty. Cal Lutheran lost in the championship game in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very disappointing, but I don't think anything can take the place of 
a game in which you have a chance to win the national championship," said 
first-year Coach Marty Slimak, who was an assistant in '92 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (31-9-1) lost the fifth game against UC San Diego by blowing a 
5-2 lead in the seventh inning. The keys to the Tritons' six-run inning were an 
error by shortstop Ed Castillo and a misplay by pitcher Marc Weiss that was 
ruled an error, then a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLU's problem throughout the series was pitching depth, or lack thereof. Sam 
Arroyo (3.46 earned-run average during the regional) and Weiss (2.31) pitched 
well, but the rest of the staff had a 9.13 ERA. 
</P>

 Track and field: When Isaiah Mustafa of Moorpark finished second in the 
decathlon with a school record of 6,722 points in the state championships at 
Cerritos College last month, it marked the fifth year in a row that a Raider 
athlete had finished among the top five in that event. Mustafa was the 
runner-up in last year's championships with 6,417 points. Previous Moorpark 
placers were Jeff Ingalls (third in '92 with 6,241), Jerry Edwards (fifth in 
'91 with 6,489) and Gil Carillo (fifth in '90 with 6,359).

TAFT'S MANN FINALLY FALTERS IN TENSE, WELL-PLAYED MATCH; CITY TENNIS: ROBERT 
WILLIAMS OF DORSEY WINS SINGLES CHAMPIONSHIP IN STIRRING BATTLE BETWEEN 
SOPHOMORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was as if Taft High's Dylan Mann and Dorsey's Robert Williams simply stared 
at each other for 2 hours 25 minutes in the City Section Individual singles 
final Thursday at the Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Until one of them finally flinched. 
</P>
<P>
 In a powerful, often spectacular, practically errorless three-set battle 
between two 10th-graders, Mann finally let his guard down. 
</P>
<P>
 He did so at a most inopportune time -- leading by two points and needing only 
two more to win the third-set tiebreaker while serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Williams charged back to win the final four points for a 7-6 (7-3), 
2-6, 7-6 (7-5) victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a match like this in a long time, but I wanted this bad," 
Williams said. "Dorsey has gone to the finals many times, but they never win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing tough. I was on today." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, 15, made him earn every point -- which might have surprised Williams, 
16, who had beaten Mann, 6-2, 6-2, in an age-group tournament earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams said he knew Mann had improved and expected a battle. He got one. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann broke Williams' first service in the first set and led, 4-1, before 
Williams clawed back to force the first tiebreaker. Mann dominated the second 
set and closed it out by rifling four consecutive service winners that appeared 
to have Williams reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really made me angry that I let him back in in the first set," Mann said. 
"I got fired up in the second set. We were both intense in the third set." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players held serve in the final set until Mann, down 4-3, committed an 
uncharacteristic double fault, then hit a forehand long, giving Williams a 
break and a 5-3 lead. Williams could have served out the match there. But Mann 
refused to wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got fired up again," Mann said. "I wasn't going down then. I had been out 
on that court too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mann regained the momentum when he forced the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann trailed, 3-2, in the tiebreaker but scored the next three points on an 
overhand smash, a backhand slice to the baseline and a hard forehand that tied 
up Williams at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mann hit a lob wide on the next point, put a backhand return into the net 
and hit a forehand long. Suddenly, Williams led, 6-5, and was serving for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams served hard to the corner and raced to the net while Mann retreated 
to make a return. The return floated over the net and Williams spiked it. 
</P>
<P>
 Game, set, match, championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came up big on all those points," Mann said. "He put balls at my ankles 
that I couldn't get over the net or he made me reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the ball well. At certain times I could have hit the ball better. I 
think I blew it in the first set. But you got to give him credit for coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams finished the season 17-0. Mann suffered his first loss in City 
competition after winning 15 matches, as well as all 12 sets he played in the

DIGEST: NECK INJURY FORCES HERNANDEZ TO MARLINS' 60-DAY DISABLED LIST 
</P>

<P>
 The Florida Marlins placed right-handed reliever Jeremy Hernandez on the 
60-day disabled list Thursday because of a herniated disk in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Cal State Northridge and Poly High player will undergo surgery 
Monday and is expected to be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been one of our main guys in our bullpen, but we've had a lot of 
injuries this season," Marlins' general manager Dave Dombrowski said. 
"Basically he has been our main saver out there at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 27, filled in for injured closer Bryan Harvey and had nine saves. 
Hernandez was 3-3 2.70 earned-run average in 23 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was acquired for Matt Turner in a trade with Cleveland before the 
season. Turner has since been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez played for Northridge from 1985-87. He won 21 games and holds the 
school record for career starts with 43. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Gary Matthews and pitcher Ray Rivera of Mission College have been 
named to the California junior college All-American first team. Matthews was 
also selected to the All-State squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, a sophomore switch-hitter who signed with the San Diego Padres last 
week, batted .392 with nine home runs and 44 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, a freshman right-hander who was voted the most valuable player in the 
Southern California Athletic Conference, was 12-3 with a 2.78 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Glendale College players, shortstop Randy Vickers and center fielder Bryan 
Warner, were named to the All-American second team. Vickers batted .374 with 13 
home runs and 45 RBIs, and Warner batted .352 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood baseball Coach Rick Pally resigned his coaching position 
Wednesday, according to Dave Smith, assistant principal in charge of athletics 
at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for the position are now being accepted. The Huskies finished 
7-18 overall and 1-16 in the East Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley outfielder Will Skett signed a letter of intent to play at Long Beach 
State. Skett, from Reseda High, said he turned down an offer from Oklahoma 
because he wanted to stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like both programs equally, but I feel like I'm more of a dirtbag," Skett 
said, referring to the 49ers' self-chosen nickname. "My personality is more 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Skett hit .353 with five home runs, 32 RBIs and 15 stolen bases for the 
Monarchs. JEFF FLETCHER

 Although UCLA-bound Josh Morton hit his second home run in as many American

California freshman standout Keith Evans, visiting Las Virgenes still fell, 
3-1, to West Hills Thursday.

 Evans (0-1), who is leaving Saturday to play in a Cape Cod summer league, gave 
up three runs on seven hits in five innings, striking out six and walking two

 West Hills (2-0) was paced by Brandon Gray (two for three, one run batted in,

A NEW KIND OF KARAOKE; IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PRICEY BAR SCENE, KOREAN NORAE 
BANG LETS YOU BELT OUT SONGS IN ALCOHOL-FREE PRIVATE ROOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Lights dimmed, disco diamond ball spinning overhead, Sang and Connie Han 
slouch in a sofa in a small room equipped with a console TV, wall-mounted 
speakers and a tambourine. The couple pores over a fat binder stuffed with song 
titles in several languages. Moments later, she punches a code on the digital 
remote, grabs a high-powered mike and then sings her heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoa . . . my love, my darlin', I need your love . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Valley Norae Bang, a Korean-style, non-alcohol version of the 
popular karaoke bar. Norae bang literally means "singing room" in Korean, and 
there are a dozen of them to pick from in this strip-mall establishment in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 These rent-by-the-hour rooms, also known as music studios or karaoke boxes, 
are the latest in the high-tech karaoke boom. Laser-disc machines deliver to 
private rooms thousands of prerecorded hits, minus the main vocal tracks, 
accompanied by MTV-like videos that display lyrics on the screen for the singer 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm crazy about music," says Connie Han, a nurse at Olive View-UCLA Medical 
Center in Sylmar. Han, 40, says she visits Valley Norae Bang about once a 
month, usually with several other nurses after a long day's work. "This is how 
I relieve stress." On this Saturday evening, Han dropped by with her husband 
for an hour of after-dinner entertainment. "It's good for learning English 
songs," Han adds. "You need the lyrics to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wholesome fun," says Eun Ju Jeong, 23, a student at Valley College who 
comes about twice a week with a group of friends, spending an hour or two each 
time. At $20 an hour, Jeong says, it's not that expensive when split several 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a little prodding might accomplish what many fear of doing in front of 
strangers in a bar. And for the not-so-shy singer, the wait to perform will 
probably be much shorter than in karaoke clubs, where drinks are often pricey. 
This is not a problem at the music studios because they don't serve alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geared more to the family," says Won Tae Kim, owner of Valley Norae 
Bang, which is on Van Nuys Boulevard just south of Sherman Way. Kim says on 
most nights he can hear voices from three generations of Korean-American 
families -- grandparents crooning syrupy folk ballads, parents singing 
baby-boomer classics in English and Korean, and kids belting out tunes like 
"B-I-N-G-O." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for children's birthday parties," says Kim's wife, Soon Won. "We 
even supply the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kims, who have two small children and live in Northridge, opened the 
business 18 months ago, and theirs is the only one of its kind in the San 
Fernando Valley. But more than 30 other Korean music studios have mushroomed in 
the Southland in the last couple of years, making their way to cities such as 
Los Angeles, New York and Washington after sweeping Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The big cluster of Korean music studios on the West Coast is in Koreatown. 
Rosen Music Studio at 8th Street and South Hobart Boulevard boasts the most 
rooms -- 24 of them on two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular establishment, Recital Norae Bang at Wilshire Boulevard and 
Wilton Place, claims its largest room, at $50 an hour, can hold a party of up 
to 30 people. None of these, however, is quite as elaborate as the music 
studios in Asia, where some spew thick mist around singers, and others are 
designed with a theme, such as a Tarzan room painted with jungle flora. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Norae Bang is more of a beginner's music studio. With the notable 
exception of one larger room, which can squeeze in 15 to 20 people and costs 
$30 an hour, the rest are like small playrooms, comfortably fitting a 
half-dozen adults at an hourly rental rate of $20. Before 7 p.m. it's 
half-priced. And you can sing into the wee hours because it's open until 2 a.m. 
on weekdays and 4 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much inside the private rooms: a couch, a coffee table, 27-inch 
TV, a couple of mikes, a wall painting. But it's not like singing in your 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneer laser-disc equipment provides rich, high-fidelity acoustics, and 
even bad singers sound halfway decent because they get a little help from a 
mixing system that includes vocal enhancement technology, including 
reverberation and echo. The remote control also allows you to raise or lower 
the key, slowing or speeding up the song's tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 The digital technology provides instant access to several thousand songs. 
Valley Norae Bang's catalogue includes 2,000 titles in Korean, 1,500 in 
English, several hundred each in Chinese and Japanese, and 50 in Spanish. Most 
of the English songs are popular hits from the '60s to '80s, with plenty of 
Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and the Beatles. There's classic rock, disco, 
country, rap, even tunes from singers such as Judy Garland and Doris Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Each title has a code, and you can enter up to four songs at a time, which is 
recommended because once the bank is empty, it takes a couple of minutes for 
the computer in the lobby to restart the circuitry to load up a disc. The 
12-inch laser discs that play the musical tracks are accompanied by videos, 
which often flash images of beautiful women and handsome men doing such things 
as strolling in a park or cozying up near a fireplace. But some videos are 
hilarious, as in "My Way," which shows a man practicing his golf swing. All of 
which makes it tough to suppress laughter, even if you're trying to follow the 
lyrics that are highlighted at the speed at which you are supposed to sing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bit of amusement comes after each performance, when an on-screen 
scoring system ranks a singer from one to 100. But don't get alarmed; the 
scores are all arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Most go to music studios just to have fun. But David Choi, a Northridge 
businessman, sees other benefits in coming with his 11-year-old son, Steven, as 
Choi often does. "It's a good way to help him with his music education, which 
isn't all that strong in this country," Choi says. And it's not a bad way to 
reinforce family relations, Choi adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Choi, most of Valley Norae Bang's customers are Koreans who live in the 
San Fernando Valley. Certainly one reason few outside of the Korean community 
have found Valley Norae Bang is that it's hidden in the second level of a 
Korean-owned strip mall crowded with some two-dozen Korean shops. There's no 
English signage, and the Kims don't advertise except in Korean newspapers. (The 
business is listed in the phone book as Valley Music Studio.) 
</P>
<P>
 But owner Kim thinks there's also cultural reasons why few non-Koreans have 
visited. To many Koreans and other Asians, singing in front of groups, whether 
in a bar or private room or at school or church, is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, karaoke bars have long been popular to Japanese as well as Korean 
"salarymen" as places to unwind, gather with clients, friends or to just pass 
the night. Music studios grew rapidly in Japan in the late 1980s, partly 
because karaoke bars were prohibitively expensive and perhaps out of a yearning 
for privacy in a land where there isn't much. In a sense, music studios are 
simply family-oriented version of the karaoke bar, Kim says, and that is why 
they're popular in the United States -- at least to many Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim says non-Koreans occasionally come in to his shop, but appear more timid 
about picking up a mike. They tend rather to sing in groups, he says. "But they 
still say it's a lot of fun." WHERE AND WHEN

KEEPING THE FAITH; THE NEWSBOYS WILL BRING THEIR POP-ROCK CHRISTIAN SOUND TO 
THE STAGE WITH EVANGELIST LUIS PALAU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Pop music and Christianity haven't always enjoyed a harmonious relation ship. 
From Elvis to Lit tle Richard to the Beatles and beyond, rock 'n' roll at times 
has even been declared the Devil's music and cast into a convenient bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Which just leads musician Peter Furler to ask: "At what decibel does the devil 
come in?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian-born songwriter, drummer and producer has asked questions like 
this, but only half seriously. His band the Newsboys has devoted most of its 
career to playing music that mixes an alternative pop-rock sound with lyrics 
devoted to the Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the hip-hop act Limit X, the Newsboys will be the central musical 
entertainment Saturday for "Youth Night" of evangelist Luis Palau's five-day 
crusade at Birmingham High School Stadium in Van Nuys. Palau, an Argentina-born 
American who is the possible heir apparent to Billy Graham, presents a sermon 
during each day's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Palau celebrated Pat Boone's 60th birthday, and was joined 
by such performers as Smokey Robinson and Dean Jones. A choir was also on hand. 
But it's on Saturday that a newer generation of musicians demonstrates the 
strides made recently in Christian pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the central reasons for its broadening success, says publicist Velvet 
Rousseau of Starsong Records, is a new willingness by artists to cross into 
other genres. "There will always be the inspirational type of music," Rousseau 
said. "That's just traditional. But you've now got metal, you've got pop, 
country, techno. It's basically the same as mainstream music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newsboys sat in the Top 20 of Billboard's contemporary Christian album 
chart for more than 70 weeks with their last album, "Not Ashamed," and sold at 
least 200,000 copies. Not enough to earn a gold record, but a respectable 
number by most standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The crossover popularity of such gospel-pop singers as Amy Grant and Michael 
W. Smith has helped change old perceptions of Christian music and introduce it 
to new audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bob Dylan dabbled with some personal gospel music in the late '70s and 
early '80s, and soul master Al Green has committed himself to Christian themes 
for more than a decade. But it's been a slow process for most lesser-known 
artists, in spite of the work of such Christian rock acts as Stryper, White 
Heart and Petra. 
</P>
<P>
 But singer John James of the Newsboys insisted, "We don't lay awake on our 
beds at night wishing we could cross over. We just want to do good music." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he entered the genre, James, 30, had always thought of Christian music 
as something performed by "ladies in long flowing dresses, with tambourines, 
floating around the stage. . . . We didn't know Christian music could sound 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The band began its career in Australian pubs and clubs, singing originals and 
cover tunes, looking mainly to earn beer money and for the chance to meet 
girls. In those days, Christian music was far from their minds.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was brought up as a pastor's kid," Furler, 27, said. "So for many years I 
hated church." 
</P>
<P>
 Now most members of the five-person band are married, and questions of family 
and spirituality have begun emerging. Some of the Newsboys' material is taken 
from the Bible, while other songs offer positive messages on life and faith. 
"It's more about putting what's going on in our life to the music," Furler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the nighttime concert and sermon Saturday, a 10 a.m. "Rally in the 
Valley" is scheduled at Birmingham for schoolchildren, with a program to 
include a nearly 1,000-voice children's choir. On Sunday, the crusade concludes 
with an event that includes a performance by singer Leon Patillo, formerly of 
Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Baye, a spokesman for the Luis Palau Evangelistic Assn., is unsure how 
many will come Saturday. "We just hope that anybody interested in a spiritual 
pursuit or quest may consider coming, as well as those who might just want to 
be entertained." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Youth Night," Luis Palau San Fernando Valley Crusade, with performances 
by the Newsboys and Limit X.

 Al Viola's musical life has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist first gained renown working with pianist Page Cavanaugh's trio 
-- with whom he appeared from 1946 to 1949 and made three films, including 
"Romance on the High Seas," starring Doris Day and directed by Michael Curtiz 
(of "Casablanca" fame). 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling those '40s salad days, Viola says, "We were like the white Nat 
(King) Cole trio, but we were different in that we all sang." The third member 
of the trio was bassist Lloyd Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the veteran guitarist with the round, silky tone and spiffy execution 
appears again with Cavanaugh's trio, which he rejoined about five years ago. 
With Phil Mallory on bass now, the trio will perform Thursdays through 
Saturdays at JP's The Money Tree in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't sing anymore." Viola's blue eyes flash. "I'm over 70 years old, 
and I don't give a damn about singing," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist comes across as vital, enthusiastic, likable and unpretentious. 
A look at the mementos scattered around his Studio City dining room makes it 
evident that from his first days to today with Cavanaugh, the guitarist has had 
a wonderful whirl. 
</P>
<P>
 There are framed letters, such as the thank-you note from then-Sen. John F. 
Kennedy, then a photo of Viola with President John F. Kennedy -- the musician 
was performing at the White House with singer Julie London. And there are 
photos of the guitarist with Cavanaugh and with Frank Sinatra -- at the 
now-defunct Gilmore Field in Hollywood in the '50s, at the Great Pyramid of 
Giza in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola, a native of Brooklyn, ultimately became one of Los Angeles' most 
reliable studio performers, appearing on more than 500 albums with everyone 
from June Christy and London to Jimmy Witherspoon and Marvin Gaye. He's played 
on countless film and TV soundtracks, among them "The Godfather" -- he's the 
solo mandolinist who performs the now-classic theme -- "West Side Story" and 
"Blazing Saddles." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was involved in studio work, the music was tops," Viola says of the 
period from the mid-'50s to the late '70s. "Not just playing standard tunes, 
but original music, voiced with great harmony."  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the high point of his career was the association with Sinatra, with 
whom he performed intermittently from 1946 to 1980. Viola made appearances with 
the singer anywhere from the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas to the Parthenon in 
Athens, and played on such albums as "Nice 'n' Easy," "Only the Lonely" and 
"Ring-a-Ding-Ding." 
</P>
<P>
 "The big hits, 'My Way,' 'New York, New York,' 'Strangers in the Night' -- I 
was on all of those," he says, standing in the memorabilia-packed dining room 
of the Studio City home he shares with his wife of 48 years, Glenna. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola can be heard on a new Sinatra release, "Sinatra and Sextet: Live in 
Paris" (Reprise), which documents a 1962 performance done at the Club Lido in 
Paris, part of an 11-week world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good jazz band with Emil Richards, vibes, and Harry Klee, reeds," 
Viola says. "I would warm Frank up, just me and him, before the shows, and then 
during the shows, we did a number together. He was great to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his studio career, Viola has done well as a jazzman, recording 19 
albums under his own name and appearing with reedman Buddy Collette.  
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist says that when he played again with Cavanaugh in the late '80s, 
working a couple of weekends at a club in the San Fernando Valley, he didn't 
foresee another lengthy relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Page had been playing solo in Vegas for six years, and here he was with me 
and bassist Frank Della Rosa, and it was rough," recalls Viola. "When you play 
solo, you don't have to worry about time, and at first, his time was terrible. 
But by the second night of the second weekend, it was all jelling, and I said 
to him, 'You've got yourself a band.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh, who says he's thrilled to be working with Viola again, calls the 
guitarist "totally brilliant, a demon guitar player." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio offers seamless interpretations of standards and arcane numbers from 
Hollywood musicals of the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there are no written arrangements for this stuff," Viola says. 
"Page and I just have chemistry. We just hit it. That's the way it's always 
been." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER PROGRAM REVIVED; AFTER A TWO-YEAR HIATUS, THE SUMMER WORKSHOP AT CSUN 
GIVES TEEN-AGERS A TASTE OF THE STAGE SCENE. 
</P>

 Ask Jenny Cariker, 12, what she wants to be when she grows up, and she answers 
without hesitation. "Famous," she says. "I want to make it to Broadway. I want 
to be in movies and big Broadway shows. I love being on stage in front of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 To help realize her dream, Jenny -- whose idol is Judy Garland -- has enrolled 
in the Teenage Drama Workshop at Cal State Northridge, which is being revived 
after a two-year hiatus and threatened extinction. Since 1957, the intensive 
summer program had trained thousands of young people in all aspects of theater, 
with previous students including Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger, and 
Michael Rupert, now starring in "Falsettos" at the UCLA James A. Doolittle 
Theatre in Hollywood. But in 1991, the program was canceled due to low 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workshop had fallen on hard times because the year-round school calendar 
made the program impossible and attendance dropped," said Jeffrey Levy, CSUN 
theater general manager. "I felt it was a real loss -- almost like a death. The 
workshop had done so much for so many kids for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when it looked as though the workshop was in danger of being dark 
for good, Levy offered to try to resuscitate it. Then the Jan. 17 earthquake 
rumbled through Southern California, devastating Cal State Northridge. The 
school's main 400-seat theater and costume and scene shops were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake is obviously a complicating factor," Levy said. "But we have 
access to two other (smaller) theaters and a makeshift costume shop. Classes 
will be held in trailers, and scenery may have to be built outside. We have no 
dressing rooms right now -- we are figuring out what to do about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulties, Levy is determined: The show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting it off another year would probably kill it, and we can't afford to 
lose this kind of excellence," Levy said. "The workshop is magical for kids. 
They remember it for the rest of their lives. It changes their lives. Even if 
they don't go into theater, they discover what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny's mother, Laurie Cariker, who participated in the workshop when she was 
13, agrees. "It was one of the most wonderful, memorable experiences of my 
life," she said. "It just consumed me, being surrounded by theater 
professionals, making costumes and learning how to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that level of professionalism that attracted Jenny, said her mother. 
"Since she was 4 years old, Jenny has loved standing up in front of people and 
singing and dancing. She always had a natural ease on stage," said Cariker. 
"She takes it very seriously. So I wanted her to be in a program that would 
provide growth for her." 
</P>
<P>
 But Levy points out that the six-week workshop is geared to novices as well as 
seasoned performers. "We like to have a mix of students, including those who 
are just sampling, the shy kids who are sort of frightened, and those who have 
10 years experience in music and dance classes," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Professional directors, designers, actors and drama and dance teachers lead 
the workshop, which includes lessons in acting, voice, movement, music, 
singing, improvisation and play writing. Guest speakers -- including workshop 
graduates -- will lead some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will stage an original musical version of "The Pied Piper of 
Hamlin" and other productions, depending on enrollment. Organizers would like 
to have 40 to 60 students, but the workshop will go on if fewer are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 To reinforce skills the students learn in class, the workshop functions like a 
full-fledged repertory company, producing up to three plays, complete with 
theatrical lighting, costumes and fully designed sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe kids want challenges," Levy said. "So the program will be tough and 
disciplined. The students are going to sweat, they are going to hustle and they 
will discover they can do things they thought they were not able to do." WHERE

A NEGLECTED AMERICAN ARTIST; PLAY PAYS HOMAGE TO PAINTER ALBERT PINKHAM RYDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Pinkham Ryder may be the most famous American artist you've never heard 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it impossible to find anything about him in Los Angeles," Michael 
Holmes said. "There are no books in the libraries, nothing in the County 
Museum. So I went to New York, where there was also nothing on display, no 
prints available. He's not at the Metropolitan Museum, the Whitney, the 
Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art. Really, he's quite neglected. But 
during his time, he was considered the foremost American painter, second only 
to Winslow Homer." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Ryder (1847-1917) fall into such obscurity? 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion," Holmes said with a sigh. "Also, his paintings are very small -- he 
often painted on the backs of cigar boxes, because he liked the glow of cedar. 
But he never signed them, so after he died, there were a lot of forgeries; it 
was difficult to tell which were the real ones. Also, he had training as an 
artist, but no proper technique. He would shellac a painting before it dried -- 
and it would run, the paintings would begin to shift or crack. So it limited 
his output." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes discovered the artist as a child in Texas, coming upon a reproduction 
of Ryder's painting "The Racetrack" in one of his parents' art books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really stuck in my head," said the actor-writer-director-teacher, who 
founded the 30-seat Chandler Studio Theater in 1987. "He was a sweet man, a 
genius, and his were poetic, visionary works. They changed the face of American 
painting." Holmes pays homage in his new five-character play "Ryder," which 
will have two previews, Saturday and Sunday, as part of this weekend's NoHo 
Festival, before settling into its regular run next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes has assembled the show's dialogue from imagination and from Ryder's own 
words in correspondence with friends, art dealers and family. "A lot of the 
play has to do with internal monologue," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action takes place in a variety of locales: in Ryder's squalid New York 
apartment, on a steamer in the middle of the Atlantic, at a Manhattan art 
gallery, in a hotel, at the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He rarely went out, except for midnight walks to the docks," Holmes said. "He 
grew up in New Bedford, (Mass.), and his brothers were whalers; most of his 
paintings were seascapes. But his abilities started to go in his 40s." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Dean Vachon, a longtime acting student of Holmes, is playing Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time he was painting, Europe was the center of the art world," Vachon 
said. "America was new, as was the art scene -- working in the shadow of the 
Europeans, trying to meet their standards and be accepted. Ryder was not 
interested in that. His only responsibility was to the canvas, and to his inner 
vision. Most of his paintings came from that inner life. As time went on, they 
came more and more from his mind, what he considered the truth. I think he's a 
real find, a real gem. Somehow through history, he just got lost." WHERE AND 
WHEN

 What: "Ryder."

THEATER REVIEW; ETHICAL ISSUES GET SHORT SHRIFT; THE CAST OF 'ANDERSONVILLE 
TRIAL,' A POST-CIVIL WAR DRAMA, APPEARS TO BE AFRAID OF THE PLAY'S OWN POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no reason why Saul Levitt's late-'50s courtroom drama "The Ander 
sonville Trial" shouldn't remain vital. Unlike many trial plays, its post-Civil 
War setting is so far removed from any modern reality that it's not dated. Like 
Brecht's "Galileo," the specific events and dilemmas are so old, they're 
universally apt. And Levitt's attempt to dramatize U. S. history remains a rare 
one by an American playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Andersonville Trial" isn't vital in director Bill Prescott's staging 
at the Woodland Hills Community Theatre (produced under a special Actors Equity 
contract). Levitt's play is too skillful for it ever to become a boring history 
lesson, but the stakes aren't set nearly high enough here for us to feel the 
full brunt of what should be a galvanizing morality play. 
</P>
<P>
 Think back, and you may remember George C. Scott's exquisite KCET production 
in 1970, with William Shatner, Jack Cassidy, Richard Basehart and Cameron 
Mitchell. It was enough to turn this 14-year-old viewer into a theater fan for 
life. No "Andersonville," of course, would ever top it and none should be 
compared to it. But Levitt's work, again like Brecht's, can cause one's ethical 
sense to shift. Any "Andersonville" production should at least convey that. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prescott's production, cast members can generally only hint at it -- 
they're a little scared of the play's own power. In the war's aftermath, with 
Northern vengeance against the defeated South at an apex, Henry Wirz, (Jon 
Berry) warden of the Confederate POW camp at Andersonville, Ga., seems to be 
the most dramatic and effective Southern war criminal that the U.S. government 
can bring to military justice. While Wirz is defended by the cynical, wily Otis 
Baker (Jim Miller), he is opposed by an ambitious idealist, Lt. Col. N.P. 
Chipman (Gordon J. Noice). 
</P>
<P>
 The very reason why Wirz is up for prosecution -- the apparently cut-and-dried 
evidence that he conspired to make the prison camp "a hell" in which prisoners 
resorted to cannibalism -- is undercut by Baker's brilliant lawyering. Chipman, 
realizing that he may lose and thus scandalize the government, sees only one 
attack left: Try Wirz on the moral grounds that he should have disobeyed orders 
so as to save his prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andersonville" is the American response to the Nuremberg trials, where mere 
obedience to orders was outlawed in military trials. In 1865, however, 
Chipman's course was radical indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 It should also be thrilling, the final profound closure of a profound war. 
While Noice is earnest, his woodenness and his unfortunate habit of upstaging 
himself during some of the most crucial scenes stalls the emotional drive in 
this courtroom. Miller plays the snakelike dandy to the hilt, though his accent 
wobbles. John Henry Whitaker as Judge Gen. Lew Wallace is very good at poses, 
but never feels in total control of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, the cast's Equity member and the company's artistic director, turns 
Wirz into an ailing giant of a man, slowly suggesting the coward behind the 
facade of victimhood. It's an interesting performance until he rushes through 
Wirz's final, obsessive monologues, in which the full pain of Andersonville 
becomes shockingly revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous witnesses are Levitt's way of injecting a little humor -- always 
the play's weak link, but good chances for character actors. Here, most of them 
take advantage of the chances, especially Michael Groves and Darryl Swearingen. 
While Don Nelson's costumes are unusually rich and authentic for community 
theater, the supporting cast members of silent court attendees look like 
they're playing dress-up. WHERE AND WHEN

SCULPTURES FULL OF LIFE; RICHARD GERRISH'S STEEL FIGURES, RICH IN HUMOR AND 
GESTURES, ARE ON DISPLAY AT THE BRAND LIBRARY ART GALLERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Gerrish's metal sculptures are full of life, even as they remind us of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Legs kick and hands fly as skull-shaped faces peer out from the 32 agile 
figures, most of them life-size, that make up his installation "The Minstrel 
Show" at the Brand Library Art Galleries. The spacious gallery buzzes with 
excitement, as if these sculptures were dancers in a rehearsal hall, spinning 
in their own orbits, warming up for the big performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to dance within the face of death," Gerrish said. "I tried to create 
a sense of dancing and music of the spheres -- that music is the rhythm of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The figures are light on their feet even though they have come out of the 
heaviest of materials -- steel. Gerrish builds his forms from scrap metal, new 
steel and scraps left from his own workings and some found objects. 
</P>
<P>
 He draws primarily from the American heritage of minstrel shows, rich in 
gesture and humor, and Latino culture's memento mori (remembrance of death) to 
make "cross-cultural sculpture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a self-described "Army brat," Gerrish was exposed to numerous cultures. He 
was born in Japan and lived in the Philippines, India and all over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from the Anglo-Saxon establishment, but I'm living in this culture in 
L.A. -- the most intense cultural mix," Gerrish said. "I was looking for 
imagery that spoke to me personally and has an impact on the viewer. I want 
(viewers) to be confronted, to be a little bit nervous. Then I want them to get 
into the humor and playfulness -- to see life through death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all united by death, but there are unanswered questions. My purpose is 
to open up viewers to questioning their thought processes." 
</P>
<P>
 One can soul-search in front of the wall work, "Life After Death," which 
beckons passersby to put their faces up against a skull-like mask. Behind it is 
a mirror so they can see how they look in a death mask. 
</P>
<P>
 On the more humorous side, the high-stepping "Yankee Doodle," waving a 
big-time salute, is a dandy. Gerrish's love of ballet and his studies of leg 
movement are evident in many of the pieces, especially "Cakewalk," where we can 
sense a tempo in its kicking legs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the geometric "Horns of a Dilemma," the figure holds up an abstract element 
and a face mask, conveying Gerrish's desire to strike a balance between 
abstract and representational modes of artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prestidigitator" embodies the meaning of its title: someone who creates 
illusions by sleight of hand, such as a juggler. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerrish has been fascinated by minstrel shows since he attended one when he 
was about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw such a visual feast," he said. "I wanted to retrieve that feeling of 
animation and humor and color. It is a way of reaching back and getting in 
touch with my roots, of bringing that into the culture of L.A. and (showing) 
how that culture affects my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minstrel shows are important historically as a part of America's past. They 
were racist, but they were an early step in integrating black culture into 
white culture. It's important to remember these things in the context that they 
happened, and the value of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Complementing "The Minstrel Show" at Brand are Christina De Musee's large, 
expressive multimedia works that reflect the pressures of urban life. The 
businessmen of "Wallstreet" have overblown heads that are somewhat detached 
from their bodies. The women of "City Life" are truncated; the black men 
depicted with heads but no bodies. The Madonna-like figure in "City Dwellers I, 
II, III" is pieced together, mechanized. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, De Musee was primarily a neoclassical and Romantic-style 
painter. These works are her "reaction to how we're out of balance with 
nature," she said. "Living in L.A., I'm concerned and frightened by the changes 
here. The intense population explosion and the effects it has on people are 
hitting me on artistic levels." WHERE AND WHEN

 You don't have to wait until the 23rd Century to explore strange new worlds. 
Hollywood location managers discovered plenty of bizarre places in the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys to shoot scenes for "Star Trek" and "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Set aside three hours in the morning for a Trek mini-tour to two famous 
location sites. 
</P>
<P>
 And bring a picnic basket. It's a long way between planets. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the legendary Starfleet Academy, warp on over to the Donald C. Tillman 
Water Reclamation Plant at 6100 Woodley Ave. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right: The place that trained Captains James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc 
Picard is a sewage plant.  
</P>
<P>
 You can almost hear the Ferengi snickering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "Next Generation" episode titled "The First Duty," the facility's 
Japanese garden is used as the picturesque academy grounds. There, cadet Wesley 
Crusher has to decide whether to reveal the truth about a horrific accident in 
space to Capt. Picard or keep the secret with his fellow cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier episode, "Justice," the Japanese garden is Rubicun III, a 
pleasure-planet the crew visits for rest and relaxation. Despite the fragrant 
blossoms and the sensual natives, the crew ends up in trouble when Wesley kicks 
a ball into the off-limits zone -- a violation punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are required to enter "Starfleet Academy." 
</P>
<P>
 Free tours of the Japanese Garden, which last about an hour and 15 minutes, 
are available by phone for as few as one person and as many as 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Children younger than 12 are not allowed, and neither is food or pets. Also, 
flat-heel shoes are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the far future, there are rules to follow.

trip to Vasquez Rocks County Park in Agua Dulce will do. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bob Justman, a producer of both the original "Star Trek" and "The 
Next Generation" shows, no other off-set location has been used as much in the 
history of Trek as the 750-acre park's desert maze of rock formations jutting 
toward the sky -- a 20-million-year-old product of earthquake activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the original "Star Trek" series will recall William Shatner huffing 
and puffing down the barren slopes as Kirk, trying to outwit the lizard-lipped 
Gorn in "Arena." Other original series episodes shot there include "Friday's 
Child," "Shore Leave" and "The Alternative Factor." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the stuff we did wasn't on location because we had to create alien 
surfaces," said Justman, explaining how most sets are created at Paramount 
Studios in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez Rocks was an exception, he said. "It was a weird landscape with hardly 
any vegetation. The large rocks gave it an unearthly appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Next Generation" episode titled "Who Watches The Watchers?" uses the 
rocks as the surface of Mintaka III, where Federation scientists observe an 
alien culture. 
</P>
<P>
 For your other-worldly visit, bring plenty of water and watch your step: There 
are terrestrial dangers, too -- rattlesnakes and 100-degree heat during late 
spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a small price to pay for walking an alien surface. Where AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Japanese Garden in the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 6100 Woodley Ave., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Open to the public by guided tour only. Tour reservations for the 
garden are taken 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday. Morning tours 
conducted Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday year-round, unless it rains. 
Additional evening tours are available Monday through Friday, June through 
September.

<P>
 Price: Free.

 Call: (818) 756-8166.  
</P>
<P>
 What: Vasquez Rocks County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 10700 W. Escondido Canyon Road, Agua Dulce.

BRINGING DOWN THE WALL; REMOVAL OF THE STRUCTURE COMES JUST IN TIME FOR THE 
NOHO PERFORMING AND VISUAL ARTS FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They danced and partied all night when the Berlin Wall fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Lankershim Wall has fallen, there's going to be a different kind 
of party. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 17, less than three weeks before the second annual NoHo Performing and 
Visual Arts Festival (Saturday and Sunday at the Academy Plaza), the solid 
wooden wall that had blocked off a vacant lot bordering Lankershim Boulevard 
and adjacent to the plaza area was finally brought down. Not surprisingly, 
festival organizers are exultant that the wall is gone just in time for the 
eclectic weekend events. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing was ugly. Everybody is really happy that it's gone," said festival 
coordinator John McCrae. Universal City-North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce 
Executive Director Jim Mahfet said commercial businesses on Lankershim "are 
delighted. We always believed that that wall was a visual obstacle. It was 
ominous. With it gone, this increases the look of the area 100%. Now people 
will actually be able to see the festival if they're at the corner of Magnolia 
and Lankershim." 
</P>
<P>
 The elimination of the wall, and its replacement with a black-painted 
chain-link fence, is especially welcome, since efforts to get rid of the wall 
before the 1993 festival were thwarted at the last minute. Only recently, the 
various interested parties, including the chamber, the television academy and 
the Community Redevelopment Agency (which currently owns the vacant lot), could 
agree on a deadline and method to replace the wall. City liability laws require 
that vacant lots be fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the first edition, the '94 festival aims to pack as much variety as 
possible into 48 hours. But though the event is designed to show off the 
fledgling NoHo arts district (still awaiting official designation by Los 
Angeles city officials), many of the acts holding forth on the tent-covered 
stage -- as well as the vendors selling artwork, crafts and food -- are not 
actually based in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the festival's vendors, according to McCrae, operate on the road, 
moving weekly from festival to festival in California and through the West. 
Festival funding depends on the sale of vendor sites, but of the 130 possible 
sites, at the beginning of the week only 70 had been sold, McCrae said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge quake dislodged Actors Alley Repertory Theatre from its 
damaged home at El Portal Theatre. But the theater is making its temporary home 
in the plaza area, with this weekend as a kind of kickoff. Company actors will 
perform scenes from four previous productions ("Broadway," "Cantorial," "La 
Ronde de Lunch" and "Most Secret War"), but it's only a teaser for the upcoming 
season of plays, slated to begin July 17.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only other theater group on the plaza performance stage is Art of the 
Dance, which itself is providing a space on its nearby Weddington Street 
property for a second tented performing stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival stage coordinator Susan Cheyno pointed to this additional festival 
space as a sign that the festival is growing, and Valley Theatre League 
spokesman David Cox said the stage was needed because "we have so many 
performances, and we want to make it even more festive." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the main plaza stage, the second stage is reserved exclusively for 
theater groups during the day, including Lankershim-based Actors Workout, 
Burbank's Alliance Repertory Theatre and Los Angeles-based Immediate Acting 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most main stage acts are newcomers; only the Art of the Dance company, Mike 
Latour's On Stage dance troupe and leader Paul Tavenner's jazz group, Man 
Alive, are returning from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With emcee (and Avaz International Dance Ensemble director) Boualem Boufseloub 
as guide, the audience can expect a wide range of music, including baritone 
soloist John Lombardi, baroque instrumentalists Donna and Mark Foster, recorder 
player John Sherman, singer-songwriter Rachel Pashall, Celtic musicians Pam 
Munro and Sean Walsh and jazzers Suburban Alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dance will receive equal time, with dancer Joe Tremaine, Ballet Folkloric 
Mexico Azteca, the Perfumes of Arabe belly dancing group led by Mary Ann Cappa, 
and Kids on Stage dance troupe. Other children's acts will include Bob Mills' 
participatory "Crayon Sky" show and The Little People, a reputedly spunky clan 
of characters roaming the festival site. 
</P>
<P>
 If you tire of following The Little People, jump on a free, 44-seat shuttle 
headed for eight NoHo arts district theaters presenting scenes from current 
shows, from the Odessa Theatre and Group Repertory Theatre on the east, to 
Chandler Studio Theatre on the west. The maximum wait for the shuttle, 15 
minutes, will be considerably shorter than the wait for the Lankershim Wall to 
come down. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: The second annual NoHo Performing and Visual Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Academy Plaza, Lankershim and Magnolia boulevards, North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday; 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; CSUN BACK IN ACTION; STUDENTS OVERCOME THE JAN. 17 QUAKE 
AND PREPARE TO SHOW OFF THEIR FILMS AT A FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The theme of this year's Northridge University Film Festival, "Out of the 
Rubble and Back in Ac tion," reflects how the Cal State Northridge student film 
program, like the rest of the San Fernando Valley, was disrupted by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The film students were especially hard hit because they were denied access to 
vital equipment because of damage to school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle that the students are finishing their films," said Michael 
Scott, president of the Action Film and Video Club, a CSUN student film 
organization that sponsored the festival along with the CSUN Radio Television 
and Film Department. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN film professor Nate Thomas agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a tough semester because of the earthquake," Thomas said. 
Cinematography and editing is "a hard class even without the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which features about 25 student films from CSUN's beginning and 
intermediate filmmaking classes, was set for Thursday night at the General 
Cinema Center at Fallbrook Mall in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The semester-ending screenings normally would have been on campus, but the 
earthquake forced the move to the mall. The screenings are part of the 
education process, because only a live audience can clearly demonstrate to the 
filmmakers what did and didn't work in their films, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those filmmakers are David Burns and Alex Mende. They produced a 
documentary, "Positively Living," which focuses on the lives of two young 
adults who have tested positive for HIV: a 21-year-old mother, whose child has 
also tested HIV-positive, and a 24-year-old musician who plans on attending 
Juilliard. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake indirectly caused Burns and Mende to alter their script. 
Because of delays in getting access to the school's film equipment, the 
original HIV-positive subjects they chose to be the focus of their film backed 
out. They were forced to quickly find new subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting their film subjects was a powerful experience for Burns. "Before 
making the film, I never had known anyone who had HIV. I was very impressed by 
their strength," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the CSUN film program, the Action Film and Video 
Club has a hot line number, (818) 773-3230.

 THE HILLS ARE ALIVE: The Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum unveils its 1994 
Summer Repertory Season of classics next week with a weekend of Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Midsummer's Night's Dream" will be presented at 3 p.m. June 11, followed by 
"Macbeth" at 3 p.m. June 12. Other plays featured in the Theatricum's 12th 
summer season are Moliere's "Educated Women" and Tennessee Williams' modern 
classic "The Glass Menagerie." 
</P>
<P>
 The venue was founded by the late actor Will Geer, probably best remembered as 
Grandpa on television's "The Waltons." Geer's daughter, Ellen Geer, is the 
outdoor amphitheater's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make our productions accessible," Geer said. "Classics are not for 
museums." 
</P>
<P>
 She tries to pick pieces that have thematic relevance for today. For example, 
"Macbeth" fits well with today's world because it "is a violent piece about 
people without conscience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Midsummer's Night's Dream," geared for families and young audiences, will 
have six Saturday afternoon performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Educated Women," featuring a new translation by Philip Littell, will open 
July 3, and "The Glass Menagerie" opens Aug. 13. For a complete performance 
schedule, call (310) 455-3723. 
</P>
<P>
 The Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., is in the 
canyon about six miles south of Ventura Boulevard. Tickets are $12; $8.50 
senior citizens, students and equity members; $4 children 6 to 12; free 
children 5 and under. No reservations are required. Audience members are 
advised to dress casually (and warmly for evening performances) and to bring 
pillows and blankets to sit on. Picnickers are welcome on the grounds before 
and after the shows.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WELCOME HOME: Playhouse West, 4250 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, will 
present a benefit performance at 8 p.m. Saturday of "Welcome Home Soldier: A 
Tribute to Vietnam Veterans" to celebrate the production's third anniversary. 
Proceeds will benefit Task Force Omega, a California organization of the 
families and friends of Vietnam POWs and MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has been playing to full houses since 1991. Playhouse spokeswoman 
Christine Cavanaugh said the play is popular with a disenfranchised audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional play, and it's done in a point of view that hasn't gotten 
attention -- the point of view of what happened to the soldier when he came 
home," Cavanaugh said. "The play is in their own words; it's their story." 
</P>
<P>
 Theater Director Robert Carnegie said the style of the production is also a 
part of its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acting is extremely realistic," he said. Vietnam veterans, who make up 
about one-third of the show's audience, often don't realize that the actors are 
not real vets, he said, adding that some veterans come back as many as 50 times 
to see the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes like a therapy session for them. It's a strange and odd 
situation," Carnegie said. "And we're extremely pleased by it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome Home Soldier" plays in rotating repertory with several other 
productions at Playhouse West. Tickets are $7. For a complete schedule, call 
(310) 285-3311.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: WINDOW ON ITALIAN STYLE; WESTWOOD STORE BRINGS THE PRICE 
OF DESIGNER FOOTWEAR AND BAGS DOWN TO EARTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large overstock of merchandise is a wholesaler's nightmare -- but it can be 
a consumer's dream. The in ventory at Window Italy is made up entirely of a 
wholesaler's overstocks, and the bargains are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes for men and women, many of them big names in the shoe industry, are on 
the shelves. Sizes from 5 1/2 to 10 are available in all styles. Joan & David, 
Anne Klein, Perry Ellis, Stuart Weitzman, Giorgio Brutini and Paloma are some 
of the women's shoe designers represented at greatly reduced prices, as much as 
10% to 20% below wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Joan & David suede dress pumps that retail for $195 were $49.99, as were 
a pair of Via Spiga pumps that were in the stores for $135. The name "Stuart 
Weitzman" on the inner sole evokes a glint in many a shopper's eyes, and they 
will be knocked out when they read the prices -- for instance, $55 for leather 
dress pumps that retail for $225. I loved the Anne Klein flats at $35 -- and 
was pleased that I didn't pay $120 for them a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's shoes that retail for $75 to $110 -- such as Studio Paolo, Jazz, Van 
Eli, Palaizzio, Anne Klein II and Etienne Aigner -- are at Window Italy for $25 
to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are current styles, and some are "gray market," or made for the European 
market, which means that some styles reach here ahead of the local marketplace. 
Last season's styles are further reduced and can be found in the $29 section. 
</P>
<P>
 Men will find some of their favorite designers as well -- Bruno Magli, Mario 
Bruni, Stracam and BrassBoot, to name a few. For $75, you can have some $225 
hand-crafted loafers by Mario Bruni; $50 is all you need for a pair of $135 
Stracam slip-on dress shoes, and $70 gets you any style -- Oxford, wing-tip, 
loafer or slip-on -- from BrassBoot, which retail for around $165. 
</P>
<P>
 The assortment of women's handbags is colorful, fun and $35, except at sale 
time -- about four times a year -- when they are marked down to $25. Most of 
the handbags are made in Milan and retail from $85 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never heard of this place, the reason is that a clause in this 
wholesaler's contract with other retail stores prohibits Window Italy from 
advertising its bargains. Manager Jonathan Kohan finds this a bit frustrating 
when he has such great deals to offer, but he knows that once consumers find 
this little spot, they generally become regulars.

'A DIFFERENT VIBE EACH NIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERIE SAUNDERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like television's "Cheers," Bourbon Square in Van Nuys is a place where 
everybody knows your name. With live music seven nights a week, friendly 
bartenders and ample places to sit and talk, newcomers immediately feel welcome 
and regulars often call the club their second home.  
</P>
<P>
 The Scene: The club has two rooms, each with a bar. One is a lounge area with 
dartboards and cozy couches that could have come from your great-aunt's attic. 
People were sitting in these mini-living rooms in deep conversation. On Monday 
nights, blues bands push the couches back and set up a stage, providing 
up-close and personal interaction with the audience. The second room has a 
stage, tiny round tables and chairs, and a dance floor that makes your broom 
closet seem roomy. This doesn't seem like the place to go if your sole purpose 
is to dance. Patrons here kick back with a drink and a smoke and enjoy the live 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crowd: Lots of elbow room on this particular Friday night, but the number 
of people depend on the bands who play. Some bands have larger followings than 
others, which makes the crowd size vary from night to night. The wardrobe of 
the 21- to 50-year-old crowd fell somewhere between grunge and honky-tonk. 
Shorts, torn jeans and leather jackets were in abundance, with occasional 
cowboy boots and sneakers. A sign on the door read "No hats, T-shirts or tank 
tops," yet various people were seen wearing all of the above, and no one seemed 
to care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music: Rock, straight, no chaser. The featured acts on this Friday were 
two local rock bands, Smashbox and Guinea Pig. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: "It feels like a hometown bar," said Lisa Rosenberg of Granada 
Hills. "It's the kind of place where I don't mind coming by myself. Plus there 
are more men than women, and there's a different vibe each night."  
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: "I wish I could just pick up the bar and move it out of this area, 
maybe to the northwest Valley," said "Doc" of Van Nuys. "Crimewise, Van Nuys is 
not the best place."

ENJOYING THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS; AT 17, MIRIAM PARRISH HAS MANAGED TO LAND A 
ROLE ON A DAYTIME SOAP AND BE NAMED HER SCHOOL'S VALEDICTORIAN.

 It's 7:30 a.m., and Miriam Parrish is already at the NBC Studios lot, getting 
"blocking" from her director for the day's shoot on the "Days of Our Lives" 
set. Next, she's having her makeup done, then her hair, followed by lunch and 
finally the actual shoot, all the while studying her script and cramming for 
her finals: certainly more than your average 17-year-old can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miriam kept up this frenzied pace until December. And despite her 
demanding yet blossoming acting career, she managed to not only graduate from 
high school a semester ahead of schedule, but is valedictorian of the San 
Fernando Valley Professional School. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents called me today -- for the tenth time -- and said, 
'Congratulations on being valedictorian!' " said Miriam, recalling how 
supportive her parents have been in both her career and education. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Days," Miriam plays Jamie Caldwell, whom she describes as "your typical 
16-year-old teen-ager." Initially brought on as a recurring character, Jamie 
has become a regular on the show since Miriam signed a contract last December.  
</P>
<P>
 "Recently, on the show, I had a story line where my father was sexually 
abusing me. So that was nice and juicy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam says she loves working with the "Days" cast and enjoys being involved 
in the NBC-TV soap opera, which airs at noon Mondays through Fridays. "It's 
steady, constant work, and a great job all around."  
</P>
<P>
 She has also been on "Roseanne" and "Step by Step," as well as in a Los 
Angeles theatrical production called "Spying," which starred Meredith Baxter.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Miriam will be graduating on Wednesday, she actually received her 
diploma in December. She decided to finish her high school education early in 
order to be "treated as an adult rather than a minor so that I can work longer 
hours."  
</P>
<P>
 The law states that a minor can only work 10 hours a day, three of which must 
be designated toward school and one to lunch. "The directors have to work 
school into what you're doing on the set, but they do have this moneymaking 
business called acting going on, so sometimes it's difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marjory van Valkenburg, the administrator of Valley Professional, said she is 
especially proud of Miriam, not only for excelling in her studies, but also for 
keeping a firm head on her shoulders about the acting business. "She suffers 
from no delusions of grandeur," said Van Valkenburg.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley Professional is a private elementary and secondary school in North 
Hollywood designed to allow young people in show business to continue their 
education, but according to their own schedule, rather than the usual public 
school hours.  
</P>
<P>
 "I transferred out of Grant High School," Miriam explained, "because it's too 
hard for the public system to accommodate my schedule. And that's not their job 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Valkenburg said the school's current enrollment is 165 students, from 
first through 12th grade. Classes are held on campus, and are coordinated with 
the tutors on the studio sets.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of independent study and homework on the set," said Van 
Valkenburg. Valley Professional is one of only two schools in the area that is 
specifically for industry kids. "Every time I mention that school, someone has 
gone there for a short period, is going there, knows someone who's gone there. 
. . . It's very well-known," Miriam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she's a full-time working woman, Miriam has her own apartment in 
Burbank near NBC Studios. Having moved four years ago from her home state, 
Florida, to pursue her acting career, Miriam had been living with her cousin in 
Sherman Oaks. But since receiving her diploma and getting shook up by the 
Northridge quake, she found it was time to find a home of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam has plans for college. In the fall, she'll be taking night classes at 
Valley College in Van Nuys while taping the soap during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled that she's decided to continue her education," Van Valkenburg 
said. Miriam said she plans to study English, communications or journalism for 
a couple of years at Valley College, then transfer to either UCLA or USC.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know I need to go to college to have something to fall back on," Miriam 
conceded, fully aware of the lottery-like nature of her business. "But I know 
this business is meant for me."

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; THE OVERALL STORY: A SHORTS TALE; THAT '70S 
WORKING-CLASS LOOK RETURNS, BUT NOW WITH LOTS OF CUTE TOUCHES TO SEPARATE THE 
GIRLS FROM THE BOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes regularly about fashion for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue-collar fashions reminiscent of working-class chic are the height of style 
this summer, both locally and beyond. Consider it the fashion extension of the 
industrial shoe. Chinese laundry jackets, uniform looks, naval peacoat-style 
blazers and the biggest surprise of the season, given the demise of grunge -- 
the resurgence of overalls -- are adding an urban edge to the suburban summer 
fashion scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who remembers the look in the summers of the '70s needn't bother to 
retrieve the old tube tops from the back of the closet, the former companion to 
the denim duds. The new look in overalls is fresh and original because it's 
more feminine, says Cissy Wechter, owner of Flair boutique in Encino, who at 57 
is sporting overalls these days.  
</P>
<P>
 "The overalls we're seeing now are so cute, very comfortable and something 
different for summer over little white and cream T-shirts," she says, adding 
that the store can barely keep the plain T-shirts in stock. Denim is a fabric 
staple, but linen also is being implemented into trendy overall designs. Among 
the most popular styles are the short overalls and those that are fashioned 
into below-the-knee dresses. Some feature attached crinkled pleat skirts 
affixed to an overall bodice. Most feature rayon print trims, a definite plus 
when separating the boys from the girls. Paris Blue, Loco Lindo and So So 
Sophie labels hang inside the designs, which average about $100 at Flair. 
</P>
<P>
 SKIRTING THE ISSUE: Speaking of skirts, those fitted micromini styles that 
have been around for a few years are finally falling out of favor. Instead, 
watch for an influx of short yet loose types that still hit above the knee but 
move more freely. They're being paired with fitted corset tops, T's and 
abbreviated, bolero-style vests. Fashion types have dubbed it the flippy skirt, 
but Carol Lettieri, editor of the Woodland Hills-based West Coast Pipeline, 
calls it the Nancy Kerrigan skirt for its playful, movement-enhanced 
silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 At I. Magnin, three categories of the skirts are featured, including the 
standard flip (wispy and breezy), the pleat (peppy kilt-influenced numbers) and 
the A-line (short and flared at the hips.) At all their stores, including the 
newly reopened one in Woodland Hills, flippy skirts abound in the designer 
areas, with prices ranging from $250 to $500. Among the lines featuring the 
looks: Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Richard Tyler Collection and Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of us, a more affordable version sells for $48 at The Limited. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDLING A TREND: After a decade of structured bags, unconstructed woven 
styles are all the rage. At better-priced department stores, the bags fetch 
between $150 to $400 for some styles. But savvy women, adept with crochet 
needles, are heading to Needle World in Sherman Oaks to knock off the pricier 
styles for as little as $70. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moms are making things for their kids," saleswoman Lil Chavkin says. The 
store is doing a brisk business in materials for the purses, made of soutache, 
which is sold by the gross. (A gross is equal to 144 yards, and two are needed 
to make the average bag.) The soutache comes in the same colors popular in the 
stores: bisque, black and navy. Crochet hooks are the only tools needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But will the finished product look like the in-store offerings?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we do a better job than Carrie Forbes," says Chavkin of the designer 
bags her customers are copying. The original inspirations, Chavkin says, cost 
between $350 to $400. Now that's homespun ingenuity.

PARTY IN THE PARK; A TOUR OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S HOLLYHOCK HOUSE WILL 
COMMEMORATE THE ARCHITECT'S 127TH BIRTHDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Architect Frank Lloyd Wright lived a long, productive life, designing some of 
this country's and Los Angeles' most unusual architecture before he died in 
1959 at the age of 92. 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks Wright's 127th birthday, and the Los Angeles City Cultural 
Affairs Department is inviting the public to commemorate it Sunday at Barnsdall 
Art Park in Hollywood, the location of one of his most renowned structures -- 
Hollyhock House. 
</P>
<P>
 Built for oil heiress Aline Barnsdall between 1919 and 1921 on a 36-acre site 
known as Olive Hill, Hollyhock House was Wright's first Los Angeles project. 
The original plans included two secondary residences, a theater, director's 
house, dormitory for actors, artists' studios, shops and a motion picture 
theater. Only the Hollyhock House and the two secondary residences were built. 
</P>
<P>
 Though historians have waxed on about the Japanese, Maya, Inca, Egyptian, 
Spanish Colonial and Southwestern Native American architecture of the house, 
Wright preferred to label it "California Romanza," a musical term that means 
"freedom to make one's own form." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and 11 surrounding acres to the city 
of Los Angeles for use as a public art park. Today, Hollyhock stands in 
Barnsdall Art Park with the Municipal Art Gallery and Gallery Theater, 
Barnsdall Arts Center and the Junior Arts Center, which provides an array of 
art classes for children year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 This three-hour tour is designed around Wright's birthday celebration Sunday, 
when many family events will take place. The tour of Hollyhock House begins at 
1 p.m. but you also might want to partake in two workshops that start at 10 
a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Julius Shulman -- well known for more than 50 years as one of the 
great photographers of Southern California's best architecture -- will share 
his ideas from 10 a.m. to noon on how to photograph Hollyhock House. Free, but 
reservations are required. Call (213) 485-4581. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Fu-Ding Cheng, creator of the exhibit "Dream-House" in the Junior Arts 
Center, will view and discuss his show and the exterior of Hollyhock House from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Then, children 7 and older will create memorial dream houses 
of their own. Free, but enrollment is limited. For reservations, call (213) 
485-4474. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could begin your day here with a picnic lunch. The park's tree-shaded 
grounds provide an oasis from its urban surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 p.m.: Take your own tour through Hollyhock House. Docents will tell you 
about the architecture and furnishings, about Wright and his idiosyncrasies, 
influences and innovations -- all manifested in the house -- and about owner 
Barnsdall. One of the richest women in the world at the time, she was an 
unmarried mother who championed labor, children's and human rights causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Hollyhock House is the exhibit, "Flashback/Fastforward: Runyon Canyon 
and the Wright Plans for Huntington Hartford," which documents the history of 
Wright's plans for Runyon Canyon, now a public park. 
</P>
<P>
 For kids who wouldn't appreciate discussions about Hollyhock House, several 
workshops designed specifically for them will be going on at the same time. 
Parents are also welcome. Free, no reservations necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities include embellishing actual blueprints to create one's own 
architectural designs and artwork; making textured plaster blocks, a la 
Wright's designs in concrete, using found objects; building graham cracker 
houses in the style of Wright's cantilevered buildings, and an origami flowers 
workshop.  
</P>
<P>
 These workshops are based on activities from the book, "Frank Lloyd Wright for 
Kids" by Kathleen Thorne- 
</P>
<P>
 Thomsen, who will read from her book from 3 to 3:30 p.m. in the Hollyhock 
House courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:30 p.m.: Enter the Municipal Art Gallery to view two exhibits: "The 
Third Los Angeles: The Creation of Downtown L.A., 1900-1939" and the "Los 
Angeles Service Station Project." Cost is $1 general, free for children under 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Third Los Angeles . . . " presents original drawings, blueprints and 
photographs of some of the city's most significant buildings, including 
Bullock's Wilshire, City Hall, the Public Library and Union Station.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Service Station Project," 11 architectural teams, working with civic 
agencies and community groups, created architectural models that suggest ways 
to address the needs of such areas as Cudahy, Chinatown, Koreatown and South 
Central L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 to 3 p.m.: Take a guided tour of Residence A, now the Barnsdall Arts 
Center. Residence B has since been torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3:30 p.m.: Go to the Junior Arts Center Gallery to see the three-part 
exhibit, "Gateways." Take a journey through Fu-Ding Cheng's "Dream-House," 
which conveys the life story of a magical house with a display of delightful 
illustrations and the animated film, "Spirit of the Dream-House." Also on view 
are Art Nomura's "Digital Mandala" video and Roger Feldman's installation, 
"Teleological Passages: Still a Small Voice." 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 to 4 p.m.: Join in the reception and birthday cake to celebrate Wright's 
127th birthday, in the Hollyhock House courtyard, sponsored by the Friends of 
Hollyhock House. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Frank Lloyd Wright's 127th Birthday Celebration in Barnsdall Art Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 4800 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: All events are free except $1 entrance to the Municipal Art Gallery for 
visitors over age 12. Parking is free.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MIDDLE EASTERN DELIGHT; SASOON ISN'T JUST A PLACE FOR EATING 
CHICKEN. THE STOREFRONT CAFE OFFERS MANY CHOICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Don't compare my chicken with Zankou," said a faintly bristling Garbis 
Kalaijian, handing me a plastic cup of his powerful homemade garlic sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I had inadvertently done just that when Kalaijian asked me how I was enjoying 
his crisp-skinned, perfectly browned roast bird; I'd muttered something about 
how it reminded me of something I had eaten at one of the redoubtable Zankou 
Chicken rotisserie palaces. Big mistake. It struck some kind of nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the comparison is unthinkable. Roast chicken, sides of garlic sauce, 
olives, pickled turnips and the Armenian flat bread known as lavash have been 
the recipe for Zankou's phenomenal success. Thinking back, I might have put it 
more diplomatically and said I liked his chicken even better than Zankou's, 
which is true. The fact is that both Zankou and Sasoon are pretty impressive 
chicken vendors, especially on a bang-for-the-buck basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zankou Chicken is a big commercial operation," Kalaijian continued, 
recovering his considerable grace, "and we are a family-run business." 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately got the point, glancing at the modest counter and one busy 
rotisserie. Kalaijian shares cooking duties at this tiny Tarzana storefront 
cafe with his wife, Nelly, and the couple is proud of the fact that everything 
here is made from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference is that Sasoon isn't just a place for eating chicken but a 
restaurant that offers many choices. There are more than 25 Middle 
Eastern-style appetizers, for instance, as well as soups, kebabs and homemade 
pastries and cookies meant to be taken with soorj , that sweet, muddy demitasse 
also known as Armenian coffee. And practically anything you eat or drink here 
is infused with Lebanese aromas -- garlic, pine nuts and spices -- because the 
Kalaijians happen to be Armenians who were reared in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers and small plates are the true focal point of Sasoon's menu. 
Lahmajune is one (it's often called Armenian pizza, a description I find a 
little misleading since lahmajune is lighter and contains no cheese). It's a 
round, cracker-crisp flat bread topped with a dense coating of spiced ground 
beef. Frozen, reheated lahmajune -- the kind served at many Armenian 
restaurants -- is good enough, but Sasoon proves that freshly made lahmajune is 
better.  
</P>
<P>
 Think of sujuk as a homemade sausage, redolent of garlic, cumin and other 
Levantine flavorings. Sasoon's version is grilled crisp and sliced onto a bed 
of heavily vinegared onions. A wine buff would call its flavor long in the 
finish. Ras nana is basically grilled chunks of beef in a bath of what tastes 
like concentrated lemon juice. I liked it, but the three people accompanying me 
found it too sharp.  
</P>
<P>
 To tell the truth, Sasoon is decidedly liberal in its use of lemon juice, 
which means that some appetizers from the Syrian/Lebanese tradition may have 
far more sourness than you're used to. Mutabbal (better known in this country 
as baba ghannuj ) is a puree of roasted eggplant flavored with garlic and 
sesame, an eggplant-based cousin of hummus; Sasoon's mutabbal is crowned with a 
sprinkling of pomegranate seeds, and both it and the cafe's version of hummus 
are quite lemony. Muhammara is a dark-red paste of bread crumbs, crushed 
walnuts, cumin, olive oil and pine nuts -- and lemon juice, of course.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good, but I can do without the fool , which is boiled fava beans, a 
traditional breakfast dish. As sold here, it's under-spiced and overdosed with 
lemon juice. Even hot steaming lavash couldn't rescue it. 
</P>
<P>
 After appetizers, there are dozens of dishes to choose from: lamb tongue 
sandwiches, the cracked wheat meat cakes known as kibbeh , the thickened yogurt 
spread labneh , exemplary meat-and-rice- stuffed grape leaves and that garlicky 
chicken, of course. If you want a full meal, you can order one of the somewhat 
generic but tasty meat kebabs, which will be served with pickled vegetables, 
mounds of fluffy white rice and all the lavash you can eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Just make sure you save room for one of Nelly Kalaijian's finely crafted 
desserts. My favorite is probably maamul , a crumbly, butter-filled cookie with 
a minced pistachio filling. Basbusa is a square of semolina flour cake perfumed 
with rose water and clove. And of course there is terrific baklava, 
syrup-drenched strudel leaves piled one atop the other, interspersed with 
crushed walnut and pistachio. 
</P>
<P>
 The baklava actually reminded me of one I ate as a child, but I decided to 
hold my tongue. I plan to come back here for chicken and baklava some time 
soon, and you've got to think ahead. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 Location: Sasoon, 18970 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested Dishes: Whole chicken to go, $6.50; whole chicken to eat on 
premises, $7.50; sujuk , $3.99; muhammara , $2.50; lahmajune , $1.50; maamul , 
$1.25.

 HOLDING OFFICE: San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr., the dean of 
California prosecutors, faces stiff competition this election after his office 
bungled a high-profile case . . . . If he's toppled this year, Ventura County's 
Michael D. Bradbury would become California's longest-serving D.A. in a major 
county. As in the past three elections, Bradbury has no opponent. "I'm 
beginning to think I'm the only one dumb enough to want this job," Bradbury 
said. "Seriously, I think it is the best job in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 DIRTY JOB: Wielding a three-handled shovel, Simi Valley leaders on Thursday 
symbolically broke ground on the city's long-awaited Cultural Arts Center . . . 
. If all goes as planned, the old Community Methodist Episcopal Church on Los 
Angeles Avenue will be transformed into a 290-seat theater with an art gallery 
by next February. And, construction costs will peak at $2.5 million. Work began 
on the site a few days before the official groundbreaking, Deputy City Manager 
Bob Heitzman said. "We needed some soft dirt to turn, so we had to do some 
grading first." 
</P>
<P>
 POWERHOUSE: At 6-foot-1 and about 285 pounds, Dolores Tuimoloau stands out in 
more than one sport at Oxnard's Channel Islands High School. But the attentions 
lavished on the 18-year-old senior by college recruiters focus on the local 
records she has shattered in the shotput (C12). "She has had so many calls from 
so many schools," Coach Myra Beemis says. "I lost track." And the shotput is 
her off-season sport. Dolores' heart belongs to basketball. A center, she 
intimidates opponents with her size. 
</P>
<P>
 INSULT TO INJURY: Imagine being in a car accident. You're unconscious and 
being wheeled into the hospital emergency room on a gurney. And a hospital 
clerk picks your pocket . . . . That happened to several patients at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center before authorities arrested Michelle Elaine Peralta of 
Oxnard. Peralta got 90 days in jail for going on a shopping spree with credit 
cards swiped from emergency-room patients (B1).

BODY OF MAN IN LSD TEST TO BE EXHUMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a scientist who was given LSD in a CIA experiment was exhumed 
Thursday in an effort to find out whether his death 40 years ago really was a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Olson, a 43-year-old civilian biochemist involved in biological warfare 
research at Ft. Detrick, fell 13 stories to his death from a New York hotel 
room on Nov. 28, 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the death was classified as a suicide, relatives have suspected foul 
play since learning in 1975 about the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 A government commission investigating the CIA indicated that year that the 
agency had experimented with LSD and other hallucinogens in the early 1950s and 
that a number of experiments were conducted on unwitting federal employees, 
including Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic scientists will examine Olson's body for the presence of drugs and 
for evidence of injuries that cannot be attributed to the fall, said James E. 
Starrs, professor of law and forensic sciences at George Washington University 
National Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Starrs, who has investigated such long-ago deaths as those of explorer 
Meriwether Lewis and assassinated Louisiana Sen. Huey Long, said Olson might 
have been killed because he knew about clandestine CIA activities and his 
reaction to the LSD made him a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report is expected in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson and four other scientists were given a drink laced with LSD at a cabin 
near Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland, reportedly on Nov. 19, 1953, 
according to CIA documents given to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned home to Frederick, he was upset and depressed, said Eric 
Olson, his son. He told his wife that he was going to quit his job, then came 
home from work a few days later and said he was being taken to New York to be 
seen by a mental health professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert V. Lashbrook, a CIA scientist who was in the hotel room with Olson, 
said Wednesday that he did not see Olson throw himself out the window, but 
believes he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lashbrook, 75, reached at his home in Ojai, Calif., said he was awakened by a 
noise and saw the window shade flapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long time ago. I was certainly in shock at that time," Lashbrook 
said.

YOUNG BIDDER SPENDS $2 ON ANTIQUE IRON, FINDS $1,000 IN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old antique collector who paid $2 at an auction for an old iron 
found a bonus inside the box it came in -- $1,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knees weren't shaking, but they were a little weak," said Aron Maghoudi, 
14, of Unity Township. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader said he bid on the clothes iron because his grandmother 
owned one just like it. No one else made a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The stack of bills, some dating to 1934, was about an inch high and wrapped in 
foil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to give it back, but the auctioneer said not to worry about it," the 
boy said. "He said that it was mine, that it was one of those lucky things."

S. CAROLINA LAWMAKERS FAIL TO VOTE ON BID TO STRIKE CONFEDERATE COLORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An agreement to lower the Confederate battle flag from atop the Statehouse 
died when lawmakers failed to vote on it Thursday, the last day of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many would rather run with a racial issue than have it settled," 
Democratic state Sen. Verne Smith said after a House Republican stalled the 
Senate-approved plan with a procedural maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise had brought together grandsons of Confederate veterans and 
state civil rights leaders in an agreement to furl the flag that has flown 
above the Statehouse since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, who control the House, were divided on the issue and unable to get 
the votes necessary to consider it without Republican help. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag, with its blue X, red background and white stars, is the last 
Confederate battle flag flying over a state capitol. Georgia and Mississippi 
incorporate the banner's design in their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would have lowered the flag but raised a similar one at 
Confederate monuments on Statehouse grounds. A monument would have been built 
to honor African Americans, and lawmakers said they would stipulate that the 
rebel flag honored the South's heritage and was not racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers blamed Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. for failing to 
push House Republicans to support the compromise. He said he did what he could.

ELECTIONS / MEASURE Y; LIBRARY BACKERS HOPE FOR LOW TURNOUT ON KEY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A low-key but pivotal ballot measure to be decided Tuesday in Santa Paula has 
library officials crossing their fingers and banking on a small voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 While registered voters in Santa Paula's special library district agreed in 
November to pay $25 a year to keep their branch open, a state law requires that 
they also give officials permission to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure Y asks them to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a non-contentious, undebated issue that if not approved by a majority of 
voters Tuesday would virtually negate Measure W, the library tax that would 
generate about $170,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no billboards urging a yes vote looming above downtown, and no "Yes 
on Y" placards lining Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frightening this time because it's so positive out there," said Gene 
Marzec, a retired school administrator working to get Measure Y passed. "I 
haven't heard one word against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody figures it's a done deal and there's no problem with it," he said. 
"But it does kind of get you squeamy that there's no opposition to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to date has consisted of one mass mailing to registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 It also included a few speeches by library boosters to Santa Paula service 
clubs and a handful of volunteers mailing informational flyers to absentee 
voters. Supporters also paid for one small advertisement in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we decided to do was go for the money first and then go for the 
appropriations limit," said Daniel Robles, librarian for the Santa Paula Union 
High School Public Library District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't want to confuse the issue because it's a real hard thing to 
explain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law adopted in the aftermath of Proposition 13 requires special 
districts and other agencies to gain voter approval before they spend more 
property tax money than was spent in an established base year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said he considered recommending the so-called appropriation initiative 
for the November, 1993, ballot alongside Measure W. But he was afraid people 
would misunderstand the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried that in 1990, but people got confused," Robles said. "They thought 
one was asking for a per-parcel tax and that the other was a special 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though (the appropriation measure) was not a monetary request, people 
took it as one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Robles and other library boosters decided early on to 
separate the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In last November's election, the library tax received almost 69% support, just 
two percentage points above the two-thirds needed to pass. Measure Y requires a 
simple majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard Library, which operates independently of the county library system, 
is open just 18 hours over three days a week. The library would increase its 
hours to 30 or more each week over five days if Measure Y is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for anything pie in the sky," Marzec said. "But you can't 
continue to exist with the funds that we're getting and still reasonably call 
it a library." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the Yes on Measure Y campaign was provided mostly from leftover 
cash from Measure W committee donations, Marzec said. He estimated the Measure 
Y committee has spent less than $2,000 promoting the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe not even that, to be honest," Marzec said. "It hasn't been a terribly 
high-key campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said that if the measure fails, the library district would be able to 
spend the $25-a-year assessment this coming fiscal year, under a legal opinion 
from the Ventura County counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But future funding, despite the November approval of the per-parcel tax, would 
become unavailable, forcing the library to again scale back its hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library director said he hopes for a low voter turnout to minimize 
confusion over the issue. That way, he said, more voters familiar with the 
measure would cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lacking a concerted campaign effort, those are the two items I'm banking on," 
Robles said.

COALITION ATTACKS LANDFILL INITIATIVE; WELDON CANYON: THE WEST COUNTY 
GOVERNMENT LEADERS VOW THEY WON'T LET VOTERS APPROVE THE DUMP WITHOUT A FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of west Ventura County leaders launched a counteroffensive to the 
Weldon Canyon landfill initiative Thursday, only days after the measure's 
supporters announced they had gathered enough signatures to qualify it for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined at a press conference by county Supervisors Susan Lacey and Maria 
VanderKolk, and a representative from Supervisor Maggie Kildee's office, City 
Council members from Ventura and Ojai said the initiative puts their pristine 
back yards at the mercy of other county residents looking for a convenient new 
dump site. 
</P>
<P>
 "At what point can some county cities decide land use for other cities?" 
Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle asked. "If this is the way we are going to 
make land use decisions in this county, beware -- you could be next." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Council members Steve Bennett, Rosa Lee Measures and Jim Monahan 
also attended the event, held near the mouth of Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The city officials warned they would not let county voters approve the 
proposed landfill without a vigorous fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be an expensive, long-term mistake for the people of this county. 
Landfills are an antiquated, easy solution. We can and we must do better," said 
Ojai City Councilman Steve Olsen, who was joined by Councilwoman Nina Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Canyon is a 6,474-acre gorge 2 1/2 miles north of Ventura and five 
miles south of Ojai, proposed as the dump for all the non-recyclable trash from 
Ventura, Oxnard, Ojai and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, opponents of the landfill contended that it would: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dramatically pollute" the air in the west county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discourage residents from pursuing progressive recycling efforts by making 
it too easy to just dump trash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be so large that operators would have to ship in trash from Los Angeles 
County just to break even financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Ventura and Ojai, however, support for the initiative appeared 
widespread among other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Thursday, city council members from around the county called 
Ventura and Ojai officials irresponsible for blocking a ready solution to the 
county's looming trash crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to be thinking regionally and not just east versus west," 
Fillmore Mayor Linda Brewster said. "(The county's existing landfills) will 
fill up within 10 years or so if there is no Weldon, and then where are we?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative dismiss many of the landfill opponents' 
objections as mere scare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue, they say, is that with the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard nearing 
capacity, there will soon be nowhere left for the county's western cities to 
dump their non-recyclable trash. 
</P>
<P>
 That trash could be hauled to Toland Landfill between Santa Paula and 
Fillmore, or to the Simi Valley Landfill, but officials from cities that dump 
in those landfills say that would only make them reach capacity faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Oxnard and Camarillo officials continue to push for Weldon Canyon as the 
answer to their problems. But those cities, Ventura and Ojai officials suggest, 
could pack their refuse in trains and ship it to Utah. Critics say that could 
be prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said, "It is 
irresponsible to have the attitude that our trash should go out of state." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the initiative has heated up, with members of the Coalition to 
Stop Weldon Canyon Dump, an Ojai-based environmental group, demanding the 
resignation of Chairman Scott Montgomery from the Ventura County Waste 
Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members alleged there was a conflict of interest with Montgomery 
serving on the commission while lobbying for the initiative. They also hinted 
that Montgomery, a Moorpark city councilman who is running for a supervisor's 
seat, was receiving financial support from proponents of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Moorpark's City Council meeting Wednesday, Montgomery again denied that 
he has received donations from Taconic Resources of San Diego County, the 
company working on the initiative, and Waste Management Inc., the company that 
drew up the plans for the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone one can look at my campaign finance statements and see that I haven't 
received a dime from Taconic Resources or Waste Management," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery asked the City Council to consider removing him, but council 
members unanimously rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the coalition) has a problem with Montgomery, they'll have a problem with 
any one of us," Moorpark City Councilman John Wozniak said. "We've all signed 
the initiative, and we all support it."

ELECTIONS / GOP POLITICS; COMMITTEE MODERATES FEAR RIGHT WING THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moderate Republicans who dominate the local party's organization are bracing 
for what they say is a quiet campaign by conservative Christians to regain 
control of the GOP's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Larkin, chairman of the Ventura County Republican Party Central Committee, 
contends that about a dozen of the 29 candidates vying for seats on the 
committee are members of the religious right wing, determined to advance an 
antiabortion agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 Larkin and other incumbents have mounted a $5,000 advertising campaign to give 
voters a slate of "responsible" Republicans for the 19 seats up for grabs in 
Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone on that slate agrees that the primary purpose of the Central 
Committee is to work together to elect Republican candidates nominated in the 
June primary," Larkin said. "We don't want to get into single-theme issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But those candidates who are not on Larkin's list denied that they will focus 
on abortion and other controversial issues if elected to the board. While many 
admit they have been urged to run and have strong personal beliefs opposing 
abortion, they say the Central Committee is not the place to debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned that lesson two years ago, when a majority of the conservative 
Christians were ousted by voters, said candidate Jonathan Payne. Now, Payne 
said, he would be content to vote his antiabortion stance at the party's state 
convention, where such issues are routinely debated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days are done when the Central Committee is going to push a social 
agenda," Payne said, "unless something really crazy happens, like they start a 
euthanasia program for California." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne, 38, is a member of two conservative county groups, the Christian 
Coalition and the New Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said he was encouraged to run "because I am a hard worker" and would be 
a "conservative vote at the state convention" set to be held in September in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other candidates left off Larkin's slate also denied that they are part 
of any organized effort to take over the Central Committee. But many said they 
differ with Larkin's view that the committee should never stray from its 
principal chore of party building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have my opinions and view, and I am going to vote my conscience if 
anything comes up," said candidate Michael Ballard, 29, an aircraft electrician 
for the California National Guard and a member of the First Baptist Church in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates bluntly say that the Central Committee can and should be used 
to promote a socially conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Said candidate Matt Noah, 36, a Simi Valley member of the Christian Coalition: 
"If serving (on the committee) isn't about an ideology, we're not different 
from the Democrats or the Greens or anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1990, it was often difficult to find 22 candidates to fill all the 
seats available on the Central Committee, said Larkin, a longtime Republican 
activist in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire committee faces election every two years. Traditionally, its focus 
has been on basic party-building functions such as registering voters, raising 
money and organizing get-out-the-vote drives on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also endorses candidates and oversees the activities of the 
various Republican clubs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats also have a county Central Committee, but did not draw enough 
candidates to warrant an election this year. All candidates who applied will 
automatically win seats in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems on the GOP Central Committee started in 1990, when a conservative 
Christian faction won a majority of seats. The group's leader, Bill Jones, 
triggered controversy when he expressed sympathy for former Ku Klux Klan leader 
David Duke's gubernatorial campaign in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Jones ousted as chairman, infighting plagued the committee for two 
years. The more moderate wing of the party was outraged when some committee 
members held a candlelight prayer vigil after a meeting in January, 1992, to 
commemorate the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 And the new Christian members tried, but failed, to pass a resolution 
officially asking the California Republican Party to include a constitutional 
ban on abortion in the state party platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly publicized squabbles within the party dried up political donations 
and the committee was nearly bankrupt when voters ousted the Christian 
conservatives in favor of moderate Republicans, Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough of the conservatives are elected, even if they fail to win a 
majority, they could disrupt meetings by trying to pass resolutions on heated 
social issues, Larkin said. And that could turn off the spigot on contributions 
all over again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't like to send money to a controversy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 17 months, Larkin said, the Central Committee has raised $38,000, 
refurbished the local party's Camarillo office and assembled a computerized 
list of the county's Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 That will allow the committee to give candidates precinct lists and mailing 
labels at cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin said he thought the group's problems were over until a flurry of 
candidates with unfamiliar names began filing candidacy papers a few days 
before the deadline. Before then, mostly incumbents had sought reelection, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the sudden, 10 or 15 new names showed up on the lists. And just from 
what they have been saying in public, it would appear it is an effort to take 
back the majority of the Central Committee." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 people listed on a slate mailer sent to 20,000 Republicans who are 
likely to vote on Tuesday were selected because they are committed to 
fulfilling the party's tasks, Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 19 seats are up for election because only one candidate qualified for the 
district with three seats representing Oxnard. As the only candidate, Nancy 
Shook automatically wins and the committee will appoint members to the two 
other seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Committee districts follow the lines of supervisorial districts and 
the number of seats available is based on population. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the first-time candidates said they are running simply because the 
incumbents' performance is lacking, especially in registering voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Tom Lee, 19, a Thousand Oaks business student and part-time worker 
at a tool firm, said he is concerned with a recent drop in Republican 
registration. According to the county registrar of voters, Republicans have 
lost 2,313 registered voters since January, while Democrats have gained 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Republicans still hold the edge in overall registration by 5,332 voters, 
with 147,084 on the rolls, the figures show. Lee said he is concerned about the 
GOP's lead narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not seem like much, but in politics, it can mean the difference 
between victory and defeat," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin said most of the Republicans' loss comes from older, taxpaying 
residents moving out of the county, a contention that the county's assistant 
registrar of voters supports. But Larkin confesses that the committee has 
lagged in registration efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership body plans to concentrate its efforts during the remainder of 
1994 on signing up new Republicans, he said.

2 MEN PLEAD GUILTY IN CUT-RATE AIRLINE TICKET SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Technology has made possible many things, as any con man can attest. For 
instance, thanks to science you can now steal almost anything: phone numbers, 
credit, whole identities. 
</P>
<P>
 But turning technology into ill-gotten gain still requires the same 
old-fashioned and risk-prone grifting skills. Which is how two Los Angeles area 
scalpers of cut-rate plane tickets ended up convicted this week on a 
long-running, multimillion-dollar scam involving stolen phones, faked 
identities, credit card numbers pinched from the trash at a rental car firm, 
and a phony claim that they were doctors whose transplant patients needed 
emergency transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate cases, Keith Wayne Thompson, 39, of Compton and Roderick Shawn 
Williams, 34, of Lakewood pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to 12 and 
11 counts, respectively, of wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the two unemployed men had been scalping stolen plane tickets 
as far back as 1987, and their arrests were the result of a long-term 
investigation by the U.S. Secret Service into the unauthorized use of credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Larson said the two men knew each other, and ran 
virtually identical operations, but did not appear to be in business together. 
Their network of operatives, runners and middlemen was extensive, Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the counts to which they pleaded guilty amounted only to a little 
over $26,000 in fraud, the two men and their associates were running a variety 
of scams that cost the airlines as much as $13.5 million in the past six years, 
Larson said, citing Secret Service and airline estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent most of the money they made on cars and luxuries," Larson said. 
"So they don't have a big bank account with which they can make restitution. 
The money is gone, and the airlines and travel agents and credit card companies 
are left holding the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson said that Thompson, who has prior convictions for forgery and credit 
card fraud, obtained discount airline tickets by calling travel agencies near 
hospitals, using one of several cellular phones that had either been stolen or 
encoded with a "cloned" computer chip bearing someone else's telephone billing 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Posing as "Dr. Tom Powers," Larson said, "(Thompson) would tell the agent that 
my patient so-and-so has a transplant operation, and needs to fly immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Larson said, Thompson would give the agent the "patient's" credit card 
number over the phone -- reading the name, number and expiration date from a 
credit slip he or one of his operatives had pilfered, usually from a trash bin 
at an Avis Rent-a-Car outlet in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely was the "doctor" questioned, Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, Thompson would resell the tickets for as much as 70% of face 
value. His clients were people who had heard of him by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and Williams ran little risk of capture because their customers used 
the tickets before the credit card holders realized they had been wrongly 
charged, the prosecutor said. Investigators had difficulty tracing the sale 
because the names and the phone numbers they had left with travel agents 
belonged to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the number of complaints involving the scam drew the attention of 
the Secret Service, Larson said, and with the aid of telephone wiretaps and 
surveillance, the two were caught and they confessed.

NEW OFFER PRESENTED TO CITY BY POLICE UNION; LABOR: THE COMPROMISE CONTRACT 
PROPOSAL MAY SIGNAL A WILLINGNESS TO END THE LENGTHY DISPUTE, SOME OFFICIALS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Softening its position, the Los Angeles police union presented a compromise 
offer to city negotiators Thursday that is less than the $75-million 
compensation package it demanded last month but is still well above the $40 
million that the city says is available, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides remain well apart, but some officials said the movement in the 
union's position signaled a willingness to end the dispute. The union's 
counteroffer, which amounts to just under $55 million, includes a 1.25% bonus 
for patrol officers, a $1,000 cash bonus for all officers and an 8% raise over 
the next two years, sources said. The raise would come in four 2% intervals in 
July of this year, January and July of 1995 and January of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offer that we have sent back is a step forward," said union President 
Danny Staggs. "We have given something and now we expect the city to give 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 City and union officials had previously agreed to a $40-million package with 
3% raises over each of the next two years. But union members overwhelmingly 
rejected that package two weeks ago, demanding additional pay for the two years 
that they have worked without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, union negotiators have revised their request for retroactive 
pay and are instead asking for a one-time cash bonus for officers. The amount 
of such a payment remains a major point of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the city had offered to bring in a mediator to help settle 
the dispute. The union turned down the request, prompting the city to say it 
intended to declare an impasse. Such a stalemate would send the dispute to 
state labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials would not say they were any closer to a deal after emerging 
from daylong meetings Thursday, but no impasse was officially declared by day's 
end. The union saw that as a positive sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city decided to stop acting like the bully on the block and to start 
listening," said union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield. "That's a good sign. We 
need peace on the playground right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, discontent among rank-and-file police officers erupted into action 
against Police Chief Willie L. Williams on Wednesday, as officers began 
circulating a petition declaring their lack of confidence in his leadership and 
personally attacking his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was launched by officers in the Rampart Division and more than 
200 signatures were gathered within a few hours Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer who helped draft the petition said it reflected widespread 
disillusionment among officers with Williams and his two-year administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of being a stepchild," said the officer, who asked not to be 
identified. "Momentum is building. Anger is building. We've been pushed in a 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition asks officers to sign and return the document to the union by 
June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the chief "a political pawn instead of a chief who is a leader," the 
petition cites Williams' failure to pass a California peace officers' exam and 
accuses him of failing to respond in a timely way during the January 
earthquake, when he was trapped in his home for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the petition urges officers to return the petitions to the union, 
league officials disavowed any role in drafting or circulating it. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders last year considered calling for a no-confidence vote on 
Williams but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had no comment on the petition.

UNCOMMON DENOMINATOR; MATHEMATICIANS GATHER IN HONOR OF A COLLEAGUE FEW COULD 
EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At first it didn't seem to add up. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would 200 of the world's top mathematicians travel at their own expense 
from two dozen countries to camp out in a cramped dormitory east of Los Angeles 
and spend four days at a conference talking about differential equations? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Stavros Busenberg was their common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
 Busenberg was a mathematics professor at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont when 
he died a year ago of Lou Gehrig's disease at age 51. But even in the arcane 
world of higher mathematics, he was unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "His reputation was enough to get me here," said Eduardo Berretta, a professor 
at Urbino University in Italy who came to discuss mathematical models for drug 
administration that utilize Busenberg's concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Busenberg held a black belt in judo, but cultivated delicate wine grapes in 
his back yard. He could recite poetry in five languages and loved opera -- but 
could drop everything for a strenuous bicycle ride or game of squash. He could 
chat as easily with overalls-clad workers on a noisy jet engine assembly line 
as with black-robed academicians cloistered in ivory towers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the classroom, he taught students that hard-core mathematics forms the 
basis of modern industry -- and he backed that up by wrangling student 
sponsorships from local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lab, he challenged colleagues to put their numbers to work for man, not 
machine. He devised ways of applying math to population and ecological 
problems. He was a trailblazer in mathematical biology -- concocting numerical 
models that could forecast the spread of infectious diseases and the growth of 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Busenberg shared his work with anyone who wrote, called or messaged him by 
computer E-mail. He shared the glory, too: More than 30 co-authors are listed 
in papers and books that he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematicians equated Stavros Busenberg with genius. And role model. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why there wasn't a single plastic pocket protector in sight 
Thursday as his friends gathered to discuss topics as diverse as "the 
one-dimensional hydrodynamic model for semiconductors" and "the probability of 
tumor cure after fractionated radiotherapy" and "roguing and replanting in 
orchards." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here was affected in one way or another by Stavros," said Courtney 
Coleman, a Harvey Mudd math professor who worked for two decades with 
Busenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was absolutely world-class," said John Ockendon, a mathematician from 
Oxford University in England who praised Busenberg's efforts to link the math 
classroom with American industry as pioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference participants huddled in groups, some meeting colleagues they had 
corresponded with for years for the first time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised this many people are here," said Carlos Castillo-Chavez, 
professor of biomathematics at Cornell University in New York. "Stavros was 
interested in everything." 
</P>
<P>
 That showed at the lecture on the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis 
delivered by Pauline van den Driessche, a professor at the University of 
Victoria in Canada. Not only was she incorporating his teachings, she told the 
crowd. She was using his lecture style as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day International Conference on Differential Equations at Harvey Mudd 
College may become a biannual event, said Courtney Coleman, a math professor at 
the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sessions could help subtract from the myth of the mathematician as a nerd 
-- an eccentric who spends a lifetime poring over numbers and rarely sees 
sunlight or ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be an isolating profession. A lot of mathematics is done in a room by 
yourself," said Ann Sitomer, a graduate math student from Arizona State 
University. "If you're by yourself for 20 years, you can come out strange. Some 
mathematicians seem to be on a different planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematicians need to become more visible as a group, said Fern Hunt, a 
researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology from Silver 
Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who struggled just to finish high school algebra should realize that 
math now plays a role in every facet of their lives, "except probably morals 
and issues of courage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's something Stavros Busenberg deduced early on.

HOSPITAL CRIMES; EX-CLERK GETS JAIL TERM IN CREDIT CARD THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cadillac blindsided 84-year-old Ruth Mauch as she drove to a hair 
appointment in December. And a clerk blindsided her at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauch was unconscious and clinging to life when paramedics rushed her to St. 
John's Regional Medical Center on Dec. 18 after her car was hit on Oxnard 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 As doctors worked to save the widow, an emergency room clerk was busy stealing 
two of her credit cards, eventually racking up close to $1,700 on them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Mauch, walking with the aid of a cane, appeared in Ventura County 
Superior Court as the clerk was sentenced for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Elaine Peralta, 26, of Oxnard was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 48 
months' probation after pleading guilty to four counts of theft for using 
stolen credit cards. She also has been fired from her job at the hospital, 
where she worked for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Peralta rang up more than $10,000 worth of clothing and other 
merchandise with credit cards swiped from emergency-room patients during the 
past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Mauch said she didn't much understand all the legal talk that 
took place in the courtroom. But what her many years of life have taught her, 
Mauch said, is that it is wrong to steal -- especially from defenseless people 
like those wheeled into an emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was brought into the hospital unconscious after a very serious accident," 
Mauch said. "They took me in through Emergency, and she's the one who handles 
all your valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hit on Dec. 18, and on the 20th, she's shopping," said Mauch. "Who 
would think somebody is going to rob you in the hospital?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mauch, a retired clerk in the Los Angeles County assessor's office, said 
Peralta charged $1,544 to her May Co. charge card. She charged a much smaller 
amount to Mauch's Mervyn's card, Mauch said, and pocketed $80 in cash that 
Mauch was carrying when admitted to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took three 20s, two 10s and left me with $7," Mauch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta's job duties required her to take an inventory of the personal 
belongings of patients who were unconscious when admitted to the emergency 
room. None of the alleged victims ever complained to them, hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An informant who does not work at the hospital found a number of stolen credit 
cards in February and alerted authorities, police say. Peralta later turned 
herself in, Oxnard police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta originally was charged with 10 felony counts, but six charges were 
dismissed in the plea negotiation. Peralta's attorney suggested in court 
Thursday that his client stole to deal with her personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument did not go over well with Mauch. "If anybody has emotional 
stress, it's me. She didn't know if I was going to live or die," said Mauch, 
who suffered a broken collarbone, cracked ribs, a fractured leg and a 
concussion in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for leniency, Deputy Public Defender William S. Markov told Judge 
Charles R. McGrath that Peralta has suffered two pregnancy miscarriages since 
October, 1992. Her 4-year-old son also was diagnosed with leukemia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markov said Peralta is "a victim of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary K. Barrett disagreed, saying Peralta deserved six 
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the notion that the tragedies Peralta faced caused her to steal on 
impulse, Barrett said the defendant's actions were part of her lifestyle. 
"Based on the amount of sophistication and the amount of money in this case, I 
would suggest that 90 days (in jail) is not enough," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath gave Peralta until Sept. 7 to turn herself in to authorities. The 
extra time is for her to get psychological and emotional counseling, he said.

2 EX-INSPECTORS ACCUSED OF FAKING FEMA REPORTS; CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY AS MANY 
AS 70 PROPERTIES WERE NEVER VISITED. MEANWHILE, 13 PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED FOR 
ALLEGEDLY FILING FALSE QUAKE CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former FEMA earthquake damage inspectors have been accused of fabricating 
inspection reports on as many as 70 properties they never visited after the 
Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the faked reports, federal prosecutors said Thursday, some 
homeowners and tenants were denied thousands of dollars in benefits they should 
have gotten, and others received more than they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaints -- the first to target earthquake inspectors -- were 
announced as federal authorities carried out a new round of arrests of 
individuals who allegedly filed false claims for quake relief with FEMA or with 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen people, most of them from the San Fernando Valley -- and including 
two mother-daughter pairs -- were accused of collecting up to $12,150 by 
falsely claiming they lived in severely damaged homes or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious charges, however, were brought against inspectors Phyllis 
Hawkins, 36, of Moreno Valley and Eugene Dolezal, 69, of Denver. Both worked 
for Vulcan Services Inc., one of two private firms hired by FEMA to conduct 
thousands of inspections, for $39 each, as follow-ups to applications for 
assistance filed by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials became suspicious of Hawkins' work after a bewildered Mission 
Hills homeowner sent back a $3,545 check he had received "and explained that 
his home had not yet been inspected," according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite never visiting the home or speaking to the owner, Hawkins wrote a 
report detailing damage to a sliding glass door, microwave oven and television 
-- when, in fact, the oven and television emerged unscathed and "the home did 
not have a sliding glass door," the charges state. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, she allegedly reported that a homeowner's electric fan was 
damaged, when there was none in the house, and that walls needed "Sheetrock 
replacement" -- when the walls were made of plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hawkins was formally charged with six instances of filing false 
reports, she has since admitted "that she made up 10 to 20 FEMA inspection 
reports," federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, who was arrested Thursday, faces up to 30 years in prison if 
convicted on all counts of filing false reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolezal was accused of filing nine false reports but admitted "to not visiting 
approximately 50 damaged residences . . . he claimed to have inspected," 
prosecutors said. In all, Dolezal submitted 643 inspection reports, according 
to federal records. 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, routine follow-up inspections by FEMA officials apparently 
uncovered the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolezal, who is scheduled to surrender to federal authorities in Denver, faces 
up to 45 years in prison if convicted on all counts. When confronted by FEMA 
officials, he reportedly explained that he had inspected the outside of the 
structures in each case but failed to go inside because "these inspections 
involved a red-tagged building, which was inaccessible." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said the structures were not red-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake assistance applicants told investigators that Dolezal had spoken to them 
over the phone, then asked them to come to the Van Nuys motel where he was 
staying to sign the appropriate forms. The result was "large errors in his 
evaluation of the applicants' damages," the criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't get enough and others should not be getting as much as they 
are," explained Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman. The cases are being 
rechecked to correct the errors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors also are continuing their investigation to determine if 
other FEMA inspectors "may have committed similar fraudulent acts," Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins told investigators that she could not afford to conduct inspections in 
all cases because she was working out of her Moreno Valley home and "wasn't 
being paid enough to keep coming into Los Angeles," Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $39 that FEMA paid Vulcan Services for each case, employees such as 
Hawkins and Dolezal received from $22 to $25 for each inspection, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake required a small army of inspectors to help in the 
various government assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year veteran of insurance adjusting, Dolezal said he was hired by Vulcan 
and received two days of training in Redwood City before moving to the motel in 
the hard-hit San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaint alleges that, unlike Hawkins, he at least spoke by 
phone with the quake victims assigned to him after they filed applications for 
FEMA grants. 
</P>
<P>
 One Northridge apartment dweller told investigators that, during their 
conversation, Dolezal explained that "since she lived within a specific ZIP 
Code area, it was unnecessary for FEMA to visually inspect her dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the woman was notified by FEMA that -- based on Dolezal's report -- she 
was not eligible for disaster funds. After she filed an appeal, however, her 
case was reviewed -- and she was found eligible for $2,300 in emergency housing 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Dolezal may have missed evidence of fraud, the complaint 
alleges. If he had inspected another Northridge apartment, "he would probably 
have learned that FEMA received five separate applications from this 
three-bedroom apartment . . . (and) paid $625 twice for the damaged kitchen, 
$2,700 for three bedroom claims . . . and $600 for a dining room that . . . did 
not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hawkins, in contrast, it was not the aid applicants but the inspector 
herself who allegedly invented damage, as in the case of a Mission Hills couple 
who she said deserved $6,655 in grants. The couple later told investigators 
that, in fact, "their vacuum cleaner, washer, refrigerator and kitchen range 
had not been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Emmitt L. Adams, a 74-year-old retiree, also of Mission Hills. 
He sent back the $3,545 check he received, alerting FEMA that his home had 
never been inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want money for something that doesn't belong to me," Adams said 
Thursday. "I knew it couldn't be mine. . . . I didn't know what I was entitled 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hawkins and Dolezal are the first two inspectors charged, 39 other 
cases have been brought by the federal task force set up to check for fraud in 
the earthquake relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's arrests, 29 FEMA applicants have now been charged with filing 
false claims, totaling more than $100,000. Two SBA loan applicants have been 
accused of fraudulently seeking more than $1.5 million, and eight retailers 
have been charged with illegally exchanging food stamps.

CLASSICAL AFFAIR; AFICIONADOS, MERCHANTS UPBEAT OVER OJAI MUSIC FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Beneath the sprawling oaks and gnarled sycamores that frame Libbey Park's tiny 
outdoor amphitheater, some of the nation's top musicians will perform this 
weekend, transforming Ojai's public park into a world-class concert venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual arrival of the Ojai Festival, which starts tonight and continues 
through Sunday, draws thousands of classical music fans each year, from picnic 
basket-wielding locals vying for lawn space to foreign visitors attracted by 
the event's avant-garde musical lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three-day event brings more than just culture to the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the town's largest tourist attractions, the festival is always music to 
the ears of downtown merchants, whose cash registers chime allegro throughout 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are our absolutely biggest days in the tearoom and the biggest days of 
people walking through the store," said Andrea Bloom, owner of Tottenham Court, 
Ltd., an English tearoom and boutique. "We do at least a quarter more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai resident Khaled Al-Awar, who owns an art gallery and men's clothing store 
in Ojai's downtown Arcade, said business always picks up during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it does impact in a very positive way," he said. "Since it is an 
artistic event, and we happen to have an art gallery, there is some commonality 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of the festival's board of directors, Al-Awar said he hasn't 
always liked the festival's novel music but has always enjoyed the weekend 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of faces from our community and the neighboring areas," said 
Al-Awar, who has attended the festival for the last 11 years. "I try not to 
miss it. I'm very proud that Ojai can play such an important cultural role." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Festival was started in 1947 to provide an intimate, informal concert 
setting for both audience and musicians. It has since garnered a reputation as 
a place for adventurous new music and rarely performed pieces to be showcased. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Michael Tilson Thomas will conduct three concerts with the 
Miami-based New World Symphony. In addition, the symphony's brass quintet, 
chamber players and percussion ensemble will play separate concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the interesting thing about this festival is we've always had the 
tops in the music world -- Stravinsky, Copland. It's sort of a launching 
point," said Joan S. Kemper, executive director of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the music and international arts community, we're known all over the 
world," she said. "We're known more there than in Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most seats in Libbey Bowl are sold out for the concerts, Kemper said 
some individual seats are still available and a "couple hundred" spaces remain 
open on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people are expected to attend this year's three-day concert 
series, a small number in comparison to other prominent music festivals but 
enough to increase the city's population by about 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Manor Hotel owner Mary Nelson said reservations for this weekend were 
booked a year in advance by several returning festival fans from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had the same people coming back for about seven years," Nelson said. 
"They're all from L.A., mostly people involved in the arts, patrons of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year they say, 'Hold a room for us next year,' " said Nelson, whose 
tiny six-room bed-and-breakfast is a block from Libbey Park. "I don't make any 
more money than any other weekend, but it's kind of a tradition." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Festival begins tonight with an 8:15 p.m. concert and continues 
through the weekend. Tickets for seats in Libbey Bowl range from $35 to $20 per 
concert. It costs $15 to sit on the lawn. At 10 a.m. on Saturday, there will be 
a special family concert featuring the percussion ensemble. Tickets for that 
concert are $10 for adults and $5 for children 16 and under. For information, 
call 646-2094.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ALTADENA; FIREFIGHTERS 
HOLD PRACTICE ON SITE OF DEVASTATING BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of firefighters gathered near Altadena on Thursday to practice fire 
suppression techniques in the area where thousands of acres of brush and 
several hundred homes burned last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters, from the Los Angeles County, Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena 
fire departments, planned a two-hour "wild land brush drill" that included 
water drops by helicopters, said county fire Inspector Rick Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 The drill was conducted near the site of the Altadena fire that started Oct. 
27, when winds whipped out of control a campfire that a transient had started 
to keep warm.  
</P>
<P>
 In that blaze and in the Calabasas-Malibu fire, which started Nov. 2, 22,000 
acres of brush were burned, Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in the county, about 50,000 acres of brush burned, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest brush fire occurred overnight in the Lancaster area, when 130 acres 
were blackened in a blaze evidently sparked by an explosion in a house being 
used as an illegal drug laboratory.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; REPORT 
SHOWS HOW LEANER SCHOOLS CAN CUT MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District could save up to $17 million next year 
by modernizing its inefficient bureaucracy, a report by Supt. Sid Thompson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings would come from streamlining operations and applying the computer 
age to antiquated business practices, said William Magee, the district's newly 
appointed finance czar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an organization that is basically in the '60s from a standpoint of 
systems operations," said Magee, a retired Atlantic Richfield Co. finance 
executive who was hired three months ago to inject business savvy into district 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money is paltry compared to the district's $3.9-billion budget, 
school officials said it represents some progress in unfettering the Downtown 
administration, which was described last year in a scathing management audit as 
slow-moving and inefficient.

PASSENGERS DIE IN CRASH

<P>
 On almost any Wednesday night for the past two years, JoKema Du Bois, 15, and 
her 14-year-old sister, Barbara, would either call their pastor for a ride or 
get their grandmother to drop them off for youth night at a church in Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were too young to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, JoKema hopped into the driver's seat of her grandmother's 
Chrysler LeBaron anyway. Piling in behind her were Barbara and several friends: 
Gena Watkinson, 15, Alicia Acevedo, 14, and 3 1/2-year-old Jesica Noell, who 
lived with a boarder in the Du Bois home. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone put seat belts around Jessica in the back seat, but she was not 
restrained in a child safety seat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, after the girls had listened to a sermon on eternal life, 
police said JoKema lost control of the car, sideswiped a pickup truck and 
slammed head-on into a second truck. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the night, JoKema and Gena were dead, and Barbara and Alicia 
were hospitalized in critical condition. Jesica died Thursday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Three people in the vehicles they hit were not seriously injured, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 8:30 p.m. on a straight stretch of Seco Canyon 
Road near Santa Clarita Park, where JoKema lost control of the car, said 
sheriff's Deputy Mark Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharron Eineke, a Saugus resident, said she was driving her pickup west on 
Seco Canyon Road when she noticed JoKema's car swerving between two lanes. 
Eineke said the car crossed the center divider and she could do nothing to 
avoid a collision. JoKema's carstruck Eineke's truck in the left lane and then 
collided with a Toyota Land Cruiser in the right lane, authorities said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAMPLING A SOLUTION; 
GORE GETS TASTE OF GRASS-ROOTS ENTERPRISE AT EASTSIDE BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore on Thursday praised youths and community leaders 
gathered at Dolores Mission in Boyle Heights for their efforts to create jobs 
and services in their neighborhood without government help. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore came to Los Angeles specifically to tour the Homeboy Industries bakery 
and the church's child-care center, which was built by homeboys in 1992 and is 
staffed by local mothers. The vice president toured the Eastside projects in an 
effort to gather information for a new federal program that will allow 
communities to create ways to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later this year, you're going to be hearing a lot more about (community 
empowerment)," Gore told the crowd. "One of the reasons I'm here today is to 
learn from the successes you have provided with these projects that come from 
the grass roots and are based on ideas within the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery, which was created as part of the Dolores Mission's Jobs for a 
Future program, is being renovated by onetime gang members and other homeboys. 
When the bakery reopens in August, it will employ about 20 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the vice president was interested in coming here because Dolores 
Mission hasn't waited for the federal government to rescue us with programs," 
said Father Gregory J. Boyle, director of the Dolores Mission's jobs program, 
which was founded in 1990 by Boyle and members of the church's Comite pro Paz 
en el Barrio (Committee for Peace in the Barrio). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've created jobs on our own. . . . Fifteen homeboys built the child-care 
center and the bakery now hires seven homeboys and will employ three times that 
number when it opens. Jobs reduce crime. Jobs make communities safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Before answering questions from community members, Gore chatted with children 
at the child-care center, giving them high-fives and complimenting them on 
their artwork.  
</P>
<P>
 "His coming here is a new experience for us," said Mario De La Cruz, who works 
at the bakery and gave Gore a Homeboy T-shirt. "I think it's good for people on 
the top like that to see how we live over here." 
</P>
<P>
 During a round-table discussion, Comite Pro Paz member Esperanza Vasquez told 
the vice president in Spanish that the federal government must work on creating 
jobs for youths, rather than building prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen that crime is reduced when there are more jobs," she said 
through an interpreter. "I have talked to many of these kids and what they tell 
me is that they need help getting a job so they can support their families and 
pay their rent. We need support for these efforts that we have started, but we 
can't finish them unless we have the support from people like you who have the 
power." DIANE SEO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TEAMWORK IS CRUCIAL AT THIS SCIENCE 
FAIR

<P>
 Crowding around a five-foot pyramid of plastic straws, straight pins and red 
clay, 8-year-old Joseph Jing and his teammates argued about how to make their 
"straw scraper" stand taller without tipping over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need support! We need support!" shouted Joseph, as the needlelike 
structure wobbled to one side. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third-graders at Ladera School in Thousand Oaks, the race to build the 
tallest tower was just one of a dozen events in Thursday's daylong Science 
Olympiad. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after a similar program in Simi Valley, the Olympiad is designed as a 
carnival-like alternative to the traditional science fair. Rather than 
conducting experiments independently, the youngsters competing in the Olympiad 
must work together to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to building free-standing straw towers, students built a cardboard 
roller coaster for marbles, designed a car propelled by wind and fashioned a 
boat from aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the activities seemed more fun than academic, Ladera teacher 
Teresa Coffman said each one demonstrates a scientific principle or fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that science is very dry and very boring," she said. 
"With this, students are solving problems the way engineers and people who use 
science in the real world would. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes the kids scientists," Coffman added. While the straw towers taught 
the students engineering principles, the Naked Egg Drop taught the students 
about gravity and mass. 
</P>
<P>
 From weeks of experiments with their groups at home, each team developed a 
"landing pad" intended to cushion an egg dropped from a height of up to 30 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials for the pads ranged from cut-apart mattresses to sponges and a mound 
of cooked white rice. 
</P>
<P>
 For sixth-grader Kari Green and her teammates, the secret to success was a 
gooey mixture of spaghetti, red Jell-O and Malt-O-Meal, all stuffed inside a 
slashed-open pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite overnight hardening of the Malt-O-Meal, the home-brew successfully 
cushioned an egg dropped from a 30-foot platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how high (the cushion) is, just how durable," said egg drop 
contestant Jill Skinner. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WARNINGS ISSUED ON MEDICATION, CANDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health officials issued separate warnings Thursday about a medication and a 
candy, both produced in Mexico, that could have toxic effects on children. 
</P>
<P>
 The medication, easily available in Mexico and some countries in South 
America, is known in Spanish as "neo-melubrina."It is used to reduce pain and 
fever in infants and young children, said Marilyn Billimek, a Ventura County 
Health Department epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the drug can cause a dangerous drop in the body's ability to fight off 
disease by causing the level of white blood cells to fall, she said. The 
medication is believed to have contributed to the deaths last year in Orange 
County of two children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the drug has not been found anywhere in Ventura County, and no cases 
involving its use have been reported to the Health Department here, people who 
have bought medication outside the United States should check it as a 
precaution, Billimek. 
</P>
<P>
 People should immediately stop using and throw out any neo-melubrina that they 
are using, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billimek also warned parents to not let their children eat a brand of candy 
called "Brinquitos." The candy, in the form of brightly colored granules, and 
its paper wrapper were found to be contaminated with high doses of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Eating one one-hundredth of a wrapper would expose a child under age 7 to 27 
times the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-recommended limit for ingestion of 
lead. Although no cases of the contaminated candy have been reported in Ventura 
County, Billimek asked the public to report any sellers of the candy to the 
Health Department at 654-4879. KAY SAILLANT

GUILTY OF MURDER IN CRASH THAT KILLED 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two brothers were convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for their roles in 
a November, 1992, car crash in Hawthorne that took the lives of three people, 
including a toddler and a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Antonio Espinoza, 20, and Alfredo Sanchez Espinoza, 18, were convicted 
by a Superior Court jury in Torrance after two days of deliberations.The 
brothers, scheduled for sentencing June 30, face possible life prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Espinozas were part of a robbery gang fleeing a shooting scene with 
Hawthorne police in pursuit when their car streaked past a stop sign and plowed 
into another vehicle, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four people in the car they hit -- 2-year-old Jameshia Perkins and 
Ida Logan, 23 -- were killed. The other two were seriously injured. Rutilo 
Aguilera, 20, driver of the getaway car, also was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Jennings, who prosecuted the case, said another 
youth believed to be connected to the case remains at large. He was identified 
as Antonio Silva, 19.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; SCHOOLS HIRE 
EX-PRINCIPAL OF NEIGHBORING DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McKinley M. Nash Sr., whose leadership of one South Bay school district ended 
in controversy four years ago, has been selected as the new superintendent of 
the neighboring Inglewood Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood school board agreed Wednesday night to hire Nash after a 
four-month search and the screening of 31 candidates, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He met the requirements that they felt they needed," said Wilson Riles, an 
educational consultant and former state schools superintendent who was hired to 
conduct the search for a superintendent for the 16,000-student district. The 
board concluded that Nash has the experience and commitment to pull the 
community together and to work cooperatively with people, Riles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash will replace George J. McKenna III, whose contract as superintendent was 
not renewed. Nash's three-year term will begin July 1, and his salary for the 
1994-95 school year will be in the range of $100,000, Riles said.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood school officials referred all questions to Riles. Nash did not 
return telephone calls. Nash served for seven years as superintendent of the 
Centinela Valley Union High School District. He was fired from that post in 
July, 1990, in a move that sharply divided the district, which had been beset 
by allegations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Centinela Valley district trustees in 1992 agreed to pay Nash $150,000 to 
settle a racial discrimination claim and two contract-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash earlier spent eight years as principal of Evanston Township High School 
in Illinois, where he also served as assistant superintendent, according to a 
district press release. He is now a professional services executive for the 
Assn. of California School Administrators.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
ASSEMBLY OKS BILL TO CLEAR WAY FOR FREEWAY EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Assembly approved a bill Thursday that would allow Caltrans to build 
the long-delayed extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena 
without that city's permission. South Pasadena officials have long opposed the 
freeway, saying it would tear the city in half and destroy historic homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, authored by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead), revitalizes a 
1982 law that allowed construction without South Pasadena's approval. Last 
year, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled that the 1982 law was void 
because its time limits had lapsed. The new bill removes those limits. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena is one of four cities on the proposed 6.2-mile extension. 
Pasadena, Alhambra and Los Angeles have given permission, but South Pasadena 
has long opposed the freeway. Construction has been stalled by that city since 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's discouraging. but it's not the end of the world," said Amedee 
O. Richards Jr., South Pasadena's mayor. Richards pledged to lobby the Senate, 
which has not acted on the bill. Meanwhile, state and federal officials must 
still approve the project and its funding.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; STAGE SHOW OFFICIALS SEEK HOST FAMILIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Temporary homes are being sought for cast members of Up With People, an 
international stage ensemble that will perform at Mission Viejo High School on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical show is sponsored by the city Rotary Club, which will use the 
proceeds to support its scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
 One of five touring casts, the musical group is composed of about 150 young 
people from 22 different countries. The performers, between 17 and 25, visit up 
to a dozen countries during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to find host families to feed, house and provide 
transportation for cast members to Mission Viejo High School between Monday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're a nonprofit organization, it's impossible for us to stay in 
hotels," group spokesman Garry Poisson said. "But it's also a great learning 
experience for the students." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the countries cast members come from include Sweden, Estonia, Poland 
and Spain, Poisson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some real interesting exchanges," he said. "The students learn 
about cultures from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The show will take place at the high school, at 25025 Chrisanta Drive, 
beginning at 7:30 p.m. The cost is $9 for adults, $7 for students and senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be purchased at the high school box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "The World in Motion," the show takes place during a mock global 
satellite broadcast and features a broad range of international and local dance 
and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the program is a medley of music from mariachi to gospel and rock. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AIDS GROUP DENIED FEDERAL FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A troubled AIDS advocacy group was shut out Thursday when the Ventura County 
HIV Consortium delivered $300,000 in federal grants to eight local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 After three straight years of federal support, AIDS Care received no money 
from a program Congress set up specifically to address the needs of 
HIV-positive people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed at the results, and we're going to appeal," said Doug 
Green, who began working Thursday as the agency's new executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the grant decision is not surprising, given the turmoil AIDS 
Care has undergone in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a Santa Barbara banker and advocate for AIDS sufferers, is the agency's 
third executive director in six months. In addition, the group has failed to 
raise enough money to support the programs it offers, one former employee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully this is a wake-up call from the consortium to AIDS Care that they 
say they have a lot of services but they haven't followed through on them," 
said Cam Keep, who resigned in protest from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Padilla, an administrator with the HIV Consortium, said the group 
based its decisions on the grant proposal submitted, rather than any personal 
knowledge of AIDS Care's programs. In the three past years, AIDS Care received 
grants totaling $53,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium, drawn from community-based organizations, distributes federal 
money that comes with the Ryan White AIDS Emergency Act and the Housing 
Opportunities for People With AIDS Act. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the funding went to Ventura County Public Health Services 
for a case management and housing assistance program costing $159,000. 
Christopher House, a home for AIDS sufferers that opened last month, received 
$37,900. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the consortium provided: 
</P>
<P>
 * $26,800 to Clinicas del Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 * $25,400 to the Ventura County Medical Center Immunology Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 * $16,100 to Livingston Memorial Visiting Nurse Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * $10,000 to the Ventura County Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * $6,800 to the county hospital's nutrition department. 
</P>
<P>
 * $3,100 to the Metropolitan Community Church of Ventura. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 3 TEEN-AGERS ARE ARRESTED IN BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley police have arrested a 17-year-old youth and two of his friends on 
suspicion of burglarizing a relative of $200,000 worth of property from the 
family home. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, who was not identified because of his age, was arrested by 
investigators Wednesday after he confessed to the residential burglary, police 
said.He also implicated 18-year-old William Green, of Tacoma, Wash., and 
another 17-year-old Simi Valley youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say the three waited until Sam Larp and his family left town on 
Saturday during the Memorial Day weekend to break into the house in the 5500 
block of Shoshone Street. 
</P>
<P>
 They ransacked the house, taking 22 rifles and pistols from Larp's gun 
collection, a laptop computer, several cameras, golf clubs, jewelry, rare coins 
and several thousand dollars in cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock. I don't know what to say," said Larp, who owns a car dealership 
in Canoga Park. "I didn't want to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Larp said his relative, who was released into his custody pending a court 
hearing, has lived with the family for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the stolen property was recovered hours after Larp reported the 
burglary Sunday morning because a homeowner a few miles away discovered the 
loot hidden in his side yard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth confessed after police confronted him, and surrendered one of the 
stolen pistols, Police Detective Joe Brimberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 17-year-old suspect surrendered to police Thursday. He was cited for 
suspicion of burglary and released to the custody of his parents, pending a 
court hearing, Brimberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, the third burglary suspect, was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail at 
Ventura County Jail on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned this morning. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; POLICE STOREFRONT PLAN HITS A SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Moorpark will delay for another two weeks a decision on whether to 
open a police storefront in a vacant city-owned building downtown, after an 
agreement with a private company to share the building and pay the rent was 
cast in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the police storefront would share space in the former bank 
building with an engineering company that performs building and safety 
inspections for the city. The company, Charles Abbott and Associates, would pay 
for repairs on the building in lieu of rent. 
</P>
<P>
 After the $30,000 to $40,000 in repairs were finished in two years or more, 
the company would begin paying rent to city. Abbott needs a larger office and 
had been looking for a downtown location. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members learned Wednesday that Abbott may rescind its offer 
to share with the police if the city follows through on a plan to perform its 
own building and safety inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that there is strong support for the police storefront," 
said councilman Pat Hunter, who first proposed the idea. "But this is dependent 
on Abbott and Associates renting the building, and if they're out of the 
picture we have to rethink how we can make this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's proposal calls for using most of the building, on the corner of High 
Street and Moorpark Avenue, to house Abbott and Associates, and setting aside 
about 120 square feet for a police substation. 
</P>
<P>
 A police cadet or civilian would be assigned to the station about 20 hours per 
week at a cost of $15,000 to $20,000 per year. Moorpark is patrolled by a 
20-member force of sheriff's deputies that operates out of the East County 
sheriff's office in Thousand Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said the plan would help increase public safety in the town and help 
local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this has to do with perceptions about safety," Hunter said. "If 
people see more police in the area, they are going to feel safer -- safer to go 
out at night, or walk downtown and go to the businesses down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the proposal again at a meeting at 7 p.m. 
Wednesday at City Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; POLICE CHIEF FORKUS WILL RETIRE MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Donald L. Forkus will retire Monday, exchange his badge for a 
fishing pole and move to the Big Sky country of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkus, 50, said recurring health problems and a wish to spend more time with 
his family prompted him to bring his 28-year career with the Brea Police 
Department to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifelong Brea resident joined the department when he was 22, was voted 
Officer of the Year at 23, and after moving up the ranks was named chief at 32. 
</P>
<P>
 He later gained statewide recognition as president of the California Peace 
Officers Assn. and as chairman of an advisory board that helped distribute 
millions of dollars in assets seized from drug traffickers to police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkus also served as an adviser to state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and 
implemented various community-based policing programs in Brea and neighboring 
Yorba Linda, which gets its police service from Brea under contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way. And when I say 'we,' I mean that," Forkus said in 
praising co-workers who helped Brea's Police Department grow from 26 sworn 
officers to 106 over the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Forkus has watched the community evolve "from a quiet little country town to a 
quiet little city town." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls when there was only one traffic light in the city and when he could 
ride horseback through citrus groves and hunt pheasant and quail in the Brea 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those days are gone," Forkus said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for changes in crime patterns over the years, Forkus said that when he 
first joined the department, narcotics arrests were on the rise because 
marijuana usage was becoming common. During the early 1970s, residential 
burglaries were "really going out of sight." That led to the creation of 
Neighborhood Watch programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, local crime is more "white collar" and high-tech in nature, Forkus 
said, citing the recent theft of $250,000 in computer chips from a business in 
northeast Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 On a personal level, Forkus admitted that the responsibilities of a stressful, 
high-profile job took their toll. One of his most trying times came when he 
made the decision to shoot a mountain lion that had wandered into a residential 
area of Yorba Linda in 1988. Even though the lion was killed to protect 
schoolchildren, Forkus received a tremendous amount of public criticism -- even 
death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Another low point occurred in 1992 when he was hospitalized with chest pains 
and upper respiratory problems. His heart proved to be OK, but he was suffering 
from stress-induced asthma and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was disappointing to me," Forkus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My doctor said, 'You really should consider hanging it up.' I wasn't going to 
argue with him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Forkus said he will now be free to spend more time with his wife, Karen, and 
three children -- Dawn, a court reporter living in Costa Mesa; Kris, a Brea 
resident who just graduated from law school, and Kenny, a police officer in 
Haywood. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Police Department, Forkus said he is confident it is as strong as 
ever. It is now headed by Capt. Jim Oman as acting chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not leaving with any agendas undone," Forkus said. "They'll do fine 
without me. And that's the greatest legacy you can leave." ALAN EYERLY

WHISTLE-BLOWER AWARDED $744,000 OVER DISMISSAL; COURTS: A JURY RULES THAT THE 
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION MISTREATED THE ANALYST. HE WAS FIRED AFTER ALLEGING 
THAT FALSIFIED DATA WAS USED TO JUSTIFY THE PURCHASE OF AN $8.6-MILLION 
COMPUTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A jury Thursday awarded $744,000 to a former computer analyst who accused Los 
Angeles County Office of Education officials of dismissing him after he alerted 
investigators about allegedly falsified data justifying the purchase of a 
multimillion-dollar computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen M. Weil, 63, won the judgment for punitive damages and for wages that he 
lost when he was dismissed from his job in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk Superior Court jury found that the county education office and 
three top administrators -- former Assistant Supt. Calvin Hall, computer 
services director Jay Stevens and assistant computer services director Robert 
Viramontes -- had harassed Weil and unfairly discriminated against him. 
</P>
<P>
 County Schools Supt. Stuart E. Gothold and assistant computer services 
director James Magill were cleared of any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment did not include fees for Weil's lawyers, estimated to be about 
$600,000. A decision on those will be made at a July 13 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict was read, Weil beamed at his wife and 2-year-old daughter, 
who stood by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did something that I thought was my civic responsibility, and for a long 
time I was mistreated," Weil said. "This verdict (says) you've got to encourage 
people to whistle-blow, but you've got to give them protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Weil, who has been out of work since he was dismissed after being an analyst 
for the county for 16 years, was characterized by county officials as a 
vindictive malcontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothold said he was disappointed by the jury's decision. The county's 
attorney, Eric Bathen, said the trial was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a jury gone wild," Bathen said, adding that he will request a 
new trial at a hearing July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a successful appeal, the decision ends a battle that began in 1991, 
when the Board of Education decided to purchase an $8.6-million computer to 
replace what administrators described as an overburdened system. The system 
processes payrolls for most public school districts in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-week trial, Weil's attorneys argued that his superiors asked 
him to provide false data implying that the old computer was operating at 
capacity and justifying the need for a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 When Weil refused, the administrators prepared their own report and presented 
their falsified data to the county Board of Education, according to documents 
submitted by Weil. The board voted in January, 1991, to purchase a new 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The falsified data said the computer "peaked at 100% or more for periods of up 
to six days," resulting in processing delays, the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Using data that Weil supplied, county auditors later concluded that the system 
was actually operating at between 54% and 72% of its capacity in the two years 
before the new computer was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Weil took his story to investigators. In his lawsuit, he contended that his 
superiors dismissed him for whistle-blowing, then justified his dismissal as a 
budget-cutting move.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, DISTRICT 3; MANY LOOK BEYOND WIN 
BY FAVORITE YAROSLAVSKY; SPECULATION CENTERS ON THE ROSTER OF HOPEFULS WHO 
WOULD RUN FOR HIS CITY COUNCIL SEAT. THE FRONT-RUNNER'S ONLY SETBACK IN THE 
COUNTY RACE HAS BEEN AN INCIDENT WHEN HE WAS SEEN REMOVING HIS RIVAL'S CAMPAIGN 
SIGNS AT AN INTERSECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It says a lot about the 3rd District County Board of Supervisors race that 
observers are talking less about whether Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky will win than they are about who will run for his City Hall seat 
when he does, with his wife mentioned as a possible aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question is, does Zev get 65% of the vote or 80%?" said political 
consultant Richard Lichtenstein. "The real focus is on who's going to be the 
next councilperson." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the city Ethics Commission is being pressed by impatient City Council 
wanna-bes to set a date when they can start raising money to run for 
Yaroslavsky's 5th Council District seat. Current rules bar fund raising until a 
special election to fill the seat -- not otherwise vacant until 1997 -- has 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
 In the voting Tuesday for the supervisorial seat, Yaroslavsky will rely 
heavily on people from the Westside and the San Fernando Valley's hillside 
portions of the district to reflexively cast their ballots for him, with some 
urging from his cash-flush campaign machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to spend $400,000 to $500,000 total," said Kevin Acebo, the veteran 
councilman's campaign manager. Still, that will be about four times as much as 
Yaroslavsky's top challenger, Don Wallace, a retired city fire captain, will 
have to spend, and it will be only about half of the $850,000 Yaroslavsky has 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glitch in this otherwise seamless story of Yaroslavsky's political 
promotion was produced by the script's own star when he was spotted removing 
several Wallace campaign signs from a busy intersection in Woodland Hills 
during the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A city worker who saw and reported the matter to police even took a photo of 
the candidate, in sunglasses and shorts, with his shirttails out. Wallace filed 
a complaint accusing Yaroslavsky of political vandalism, sought an injunction 
against Yaroslavsky going near any of Wallace's signs and called the sign caper 
a "crime against democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has said he was not trying to sabotage Wallace's signs but rather 
was gathering evidence that the signs were illegally placed on public or 
private property and lacked proper identification. The councilman subsequently 
filed a complaint of his own, asking the city Bureau of Street Maintenance to 
take steps to remove the Wallace signs if they are posted illegally on city 
property.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne denied Wallace's application for 
injunctive relief but chided Yaroslavsky for acting in a childish manner. 
Meanwhile, City Atty. James K. Hahn continued to juggle the issue of what to do 
with Wallace's criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is launching a cable TV campaign for the final weekend before the 
primary to spotlight the sign incident and cast Yaroslavsky as arrogant and 
ruthless. The incident is seen by the Wallace campaign -- frustrated by 
Yaroslavsky's fund-raising clout and Wallace's inability to engage Yaroslavksy 
in more than two poorly attended debates -- as its best bet for stalling the 
councilman's juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the eleventh-hour flap, there are few political observers who think 
Wallace, 53, can force Yaroslavsky into a November runoff. Most political 
consultants are speculating not about Zev Yaroslavsky's political prospects, 
but about Barbara Yaroslavsky's and whether she will seek his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky did not return a call from The Times asking about her 
political plans, and her husband said he has not discussed the matter with his 
wife.  
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Weintraub, the former Los Angeles school board president, and Michael 
Feuer, executive director of Bet Tzedek, a Jewish legal services organization, 
have already said they are running for Yaroslavsky's council seat. Also 
considering the race are Lea Purwin D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney; 
Carol Schatz, director of government affairs for the Central City Assn., and 
perhaps some of the losing candidates in the 42nd Assembly District race on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, such would-be candidates are waiting for Yaroslavsky to 
take over the supervisorial seat now held by Ed Edelman, who announced in 
December that he would not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running for Edelman's seat are youth counselor Elgin Trammell Sr. and 
environmental consultant Michael Hirsch. Any candidate who gets more than 50% 
of the vote Tuesday will win the seat. If none do, there will be a runoff on 
Nov. 8.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; FIRST NEW BUSINESS SINCE QUAKE TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs of economic life are returning to downtown Fillmore, where the first new 
business since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake plans to open its doors today 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch Style, Farm to Formal, a men's store offering work and casual clothes, 
will open at 327 Central Ave., a move city leaders hope will be the first step 
toward the financial recovery of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're the first one, but I think there's going to be a lot of 
(investment downtown) because that's the only way it's going to happen," Ranch 
Style owner Janet Foy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for our neighbors, who are looking at really big investments, to 
jump, they need to see some positive growth," Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this is the quickest thing we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch Style will be the second business venture for Foy. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband John, who works as a Ventura County firefighter, already 
own the Fillmore Flower Shop across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have survived the earthquake, but for the business to survive, you have 
to reinvest," she said. "You can't have just one business sitting downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Carrillo, the executive director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce, 
said he welcomes the new business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it's the beginning of a big recovery by Fillmore," Carrillo said. 
"This is the first new store to open up since we were hit with the earthquake, 
and hopefully it's not the last. We know there are some other people who are 
going to build as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said the decision to open a clothing store was a savvy move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of questions about where to buy clothes," he said. "The nearest 
place to go for something like that is Santa Paula, Ventura or Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I think the people in town will support them," he said. "It might be a 
little slow at first like every business is. But the need is definitely here." 
</P>
<P>
 Foy said Ranch Style will be open seven days a week. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 A man walking door to door in Port Hueneme claiming to be collecting money for 
children suffering from AIDS is actually running a scam, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past week, police have been investigating reports of a man who has 
collected money from Port Hueneme residents after he said he was representing a 
charity called California Christian Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity apparently does not exist, according to Port Hueneme Police 
Detective Ken Dobbe. The information that the man gave to residents included a 
false phone number and address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the public to be aware that this is going on as a warning to them, 
and so they can notify us if he makes another appearance," Dobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbe advised that people who are contacted by someone claiming to be from the 
charity should call the police at 986-6530. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MARON LAUNCHES BID FOR ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Oxnard City Councilwoman Dorothy Maron officially launched her bid 
Thursday to represent the 37th Assembly District, accusing incumbent Nao 
Takasugi of doing little since his election on behalf of his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference at Oxnard City Hall, Maron said she will do more than 
Takasugi to curb crime and joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against such urgent need, my opponent has grown tired and out of touch with 
the people of Ventura County," Maron said. "Indeed, he has little to show for 
his legislative career in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi, Oxnard's longtime mayor, was elected to the Assembly in November, 
1992. He is running unopposed Tuesday in the Republican primary in the 37th 
District, which covers most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Maron, who served on the Oxnard City Council for 12 years before losing a 
reelection bid in 1992, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have faced off before. In 1990, Takasugi soundly defeated Maron in 
Oxnard's mayoral contest. Maron said Thursday she believes the Assembly race 
will have a different outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County sorely needs a legislator with vision and accomplishment who 
will be an active fighter for our community," she said. FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; INQUIRY CONTINUES IN EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Military officials on Thursday said they are still investigating why a 
helicopter that took off from Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station was forced 
to make an emergency landing near Lake Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what happened," said Cpl.Jeff Evans, spokesman for the Marine 
Corps Air Station El Toro, where the UH-1 Huey helicopter was based. "It's 
still under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 A helicopter carrying six Marines from Camp Pendleton made a stop at Point 
Mugu and left about 6:05 p.m. Tuesday, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 p.m., the aircraft was forced to land two miles southwest of Lake 
Pyramid, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Marines were hurt during the landing, and the helicopter sustained 
minor damage, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines were scouting the area to look for a place to establish a 
communications relay site, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 A military investigation in such cases typically lasts four to six weeks, 
officials said. PEGGY Y. LEE

FULL HEALTH STUDY URGED AT ROCKWELL SANTA SUSANA LAB; CHEMICALS: PANEL MEETING 
IN SIMI SAYS INQUIRY SHOULD BE EXPANDED BEYOND JUST DOE EMPLOYEES AT SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A health study of employees at Rockwell's Santa Susanna Field Laboratory 
should look at chemical hazards faced by all the company's employees, not just 
risks to workers under contract to the Department of Energy, an advisory panel 
overseeing the study said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's two-day long meeting in Simi Valley erupted in confusion and 
dismay when when panel members discovered that a research team from UCLA -- 
under direction from DOE and Rockwell -- was planning to limit its study to 
effects of chemicals encountered by DOE workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell employees who worked under DOE contracts represent only a quarter of 
the estimated 40,000 people who have worked at the Santa Susanna site since the 
early 1950s, Rockwell officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel ordered Rockwell to release records to UCLA pertaining to all 
employees and chemical exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, begun last fall, is trying to determine if there has been an 
unusually high incidence of cancer and other illnesses among Rockwell workers 
over the years due to exposure to chemicals and low levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was commissioned in 1991, and DOE is paying its estimated $840,000 
cost. The study is being conducted by a team of scientists, headed by Hal 
Morgenstern, a UCLA professor of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Though health records and death certificates for all employees, past and 
present, are being examined by the UCLA scientists, in-depth epidemiological 
studies were to be conducted on the effects of radiation and on chemicals with 
which DOE workers came in contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Stockwell, acting director of DOE's office of epidemology said the 
scope of the study was limited because other agencies that contracted with 
Rockwell, including NASA, refused to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to include other workers," she said. "But we don't have the 
jurisdiction to make other workers participate. DOE is funding a study that has 
to do with DOE workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgenstern said he agreed to the restrictions in negotiations with Rockwell 
and DOE last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to look at everything," Morgenstern said. "But out of necessity, 
we can't. There is no way we would have the resources to cover every chemical 
used at the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hirsch, a panel member who also belongs to the community-based group 
Rocketdyne Clean-up Coalition, said the meeting increased his skepticism of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was particularly distressed that the UCLA team on its own would negotiate 
restrictions with Rockwell and DOE," Hirsch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several panel members said they believed DOE workers were not exposed to a 
number of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals that employees in the rocket testing 
area came in contact with regularly, including hydrazine, tricholoroethane and 
beryllium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hydrazines were used only in the Rocketdyne rocket-testing area," said 
community representative Sheldon Plotkin. "We in the community want to know 
about the hydrazine effects on those workers. What I want to know, is UCLA 
going to include that in this study?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Rozas, director of health and safety at Rocketdyne, the division of 
Rockwell that operates the Santa Susanna site, said he believed the company has 
cooperated fully with the UCLA team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every bit of data we have has been available," Rozas said. "We've not said, 
you can't look at this, we've only said, remember the focus is on DOE-funded 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas called the confusion a misunderstanding, and told panel members that 
Rockwell's only concern, under advisement from their legal council, was that 
the research team not be allowed to look at salary and income records for past 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Morgenstern said salary records are key to completing a thorough 
epidemiologic study. He told the panel he would return to them with 
recommendations on which chemicals the study should focus on once preliminary 
research is complete in September, 1994.

STEPS TO DEFUSE FIRE THREAT TAKE ROOT; THOUSAND OAKS: WORK IS UNDER WAY TO 
CLEAR BRUSH-CHOKED SLOPES NEAR A 400-HOUSE SUBDIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wildwood is a tight-knit, 1970s-vintage neighborhood of about 400 tract 
houses, perched on a Thousand Oaks plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped in thickets of 30- to 60-year-old brush and capped with mostly wood 
shake roofs, the hilltop subdivision also is so flammable that fire officials 
say no one could stop a fast-moving wildfire such as last November's from 
quickly destroying the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, after wading through three years of public hearings and obtaining 
numerous government permits, parks and fire officials began a massive 
brush-clearing project around Wildwood to defuse the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could take an aerial picture (of Wildwood) now and lay a picture of 
Laguna (after November's wildfires) over it, that's what it would look like 
after a wildfire here," Ventura County Assistant Fire Chief Bob Roper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the potential of this area," he said, sweeping his arm over the steep, 
brush-choked slopes that nuzzle up to the back yards along San Miguel Circle. 
"It would vent like a chimney." 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials urge homeowners in all urban-wilderness neighborhoods 
such as Wildwood to cut weeds around their homes, clean out their gutters and 
brush pine needles off their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, they are forbidden to clear all the brush off of Wildwood's 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The slopes hugging the neighborhood are part of Wildwood Park, a natural 
preserve overseen by the Conejo Recreation and Park District, protected by the 
California Environmental Quality Act and peppered with Chumash archeological 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to remove enough brush to slow a potential fire while leaving 
enough to protect the environment, said John Van Tilburg of the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 "You reduce the fuel load, and you preserve the native brush," Van Tilburg 
said. "You can imagine what it would be like to try to fight a fire on a slope 
like this. It's real tough work -- dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 So on Thursday morning, forestry crews from the Ventura School juvenile prison 
hacked with chain saws and axes through selected thickets of scrub oak and 
chaparral. The work began Wednesday and is expected to continue through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Laboring in hot, westerly breezes blowing through the canyon, inmates in hard 
hats tossed cut brush onto piles in the center of the clearings they had made. 
</P>
<P>
 The piles will be burned later on a cooler, wetter, calmer day, fire officials 
said, when the weather is safe enough for controlled burning. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews spared some clumps of brush and left mulch and stumps behind to 
fertilize the ground so the brush will continue to grow and anchor slopes 
against the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The selected cutting left a complex mosaic pattern that will be recut every 
few years as new brush grows. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the work, a fire in the neighborhood "would be impossible to control," 
said Doug Campbell, a fire behavior analyst for the Ventura County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flame front would burn right into the community, and there'd be no 
defending it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to fall back a layer of houses and defend it from there," 
sacrificing the first row of hillside houses to the fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mosaic cutting, however, will slow a fire, reduce the amount of 
wind-tossed embers hitting houses and give and firefighters a much better 
chance of protecting Wildwood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have had questions about the work, but they have been mostly 
supportive, said Terry Raley, who oversees the county's weed-abatement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are already planning to replace their deteriorating and flammable wood 
shake roofs with new roofs of flameproof tile or composites, which are required 
under a 1981 city building code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Hostetler said that when her house was built 21 years ago, she and her 
husband, Clarence, had no idea of the fire potential the neighborhood would 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, after learning of the danger, the Hostetlers replaced 
the aging wood roof of their Castillo Circle house with tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 She said of the brush-clearing, "I think it's a good idea that they're doing 
it ahead of time. . . . I imagine it's a lot of extra expense, but in the long 
run, it pays." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the program is costing the county almost nothing, Raley said. The 
inmate workers are provided free under a state program. 
</P>
<P>
 David Byars said he plans to replace his wood roof on San Miguel Circle within 
the year because of the fire hazard, but he did not know fire officials 
believed the neighborhood was in so much danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even use my fireplace, I'm afraid it could possibly start it," Byars 
said. As for the brush clearing, he said, "Who could object to that? Obviously 
that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 One homeowner said she is aware of the fire threat and grateful for the 
brush-clearing work around Wildwood, but a new roof might have to wait until 
her children finish college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frightening," said the woman, who declined to give her name. "We've been 
very fortunate where we are that we haven't been hit, but we know the danger is 
there. Anything the county . . . is doing to protect this development is 
greatly appreciated."

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; THE BEST OF TIMES FOR TITANS; BASEBALL: ROAD TO 1984 
COLLEGE WORLD SERIES WAS PAVED WITH BITTERSWEET AND COMICAL MEMORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Halfway through Cal State Fullerton's College World Series championship game 
against Texas 10 years ago, some of the 13,487 fans in Omaha's Rosenblatt 
Stadium probably had a feeling the Titans were destined for victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth inning, Longhorn center fielder Elanis Westbrooks sent a rocket 
back at pitcher Eddie Delzer, who threw up his hands in front of his face in 
self defense. The ball slammed into his glove, popped straight up in the air 
and then nestled softly into the dazed Delzer's outstretched bare hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Delzer dropped the ball on the mound and jogged to the dugout as if he had 
practiced the play all his life. But there was nothing routine about the 
Titans' 3-1 victory over Texas or their year-long ascent to the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Delzer, whose father had been murdered two years earlier during an argument at 
a party, had a picture of his dad in his back pocket and maybe an angel on his 
shoulder. An average of 16 runs per game had been scored during the 1984 
College World Series, but for seven innings the 5-foot-6, 133-pound left-hander 
bedazzled the heavy-hitting Longhorns, giving up just two infield singles in 
the first inning. Reliever Scott Wright pitched the eighth and ninth innings to 
earn an NCAA record 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the third inning, I looked over at (pitching coach) Dave Snow and 
looked at him like, 'Where did this come from?' " Coach Augie Garrido said 
Wednesday before his 1994 Titan team left for Omaha with their own champagne 
dreams. "It was not the same guy we had been seeing all year. It was a (Tom) 
Glavine-type performance, if you want to update the name to match the 
performance. He had all four pitches working at a major league level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was everything Eddie ever wanted to be and he finally had the opportunity. 
He wasn't trying to control it, he was just letting it come out, one pitch at a 
time. It was as good as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity came only after Garrido and Snow decided to bump right-hander 
Steve Rousey -- now an assistant for Snow at Long Beach State -- from the 
starting rotation in favor of Delzer, who had been used mainly in middle 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of one specific pitcher versus one specific team," Garrido 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow and Garrido reached the decision the night before the big game, but they 
didn't tell Delzer until an hour before he was supposed to throw his first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie worried a lot and had a tendency to get over-pumped," Garrido said. "He 
would have played the game 27 times before it started and been too tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Bates, now the baseball coach at Newport Harbor High, drove in John 
Bryant, now baseball coach at Los Alamitos, for the Titans' first run in the 
second inning. And Bryant's triple was the key hit in the two-run fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That final game was so great, but my memories are really a combination of the 
regionals, the World Series, the whole year really," Bates said. "It was a 
special year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, it was the best year of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were not all that special for the first two months of 1984. They 
began the Southern California Baseball Assn. season 4-3 and were 17-7 before a 
late-season winning streak carried them to the conference title and a berth in 
the regionals in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best of circumstances, a trip to Fresno could be considered a booby 
prize, but 105-degree heat made playing baseball almost unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst conditions I can recall ever playing in," Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton beat USC, 10-6, in the opening round then routed San Diego State, 
16-6. The Aztecs, however, rebounded to eliminate Fresno and then beat the 
Titans to set up a one-game battle with Fullerton for the right to play in 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans jumped out to a 7-0 lead, but the Aztecs rallied to tie the game 
and send it into extra innings. "At that point, we didn't care how it ended, 
just that it ended," one player recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a chance to win it in the 10th," Bryant said, "but we hung in the 
game. I was up fifth in the 11th. Phil Torres, who had thrown 9 1/3 consecutive 
scoreless innings in the regional and owned me in my previous three at-bats 
against him, gave up a double to (Bob) Caffrey. Then he walked Bates 
intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a really good slider, but he got one out over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's line-drive single to center drove in Caffrey and ended the four-hour 
marathon. It was a hot bus ride home, but no one was complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido and Co. arrived in Omaha with some mixed feelings, however. During 
their most recent College World Series experience in 1982, the Titans were in 
and out so fast that "we ran through our own jet exhaust on the way home," 
Garrido said. The Titans had failed to score a run during the '82 series and 
were ousted after an embarrassing 6-0 loss to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Fullerton quickly ended its 20-inning World Series scoreless string 
with a run in the first inning against Michigan. The Titans were trailing, 4-3, 
in the eighth, however, before pushing across the tying and go-ahead runs on a 
bunt single, a double, an error, a walk and a squeeze play. Blaine Larker's 
bases-loaded double made the final score, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans lost the second game to Texas, 6-4, then came back against Miami 
with a 13-5 victory that featured 14 Fullerton hits and four Hurricane errors. 
The Titans put down a total of five bunts in the four-run fourth and sixth 
innings and then scampered around the bases while Miami players chased errant 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton then eliminated top-ranked Arizona State, a team which had set 11 
World Series offensive records while beating Oklahoma State, 23-12, a few days 
earlier. Left-handers Jack Reinholtz and Delzer spun up curveball after 
curveball and combined to strike out 11 free-swinging Sun Devil batters en 
route to a 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Todd Simmons, who had a 13-game winning streak ended by Texas, 
came back to strike out seven and give up nine hits against Oklahoma State. 
John Fishel, who was named the World Series' outstanding player with 10 runs 
batted in and a .520 batting average, hit a two-run homer. Fullerton beat the 
Cowboys, 10-2, and the Titans were playing for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the other teams on paper, we definitely weren't the most 
talented," said Bates, who was the starting second baseman until Paul Sorrento 
-- the Cleveland Indian first baseman who was then at Florida State -- crashed 
into him on the basepaths near the end of the regular season. Bates suffered a 
separated shoulder and played first base in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to a lot of scouts, that was one of the most talent-laden drafts 
ever," he said. "(Cincinnati Reds' shortstop) Barry Larkin was playing for 
Michigan and Arizona State's outfield was (San Francisco's Bobby) Bonds, 
(Baltimore's Mike) Devereaux and (Texas' Oddibe) McDowell. Oklahoma State had 
(Philadelphia outfielder Pete) Incaviglia and Texas had (Houston pitcher Greg) 
Swindell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those guys are making a few dollars a year more than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant said one of the most important lessons to be learned from the 1984 
World Series -- and he reminds his players of this often -- is baseball is a 
team sport that doesn't match individuals against each other as much as it 
matches a team against the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't physically the most talented, but collectively, we were the best 
team," he said. "We used so many different guys to do it, too, players who knew 
their roles and accepted their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the little things. We caught the ball and threw the ball. Our top RBI 
guys like Fishel and Bates didn't mind bunting. We just put the ball in play 
and did the best we could. That's how we were successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido bristles at the notion the 1984 Titans were overachievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree they gave everything they had and there are not many periods of time 
in our lives where we do that," he said. "But that's not overachieving. That's 
achieving. That's fulfilling your potential. And I hope every one of them has 
since put fewer limits on themselves because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this merry band of Titan men were not into limits. Outer-limits? 
Maybe. Off-limits? Certainly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce King, now an assistant baseball coach at Brea-Olinda High, is a graduate 
of Cal State Fullerton. In 1984, he was a destitute law student who was about 
to fail the state bar exam for a third time. While he may not have been at the 
head of his class in law school, he was among the top four Titan baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 King, still known as Bruno, teamed with Mike Wilson (Toad), Mark Bazell (Bobo) 
and Jeff Ostby (The Oz) to head a group of rowdy boosters that the late John 
Rebenstorf, then the Fullerton baseball broadcaster, called the "Titan 
Taunters." 
</P>
<P>
 They had two functions: Verbally abusing opposing players during games and 
planning postgame, uh, celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that was quite a party team," King said. "I remember the time Bobo, 
Toad and I got a 40-foot RV, five barbecues and six kegs of beer and set it up 
on the blacktop next to old Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were selling hamburgers, hot dogs and beer. We didn't have any kind of 
license. Our only license in those days was to have fun. By the end of the day, 
a beer was down to 25 cents, free for players, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great day of merriment." 
</P>
<P>
 The partying got out of hand at times, though. Bryant and Caffrey missed 
curfew one night during a trip to Texas in March and were suspended for a week. 
Other members of the team received lesser forms of punishment when management 
of the hotel where the Titans were staying complained about noise and 
rowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoyed ourselves, had a real good time, but unfortunately we got bit by 
it," Bryant said. "I think that was a turning point, though, we jelled as a 
team in regard to focusing on baseball after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was 49-12 after the trip to Texas and finished the season 66-20. 
</P>
<P>
 King and Bates are calling former teammates and to set up a 10-year reunion 
this week in Omaha. Bates admits they might recount tales of wild times, on and 
off the field, but most won't need to catch up on their former teammates' 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we'd go out to, well, an establishment, it wouldn't just be a group of 
four or five guys, it would 15 or 20," Bates said. "We were really a tightly 
knit group and developed a lot lasting friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was recently over at John Bryant's house for his son's first birthday and I 
just talked to Bob Caffrey, who lives in Iowa now, the other day. And my mom 
still stays in contact with some of the other players' moms." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, too, keeps track of most of those players. And once or twice a year, 
he slips the tape in the VCR and watches his favorite feel-good film of all 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a twice-in-a-lifetime experience," said Garrido, whose 1979 team 
also won the College World Series, "and there isn't any film of the first one." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido insists it's more than just another underdog- overcomes- adversity- 
and- wins- it- all sports saga. It has an underlying message that makes him 
want to stand up and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That team captured what competitive athletics is all about," he said. 
"Teamwork, personal commitment to the team, they were driven and motivated by 
those things and I know that every one of them is stronger as a result of the 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience of that season, of winning the College World Series, means 
different things to different people, but I know it's extremely valuable to us 
all in our own ways." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains in your soul. It reaches down and grabs at the essence of your 
being."

ANGELS BET ON FUTURE WITH PICK; BASEBALL DRAFT: THEY SELECT OUTFIELDER WHO 
WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels failed to get the man atop their most-wanted list in the amateur 
draft Thursday. Blame it on McKay Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days leading up to the draft, the Angels said they wanted a 
right-handed pitcher, preferably one with college experience. The name most 
frequently mentioned was Cade Gaspar of Pepperdine and Capistrano Valley High. 
If not Gaspar, their next choice figured to be right-hander Jaret Wright of 
Katella, son of former Angel Clyde Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Angels' turn came Thursday morning, they made Christensen, a 
left-handed center fielder from Fresno Clovis West High, their No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Another changeup from the Angels, but what makes this move even more odd is 
that Christensen has signed a letter of intent to play football and baseball at 
Brigham Young. He also has announced that he will begin his two-year Mormon 
mission this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he's the first high school player to be picked in the first round 
by the Angels in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why did they take a chance on Christensen, who might not be ready to play 
in the majors until almost the turn of the century? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bob Fontaine, the Angels' assistant vice president for scouting 
and player personnel, Christensen was simply too good to pass up, even though 
Gaspar was still available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt McKay could be our guy," Fontaine said. "When he comes back (from the 
mission), he's going to go into his baseball career with a very good approach. 
That's the way we've looked at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quality runner. He's got a good line-drive swing. He's got enough 
strength to hit the ball out." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed, however, that the Angels cooled on Gaspar when they could not 
get a financial commitment from him late Wednesday and that they have already 
reached a $700,000 contract agreement with Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen was a three-year starter at Clovis West, hitting .486 (34 for 70) 
with six home runs, 23 runs batted in and 28 stolen bases in 28 attempts this 
past season. In his career, he stole 62 bases without being thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been timed at 3.9 seconds from home plate to first base and was the 
top-ranked runner, according to Baseball America's rankings. Overall, he was 
the 47th-ranked prospect and the No. 23 position player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a special kid that comes around once in a lifetime," said Clovis 
West Coach Stan Bledsoe. "He's the best player I've seen in the 24 years I've 
been coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, 5 feet 11, 175 pounds, also was a standout running back, scoring 
a state-leading 44 touchdowns and gaining a team-leading 1,759 yards for Clovis 
West's undefeated Central Section championship football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen was attending a grad night party and was unavailable for comment 
Thursday. But after announcing his decision to sign at BYU in February, he told 
the Fresno Bee that "Pro baseball is kind of a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Christensen told each major league team he will begin serving his 
two-year Mormon mission this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 That news put the Angels off at first, but they changed their minds Wednesday, 
deciding it might be worth the wait if Christensen was available. Fontaine also 
said he believed Christensen wouldn't last until the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt he was a kid who would fit in the organization well," Fontaine said. 
"We felt it was worth taking this step. Even with him leaving for two years, we 
still felt we were making the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we'll be able to sign him before he leaves." 
</P>

BAD KNICK SLIDE BEGAN LONG AGO; NBA PLAYOFFS: UPSTART PACERS HAVE A CHANCE TO 
WIN EASTERN CONFERENCE TITLE TONIGHT IN GAME 6 AT INDIANAPOLIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are more secure places where the New York Knicks could be tonight. Like 
maybe back home, in Central Park at around midnight asking if anyone can change 
a hundred. And here are the keys to the Mercedes, can you park it somewhere 
safe? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they must be in Market Square Arena for Game 6 of an Eastern 
Conference finals too many people expected them to use as a warm-up for the NBA 
championship series. Those fans had dubbed the East finals the Knicks vs. the 
Hicks.  
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are down to the Indiana Pacers, 3-2, and facing the only thing more 
alarming then Reggie Miller against a soft defense in the fourth quarter. They 
are facing elimination, questions of what went wrong after years of building 
for this moment, cries from fans and a Ginsu treatment from the tabloid press, 
who have already started. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's New York Daily News summed up the debacle of the previous night, 
when a 12-point lead at the start of the fourth quarter became a seven-point 
loss, with a two-inch bold headline: GAG CITY. 
</P>
<P>
 This has come about for more reasons than Miller, even if he did 
single-handedly outscore the Knicks in the fourth quarter Wednesday at Madison 
Square Garden in one of the greatest showings in NBA playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks were laboring long before coming here last weekend with a 2-0 lead, 
and long before the collapse started with Patrick Ewing scoring one point in 
Game 3. This team was outplayed about 70% of the time by the Chicago Bulls in 
winning the previous series. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before that, with something as significant as home-court advantage 
through the Eastern portion of the playoffs on the line, the Knicks went 6-6 to 
end the regular season, including losses to Miami, Philadelphia, New Jersey and 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it could be worse. It could be over, considering that 
Miller has the Knicks on the ropes after only two noteworthy quarters, the 
fourth in Games 4 and 5. Imagine, if he hadn't started by shooting 41.1% 
through the third quarter of Game 4 and by making only two of nine 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply have our backs against the wall," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "The 
only thing that will come out of this is that we will find out what kind of 
team we have, what we are about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling about this team. I simply believe that we are going to get 
it done. We have to lock in to what we have been locking in to for three years, 
and maybe this is how it has to be for this team. It's always been tough, it's 
always been harrowing. It has never been easy for us. If this is the way it has 
to be, then we simply have to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, for one, has no doubt they will. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood is that we are going to come back (to New York) on Sunday," he said 
in predicting a Game 7. "We are going to Indiana and win the ballgame and come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers would like to win tonight, close out the series at home and get a 
few more days' rest before opening the championship finals at Houston on 
Wednesday. Miller has even declared this their Game 7, but the luxury does 
remain that, after never having been beyond the first round since the ABA 
merger 18 years ago, they need only to split the next two games to advance. 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: NASTY G FITS MOLD OF RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas had a protection racket. Troy Aikman had pet names for da boys. He 
called them Tuey, Stepo, Geezer, Newt, Corn Dog, Big E, Vic Vines, Hell-to-Pay 
and Nasty G. 
</P>
<P>
 They were bodyguards. Their job was to keep the Cowboy quarterback safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasty G's real name is Kevin Gogan, and this week he went to work for his new 
quarterback, Jeff Hostetler. Leaving the two-time Super Bowl champions wasn't 
easy for the offensive lineman, but the Raiders made him an offer that the 
Cowboys refused to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy called me to say, 'Don't go, don't go,' " Gogan recalled during a break 
from his first day of Raider summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Wait. I'm reworking my own contract.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Aikman was willing to defer some of his own big Cowboy bucks 
to keep some of his big buckaroos from saying adios. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, Nasty G was leaving Big D. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave the Raiders my word, and my word is my word." 
</P>
<P>
 So, here he is. No longer part of that gang with Mark Tuinei, Mark Stepnoski, 
John Gesek, Nate Newton, Frank Cornish, Erik Williams, Alan Veingrad and Dale 
Hellestrae who were there in camp in 1992 when Dallas was about to begin a new 
dynasty. No longer blocking for Aikman or pulling for Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan, 29, is one of the runaways, one of the many Cowboys who abruptly chose 
to leave the top team in football. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't kid you, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan readily admits, "If Jimmy Johnson was still there, I'm sure I would be, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 However anyone else perceived the partnership between Dallas owner Jerry Jones 
and his former coach, their players were sure of one thing: Jones was a 
bottom-line guy, Johnson a between-the-lines guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson would have fought to keep him, Gogan is convinced. Same way Aikman 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tight spiral of greatest concern to Jones was inflation. His players 
found that out two games into the 1993 season, when they were 0-2 and their 
super-back Smith was still at home, watching them on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the game against Buffalo, we knew we had to get Emmitt back or else," 
Gogan remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 They did. And with Smith and Aikman leading the way -- and with Gogan at times 
leading the way for them -- the Cowboys did win another NFL championship. But 
then the coach and owner parted company. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan, valuable and versatile because he could play either guard or tackle, 
kept tabs on the teammates who followed Johnson out the door. For a while, he 
went back home to the state of Washington and waited on an offshore island for 
the word. Would the Cowboys match the Raiders' offer or wouldn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "At one point I just got completely away, no phone, no anything. I 
just said, 'Whatever happens, happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Aikman himself got through to him, his mind was made up. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were those golden days with the Cowboys, and with them the memories. 
Gogan was going back to Southern California, where he won his first Super Bowl 
ring, where Leon Lett got caught from behind, where the players partied 
afterward at the Santa Monica Civic Center, where singer Tanya Tucker got up 
and serenaded Jerry Jones, where Gary Busey got up with his guitar and did 
Buddy Holly one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every minute with Dallas had been ideal. Johnson once wanted to bench 
Gogan over the objections of line coach Tony Wise so that he could move Newton 
to left guard and install Williams at tackle. But with Jimmy, the quality of 
the team came first. Wise -- whose linemen with the funny names were known as 
the Wise Guys -- worried that Gogan might be upset. Johnson said something 
like, "Who cares if players get upset?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raiders, the 6-foot-7, 320-pound Gogan is likely to move into Max 
Montoya's spot on the line, provided the veteran retires as expected. Raider 
offensive lineman Steve Wright also retired this week, and there are holes to 
fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell, an old OL himself, figures Gogan can fill one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I like is, he is nasty, just the way we like them around here," 
Shell says. "Gogan's not somebody you want to mess with out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have a preseason date with the Cowboys, on which their new man 
will line up on the opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked who will be opposite him, Gogan smiles and says, "It would have been 
Tony Casillas, but he's gone, too. Russell Maryland, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Will that be weird? 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing against the Cowboys? It will, for a minute or two," Gogan says. "But 
this isn't a good business to form attachments. After a couple of plays, I'll 
be the same as any other Raider. We'll be the good guys and the Cowboys will be 
the bad guys."

WORLD CUP '94 / 14 DAYS AND COUNTING; THEY'RE A LITTLE SHORT IN BIG D; OF THE 
NINE WORLD CUP VENUES, ONLY COTTON BOWL IN DALLAS HAS FAILED TO POST A SELLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The World Cup is coming to Dallas, but Dallas isn't so sure it's coming to the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The city known for its expansive youth soccer program and prestigious Dallas 
Cup tournament, for its fan support of the indoor Sidekicks and for its 
Texas-sized guarantees of World Cup mania is having to explain itself these 
days. That's because of the nine U.S. venues chosen for World Cup games, only 
Dallas has failed to record a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really quite strange," said Coach Ron Newman of the Continental Indoor 
Soccer League's San Diego Sockers, an analyst for ESPN's World Cup coverage in 
Dallas. "You would have thought that would have been the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there are tickets galore for each of the six games to be played at 
the 63,998-seat Cotton Bowl. Don't ask how many, because World Cup officials 
aren't in a chatty mood when it comes to sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't tell us hard numbers," said Chalese Stachowiak, Dallas venue press 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 What they will say is that of those six games, only the one on June 27 between 
Germany and South Korea is close to a sellout. Otherwise, there are seats 
aplenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the July 9 quarterfinal is having trouble luring fans. There are three 
ticket prices -- $140, $80 and $55. So far, the "cheap seats" are the only ones 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stachowiak, not all of this is Dallas' fault. When tickets were 
distributed by World Cup organizers a year ago, 65% were allotted domestically 
for the Cotton Bowl, the other 35% reserved for foreign sales and commercial 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, England, France and Japan -- all high-profile, high-tourist 
countries -- failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. As if that didn't put 
a financial damper on things, Dallas was awarded -- if you can call it that -- 
four first-round games featuring Spain vs. South Korea, Nigeria vs. Bulgaria, 
Germany vs. South Korea and Argentina vs. Bulgaria. There's also a game on July 
3 in the round of 16, as well as a quarterfinal on July 9.  
</P>
<P>
 At last check, Germany was ranked No. 2 in the world, Argentina No. 6, Nigeria 
No. 7 and Spain No. 9. But rankings aren't the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Spain and Korea -- well, they don't have any Koreans there," Newman said 
of Dallas. "Nigeria and Bulgaria. I'm bloody sure there's no Bulgarians." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, said Stachowiak, there are an estimated 40,000 Koreans in the 
Dallas-Ft. Worth area. The problem is, they're aren't buying tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for going door to door, Dallas officials have done everything they can 
to sell the surplus made available by the foreign ticket return. Rather than 
depend solely on the World Cup 1-800 operators, Dallas organizers hired the 
services of the 55 Rainbow TicketMaster outlets here. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico would have helped. With the area's large Latino population, sellouts 
would have occurred early and often. Instead, the Mexican team is bound for 
Orlando and Washington for the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico? I'd be in heaven," said Karen Surratt, ticket manager for the Dallas 
venue. "That would have been wonderful. Unfortunately, we didn't get Mexico. We 
would have sold out in a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said that although the lack of Dallas sellouts is a mystery to him, it 
isn't unprecedented in World Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't sell out in England," he said. "They didn't sell out in Italy. 
Notoriously in the World Cup, the first games have been incredibly boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was before FIFA changed the scoring system. Victories used to 
be worth two points and ties one, but now victories are worth three points. 
Rather than play for the tie, there is now a greater incentive for a team to 
play to win an extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 The trickle-down effect of the unsold tickets and lagging interest in Dallas 
is obvious. The latest estimates of the World Cup's economic impact on Dallas 
have been reduced by more than 20%. Projections of 300,000 committed hotel room 
nights have been cut to between 100,000 and 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean the event is a financial flop. An estimated $200 million is 
expected to be pumped into the area, but Dallas officials had hoped for so much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stachowiak tries to spread the word about the joys of soccer. She 
maintains that the average U.S. sports fan only needs "a little re-education." 
</P>
<P>
 A crash course is more like it, said Randy Galloway, sports columnist for the 
Dallas Morning News and host of the city's highest-rated sports-talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the hype of the World Cup, I'm proud to say we've had one call about 
it -- and I was shocked to get that," Galloway said. "I think it's a situation 
where a lot of people here are wondering, 'Who the hell are these teams coming 
to Dallas?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway said city officials, already stung by criticism regarding a security 
fence erected at the Cotton Bowl for the World Cup, are nervous about Dallas' 
inability to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be embarrassing if it doesn't sell out," he said. 
"Embarrassing for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway said Dallas sports fans, perhaps saturated by the number of choices 
-- Dallas Cowboys, Texas Rangers, Dallas Stars, Dallas Sidekicks, Dallas 
Mavericks, etc. -- could still become World Cup soccer converts. Of course, his 
theory won't win him many admirers at FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been more interested in the World Cup if teams with a lot of 
thugs would have been coming," Galloway said. "When the English were 
eliminated, that took care of that. But the Germans can rough it up, so that 
gives us hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Great, just what the Chamber of Commerce wants: Dallas, the City of Hooligans.

WORTHY DISMISSES RETIREMENT TALK DESPITE SHARPLY REDUCED ROLE

<P>
 Despite riding the bench much of the season, Laker forward James Worthy says 
he's not contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I may have thought about (retiring) three minutes all year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy, a seven-time All-Star, started only two of 80 games. The 12-year 
veteran averaged 20 minutes and 10.2 points per game -- both lows for his 
career -- as the Lakers went to a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy said he wasn't surprised the Lakers hired former Milwaukee Bucks coach 
Del Harris to replace Magic Johnson, who took over near the end of the season 
for Randy Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing surprises me in this business," Worthy said. "They could have brought 
Santa Claus in and it wouldn't have been a surprise to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know (Harris) personally. I know he's very good at relating to 
players on a whole and individual basis. That's what we need. Young players 
need some guidance. They need somebody who is going to be firm with them. Quite 
honestly, someone who doesn't care if they like him or not."

NEWSWIRE: HEAT FINALLY RETAINS LOUGHERY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Miami Heat Coach Kevin Loughery will not only keep his job but get a raise 
after weeks of speculation the team would dump him. 
</P>
<P>
 Loughery agreed to a multi-year contract extension Sunday, the club announced 
Thursday in Miami. Terms were not disclosed, but it was reportedly for two 
years with an option for a third, worth more $500,000 per season. Heat 
officials would not release his current salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin did get a raise," was all Managing Partner Lewis Schaffel would say. 
</P>
<P>
 On-and-off meetings with management and the appearance of Duke Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski in a Palm Beach hotel increased rumors that Loughery was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffel denied any other coach was considered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Sun point guard Kevin Johnson signed a one-year contract extension and 
says he will play three more seasons before retiring, saying his plans are 
firm, unlike the shifting announcements by teammate Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Team owner Jerry Colangelo told The Phoenix Gazette that the deal makes 
Johnson the highest paid point guard in the NBA but not the highest paid Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Johnson's salary is more than the $3.34 million Tim Hardaway is 
paid by Golden State but less than the $3.5 million paid to teammates Dan 
Majerle and Barkley. The seven-year contract Johnson signed in 1989 was for $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 28, said the contract's no-trade clause was most important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics will hire a new general manager after current 
President and General Manager Bob Whitsett has his contract situation resolved, 
said Bob Ackerley, the son of team owner, in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitsitt asked out of the final three years of a five-year contract last week. 
Boxing  
</P>
<P>
 Roy Jones Jr., the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, was 
arrested in Hamilton, Bermuda, when a loaded handgun was found in his luggage 
during a routine customs check at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials discovered a .22-caliber gun and 14 rounds of ammunition. He 
was released on $1,000 bail pending a court appearance. Police said Jones, 25, 
told officers someone else had packed his bags and he did not know the gun was 
inside.

MISSION IMPROBABLE: ANGELS TO WAIT; BASEBALL DRAFT: THEY SELECT OUTFIELDER WHO 
WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR TWO YEARS. DODGERS PICK A CATCHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given their history of strange moves, the Angels might have outdone themselves 
in the first round of baseball's amateur draft Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They selected a man on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, high school outfielder McKay Christensen's determination to 
spend two years on a Mormon mission will prevent him from playing baseball or 
joining the Angels' farm system until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi insisted that the 18-year-old Christensen, who 
stole 62 bases in 62 attempts during his three-year career at Clovis West High 
in Fresno, was "far and away" the best of the available talent when the Angels 
picked sixth and would be worth the two-year wait. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted, as well, that finances had nothing to do with the club's change 
of mind. The Angels initially had planned to draft a college pitcher capable of 
making a quicker impact, presumably Pepperdine right-hander Cade Gaspar, who 
was ultimately selected by the Detroit Tigers, drafting 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very fair signing budget," Bavasi said. "Money was not going to be 
a problem with whoever we took on the first round. There's not a whole lot of 
difference (between potential signing bonuses for Christensen and Gaspar). This 
was strictly a matter of ability." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed, however, that the Angels cooled on Gaspar when they could not 
get a financial commitment from him late Wednesday and that they have already 
reached a $700,000 contract agreement with Christensen, who was attending 
graduation events Thursday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably thought we would be asking for too much money," Gaspar's 
father, Rod, a former major league infielder, said. "I mean, they wanted a 
commitment before the draft and we thought it would be unfair to other clubs 
that might be interested to give them a number. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them Cade would love to play for the Angels and felt that we could 
work things out after the draft. Bob Harrison (Bavasi's special assistant) told 
us they were going to take a college pitcher if available and Cade was their 
guy. They end up taking a high school outfielder. It was very surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest surprise of a first round in which the Dodgers, drafting 
13th, selected catcher Paul Konerko of Chaparral High in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Mets took Florida State right-hander Paul Wilson with the first 
pick. The Cleveland Indians selected right-hander Jaret Wright of Katella High 
in Anaheim, son of former major league pitcher Clyde Wright, with the 10th; the 
Boston Red Sox, drafting 12th, took former Bellflower St. John Bosco shortstop 
Nomar Garciaparra of Georgia Tech, and the San Francisco Giants selected Cal 
State Fullerton center fielder Dante Powell with the 22nd pick. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 17 rounds Thursday, with the draft continuing through Saturday. 
Only the first round is announced publicly, but it was learned that the Dodgers 
took Mississippi State left-hander Gary Rath with their second pick and Miami 
shortstop Mike Metcalfe with their third. The Angels took outfielder Norm 
Hutchins of Lincoln High in Yonkers, N.Y., with their second pick and Notre 
Dame shortstop Paul Failla with their third. 
</P>
<P>
 USC third baseman Aaron Boone was drafted in the third round by the Cincinnati 
Reds, who already employ his brother, Bret, as a second baseman and his father, 
Bob, as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA pitcher Brian Stephenson, son of Dodger scout Jerry Stephenson, was 
selected in the second round by the Chicago Cubs, and UCLA first baseman Mike 
Mitchell was picked in the ninth by the New York Yankees. Loyola 
pitcher-infielder Jesse Ibarra was taken in the sixth round by the Giants, 
Pepperdine relief pitcher Mauricio Estavil was selected in the 11th round by 
the Philadelphia Phillies, and Cal State Fullerton second baseman Jeff Ferguson 
was taken in the ninth round by the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were thought to be leaning toward Wake Forest left-hander Bret 
Wagner, ultimately drafted 19th by the St. Louis Cardinals, but scouting 
director Terry Reynolds said Konerko was the "best available talent and it 
wasn't close." He added that so few premium talents come through the draft at 
the catching position that he couldn't pass on Konerko, 18, despite the 
Dodgers' catching backlog, which includes Mike Piazza, Carlos Hernandez and 
1992 draft pick Ryan Luzinski. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those concerns are way down the road," Konerko said of the catchers ahead of 
him. At 6-feet-3 and 205 pounds, he was the Arizona high school player of the 
year, batting .564 with 14 home runs and 51 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 He has signed a letter of intent with Arizona State, but his father, Henry, 
who will serve as his agent, said: "We hold that letter in high regard, but 
there's only one first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, the Angels' surprising pick and only the 47th-ranked position 
player among Baseball America's top 100 draft prospects, has signed a letter of 
intent to play football at Brigham Young. He will give that up, but not his 
mission, the Angels said. All 28 clubs were notified by Christensen's parents 
that no amount of money could deter him from that mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you take a lesser player who might be ready in three years, or do you wait 
five for the better talent?" Bavasi said. "We think he's worth the wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was concerned that Christensen's skills might diminish in the two 
years he doesn't play, Bavasi said, "That's part of the gamble. Concerned, yes, 
but we're confident he'll come back in shape and ready to pick up where he left 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen is 5-11 and 185 pounds. He led the state with 44 touchdowns as a 
running back, has been timed, according to the Angels, in 6.5 seconds for 60 
yards and a left-handed 3.9 to first base, and hit .486 in 70 at-bats this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he truly the best of the thousands of available players, including the 
three college pitchers selected later in the first round? The Angels are going 
to have a long wait to find out. Amateur Draft

CLEVELAND SELECTS WRIGHT IN FIRST ROUND; DETROIT PICKS GASPAR; BASEBALL DRAFT: 
TITAN OUTFIELDER POWELL GOES TO GIANTS WITH 22ND PICK. REDS ADD TO THEIR BOONE 
COLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jaret Wright, Katella High School's hard-throwing pitcher, finally had the 
answer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was selected Thursday by the Indians in the first round of the amateur 
baseball draft. He was the 10th player selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been buzzing around me all night and all morning," Wright said. 
"All anyone talked about the last few weeks was the draft. Everyone wanted the 
inside scoop." 
</P>
<P>
 It had long been speculated that Wright would be a first-round pick. His 
fastball has been clocked as high as 94 m.p.h. and Baseball America rated him 
the fourth-best high school player in the nation before the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound right-hander, did nothing to jeopardize that 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 7-2 with a 2.99 earned-run average during the regular season and won 
one more game in the Southern Section Division I playoffs. He led Orange County 
with 100 strikeouts. He was 4-3 with 80 strikeouts as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who also plays first base, hit .474 with seven home runs and 31 runs 
batted in during the regular season. He had seven home runs and 26 RBIs as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers attracted attention and scouts flocked to Katella's games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cleveland scout was at every game," Wright said. "He was like a grandpa 
to me. I tried not to let all the attention be a hassle. It wasn't, because my 
dad took a lot of it off me. He's been really stressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Wright is a former pitcher with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, shucks, I'm not important anymore," Wright said. "I'm just 'Jaret 
Wright's father.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine pitcher Cade Gaspar, who played at Capistrano Valley High and 
Saddleback College, was the 18th player selected. He was taken in the first 
round by the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was previously drafted by the Houston Astros and New York Yankees, but he 
turned down six-figure signing bonus by the Astros to go to college and become 
a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, the son of former New York Met outfielder Rod Gaspar, was an infielder 
and didn't become a full-time pitcher until he reached Pepperdine. He learned 
fast. He was 6-1 with a 2.30 ERA this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton outfielder Dante Powell was selected 22nd by the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a multi-talented outfielder, had a disappointing junior season for the 
Titans. He hit .289, but stole 40 bases in 47 attempts. He was named 
second-team All-American despite his struggles at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with where I was picked, and it's great to be able to stay in 
California,"' Powell said in Omaha, Neb., where Cal State Fullerton is 
preparing to meet Georgia Tech in today's opening game of the College World 
Series. "The Giants are a class organization. I thought I might have a shot at 
going with the Angels. That would have been fine, too, since they're the team 
in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who played at Long Beach Millikan High, was drafted by the Toronto 
Blue Jays, who took him as a supplemental pick between the first and second 
rounds in 1991. He turned down a $425,000 offer to attend Fullerton. He hit 
.307 as a freshman and .335 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said he has not talked with anyone from the Giants at this point and 
has no plans to do so until after the College World Series ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Series is my first priority right now, and when the tournament is 
over, we'll go from there," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only players drafted in the first round are announced by Major League Baseball 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 USC third baseman Aaron Boone, who played at Villa Park, was drafted by the 
Reds in the third round. Boone, a second-team All-American selection, hit .340 
with six home runs and 30 RBIs for the Trojans. He also stole 26 bases, a 
school single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Boone, Aaron's brother, plays second base for the Reds and his father, 
ex-Angel Bob Boone, is a coach with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any clues," Aaron Boone said. "Dad didn't tell me anything. He 
was in a golf tournament today and called me from the golf course a couple 
hours ago. My brother called to congratulate me, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Boone, Aaron's grandfather, had a 13-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron France, a pitcher from Cypress College, was drafted in the third round 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates. France, who played at Loara High School, was 12-4 
with a 2.82 ERA in helping the Chargers win the State championship. He has 
signed a letter of intent with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei catcher Matt Treanor was taken by the Kansas City Royals in the 
fourth round. Treanor, an excellent defensive catcher, hit .368 with three home 
runs and 23 RBIs for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton pitcher Mike Parisi, who is scheduled to be the Titans' 
starting pitcher today in the opening game of the College World Series, was 
selected by Miami in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, a junior, is 11-3 for the season with a 2.55 ERA. And teammate Jeff 
Ferguson, a junior second baseman who was chosen co-Big West player of the 
year, was picked in the ninth round by Minnesota. Ferguson is hitting .373 and 
leads the team in RBIs with 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills shortstop Brett Nista was taken in the seventh round by the New 
York Mets. Nista, who has signed with UCLA, set county career records for hits 
(155) and runs scored (128). 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin third baseman Derek Baker was drafted in the 12th round by the Angels. 
Baker, who has signed with USC, hit .397 with three home runs and 19 RBIs 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills pitcher Seth Etherton was drafted in the 16th round by the Florida 
Marlins. Etherton, who also has signed with USC, was 9-1 with a 1.15 ERA and 99 
strikeouts this season.

 The likelihood of a Division I-A football playoff went neither forward nor 
backward Thursday. Instead, the NCAA Special Committee appointed to examine the 
feasibility of a championship was stuck in neutral after the first of two days 
of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still got a lot of work to do," said committee member Chris Plonsky, 
University of Texas associate director of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the 24-person committee, chaired by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, 
would be ready to vote on a recommendation by the end of today's session, 
Plonsky said, "I don't know. That's a real good question." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Thursday dinner break, Young said he would not steer the committee 
toward a forced vote.

<P>
 "I think the committee will know when it's ready to do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee could recommend a specific playoff plan and write proposed 
legislation for the January NCAA convention. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could vote against a Division I-A football championship scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could do nothing and meet again, presumably before month's end, when the 
powerful Presidents Commission convenes. At that point, the Special Committee 
also could recommend to table the proposal until the 1996 convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just see," Young said. "It may take a little time, or a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Destin, Fla., the Southeastern Conference used its annual spring 
meetings as a sounding board against a playoff system, voting, 12-0, to oppose 
any proposal to adopt one.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's sessions here included reports from the Structure, Student-Athlete 
and Revenue Sharing subcommittees. Also, issues remaining from Special 
Committee meetings in May were discussed, but not always resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speak for me, but (on) some of the issues I feel the same, others 
I've changed my mind," said Florida State linebacker Derrick Brooks, one of 
three student-athletes on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks declined to comment on the specific issues, but it is safe to assume 
that the subject of financial compensation, as it relates to the NCAA football 
playoff pie, was discussed at length. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the most recent allegations leveled against his Seminole program -- 
charges of booster-supplied loans and phony jobs -- Brooks was equally 
reluctant to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things happening with my school, I just hope we weather the storm. That's 
all I have to say about it," Brooks said.

ARGENTINE STAR MARADONA SAYS HE MAY QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diego Maradona, disgusted over suggestions that he dictates the team's roster, 
threatened Thursday to quit Argentina's World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer star spoke in response to a radio interview with the mother of 
defender Dario Franco, who was left off the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco's mother told radio station La Red her son was not placed on the team 
because Maradona "dictates the lineup to (Coach Alfio) Basile." Basile said 
Franco was excluded because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, speaking from Austria, where Argentina plays a tuneup game Saturday, 
said: "My nerves are in a terrible state, I can't go on like this." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would call his wife today before deciding.

MEOLA TO START AS GOALKEEPER FOR THE U.S. TEAM -- OR WILL HE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic named Tony Meola to start as goalkeeper in the 
team's opening World Cup soccer game on June 18 against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference Thursday at the Rose Bowl to introduce those who had 
made the team's final 22-man roster, Milutinovic preceded his remarks to the 
press with a short lecture to Meola, beginning, "When you lead the team against 
Switzerland. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, when asked about it, Milutinovic was typically evasive, saying that 
he will not identify his 11 starters until an hour before the game. But team 
officials said that Milutinovic has decided that the No. 1 goalkeeper will be 
Meola, who started all three U.S. games in the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola, team captain, said he is not taking anything for granted in his 
competition with Brad Friedel for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first thing I've heard anything about it, too," he said of 
Milutinovic's remarks to him. "I'm still not sure if that was a yes or a no. I 
hope it was a yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meola will start Saturday at the Rose Bowl against Mexico in the United 
States' final exhibition game before the World Cup. RANDY HARVEY

<P>
 The Kings will add another assistant coach and are talking with Tom Renney, 
who coached Canada's silver medalists in the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Renney, 38, has become a hot name and is scheduled to interview this weekend 
for the head coaching vacancy in Hartford.He said he has spoken with King 
General Manager Sam McMaster and Coach Barry Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Renney is an outstanding prospect for coaching, and the Kings would love 
to have a person like Tom Renney on the coaching staff," McMaster said 
Thursday. "Barry and I want to sit down with him when Barry gets back from the 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have offered termination contracts to defensemen Charlie Huddy and 
Doug Houda and 12 other players, giving them opportunities to sign with other 
teams by June 30. Some of the others are Tim Watters, Rob Murphy, Rick Knickle, 
Dave Thomlinson and Brian McReynolds. LISA DILLMAN

NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; TITAN PITCHING STAFF SHOULD BENEFIT FROM LESS-TAXING 
FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The College World Series, which begins today, won't place the same kind of 
demands on a pitching staff that NCAA regional play did, and that should help 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less pressure on the pitchers because you're not playing every day 
and you never have to play twice in one day the way you do in the regional," 
Titan associate head coach George Horton said. "That means you can be a lot 
deeper for each game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans played five games in four days in the Midwest I Regional at 
Oklahoma State, stretching thin a staff with good depth. Hitting becomes a more 
dominant factor in the late stages of regional play. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said Mike Parisi (11-3) is the Titans' scheduled starter in today's 
opening game against Georgia Tech. Brad Rigby (13-4) will start for the Yellow 
Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel he matches up better with them than anyone else," Horton said. Parisi 
also was the winning pitcher when Fullerton beat Georgia Tech, 2-0, this season 
on the Titans' home field. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's series field is loaded with strong pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblatt Stadium is known as a pitchers' park. The stadium, home of the 
Omaha Royals of the American Assn., has a large center-field area and the wall 
is 408 feet from the plate and 10 feet high. It is 332 feet down the lines and 
the alleys are 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton comes into Omaha with the third-best earned-run average among the 
eight teams. Miami is first at 2.43, Florida State second at 2.97. Fullerton 
has a 3.15 ERA. Louisiana State (4.40) and Oklahoma (4.23) have the highest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires' inconsistent strike zones was an issue at the Oklahoma State 
regional, and Horton and the Titan pitchers are anxious about what it might be 
like in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner, the Big West pitcher of the year, didn't pitch as well in 
Stillwater as he normally does, and Horton thought the umpiring could have been 
a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the game Matt started, we had an umpire with a tight strike zone compared 
to the others," Horton said. "That made him pitch more out of character. He may 
have been a little too excited, too." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, one of the other umpires in Stillwater called a loose zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way an umpire views the zone is an important issue and it does have an 
impact on us," Titan pitcher Dan Ricabal said. "It doesn't bother me as much as 
it does some pitchers because I'm always around the strike zone. If an umpire 
gets used to seeing a pitch in a certain spot, you tend to get the close 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Titan center fielder Dante Powell, who suffered a hamstring pull late in 
Fullerton's regional championship game against Oklahoma State, is optimistic 
that he will be able to play today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've jogged on it and it feels all right, but I guess we won't know for sure 
until the first time I go all out on it," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Augie Garrido said Powell's playing status "will have to be a day-to-day 
thing." Powell has lifted his batting average to .306 after going 11 for 23 in 
the NCAA regional. He was six for six against Memphis State.

PASADENA GROUPS TELL NFL RAIDERS AREN'T WELCOME; PRO FOOTBALL: CITY OFFICIAL 
SAYS LEAGUE REQUESTED MEETING TO DETERMINE ROSE BOWL'S AVAILABILITY IF COLISEUM 
ISN'T REPAIRED, BUT RESIDENTS VOICE OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the reaction of several Pasadena residents and community groups was any 
indication Thursday night, the Raiders will not play their home games at the 
Rose Bowl this fall despite the possible wishes of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special joint meeting of the Pasadena City Council and the Rose Bowl 
Operating Co., seven Pasadena area residents voiced their opposition to a 
potential proposal generated neither by the Raiders nor the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL, concerned about where the Raiders will play if the earthquake-damaged 
Coliseum is not ready for the 1994 season, asked the city of Pasadena to 
consider whether the Rose Bowl could be made available for the team's home 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NFL made a direct request to look into what it will take for the Raiders 
to play at the Rose Bowl," assistant city manager Edmund Sotelo said. "An NFL 
official said that a series of meetings will be held this week to determine if 
the Coliseum will be ready or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the NFL) then decides that an optional field should be made available, 
they would prepare a letter of agreement with a non-refundable stipend to 
reserve (eight home) dates to play at the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Chomsky, vice president of the Linda Vista Annandale Assn., said Pasadena 
residents who live near the Rose Bowl are willing to go to court to fight 
against having the Raiders as temporary neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have a study done on what the economic effect would be on land 
value in the city if we allowed the Raiders to move into the Rose Bowl," 
Chomsky said. "I'm sure that there would be an erosion on the quality of life 
in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents who spoke against the move claim that the Raiders would create 
more traffic, noise and crime problems around the city. They also said the 24 
events scheduled for the Rose Bowl this year, including this summer's World 
Cup, is more than the allowed 12 under the Arroyo Seco Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, NFL spokesman Joe Browne said he knew nothing about the Pasadena 
meeting but added: "We have said that we would explore what the options might 
be for the Raiders in the Greater Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis, the Raiders' managing partner, has repeatedly said the Rose Bowl 
would not be suitable for his team. The team had no comment on the NFL's 
overture to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a source at the Coliseum said NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue plans 
to inspect the Coliseum next week while in Los Angeles for a meeting, to see 
for himself how stadium repairs are progressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials and the head of the Tutor-Saliba Co., the prime contractor 
on the repair job now estimated at $42 million, expressed confidence at a 
Coliseum Commission meeting this week that the stadium would be substantially 
ready for the first USC and Raider home games, Sept. 3 and 11, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, they said the Coliseum press box might have to be 
demolished and temporary press seating installed before fall, and they said 
repairs on the historic peristyle end of the stadium might not be complete by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has been skeptical of the Coliseum's readiness, and the Raiders have 
talked with Oakland officials about moving the team back to its original home, 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility was the subject of a sharp exchange between Davis and Carmen 
Policy, president of the San Francisco 49ers, at a recent NFL meeting in 
Florida. Policy said the 49ers would view the Raiders' return to the Bay Area 
as an intrusion.

BASEBALL; ORIOLE IMPRESSES IN DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before his major league debut Thursday afternoon, Baltimore Orioles rookie 
right-hander Scott Klingenback said he had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he went out and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken Jr. homered and drove in four runs, and Klingenbeck pitched seven 
strong innings, as the Orioles snapped their three-game losing streak and 
Detroit's four-game winning streak by beating the Tigers 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingenbeck (1-0) was recalled from the Double-A Bowie Baysox when a strained 
groin forced Ben McDonald to miss his first start after 80 straight turns. 
Klingenbeck gave up four runs on six hits, walked four and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a lot of time to think about the start, I might have been stronger," 
he said. "I was pitching on three days' rest. But if that's the way it's going 
to happen . . . this is my ESPN dream."" 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed a lot of composure," Baltimore manager Johnny Oates said. "He did 
some things that you'd like experienced veterans to do. He threw some 3-2 
change-ups, 3-2 sliders. Sometimes that's tough -- not only to teach, but to 
teach them to have confidence in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Whitaker hit a home run, his ninth of the season, for Detroit. Whitaker 
and Junior Felix each had two RBIs for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory helped the Orioles avert a four-game sweep at the hands of the 
Tigers, who could have reached .500 for the first time this season with a 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought for sure we would," said Tigers manager Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been battling all year trying to get there," Whitaker added. "One thing 
about it: we're not going to stop until we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigers left-hander Bill Krueger (0-2), making only his second start of the 
season, lasted only two innings plus two batters. He gave up five runs on five 
hits.

TRAINER SAYS HOLY BULL WON'T RUN IN BELMONT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Holy Bull, the beaten Kentucky Derby favorite but a dazzling winner of the 
Metropolitan Handicap on Monday, will not race in the Belmont Stakes on June 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that is is best for the horse," owner-trainer Jimmy Croll said 
Thursday."He needs more time. He comes first, and I have to do what's best for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Holy Bull is scheduled run against 3-year-olds in the 1 1/16-mile 
Dwyer on July 3 at Belmont. One of his rivals in that race will be Twining, who 
is unbeaten in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing 12th in the 1 1/4-mile Kentucky Derby, Holy Bull was held out 
of the 1 3/16-mile Preakness because of minor physical problems. He returned to 
action on Memorial Day and beat older horses in the Metropolitan mile. It was 
Holy Bull's eighth victory in 10 starts, and his sixth wire-to-wire victory.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; ZAAHI BREAKS HIND LEG AND HAS TO BE DESTROYED

<P>
 Zaahi, who was to have raced in the $300,000 Californian on Sunday at 
Hollywood Park, had to be destroyed after breaking down during a workout there 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-year-old son of Slew O' Gold, Zaahi broke his right hind leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Shadwell Stable and trained by Neil Drysdale, Zaahi had four 
victories in 19 starts and earnings of $356,680. Raced primarily in Europe 
before he was shipped to California last year, he finished third in the 
Kensington Handicap in his final start May 1 at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 A field of six is likely when entries for the 1 1/8-mile Californian are taken 
this morning. The Wicked North, Del Mar Dennis, Stuka, Kingdom Found, Thunder 
Rumble and Slew Of Damascus are the probable starters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Golden Gate Fields shifting its post time on Fridays to 4 p.m. for the 
rest of its meeting, Hollywood Park will offer two simulcasts from there 
tonight. The first is scheduled for 6:42, before Hollywood Park's first post at 
7. The other will be shown between Hollywood Park's first and second races. BOB

MARINA'S CROUCH HAS TASTE FOR WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch took a slice of Canadian bacon and pineapple pizza, grabbed the 
cheese by the edge and pulled it off -- all in one perfect piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on a roll," she said to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch likes her pizza stripped bare, but the message she delivered to her 
Marina teammates amid the postgame celebration provided plenty to chew on. 
</P>
<P>
 She told them what it is like to be a champion. Crouch has won two Southern 
Section titles for the Vikings -- in soccer -- and she imparted that feeling to 
the gang after their 10-inning, 1-0 semifinal victory over Pacifica on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my soccer game, I was on the biggest high of my life," she said. "I had 
never been that happy before. I was in the absolute best mood. I told them, 'It 
is the best feeling to win.' I loved it. And I want it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch will be in the middle of Marina's championship hopes tonight when she 
takes the mound at 7:30 against Foothill (25-6). The Vikings (25-2) are the 
top-seeded team in Division I and have won 15 in a row. Crouch, the leadoff 
batter and a pitcher with a 21-2 record, is the only starter on the team who 
knows what it's like to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sweeper on the two-time defending champion soccer team (ranked No. 1 in 
the state), she was the Southern Section's Division I defensive player of the 
year. On the softball diamond, she is recognized as one of the county's best 
clutch performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina's only two losses this year occurred in back-to-back games. The Vikings 
lost to Fresno Bullard, 2-1, in the championship game of the Santa Maria 
Righetti Tournament, and then lost the next day to Fountain Valley, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that game that Crouch allowed four of the five earned runs she 
surrendered all year, but consider the circumstances: She pitched 12 innings 
the day before, and she pitched seven innings the day before that. And she had 
only recently finished an extended soccer season. She doesn't throw in the 
winter, so she had not yet worked herself into softball shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Marina played Fountain Valley -- rested, not worn out -- Crouch 
pitched a two-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Take away the first Fountain Valley game and her earned-run average is 0.05 
instead of its current 0.26. Crouch is also averaging more than a strikeout per 
inning (146 in 136 innings) and has walked only five batters. 
</P>
<P>
 And she relishes a softball title more than her soccer championship "because I 
didn't expect to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not dominating like my soccer team," Crouch said. "Every game, we have 
to go out there and work to win. In soccer, we were expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we beat Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley and won (the 
Sunset) League, we said, 'If we play like this, we are a good team. If we can 
beat them, we can beat anybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sage analysis from someone who knows the feeling. FOOTHILL VS. MARINA 
</P>
<P>
 Division I Softball 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7:30 tonight 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Mayfair Park, Lakewood 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Foothill (25-6); No. 1-seeded Marina (25-2) 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers: Marie Gieron, 12-4, 0.50 ERA; Marcy Crouch, 21-2, 0.26 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: Marina should get some good swings against Gieron. Foothill's 
quickness puts pressure on the Viking defense to play error-free. Both teams 
should have scoring opportunities. Foothill has three players -- Dawn Davidson, 
Michelle Churnock and Carley Rutledge -- who played on its 1992 championship 
team.

GIANTS SELECT JACOB CRUZ IN 1ST ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER and DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacob Cruz, an All-American outfielder from Arizona State and Channel Islands 
High, was the first area player selected Thursday in the major league baseball 
amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, a junior, was selected by the San Francisco Giants with the 32nd pick in 
the draft, which fell in the supplemental portion of the first round. Teams are 
given supplemental first-round picks as compensation when they lose free agents 
to other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The only high school players from the area selected were Quartz Hill 
right-hander Roger Worley, who was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 
third round, Newbury Park outfielder Keith Smith, a fifth-round choice of the 
Detroit Tigers, and Monroe right-hander Joel Zamudio, a ninth-round selection 
of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's senior right-hander Chris Beck was taken by the Seattle Mariners 
in the seventh round, and UCLA first baseman Mike Mitchell, a Rio Mesa High 
graduate, was taken by the New York Yankees in the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Eddie Oropesa, who lives in Sylmar, was drafted by the Dodgers in 
the 14th round. Oropesa defected from Cuba during the World University Games 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams drafted, via conference call, for 17 rounds Thursday. They will draft 
about 30 rounds each, today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, a junior who is in Omaha, Neb., while the Sun Devils prepare to begin 
play today in the College World Series, surprised many draft observers by being 
selected so high. He was forecast before the season as a fifth- to 10th-round 
selection. In Baseball America magazine this week, he was listed as the 
75th-best prospect in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cruz's hitting -- he enters the World Series with a .408 average and 67 
runs batted in -- raised interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like his bat," said Gene Thompson, the Giants' scout who covers Arizona 
State. "His other abilities are not all that great, but they are good enough. I 
think I've seen an awful lot of improvement in his outfield play. I was a 
little concerned at the start of the spring if he could be a center fielder, 
but I think he can now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division player of the year, said 
before the draft that the College World Series is his primary focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to worry about (the draft)," he said. "That's something that's 
going to be there after the World Series. I want to take care of the World 
Series first. One thing at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz becomes the fifth first-round pick from the area since 1989, joining 
Roger Salkeld (Saugus, Mariners), Mike Lieberthal (Westlake, Phillies), Dmitri 
Young (Rio Mesa, St. Louis Cardinals) and Derek Wallace (Chatsworth, Chicago 
Cubs). The area boasted first-rounders every year from 1989 to 1992, but last 
year the top area picks came in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who was 5-3 with a 1.55 earned-run average for the Rebels, was not 
disappointed with being the 83rd player selected this year, despite reports 
that he would be gone by the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine with me," said Worley, who added he hoped he could sign as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Smith will prove much more difficult for the Tigers to sign 
because he has a football scholarship to play quarterback at Arizona. Smith hit 
.353 with 19 stolen bases for the Panthers this season. The state's all-time 
passing leader, he led the Newbury Park football team to the Southern Section 
Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the best of everything," Smith said. "I'm just glad everything is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio, who was 5-3 for the Vikings this season, is also expected to sign 
soon. He said he has a meeting scheduled for Monday with the Phillies. Zamudio 
does not have a scholarship to play Division I college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, who was 5-7 with a 3.40 ERA for The Master's this season, said he hopes 
to sign with the Mariners at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a left-handed hitting first baseman, led UCLA with 12 home runs this 
season. He hit .339 with 46 RBIs and a .597 slugging percentage. He is also 
scheduled to meet with the Yankees today. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropesa played last summer in the independent Northern League after defecting 
from Cuba. He was 3-1 with a 1.93 ERA in four games for St. Paul, Minn. Area

STEPPING IT UP A NOTCH; EL CAMINO REAL ACE WOLF AT HIS STINGIEST DURING PLAYOFF 
GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can he top that?  
</P>
<P>
 If you're an opponent of El Camino Real High pitcher Randy Wolf, don't ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's playoff time, he just might one-up himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's a god," said his catcher, Steve Riback. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgive the hyperbole. Riback had just finished catching Wolf's latest 
postseason gem, a one-hitter -- and even that one hit was in dispute -- against 
Carson on Wednesday. The victory put El Camino Real in today's City Section 4-A 
semifinal against Kennedy at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 That performance continued a remarkable postseason run spanning two seasons, 
in which Wolf has made four starts -- all complete-game victories -- and 
allowed one run. In order, he has thrown a no-hitter, a three-hitter, a 
five-hitter and a one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wolf bared his teeth and pitched the Conquistadores to the City 
4-A championship, for which he was named player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wolf's true prowl again began the day the regular season ended. He 
was 9-3 in the regular season with a 1.22 earned-run average, but was saddled 
with a 10-4 loss in his final start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a little kick in the butt to get you into it," Wolf said. "I 
guess in a way I was pacing myself. I didn't really want to go out there and 
gas it up in the very beginning, and -- who knows? -- not have as much energy 
toward the end of season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be in more of a peak when the playoffs come around." 
</P>
<P>
 If only mountains peaked like this. He has won both of the team's playoff 
games in pursuit of its second consecutive title, and has 29 strikeouts in 14 
innings. He has improved his record to 11-3 and lowered his ERA to 1.12 in 100 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of playoff imperfection are minimal: five hits and a meaningless run 
allowed against Monroe in the first-round game and five walks against Carson. 
And, oh yes, the Colts' hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it? 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf bobbled a ball hit back to the mound in the first inning and could not 
make a throw to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an error," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real scorekeepers agreed, and two sportswriters in attendance 
also scored the play an error. But the Carson scorekeeper ruled it a hit, and 
because the home team's ruling is official, Wolf was denied his second playoff 
no-hitter on the day before major league baseball's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in his final regular-season start, he pitched a perfect game. He 
followed that with a no-hitter against Banning in a quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 But numbers and statistics do not tell Wolf's entire story. Even more 
impressive is what he has had to endure while achieving so much. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, James, died suddenly of a heart attack April 18. Wolf missed two 
games before returning to the lineup, and hit a home run in his first game 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone who could have turned it around like he did," Riback 
said. "He's got a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Riback was the driving force behind the team's decision to don a black patch 
with the initials "JW" on each player's uniform shoulder, a gesture that 
touched Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really cool," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riback: "His dad was at every single game -- he never missed one. For 
Randy to look out at the stands and not see his father, it's got to be pretty 
tough. But he's turned it around and I give him a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one. The list of Wolf admirers is a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not just a thrower, he's a pitcher," Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarado said. 
"He throws hard but not all the time. He's able to change speeds, able to sink 
the ball away and cut it in. And when he wants he can really pump it up and 
bring it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said El Camino Real pitcher Tony Kyber: "I wish I could throw it that hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy players, winners of 10 of their past 11 games, are glad Kyber cannot, 
because he is the scheduled starter today. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's complete game against Carson leaves him with only three more innings 
for the week because of the state 10-inning rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Wolf might already have pitched in his final high school game, 
although El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said his ace could pitch in relief. Or 
he could lead El Camino Real to another City title Monday at Dodger Stadium 
before moving on to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, he strives to enjoy the successes of another heady season, but one 
in which his triumphs ring bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has its ups and downs," he said of his time since his father's death. "It 
kind of tells you that life sucks and that you have to live one day at time, 
and live as happy as you can that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to pick yourself up." 
</P>
<P>
 He already has picked up so many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's up at that level, everybody else wants to get up there, too," 
Riback said. "Last year, I was down in JV; now I'm catching for the best 
pitcher in the City. I mean, he's going to the pros, almost for sure. It's 
something I can tell my kids."

MEDEARIS, FISCHER SET FOR FINALS; STATE TRACK MEET: HURDLER AND HIGH JUMPER 
PREPARE FOR IMPORTANT TESTS AGAINST CHIEF RIVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High and Jason Medearis of Hart are expected to 
play central roles in three highly anticipated showdowns at the state track and 
field championships at Cerritos College today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet, which starts with qualifying rounds today, consists of 31 events, 
but the high jump, featuring Fischer and Arthur Lloyd of Eisenhower, and the 
110-meter high and 300-meter intermediate hurdles, pitting Medearis against 
Kenny Haslip of Muir, rate among the most intriguing contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer is the national outdoor leader this year in the high jump at 7 feet 4 
inches and is undefeated, including a 4-0 record against Lloyd. However, 
Fischer has shown recent signs of fallibility. He is recovering from a bout 
with the flu that hampered him in last week's Southern Section Masters Meet 
even though he still defeated Lloyd, who has a personal best of 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's definitely going to take a jump of 7-2 or 7-3 to win it," 
Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve his chances at winning his first state title -- he finished second 
last year and tied for fourth in 1992 -- Fischer has withdrawn from the long 
jump for the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I don't have a chance at doing well in that event," Fischer 
said. "But the high jump is my forte." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Medearis has produced his best mark in the intermediates -- his 
36.80-second clocking ranks third on the national list -- he's had more success 
against Haslip in the highs. 
</P>
<P>
 He defeated Haslip last week and has split four races against him this season 
in the highs. In the intermediates, Medearis is 0-4 against the defending state 
champion, including a second-place finish last week in the Masters Meet when 
Haslip ran a national leading time of 36.65. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never beaten him in the 300s, so that is definitely a goal of mine," 
Medearis said. "My workouts have gone great this week so I feel really good 
about my chances in both races." 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to contend for state titles are Esa Sallinen of Burroughs, 
Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill and Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, a senior exchange student from Finland, has a personal best of 16-4 
3/4 in the pole vault and ranks second behind Scott Slover (17-0) of San Jose 
Leland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase's personal best of 24-2 1/4 in the long jump is No. 1 in the state and 
he ranks third in the triple jump (49-3). Undefeated in the long jump for much 
of the season, Chase finished third behind Lloyd and Fischer in the Southern 
Section Division I championships May 21 and placed second behind Tyree 
Washington of La Sierra in the Masters Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been way too timid on the runway the last couple of meets," Quartz Hill 
Coach Don Crimin said. "If we can just get him to run through the board at full 
speed, he'll produce some big marks." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau is the state leader in the shotput at 49-2, although her 3 1/2-foot 
advantage over second-ranked Gina Heads (45-7) of Newport Harbor is a little 
deceiving because Tuimoloau's performances have been in the 45- to 46-foot 
range for the past four meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Taft, Brett Strahan of Hart, Gabriela Rodriguez of Oxnard 
and Cathy Prater of Agoura each will attempt to place among the top five 
finishers in their respective events for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure finished second in the 400 last year and has run 47.77 this season, 
despite being hampered by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan placed fifth in the 1,600 last year and ranks third with a personal 
best of 4 minutes 9.71 seconds this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez ran 10:54.36 to finish fifth in the 3,200 in a tightly bunched race 
at the Masters Meet and could add a top-five finish to last year's third-place 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater placed third in the 300 low hurdles last year and ranks sixth this year 
with a personal best of 43.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meet starts with the boys' discus at 3 p.m., followed by the first 
running event at 5. Local Qualifiers

THE THROWS OF GREATNESS; BASKETBALL CAME FIRST FOR DOLORES TUIMOLOAU, BUT SHE 
GREW TO LOVE ANOTHER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago Dolores Tuimoloau turned to track and field only as a way to 
stay active between basketball seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Channel Islands High senior has turned in some of the state's best 
performances in the shotput and the discus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, who holds the state's best shotput mark, 49 feet 2 inches, and the 
Ventura County record in the discus, 145 feet, ends her high school athletic 
career today and Saturday in the State meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 To think she once thought that career would end in a gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau excelled at basketball since she was 9, partly because she was big 
for her age. She became better as she grew bigger. This season, at 6-foot-1 and 
285 pounds, Tuimoloau averaged 11 points and seven rebounds a game and earned 
Times' All-Ventura County honors. 
</P>
<P>
 How to spend the time between bouncing basketballs was settled during her 
freshman year, after her cousin suggested she try the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even thought of track," Tuimoloau said. "I was ready to play 
softball. Then I did so well in track that people said I could get a 
scholarship. So I really started to like it, even though basketball will always 
be my first love." 
</P>
<P>
 That first heave of the shotput traveled 39 feet. By the time the season was 
over, she ranked ninth among Southern Section 3-A Division shotputters. 
Tuimoloau threw the discus, too, and ranked fourth with a best of 126-2 as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau made steady progress through the years. As a sophomore, her best 
mark in the shotput was 42 feet and 133-6 in the discus. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, she improved her best to 44 feet in the shotput and 142 in the 
discus, which ranked fourth and second, respectively, among Southern Section 
Division I marks. 
</P>
<P>
 This season her best shotput of 49-2 came at the Ventura County Championships 
at the end of April and her best discus mark (145) came in an invitational in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's thrown well all four years but this year she has gone above and beyond 
the other three," Channel Islands Coach Myra Beemis said. "She's always had a 
lot of strength, but technique improvement has made the biggest difference this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing about her is that she is really mature and she handles pressure 
well because she remains calm. A lot of kids would crack under the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 And the pressure doesn't subside when competition ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau says life away from sports isn't always easy because many people 
make snap judgments based on her commanding physical appearance and aggressive 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at me and I'm such a big girl that they say, 'There's a bully 
right there.' But I'm very nice and caring. I'm also a very friendly person," 
Tuimoloau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beemis agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are intimidated by her size," she said. "It's just her presence. She 
really is a sweet girl and she is liked around school." 
</P>
<P>
 She draws much of her strength from her family, which has a rich background in 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores' father, Junior, played football at Channel Islands and is the 
school's defensive coordinator. Her 14-year-old sister, Judy, is expected to be 
one of the school's top basketball players next season and her 11-year-old 
sister, Chenne, is also a promising basketball talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau's two cousins, Peka and Mickie Liufau, also played basketball for 
Channel Islands last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the average we have about 20 relatives at our games," Tuimoloau said. 
"They'll probably be there at Cerritos." 
</P>
<P>
 The only athlete from Channel Islands to qualify for the state meet, Tuimoloau 
must place among the top nine in each event today to advance to Saturday's 
finals. Family support will help a great deal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems almost unreal because I didn't make it to the state meet the last 
three years," Tuimoloau said. "But I'm just going to take it like any other 
meet. I mean, I really like performing under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Those performances have attracted major colleges. Arkansas, California, Cal 
State Northridge and USC are among the schools recruiting Tuimoloau for track. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has had so many calls from so many schools," Beemis said. "I lost track." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau said USC has offered a full scholarship providing she passes the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test, which she took early last month. 
</P>
<P>
 If she doesn't get the minimum 700 required by the NCAA to receive a Division 
I scholarship, Tuimoloau probably will attend a junior college next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked USC right away because they offered me a scholarship first and they 
have been watching me since my sophomore year," Tuimoloau said. "They also have 
a great criminal justice program and that's my major." 
</P>
<P>
 If she attends USC, she also plans to play basketball as a walk-on. Tuimoloau 
probably will hold her own in Division I collegiate basketball. An aggressive 
and powerful center, she was a two-time All-Marmonte League pick at Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior she led the Raiders to a 24-4 record and helped them win the 
Marmonte League title and reach the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very dominating, both offensively and defensively," Channel Islands 
Coach Don Salado said. "She just bangs them around. They respected her. She is 
very intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only during competition, according to Tuimoloau. She says she is 
just a regular teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even my voice is bulky but I'm pretty kicked back," Tuimoloau said. "I'm just 
another high school student."

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; TIFT PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE 
FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Newport Harbor's Wade Tift and Esperanza's Kristy Kierulff are the leading 
qualifiers in their events for this weekend's State track and field 
championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Tift, who won the shotput at last week's Masters meet with a throw of 59 feet 
8 1/2 inches, leads all qualifiers by more than two feet with his personal-best 
throw of 61-6 in the Sea View League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kierulff, the 1992 State champion in the high jump, has reached a 
personal-best of 5-10 3/4 this season, and enters the State meet as the 
favorite based on her winning jump of 5-10 at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Martinez of Orange will compete in the 3,200-meter race against San 
Diego High's Mebrahtom Keflezighi, who was runner-up last year at the Kinney 
National Cross-Country Championships. Keflezighi ran a state-leading time of 
9:03.27 to win the San Diego Section title, and Martinez, a senior, won at the 
Masters in 9:06.08. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Young of Woodbridge and Mel Lete of Saddleback are looking to close out 
their prep careers in style. Young, the county's 100 and 200 meters champion, 
has run the 100 in 10.52 (wind-aided) and the 200 in 21.39. Lete finished 
fourth in the 300 intermediate hurdles at the Masters to advance to the State 
meet for the second consecutive year. The county champion has run a 37.62 this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park's Carrie Garritson, who along with Young and Esperanza's Courtney 
Pugmire are the only county athletes to qualify in two events, is expected to 
battle Julie Stamps, a ninth-grader at Santa Rosa Rincon Valley Junior High, in 
the 3,200. Garritson will also run the 1,600, in which she has the county's top 
time of 5:01.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Four county athletes advanced in the girls' 800, led by Edison senior Julie 
Koudelka and Laguna Hills junior Tiffany Boykin. Koudelka has run 2:12.99 and 
Boykin 2:13.83. Pugmire and Santa Margarita freshman Katie Nuanes also will be 
in the 800 field. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill junior Tara Oettinger, the county champion in four events, will 
participate in the long jump after winning the Southern Section title with an 
18-7 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor seniors Gina Heads and Steve Gonzales are expected to be strong 
contenders in the throwing events. Heads, a four-time qualifier in the shot, 
has the state's third-best mark this season. She qualified fourth in the 
discus. Gonzales, the Sea View and county discus champion, posted the 
seventh-best mark entering the meet with a personal best of 177-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison sophomores Kerry O'Bric (triple jump) and Marie Philman (discus) have 
qualifying marks among the state's top eight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying begins today in all events except the boys' and girls' 3,200. Boys' 
discus is up first at 3 p.m., followed by field events beginning at 4 and 
running events at 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's championships begin with the field events at 3 p.m. and running 
events starting at 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices are $7 general admission today and $8 on Saturday. Children 13 
and younger are $2 each day. Prices for students with high school IDs are $3 
today and $4 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the country's top female pole vaulters will put on a vaulting 
exhibition at Saturday's State finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Price of Kingsburg High, the national leader with a vault of 11-1, and 
Jocelyn Chase of Agoura High, whose vault of 10-6 is second only to Price's, 
are scheduled to pole vault immediately after the conclusion of the boys' 
event, sometime around 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Though girls began participating in pole vaulting in California last year, the 
event is not listed in the National Federation Track and Field Rules Book.

BARONS FIND A PLACE FOR YANAGISAWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That first home run this season was a real shocker to Deric Yanagisawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball cleared the fence and the Fountain Valley High School senior third 
baseman took off. He ran -- no sprinted -- around the bases, grinning from 
lobe-to-lobe. Clearly, this guy was a novice on home-run protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to junior Chris Ponchak to set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do it right," Ponchak said. "I told him he's got to enjoy those 
things. But he just wasn't used to doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa has grown accustomed to it. In fact, he's downright comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 He has slowed down a bit, on his home-run trot that is, but there is no one 
who has found more enjoyment in the Barons' run to tonight's Southern Section 
Division I title game against Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who spent his entire junior season in a slump. It cost him the 
starting catching job and a few nights of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he was a guy Coach Ron LaRuffa just had to get in the lineup. A 
big change, but Yanagisawa made it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it was maturity, but Deric worked awfully hard over the summer," 
LaRuffa said. "We needed his bat in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The bat has been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa is hitting .420 with six home runs and a school-record 35 runs 
batted in. He has hit two home runs and had four RBIs in four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 He has gone from hitting eighth to clean up. Not bad, considering he hit a 
measly .215 as a junior. The highlight last season was ending an 0-for-13 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid last season," Yanagisawa said. "I would concentrate on getting 
the bat on the ball, instead of concentrating on getting hits. I was scared I 
would strike out." 
</P>
<P>
 He has conquered those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa spent the summer working, physically and mentally. He took extra 
batting practice and corrected a flaw in his swing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he became an important part of the Fountain Valley team that won 
the Colt League World Series last summer. So impressive was his performance 
that finding a position for him became a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons already had senior Dan Hoppie, an All-Sunset League catcher. But 
they didn't have a third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach knew I had played third in youth leagues," Yanagisawa said. "He asked 
me and I jumped at the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," Yanagisawa said. "The hard part was getting used to the 
reaction time. The ball gets to you quick. But I think I got the hang of it." 
</P>
<P>
 His on-the-job training has had high points and low points. But the benefits 
have certainly outweighed the gaffes. He has improved as fielder and his 
hitting can make up for the odd mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deric will boot some balls, but he really works hard to get better," Ponchak 
said. "And having him at third means his bat is in the lineup. That's 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanagisawa has not only played out of position, he has hit out of character. 
He had not hit a home run in his high school career until he unloaded against 
Artesia in the Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what it felt like," he said. "I didn't know how to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoppie: "He got pretty excited and just took off around the bases." 
</P>
<P>
 But practice makes perfect. Yanagisawa continued his power surge. He has 12 
doubles to go along with six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deric found some pop in his bat somewhere," Hoppie said. "All of a sudden, he 
was hitting line drives all over the place. If we need a key hit, Deric will 
get it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's something he has proved, over and over. His bases-loaded single broke a 
scoreless tie against Diamond Bar in the championship game of the Loara 
tournament. He had two hits and two RBIs in the 15-0 victory. It was his first 
game as a clean-up hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Huntington Beach, Yanagisawa had a three-run home run and five RBIs. 
The Barons won, 16-2, to clinch the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he he was hitting, it was inevitable we move him to clean up," 
LaRuffa said. "That can be the kiss of death sometimes. But he kept right on 
hitting and right on driving in runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Right on into the playoffs. In the second round against Esperanza, Yanagisawa 
hit a two-run homer in the sixth that was rather insignificant at the time. It 
gave the Barons an 8-0 lead. Then the Aztecs scored six runs in the bottom of 
the inning. Fountain Valley hung on for an 8-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was there for us again," Hoppie said. "He also showed he has grown up a 
little. He's got a nice home run trot now." LAKEWOOD VS. FOUNTAIN VALLEY

AT THE END, THEY MADE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: STRENGTHENED BY 
ADVERSITY, A BRASSY, SENIOR-LADEN NORTHRIDGE TEAM FOUGHT ITS WAY TO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It ended the way it began -- with a loss. And in between they endured classes 
in portable trailers, a mini-media circus, 52 victories and a steady climb in 
the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge softball team carried on despite the 6.8 earthquake, 
which nearly claimed the lives of two of its starters. Most of the team members 
were forced to find other housing after the quake. And getting to class was no 
small task. Since the earthquake, the Northridge campus has resembled a work 
camp with more than 400 trailers squeezed between closed buildings, utilizing 
every spare space. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Ivie, one of the Matadors' three All-Americans this season, thought the 
Northridge softball field would be considered a spare space after the 
earthquake and that the softball season would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a place to park around campus was almost impossible, so most of the 
Matadors went to school on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 These day-to-day distractions soon found their way to the playing field and 
made for some tense moments at practice. There was name calling. Not only by 
opponents and their fans, but by teammates and Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Some referred to the Matadors as the Bad Girls. Others simply called them a 
classless bunch. And in the end, Oklahoma reporters called them the no-namers 
of the Women's College World Series. As for what the teammates called each 
other, well, it simply isn't fit to print. 
</P>
<P>
 And through it all, Northridge never played better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got farther that we ever had in Division I and we did it under probably 
the hardest circumstances you could ever imagine," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys -- these student athletes -- played through all of this and my 
hat's off to 'em. It takes a lot of courage to continue to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Amy Windmiller and third baseman Shannon Jones escaped the collapse of 
the Northridge Meadows apartments with their lives. Sixteen of their neighbors 
weren't as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller and Jones, despite having lived through a nightmare they would just 
as soon forget, were constantly chased by photographers and reporters wanting 
to know everything about their earthquake experience. They did "CBS This 
Morning," CNN (twice) and the "Vicki!" show. They were featured in Sports 
Illustrated. And both had never been more focused on softball. They went on to 
have career seasons and were named All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 After claiming its second consecutive Western Athletic Conference title in the 
final week of the regular season, Northridge played host to one of eight 
four-team regionals in the playoffs. The Matadors defeated Cal State Fullerton, 
4-0, in the regional championship to advance to their second World Series 
appearance in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's goal throughout the season was to get to the championship game of 
the World Series. He cared little about anything else. After victories over 
Missouri and Utah in the first two rounds, Northridge battled Oklahoma State 
for 22 innings in two games to reach that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And had left fielder Beth Calcante not leaned over the fence and robbed Karie 
Langelier of a two-run home run in the sixth -- which would have tied it, 4-4 
-- Northridge might have been denied its shot at a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Matadors played well against Oklahoma State, exerting every bit of 
energy to win and get into the championship game. When Oklahoma State's Brandi 
Stephenson flied out to center fielder Jen Fleming for the final out, the 
Matadors celebrated like there was no tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 And when tomorrow came, the Matadors, dressed in black and sweltering in the 
90-degree heat and humidity, came out flat against top-ranked Arizona (64-3), 
which has won three national titles in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad we got (to the World Series) and I'm really happy we got to 
the final game," Ivie said. "But, a lot of us felt we had disappointed people 
because we didn't win it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our World Series championship game was the night before." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, who set school records for career home runs (33), doubles (31) and 
runs batted in (141), agreed with Ivie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our hearts were there, but I don't think our minds were," Calcante 
said. "Everyone was really drained (from the day before)." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it wasn't the losing that upset them. It was the way they lost. 
Arizona ace Susie Parra threw a one-hitter, struck out 13 and faced just two 
batters over the minimum. Calcante's two-out double in the first was the 
Matadors' only hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Northridge failed offensively, many questioned Torgeson's decision to 
start Jennifer Richardson over Windmiller (26-2), a senior right-hander who 
entered the World Series with the nation's lowest earned-run average. 
Windmiller did not get the start against Arizona because she throws a riseball 
and the Northridge coaching staff felt that a down-ball, junk-type pitcher 
would give the Wildcats more trouble. With junior Kathy Blake suffering from a 
fever, Richardson was the logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors lose 10 seniors, eight of them starters. Calcante, Ivie and 
Fleming were Torgeson's first Division I recruits. In their freshman year, 
Northridge finished 34-32. As seniors, they were 52-10. Torgeson credits the 
trio with Northridge's climb to national prominence and its No. 2 ranking. And 
he's not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the heart and soul of our team," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, where do the Matadors go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be such a quiet team next year. We're going to be so mellow," 
Richardson said. "We have a lot of fights on this team because the seniors are

<P>
 Richardson is one of many who will miss the mouthy, talented group. She never 
knew what to expect from those who were not afraid to speak their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what made it fun," Richardson said.

<P>
 Added Torgeson: "You know, it's funny, the local paper (in Oklahoma) called us 
no-names. Well, I think people are going to start to remember Northridge not 
just for the earthquake but because we can play softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tribute is to these young ladies who hung in there and did it for four 
years. My hat's off to those seniors. They've taken us from nowhere and put us 
on the map."

USC RECRUIT IS TO BE ARRAIGNED ON SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A USC football recruit is to be arraigned today on a sexual assault charge, 
police in La Porte, Tex., said.  
</P>
<P>
 Antione Simpson, who signed in January to play for USC, is accused of sexually 
assaulting a 15-year-old girl in her home Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 17, free on $5,000 bond, was to have surrendered Thursday in La 
Porte, but had not done so by 7 p.m., police said. Also charged in the case was 
a friend of Simpson, Phillip Gay, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the girl said Simpson and Gay forced their way into her 
home Sunday night at 11:30 during a party. She said they chased her into a 
bedroom, where they restrained her and assaulted her.  
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-3, 260-pound defensive end, Simpson was named the Greater Houston 
prep defensive player of the year by the Touchdown Club of Houston after last 
season. He was widely recruited and had considered Colorado, Texas, Baylor and 
Miami before choosing USC. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson, who is on vacation, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday.

DRUG SWEEP NETS PLAYERS AT SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two members of the Sylmar High football team were among 18 male students 
arrested on suspicion of selling drugs during a recent undercover narcotics 
sweep at the school, authorities confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students 18 or older were arrested, including Myron Brown, a senior 
defensive back.Troy Berg and Elisha Kubly-Dunbar, both 18, also were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was arrested on suspicion of two felony counts stemming from the alleged 
sale of marijuana and cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of minors arrested in the sweep, conducted last Wednesday, were not 
released. However, at least one other Sylmar football player also was arrested, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The felony arrests were made by the Los Angeles Police Department's Juvenile 
Narcotics Division, which placed an undercover officer posing as a Sylmar 
student on campus several months ago, Det. Jeff Salo said. The majority of the 
arrests dealt with the sale of marijuana, Salo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep was made as part of a program wherein schools are randomly singled 
out for undercover surveillance, Salo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sylmar Principal Linda Ambro nor football Coach Jeff Engilman could be 
reached for comment.

CERRITOS LINES UP ECLECTIC 3RD SEASON; PERFORMING ARTS: AMONG THE CENTER'S 
OFFERINGS FOR 1994-95 ARE BALLET, TONY BENNETT AND THE AREA PREMIERE OF 
'BARRYMORE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal Philharmonic 
Orchestra and singing hoofer Liza Minnelli highlight the Cerritos Center for 
the Performing Arts' eclectic third season, unveiled today by center officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley MacLaine will kick off the 1994-95 season on Sept. 16. Also among the 
41 groups and performers coming to the center are Neville Marriner with the 
Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in its only Southern California appearance, 
the Vienna Symphony and soprano Leontyne Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet star Julio Bocca with Ballet Argentino -- making its United States 
debut -- a touring ensemble with eight principal dancers from New York City 
Ballet and the traditional Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company of China headline the 
center's dance offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Newman, Johnny Cash, Little Richard, the Chieftains, Art Garfunkel and 
Tony Bennett top an expanded pop menu. 
</P>
<P>
 In theater, the 18-month-old facility will present the national touring 
production of "Fiddler on the Roof," starring Theodore Bikel, and the L.A.-area 
premiere of a national touring production of "Barrymore," a play based on the 
late veteran actor John Barrymore's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The RSC's presentation, a U.S. premiere, will incorporate sections of the 
second and third parts of Shakespeare's "Henry VI" trilogy and is subtitled 
"The Battle for the Throne," a center spokeswoman said. The RSC and the Royal 
Philharmonic appearances are part of UK/LA 1994, a regional British arts 
festival slated for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Center General Manager Victor Gotesman, who has vowed to lead rather than 
follow the community's tastes, on Wednesday characterized the new season's 
programming as "very mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said in a phone interview, "we're still building our foundation and 
vision for the center" and educating a community "that's never had a performing 
arts center. . . . We will eventually have more adventurous programming on the 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 (One potentially challenging work, Philip Glass's 4 1/2-hour opera "Einstein 
on the Beach," which Gotesman had tried to book, turned out to be too 
expensive, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the center's current season, which completed its first full 
season on May 15 (it opened with an abbreviated season in early 1993), will not 
be available until July, Gotesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total budget of $8.3 million for the coming fiscal year has been submitted 
to the Cerritos City Council, which is expected to chip in $2 million, as it 
has annually, to bridge the expected gap between expenses and revenues, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance figures are not ready either, but the number of days that the 
facility was occupied last season by performances or with technical 
preparations was 135, Gotesman said. That figure is expected to rise to 179 or 
more in the season ahead, he said, as other productions are booked.

BRING YOUR OWN BRAHMS; PARTY ON AND ON AT SADDLEBACK'S CHAMBER MUSIC MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 First it was daylong screenings of "I Love Lucy" and "The Twilight Zone" 
episodes. Now there's a Chamber Music Marathon, live, 12 hours' worth. 
</P>
<P>
 And anybody can play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a group, but you have music you'd like to play, just show 
up," said Kay Pech, associate professor at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, 
where the music marathon begins Saturday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring your Brahms! You're a pianist? Bring a piano quartet and I'll send you 
off with a violinist, violist and cellist," Pech said. "I'll spot Stacey and 
Peggy and whoever and you guys can go off to a rehearsal room." 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon is a fund-raiser for the Saddleback Student Chapter of the 
American String Teachers' Assn. Pech, faculty sponsor for the event, teaches 
chamber music classes and leads the chamber orchestra at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do have a group, call ahead for a performance time," Pech said. "If 
you just want to listen, we leave the doors open so the audience can come and 
go. You can run out and get pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a 15-minute limit on each performance, but participants can play as 
many times as they want, with as many groups as they like. Established groups 
can schedule as many performances as they want: "We've had koto ensembles sign 
themselves up for every hour on the hour," Pech said. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission for those who come just to listen is $2, and that includes a cookie 
and a beverage. Performers pay $4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now wait one hemidemisemiquaver: Audiences usually pay and performers get 
paid. Why would performers pay twice as much as listeners? 
</P>
<P>
 Pech's explanation almost made sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are there for fun," she continued. "And they know it's a 
fund-raiser for a scholarship. If I were a musician (out there), I'd pay my $4 
fee and play all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the fee structure, it all adds up: Each marathon raises enough for 
one music scholarship. According to Pech, there have been eight such marathons 
over the last 10 years, with a crescendo to the current two or more per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pech expects scores of musicians to participate, and proceeds from the event 
will help enable one student to attend the ASTA Summer Institute of Chamber 
Music in Santa Barbara. Tuition, room and board for a week is $425. A similar 
marathon in January raised $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying to play isn't the only difference between the marathon and most musical 
events. Programs, for instance, are usually printed before a concert; here they 
come after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never know the program until it's been played," Pech explained. "Teachers 
come with little children playing duets, or maybe a quartet of violinists. 
Families come and play together. And there's always new music we've never heard 
before.  
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward I type it up and mail it out to all the participants as a memento," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that individuals hoping to pair up with musical playmates 
would have to be stupendous sight-readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not necessarily," she said. "You'd be amazed. Young ones sit in with old, 
it's amateurs with professionals. A lot of people know the music already. 
Everybody's very casual." 
</P>
<P>
 And while chamber repertory may by definition connote small groups, they're 
not exclusively small ones. The groups often get bigger as the marathon rolls 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6," Pech said. "It doesn't need that 
many players, maybe nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when the players get tired, we'll double two or three people to a 
part," she said. "Last time we went till midnight, and for one Hungarian-style 
quartet movement, we had a pianist and three to a part for the other parts, and 
at that point everybody was getting kind of crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 "This time we're going to try to stop at 10 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chamber Music Marathon takes place Saturday at Saddleback College, 28000 
Marguerite Parkway, Fine Arts Room 101, Mission Viejo. 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. $2, 
includes beverage and cookie. Performers, $4. (714) 457-9976.

GROUP EFFORTS DON'T MEAN SOLOIST HAS CHANGED HIS TUNE; BLUES: JOHN HAMMOND 
PREFERS TO GO IT ALONE, BUT HE DOESN'T SQUANDER HIS 'GREAT FORTUNE' OF WORKING 
WITH THE GREATS. HE PLAYS TONIGHT IN O.C.

<P>
 For some 30 years, with nothing more than his guitar, his voice, a harmonica 
and the stomp of his foot, John Hammond has moved audiences with blue tales of 
love, lust and heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has appeared and recorded with various bands over the years, his 
reputation as a passionate conveyor of the Delta blues tradition has been built 
on solo appearances, on his ability to touch listeners with the poetry of the 
blues masters and the simple tools of their trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to the Pointblank/Charisma label in 1992, though, Hammond's 
recording has taken a more urban turn, focusing on group presentation. His 
first album for the label, "Got Love If You Want It," found him sharing the 
microphone with John Lee Hooker, Little Charlie and the Night Cats and his 
producer J.J. Cale among others. His latest, "Trouble No More," has only a 
single cut that features Hammond working solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this signal some change in direction for the 51-year-old bluesman? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say," he answered on the phone from a Sunset Boulevard hotel 
room. "I'm still a solo artist primarily, but I've also had the great fortune 
to work with whomever I wanted. When I had a chance to record ("Trouble No 
More") with Cale producing again, I thought it would be great to use (Little) 
Charlie Baty and the band. Everything just clicked and I felt we did such 
strong tunes together." 
</P>
<P>
 But working solo remains his chosen way to hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a solo, I can do so much more, travel farther, reach more parts of the 
world. My strongest suit is that of a solo blues artist. And there aren't many 
out there doing that any more. It puts me in a unique position." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond does travel farther than most, doing about 200 shows a year. He began 
1994 in Europe, went to Australia and Brazil, and last week made appearances at 
the second annual Crossroads Blues Festival in Greenwood, Miss., and at the 
House of Blues club in New Orleans. He'll play tonight at the San Juan 
Capistrano Library as part of its Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing solo, Hammond said, "is the essence of the blues. The artists I've 
admired tremendously -- Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters -- all began solo before 
moving into the combo format. I've worked all kinds of shows with Wolf and 
Muddy and other Chicago-style artists who all said, 'Keep doing what you're 
doing. It's the real thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He says his real idols are "the solo troubadours of the '30s and '40s," and he 
thinks that when everything is working right, he can be much more effective 
alone than with a band. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I love the fact that I have the chance to work in either format." For one 
thing, he relishes working with his heroes. One of them, legendary R & B singer 
Charles Brown (the fabled composer of "Merry Christmas Baby"), not only 
contributed the title song to Hammond's new album but played piano on a couple 
of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond remembers buying "one of Charles' albums around 1957, where he does 
'Black Night,' 'Driftin' Blues' and 'Trouble Blues.' It's great music. I always 
hoped I would get to hear him play one day, but never in my wildest dreams did 
I think I would record with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He met Brown for the first time two years ago at the Montreux Jazz Festival 
where Brown was appearing with Bonnie Raitt. "He said he'd heard me do 
'Driftin' Blues' with John Lee Hooker and liked it," Hammond recalled, "so I 
said flippantly, 'I'd love to record with you sometime.' And he said we should! 
So I took him up on it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Trouble No More" also finds Hammond singing a tune called "Nasty Swing" by 
Cliff Carlisle, a hillbilly singer from the '30s and '40s. It marks the first 
time Hammond can be heard yodeling on a record. But don't try to tell him it's 
a country song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliff Carlisle called himself a blues singer. It's just that his record 
company wouldn't acknowledge it. There have always been white blues singers, 
but the racism of the United States has kept them separate. The whites weren't 
allowed to call themselves blues artists and the blacks weren't allowed to call 
themselves country artists. This kind of racism still exists. It's pathetic in 
this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the scope of Hammond's knowledge of music and the depth of his opinions 
are expansive (few have done as much to introduce the rock generation to the 
blues tradition), he doesn't consider himself a scholar. "I've never claimed to 
be an authority of any kind. The things I know are from my own experience, 
having played and worked in the same format as a lot of the great artists. I 
learned in the tradition. And I am a fan." 
</P>
<P>
 A son of the late record producer John Henry Hammond, who was instrumental in 
the careers of musicians from Benny Goodman and Billie Holiday to Bob Dylan and 
Bruce Springsteen, Hammond began following music while barely in his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a teen-ager in the '50s, on the radio you could hear blues, rock 
and R&B. I gravitated toward the stuff that had more intensity to it. Instead 
of Elvis, I was more into Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. Instead of Pat Boone, I 
was into Eddie Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1957, I picked up a country blues album on Folkways, a sampler of artists 
from the '30s that included Leroy Carr, Blind Boy Fuller, Willie McTell and 
others. It really opened my eyes. I saw it as the roots to the rock 'n' roll I 
heard on the radio, the most direct and incredible stuff I'd ever heard. Not 
long after that, I got a guitar myself and started fooling around." 
</P>
<P>
 His father's musical connections had little direct bearing on young Hammond's 
interests; his parents had divorced when he was 5. But John the elder's 
influence was felt. "He loved music in general and had a great ear. He 
instilled in me the intensity, the passion for the music." Some have seen 
parallels in the two Hammonds' careers, as the son has served a vehicle for the 
discovery of the Band and Jimi Hendrix. Hammond dismisses these assumptions. "I 
may have introduced (the members of the Band) to Dylan, but they were great 
before I met them." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hendrix? "He was playing at a place called the Cafe Wha (in Greenwich 
Village) and a friend of mine said 'you've got to hear this guy, he's great.' I 
was playing at the Gaslight and Hendrix had just been fired from Curtis 
Knight's band and was stranded in New York. He and I met between gigs and he 
asked me if he could play. I was delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A two-week gig followed at the Cafe Au Go Go, where a number of luminaries 
heard the unknown guitarist. Among them was Chas Chandler of the Animals, who 
ended up sponsoring the trip to England that resulted in the first recording by 
the Jimi Hendrix Experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ready," said Hammond. "There was nothing I did for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no denying how much Hammond has done during his career for the 
blues tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tradition is in great shape," he said. "The strength of the blues 
in general, in terms of the musical idiom, will never go away. There was a 
concerted effort in the '70s and '80s by the big record labels and the radio 
stations to wipe it out. But small labels were formed that specialize in the 
blues. And they were so effective in making the music available that they had 
to be acknowledged. Today there are blues fanatics all over the world. It may 
not be top of the pops, but it will never be denied." 
</P>
<P>

Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. $5. (714) 493-1752.

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; CHANGES FILL MORE SEATS AT PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Laguna Playhouse's current season draws to a close in two weeks, it 
will mark the end of Andrew Barnicle's third year as artistic director of the 
county's oldest and second-largest theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, he and executive director Richard Stein have made 
significant strides toward professionalizing the institution. And they've 
presided over some astonishing, if little noticed, changes in programming and 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, for example, despite a 12.5% decline in the subscription base 
that would give some producers nightmares, more theatergoers have been to the 
Playhouse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single tickets have been hot," Barnicle said recently. "They've gone through 
the roof. I think it's a direct result of the shows we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the final figures have yet to be tallied, the Playhouse expects to 
sell nearly double the amount -- 6,500, or an average of 1,300 per show -- 
projected in the theater's annual budget at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The box office already has racked up sales of 11,000 single tickets, Barnicle 
said. And with "The Mystery of Irma Vep" proving to be a big hit midway through 
its run at the Playhouse's Moulton Theater in Laguna Beach, single-ticket sales 
are expected to reach nearly 12,000 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've more than made up for the gap in subscriptions," Barnicle said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say he is sanguine about the loss of 1,100 season ticket 
holders (down from 8,800 to 7,700), which he attributes to a soft regional 
economy and also, quite candidly, to his own programming choices. 
</P>
<P>
 But he makes no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "'When I first got here," he said, "I thought it would be worth it for us to 
ease off on subscribers if it meant getting new people into the theater. And I 
think the board is now convinced it's not such a bad thing to take a dip in the 
subscription base if you're going to get a more diverse crowd. Sometimes a 
theater can be oversubscribed." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three seasons, Barnicle has produced a handful of firsts for the 
Playhouse in an effort to challenge an audience that, rightly or wrongly, had a 
reputation for unadventurous taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among those challenges were plays by Sam Shepard ("True West"), Joe Orton 
("What the Butler Saw"), Henrik Ibsen ("An Enemy of the People") and Charles 
Ludlam ("Irma Vep"), as well as the first Shakespearean production in 28 years 
("A Midsummer Night's Dream") and an original comedy by John Twomey ("Teacher's 
Lounge"). 
</P>
<P>
 Equally striking was the audience's favorable response. Several of those plays 
set box-office records, and all are among the 10 highest-grossing, non-musical 
shows the Playhouse has done, Barnicle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teacher's Lounge," "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "True West" are Nos. 1, 2 
and 3, followed by Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs," Alan Ayckbourn's 
"Bedroom Farce," "What the Butler Saw," "Enemy of the People," William Inge's 
"Bus Stop," Michael Brady's "To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday" and Eugene 
O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness!"  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, each of the top 10 shows -- plus the overall box-office champ, the 
musical "Oliver!" -- was produced during the past three seasons. And with a 
record 75% renewal rate of subscribers for next season, the Playhouse clearly 
is doing something right.  
</P>
<P>
 But as much as Barnicle has transformed artistic decisions, he credits Stein 
for making "even more dramatic changes" in selling the theater to a wider 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick has put together a very strong marketing campaign," he said. "He's made 
use of sophisticated advertising techniques. He's gotten group sales and 
corporate sponsors on a regular basis for each of the plays. He's done the sort 
of things that make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Playhouse could sell every last ticket to all its shows and 
still not break even. Like all not-for-profit theater companies, it must raise 
money in unearned contributions to help defray operating expenses. Roughly 30% 
of the Playhouse's $1.2-million budget comes from donations and grants, 
Barnicle said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 COOLING IT: Over at the Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana, the end of 
the season also brings good news. "We've had a successful year," said Gary 
Christensen, a founding member of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 10% decline in subscriptions to roughly 500, the storefront troupe 
will finish slightly in the black ($2,000) on an annual budget of about 
$50,000, also largely due to increased single-ticket sales, Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was mainly the solid success of Lorraine Hansberry's "A Raisin in the Sun," 
with attendance at 80% of capacity in its 61-seat venue, that put ART over the 
top. (Its current show through June 11, "The Search for Signs of Intelligent 
Life in the Universe," is drawing at about 50% of capacity.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the troupe's longtime quest for air conditioning might soon yield 
results. A cooling unit from a building being torn down by the city of Santa 
Ana could be donated to ART, Christensen said. If so, that means the troupe 
would consider extending its schedule into the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, ART will stage a series of new-play readings during the third 
week in August. "Where we'll be doing it depends on the air conditioning," he 
noted. "If we don't get the unit, we may have to find a site somewhere else." 
Stay tuned.

HIS SWING SHIFT REALLY DOES -- TO A CAJUN BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Cajun musicians get the luxury of making music only when the real work of 
the day is done. For some it can be backbreaking work in the rice fields, for 
others arduous labor on the oil rigs that dot the southwestern Louisiana 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no surprise earlier this week that singer and accordionist Walter 
Mouton was focused more on buying a new rig for the trucking business he's 
starting than on his appearances this weekend at the annual Southern California 
Cajun & Zydeco Festival in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what I'm going to be doing when I get there," Mouton, 55, said 
with a laugh in a phone interview from his home in Scott, La. "I just have my 
airplane ticket, and I'll do whatever they've got scheduled for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, "whatever" includes afternoon performances Saturday and Sunday 
at the festival proper, held in Rainbow Lagoon adjacent to the Long Beach 
Convention Center. Then on Saturday night, Mouton and his band, the Scott 
Playboys, also are scheduled to headline the festival's first evening dance, 
which will be held in the Convention Center's ballroom.  
</P>
<P>
 His primary order of business this week, however, was taking delivery on a 
truckfor his new business, which he is starting more out of necessity than 
desire. The trucking firm that employed him as a driver the last four years, 
the Missouri-based Churchill Truck Lines, went out of business in April, 
leaving Mouton and 2,200 others without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's ironic, since Mouton had decided long ago not to try to earn a living 
through his music because of the notorious lack of job security for musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing music has always been a supplement, something to help put bread on 
the table," he said. "But I didn't like the insecurity of playing music for a 
living. I got married young, had a family, and I've always been scared that (if 
I depended on music gigs), somebody would tighten up on that faucet and the 
water would come down to a drip." 
</P>
<P>
 So instead, Mouton worked in the oil fields for 14 years, then took up as a 
truck driver by day. On weekends, he performed near his home in Scott, just a 
freeway exit west on Interstate 10 from Lafayette, known as "the Capital of 
Cajun Country." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years he has ventured out of Louisiana to play Cajun or folk 
festivals in Rhode Island, New York and Tennessee. His band makes its West 
Coast debut this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franklin (Zawacki, producer of the festivals in Rhode Island and Long Beach), 
he got me to go to Rhode Island three years straight," Mouton explained. "I 
knew he put this one on too, so I said, 'Hell, I want to go to California next 
year.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 His presence in the Long Beach lineup brings an aspect of Cajun music that 
hasn't been represented here before: the Cajun-country music hybrid that 
developed in the wake of the discovery of oil in Louisiana in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the oil business brought high-paying jobs, workers from surrounding 
states flooded into the previously isolated region. With them came steel 
guitars and other elements from string-band music that quickly found a place 
alongside the fiddle and single-row button accordion that characterize 
traditional Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hackberry Ramblers, still playing after nearly a half-century together, 
and Mouton's group are probably the best-known exponents of the country-Cajun 
hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not incorporate too much of the hillbilly style in our songs," Mouton 
said. "Some players use a double-neck steel and put a whole lot of the country 
sound in. But the guy I've got (Randall Foreman) is special. He doesn't use the 
pedals to come up with country-music licks; he uses them to create our Cajun 
dance music." 
</P>
<P>
 Integral to that music are the traditional Cajun two-steps and waltzes, dances 
that are similar to their country-music cousins, but generally more fluid and 
lilting. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to dancing, Mouton has seen some significant changes in the 42 
years he's been fronting his own band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago we used to have dances six nights a week in this neck of the woods. 
Nowadays, there's not as many dance halls as there used to be. The restaurants 
took over, and now every restaurant's got a Cajun band and a little dance floor 
where people try to dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Cajuns, Mouton loves eating as much as he loves music and dancing. 
He just believes that, as with chain-saw juggling and brain surgery, there are 
some activities that shouldn't be performed simultaneously. Consequently, he 
still prefers the atmosphere of the old-time dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't feel comfortable set up in a restaurant. In a real dance hall, 
you become part of the situation," he said. "You know the people come to listen 
to your music and to dance. At a restaurant, their first intention is to eat; 
they don't leave their homes just for the music. It gives me satisfaction that 
people come to listen and to dance in the places where I go." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among those is La Poussier, a dance hall in Breaux Bridge, not far from 
the more famous Mulate's Restaurant, which hosts many of the top Cajun bands. 
Mouton's band has been playing La Poussier for 30 years, every Saturday night 
for the last 10 of those. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouton started playing the accordion early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved music and fortunately I was musically inclined. My daddy 
played, and he was my biggest influence. Of course, I did listen to (Cajun 
accordionists) Aldus Roger, Lawrence Walker and Iry LeJeune. I still listen to 
other people, and if I hear something I like, I might incorporate it into 
something I do." 
</P>
<P>
 He formed his first band when he was 13, yet in all his years of playing, he 
has been in a recording studio exactly once, almost 30 years ago. That session 
produced just one 45-r.p.m. single. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we did record that rascal, the guy that sang it was pretty well 
polluted. . . . We stood him up by a boom mike and he kept fading in and out -- 
he couldn't stand up straight. Then we set him on a stool, but he still did the 
same thing," he said. "It gave me a bad taste that stayed with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Mouton seems to get everything he needs from music playing at La 
Poussier and the occasional trip to an out-of-state festival. Fame doesn't 
appear to enter the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been one for all that publicity. I just love to play that music on 
weekends. . . . It's like they say: We don't mind working hard all week, and 
come Saturday night, we love to play hard. . . . I look forward to playing on 
Saturday nights, more or less just to let out some feelings. And the people who 
come to see us, I like to be a part of their evening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to start traveling. I don't say that possibly after my working 
days are over I may travel a bit more. I've made three trips this year, and 
we're going back to New York in July." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouton and his wife have two sons and a daughter (all now in their 20s) none 
of whom have followed in his path as a musician. "They play the radio -- loud 
," Mouton said, sounding less like one of the revered proponents of a vital 
strand of indigenous American folk music and more like Everyfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wished that they would have picked it up," he said. "We always had a 
guitar, fiddle and accordion in the boys' room. But I was always one who took 
care of an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't like seeing guys pulling an accordion from both ends like 
they're trying to make it come apart. An accordion is made to be played, not 
abused. So I think I carried that thought back to them, and if they'd take a 
chance where they might break something, I'd get all over them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the urge to play Cajun music may not extend to his own children, the 
appreciation for it has spread far beyond the 22 Louisiana parishes of 
Acadiana, or "Cajun country." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going like wildfire," Mouton said, his voice filled as much with awe as 
with pride. "Just in the few places I've been and seen what happened. They ask 
you for songs by name -- they really know the music. Normally you wouldn't 
expect something like that."

TWO PORTRAYALS; CLOSING ARGUMENTS MADE IN WIFE'S MURDER-SOLICITATION TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conflicting portraits of Mary Ellen Samuels, known around the courthouse as 
the "green widow," emerged Thursday as a prosecutor and defense attorney gave 
closing arguments in a murder-solicitation trial that has had all the elements 
of a trashy soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, earned the moniker because she allegedly hired a hit man to kill 
her husband in December, 1988, then spent nearly all her $500,000 inheritance 
before she was charged with his and the hit man's murder 13 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on trial in late March, charged with two counts of murder -- one 
count for the husband, the other for the alleged hit man -- conspiracy, 
soliciting murder and a single count of attempted murder. If convicted of 
first-degree murder, Samuels could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in her own defense, Samuels denied involvement in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 When the jury begins deliberations next week it will consider evidence that 
includes tales of love, lust, murder and treachery that have poured forth from 
the witness stand, along with testimony about steamy love letters, shopping 
sprees for lingerie and fur coats, limousines, cocaine parties, hit men, 
insurance checks, fast cars, child molestation, male strippers, mother-daughter 
cheesecake shots and a talking parrot who insulted the police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the lawyers tried to supply the meaning behind the lurid details. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a story of murder, twice told," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi 
explained to the six men and six women on the jury. She portrayed Samuels as a 
greedy and manipulative woman who hired a hit man to kill her estranged husband 
after calculating that he was "worth more to her dead than alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted murder charge stems from an incident a month before Robert 
Samuels was slain. Testimony varied on whether the weapon used to assault him 
was a pink lead pipe, a pink broomstick or, as Samuels claimed, a rubber dog 
toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Maurizi alleged, Samuels orchestrated the hit man's slaying at the 
hands of other friends she had met in bars, people the prosecutor described as 
"alcoholics who didn't care about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, a 40-year-old motion picture camera assistant who worked on 
the films "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was shot to death in his 
Northridge home. The day after his body was found, the suspected hit man took 
out a $25,000 life insurance policy, naming Samuels' daughter, Nicole, 
beneficiary, Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, alleged hit man James R. Bernstein was strangled, beaten and 
dumped along a highway in an isolated canyon in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it was "an honor" to defend Samuels, attorney Phil Nameth picked apart 
the testimony of his client's former friends, who were witnesses for the 
prosecution. He pointed out that many of them -- including the pair who 
confessed to killing Bernstein -- cooperated in exchange for plea bargains for 
lesser sentences or grants of immunity that spared them from prosecution for 
their roles in the slayings. The prosecution, he said, "made a deal with the 
devil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maurizi urged the jury: "Don't write off this case. Don't write off any of 
the testimony because these are people you wouldn't invite home to dinner. 
Don't judge them, judge their testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth pointed out that there was no evidence of any payments to hit men in 
Samuels' bank records, observing, "Of course it's not going to say 'Joe Schmo, 
hit man. Thanks for the hit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Nameth said, "This has become a case of family values." He contended 
that the prosecution used Samuels' lifestyle and spending habits after her 
husband's death to "dirty her up" because she had no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney maintained that she was a victim of domestic abuse and 
that Robert Samuels sexually molested Nicole Samuels since she was 12. 
According to testimony, the daughter approached four people while she was still 
in high school and asked them for a gun to kill Robert Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not 'Leave It to Beaver.' It's not 'Make Room for Daddy.' This was a 
dysfunctional family," Nameth said. "Mr. Samuels had a drinking problem. Mr. 
Samuels had a physical and sexual abuse problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said the evidence did not support an abuse excuse, which she contended 
was "manufactured" by Samuels and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the abuse? Where is the alcoholism? Where is the abuse of Nicole?" 
she said, arguing that those allegations came only from Samuels and her 
daughter, and were not corroborated by other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels spent the $500,000 inheritance like it was water, Maurizi said. "We've 
got fur coats and limousines and trashy lingerie and a big birthday bash and a 
$50,000 Porsche, insurance policies, and the spending of all that money," 
Maurizi said. "We've got trips to Las Vegas and Cancun and San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the prosecutor noted, she didn't spend a dime on her husband's headstone. 
</P>
<P>
 While such behavior was "suspicious," Maurizi said, "it wasn't a crime. She 
almost got away with the perfect murder." 
</P>
<P>
 But choosing Bernstein to kill her husband was Samuels' downfall, the 
prosecutor said. Just as he was weak enough to succumb to her manipulations -- 
he was easily intimidated by police, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor pointed to three pieces of key evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bernstein's wallet was found in Samuels' new Porsche when she was arrested 
for his murder in January, 1990, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Samuels made no mention of abuse in a "Dear John" letter she wrote Robert 
Samuels when she left him in late 1986. Instead, Samuels wrote: ". . . It seems 
strange that we have been married for just about 7 years and I don't know you 
at all! I wanted to sit down with you and tell you that I feel (you probably do 
too) our marriage has gone completely stale . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get a few groceries -- you take & hide the checkbook. . . . I 
could see how much money was left in the checkbook -- your (sic) not my father 
& I resent being treated like a child! This business about your being boss is 
not for me!" 
</P>
<P>
 * A list Samuels wrote on the back of a Christmas card shortly before her 
arrest, the prosecutor said, most accurately reflects what she was thinking as 
police closed in: "Nicole-gun (molesting). People are saying I did. . . . 
Nailed me for Bob, want me for Jim."

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; SIGHTS ARE SET BEYOND YAROSLAVSKY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It says volumes about the 3rd District County Board of Supervisors race that 
political observers are not speculating about whether City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky will win but who will run for his City Hall seat when he does, with 
his wife being one often-mentioned potential aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question is, does Zev get 65% of the vote or 80%?" said consultant 
Richard Lichtenstein. "The real focus is on who's going to be the next 
councilperson." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the city's Ethics Commission is being pressed by impatient City 
Council wanna-bes to set a date when they can start raising money to run for 
Yaroslavsky's 5th District seat. Current rules bar fund-raising until a special 
election to fill the seat -- not normally open until 1997 -- has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid for election Tuesday, Yaroslavsky will rely heavily on voters from 
the West Side and San Fernando Valley hillside portions of the district to 
reflexively cast their ballots for him, with some urging from his cash-flush 
campaign machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to spend $400,000 to $500,000 total," said Kevin Acebo, the veteran 
councilman's campaign manager. Still, that will be about four times as much as 
Yaroslavsky's leading challenger, retired city Fire Capt. Don Wallace, will 
have to spend and only half the $850,000 Yaroslavsky has raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glitch in this apparently seamless story of the political promotion 
of one of the city's best-known elected officials was produced by the script's 
own star -- Yaroslavsky -- when he was spotted on Memorial Day weekend removing 
several Wallace campaign signs from a busy intersection in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A city worker who saw Yaroslavsky with the signs and later reported the matter 
to police even took a photo of the candidate, in sunglasses, shorts and his 
shirttails out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace later filed a complaint accusing Yaroslavsky of political vandalism, 
sought an injunction against Yaroslavsky going near any of Wallace's signs and 
called the sign caper a "crime against democracy." His campaign manager likened 
the incident to Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne denied Wallace's application for 
injunctive relief but chided Yaroslavsky for acting in a "childish" manner 
while City Atty. James K. Hahn continued to juggle the issue of what to do with 
Wallace's criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is also launching a cable television ad campaign in the final primary 
election weekend to spotlight the sign incident and cast Yaroslavsky as 
arrogant and ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is being viewed by the Wallace campaign, frustrated by 
Yaroslavsky's fund-raising clout and its inability to engage Yaroslavsky in 
more than two poorly attended debates, as its best bet for stalling the 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has said he was not trying to sabotage Wallace's signs but rather 
was gathering evidence that the signs were illegally placed on public or 
private property and lacked proper identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman subsequently filed a complaint of his own, asking the city's 
Bureau of Street Maintenance to take steps to remove the Wallace signs from 
where they were posted on city property. Such postings are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this 11th-hour flap, there are few political observers who think 
Wallace, 53, can pull off an upset and force Yaroslavsky into a November 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most political consultants are speculating not about Zev 
Yaroslavsky's prospects, but Barbara Yaroslavsky's. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky did not return The Times' call to ask about this issue, 
but her husband said the couple have not discussed the matter. "We're focused 
on this election," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Weintraub, the flamboyant former Los Angeles school board president, 
and Michael Feuer, executive director of Bet Tzedek, a Jewish legal-services 
organization, have already said they are running for Yaroslavsky's seat. Also 
considering the race are Lea Purwin D'Agostina, a deputy in the district 
attorney's office; Carol Schatz, director of government affairs for the Central 
City Assn., and possibly one or more of the losing candidates in the intensely 
competitive 42nd Assembly District race now raging on the West Side. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the time being, such would-be candidates are cooling their heels, 
waiting for Yaroslavsky to take over the Board of Supervisors seat now held by 
Ed Edelman. The seat, representing the West Side and much of the San Fernando 
Valley, opened in December, when Edelman suddenly announced he would not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman's seat was coveted by a number of politicians but finally it was 
Yaroslavsky, 45, who tossed his hat into the ring and began a voracious drive 
to raise money for the race even as he pledged to bring campaign-finance reform 
to the county Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Yaroslavsky, who has been endorsed by scores of elected 
officials and civic leaders, including Mayor Richard Riordan, has promised to 
shake up a sleepy, inefficient and secretive county bureaucracy and bring to 
the Board of Supervisors the same spirit of reform that has marked his 19-year 
career at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the debates, Yaroslavsky told a Woodland Hills homeowners group that 
county government has run amok and that as the tough-minded chairman of the 
city's Budget and Finance Committee, he had the moxie and experience to put the 
county's fiscal house in order and bring financial stability as well to the 
Metropolitan Transportation Agency, the area's huge mass-transit body. The 
supervisors have a big say in MTA decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wallace has tried to outflank Yaroslavsky on reform by calling not 
only for progress on campaign finance but term limits for supervisors 
(Yaroslavsky opposes them) and an end to their perks, including 
taxpayer-financed cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired fireman and former Edelman aide who in 1988 ran a credible 
campaign against Supervisor Mike Antonovich also has billed himself as the 
environmental candidate, pointing to his endorsement by the local League of 
Conservation Voters while damning Yaroslavsky as a "coward" for not agreeing to 
more debates. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Yaroslavsky's long experience at City Hall and his formidable 
fund-raising ability, Wallace paints it all as a sign that Yaroslavsky is a 
career politician, in bed with special interests, who, as a supervisor, would 
lack the willpower and independence to shake up county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is youth counselor Elgin Trammell Sr. and environmental 
consultant Michael Hirsch. Any candidate who garners more than 50% of the vote 
on Tuesday, will win. If none do, a runoff will be held Nov. 8.

A NEW BEGINNING; MISSING WOMAN'S PARENTS LEAVING NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been three years to the day since her daughter, Denise, disappeared 
without a trace in the middle of the night, but Ione Huber feels the pain of 
not knowing what happened to her as if it were yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least now, however, there is something in her future other than 
anguish-filled days and nights waiting for the phone to ring with news about 
her only daughter. In July, Ione Huber and her husband, Dennis, will move back 
to their native North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a new beginning," Ione Huber said Thursday. "We're going back to 
where we grew up, and that is going to be better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven years ago, the Hubers rolled out of neighboring South Dakota -- 
where they had moved after marrying -- on a journey that would take them to 
Modesto, where Denise was born, to Sacramento, to Northridge, to Richardson, 
Tex., and back to California -- this time to Newport Beach, where they 
established a home seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple leave distraught that three years have passed and they still have 
no word on their daughter's fate, angry that someone they believe has 
information that could give them peace is withholding it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's responsible for not letting us know what has happened? That's what 
embitters you," Ione Huber, 51, said. "The torture of not knowing -- that 
embitters you. What did they do with her body? Where is she so that we can put 
(an end) to all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to deal with it. Those are the things I wish we could find out. It 
would make the move a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber is sure, however, that if her daughter were alive, she would have 
found a way to communicate with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was too caring a person . . . to put us through that," Ione Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on June 3, 1991, Denise Anette Huber, then 23, dropped off a friend at 
his Huntington Beach residence. They had been at a rock concert at the Forum in 
Inglewood earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last time Denise was seen. The next day, police found her 1988 
Honda Accord abandoned on a shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway, a few dozen 
feet south of the Bear Street off-ramp and just 2 1/2 miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had a flat tire. But police were never able to determine exactly what 
happened at the scene, and Huber's body has never been found. Tracking dogs 
followed her scent for a while but lost it abruptly, causing investigators to 
believe she might have entered another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An intense search by police, family, friends and scores of volunteers 
followed. Thousands of flyers and bumper stickers seeking information on Denise 
Huber's whereabouts were distributed throughout Orange County. Billboards and 
banners asked for help. A huge sign with the missing girl's likeness was posted 
near the spot where her car was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends raised a $10,000 reward, and the television shows 
"America's Most Wanted" and "Inside Edition" publicized the case nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The family hired a private detective and psychics. Police checked every lead 
-- including human bones unearthed in February, 1992, near Interstate 10 in 
Indio. All to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Costa Mesa police continued the investigation. Sgt. Tom Boylan, who was 
assigned to the case five months ago, said recent news reports on the 
sensational disappearance are bringing fresh leads in an otherwise extremely 
tough case. 
</P>
<P>
 The case "is fairly unusual (because) in almost three years there's been no 
substantial leads and she hasn't turned up," Boylan said. "That doesn't happen 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber, who since the disappearance has successfully battled breast 
cancer, says she recently found the strength to begin cleaning out Denise's 
room. She has begun giving away her daughter's clothes and is keeping souvenirs 
and mementos -- "things that were important to her." 
</P>
<P>
 She has also kept possessions that are important to her as a mother: "Things 
from preschool, elementary (school) and high school, things that were kind of 
special -- Mom's Day cards and drawings" among them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers will move at the end of July to Mandan, N.D. -- a small town near 
Bismarck -- to a home that abuts the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Huber, 55, a mortgage banker here, plans to sell computer software that 
can be used in that industry. Ione Huber, who has worked as a substitute 
teacher in this area, said she plans to sell real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber said she wants her son Jeff, 24, and his family -- including his 
21-month-old daughter Ashley Denise -- to move to Mandan sometime in the future 
because, she believes, Southern California is getting too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day you read about crime. It just seems like it's getting worse," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, she said, "we're getting back to where we grew up and that is 
going to be better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Denise will forever be there, a part of them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denise will always be part of our lives, part of our memories," she said. 
"She will always be with us."

AS DORNAN RELAXES, 7 DEMOCRATS VIE FOR CHALLENGER ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As seven Democrats make a final, breathless rush to Tuesday's primary and the 
right to challenge Rep. Robert K. Dornan in the November election, the normally 
combative congressman is taking a relaxed approach: On primary night, Dornan 
will be far above the fray, flying back from D-day celebrations in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who drew no opponents in the Republican primary, has 
not yet felt a need to do much in the way of campaigning, according to his 
staff. But in a signal that the low-key approach is unlikely to last much past 
the primary, he has raised nearly $473,000 since Jan. 1 -- more than seven 
times the amount raised by businessman Mike Farber, the best-financed Democrat 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 And even from Europe, the eight-term conservative with a reputation for 
vitriolic attacks on his political rivals belittled his Democratic opponents as 
"unknown wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best analysis of my campaign is summed up by a national Democrat 
consultant who once said that Bob Dornan always seems to rise up to meet the 
threat," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the district, which takes in parts of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa 
Ana, the crowded field of Democrats was planning an active last few days of 
campaigning, including mailings and precinct walks. But several analysts 
questioned whether any of the candidates had any realistic chance of beating 
Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Democrats are doing it to themselves again," said Mark Petracca, 
associate professor of political science at UC Irvine. "The problem with the 
party in Orange County is that it's democratic. And the consequences of that 
are, frequently, misplaced energy, misplaced or misallocated expenditures of 
funds and frequently a good deal of chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said she did not 
feel party unity had been hurt by the number of candidates in the primary, 
despite some early squabbling about torn-down campaign signs and hard-won 
endorsements.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the candidates have finally settled down," Garcia said. "We're 
getting down to the wire and they're concentrating on the campaigns now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think it's hurt to have so many in the primary. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's the more the merrier as far as trying to get rid of Bob goes," 
she said, adding that she expected the large number of campaigns to yield a 
stronger, larger group of volunteers than the party is typically able to raise 
for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Party considers Dornan vulnerable, largely because his district 
is the only one in Orange County in which Democrats outnumber Republicans. The 
party holds a registration edge of 48% to 41%, according to the most recent 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the seven candidates -- Farber, Santa Ana resident Robert John 
Banuelos, who was the Democratic nominee against Dornan in 1992, and Los 
Alamitos systems analyst John M. Ivler -- each claimed to be the Democratic 
front-runner this week, based on their own polls and informal voter surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the race include Madelene E. Arakelian, a Laguna Hills 
businesswoman; Norman Z. Eckenrode, mayor of Placentia; Don Payne, an engineer 
from Anaheim, and Huu Chung Nguyen, a computer analyst from Orange who 
qualified as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, who moved to the district in February, 1993, for the purpose of 
running against Dornan, has raised more money -- about $63,000 by the most 
recent filing deadline -- and collected more endorsements than any other 
candidate. His endorsements include those of the state Democratic Party and 
many Orange County party luminaries.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Thursday he is now the "unequivocal front-runner" and is paying little 
attention to the other Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now looking at this as merely the warm-up for the battle against Bob 
Dornan," said Farber, who expects to spend close to $200,000 in the primary. He 
said he expects to raise $700,000 to $1 million for the general election, 
assuming he is the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, who is the state director of the Concord Coalition, a group advocating 
a reduction of the federal deficit, said two factors motivated him to run: his 
desire to play a role in helping to cut the deficit and a feeling that Dornan 
was "uninterested" in the needs of his district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "While I've lived in this district a little less than two years, I've been 
there more than Dornan has been in the 10 years that he's lived there, 
representing the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos, who received 41% of the vote in 1992 despite spending less than 
$5,000 and doing little campaigning, did not return phone calls this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign manager Arturo Montez said Banuelos, a volunteer counselor for senior 
citizens, has raised and spent less than $5,000 to date, but is campaigning 
more actively than he did in 1992. Montez said a major focus of the campaign is 
attempting to register voters in Latino and other ethnic communities in the 
central Orange County district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is not to buy the vote," Montez said. "We're going to earn it by 
walking the streets and meeting the needs of the public. We're following the 
same model we did last time, running a grass-roots campaign. Obviously, we are 
not the anointed candidate of the developers and the special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, at least four of the candidates are better financed than Banuelos, 
according to the campaign disclosure statements filed last week. Eckenrode did 
not file any statements, apparently indicating he had not reached the $5,000 
fund-raising threshold, and Payne has said he will not accept any 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivler reported raising more than $12,000, while write-in candidate Chung 
Nguyen took in about $10,000 and Arakelian slightly more than $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Arakelian, who said she expects to spend $50,000 in the primary, "most of it 
mine," said several of her opponents have taken contributions from special 
interest groups. In contrast, she said, "I'm my own lady, by myself, and that's 
how I want the public to see me."  
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the winner of the primary is likely to gain financial backing 
from Beat Bob Inc., a fund-raising committee formed last June with the single 
purpose of defeating Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Adler, former chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party and one of 
the architects of the effort, said the group has raised and spent about $60,000 
so far. Most of the funds have been used for a six-minute videotape that shows 
some of the congressman's more incendiary quotes. Adler and other prominent 
Democrats have endorsed Farber's campaign. Democrats and Dornan Democratic 
chances of defeating Republican Rep. Robert K. Dornan in the 46th Congressional 
District are, in one sense, enhanced this year. The Democrats' registration 
edge has increased from two points in 1992 to seven today. Voter registration: 
1992 Democrat: 46% Republican: 44% Declined to state: 7% Other: 3% * 1994 
Democrat: 48% Republican: 41% Declined to state: 8% Other: 3% * Overcoming a 
Deficit Even facing a registration deficit, Dornan was able to win by a 
comfortable edge in the 1992 general election. Results: Republican Robert K. 
Dornan: 50% Democrat Robert J. Banuelos: 41% Libertarian Richard G. Newhouse:

COUNTY WEIGHS FEE HIKES FOR HEALTH CHECKS; REVENUE: THE 6% INCREASE FOR 
SANITATION AND SAFETY INSPECTIONS WOULD COST LOCAL BUSINESSES $433,072. 
SUPERVISORS WILL LOOK AT THE MATTER ON TUESDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 In the never-ending search for money to keep local government afloat, Orange 
County officials are preparing to tap grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, 
bakeries, pet shops and swimming-pool operators countywide for the increasing 
cost of health inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the corner hot-dog vendor and proprietors of local tattoo parlors and 
peep shows might be asked to pay at least 6% more for sanitation and safety 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the additional fees would nick local businesses for $433,072, 
if approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of concern for the sagging economy, the board froze all inspection charges 
last year. But officials said Thursday that a numbing workload, which has most 
inspectors conducting more than 300 reviews a year, has necessitated a proposal 
for likely increases -- from $16 more per street vendor to $52 more a year for 
large supermarkets. The money would go to fund the increased costs associated 
with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the economic times and the concern for attracting and keeping 
businesses, obviously this is an issue to consider," said Jim Huston, the 
county's assistant director of environmental health. "But I think a majority of 
the people really recognize the importance of health inspections, especially 
when you think of the number of people who go out to eat every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Huston's staff of 52 county inspectors spent nights and weekends 
reviewing 29,333 food-related businesses, 20,659 public swimming pools and 734 
hotels. Those visits resulted in the condemnation of 58,000 pounds of spoiled 
food, license suspensions for 158 eateries or food services and the closure of 
263 pools, Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least every three months last year, county inspectors visited Jaime Luna's 
hot-dog cart at Santa Ana Boulevard and Parton Street in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Luna said he was unaware of the proposed fee increases but 
believes the charges are probably necessary to police a very competitive 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of people who don't keep their carts clean or cook at the 
right temperature," Luna said, standing alongside a steaming vat of beef 
franks. "I keep (the hot dogs) cooking at 250 degrees for three or four 
minutes. You don't want to cook them too long or they won't be any good 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 The extra $16 inspection charge, Luna said, would not be passed on to his 
customers, who now pay about $2.50 for the "special": a hot dog, chips and 
soda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to be a problem," Luna said. "It's part of doing 
good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rhodes, president of the California Restaurant Assn.'s Orange County 
chapter, said he was aware that county officials were considering the 
additional charges but did not know they could take effect so soon. If the 
increases are approved Tuesday, the county will start billing under the new fee 
schedule by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 7,000 restaurants in Orange County would be charged an 
additional $20 to $35 a year, depending on their seating capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is not something that we as an industry like to see happen," 
Rhodes said. "But the county health program is necessary and needed so that we 
can police ourselves. Even if 99.9% of the establishments don't have a problem, 
it's needed so that problems can be detected and action taken. I don't think a 
6% increase will be out of line."

FOX IN THE TERN HOUSE; MARAUDERS DESTROY MOST OF NESTS, ENDANGERING THE 
SANCTUARY'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A red fox and a sparrow hawk have raided more than two-thirds of the nests of 
least terns at the Bolsa Chica wetlands, jeopardizing the colony of the 
endangered species at the reserve, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecological reserve is home to about 10% of the state's population of the 
rare bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem began last month when a lone red fox attacked 60 of the bird 
colony's 90 breeding nests, destroying about two-thirds of its eggs. Troy 
Kelly, a biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game, said it was 
the most devastating attack by a predator since the breeding area was 
established in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recent days, he said, a marauding American kestrel, commonly known as a 
sparrow hawk, has carried off more than a dozen of the terns' surviving chicks, 
raising grave concerns about the colony's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a potential of losing the entire nesting effort for this year at 
Bolsa Chica," Kelly said. If that happens, the birds could abandon the area and 
never come back. "The situation is pretty critical," Kelly said. "I'm very 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks by foxes are not uncommon, Kelly said. A red fox preyed on the birds 
in Bolsa Chica two years ago, but the damage was not so extensive, he said. The 
most recent attacks, Kelly said, left about 90 to 120 eggs in the nests, most 
of which have hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the alarm was first sounded early last month when a volunteer 
visiting a half-acre breeding island noticed the destroyed tern nests. 
</P>
<P>
 A small bird with a black cap and yellow bill, the California least tern 
numbers about 2,000 mating pairs statewide and is on state and federal 
endangered species lists. The bird generally spends the winter in South 
America. About mid-April, Kelly said, the birds migrate north to various 
California locations, including Bolsa Chica, where they build nests in the sand 
and lay eggs that hatch in late May or early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1978, Kelly said, the wetlands attracted an annual least tern population 
of only about 25 mating pairs. But a renovation project resulted in the 
construction of a breeding island, complete with open stretches of sand and 
tile shelters for older chicks. Today, he said, the area is visited annually by 
about 200 mating pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly -- who oversees six wetland areas in Southern California -- was 
attending a meeting in Sacramento when he heard of the volunteer's discovery 
that a fox had raided nests. He rushed home, he said, and for three nights 
slept in his car near the breeding grounds, armed with a spotlight and shotgun, 
hoping that the fox would return. Then, at a cost of about $5,000, the state 
hired a professional trapper who stalked the fox for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 All to no avail. "He was probably just passing through," Kelly said of the 
fox. "He could return." 
</P>
<P>
 That would spell major trouble, according to the biologist. No more money is 
available to hire another trapper. And with his staff thinned by budget cuts, 
Kelly said, all he can do is patrol the area regularly with shotgun at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a patrol this week, in fact, that the biologist encountered 
evidence of the second major threat to the area's least tern population: a 
foraging sparrow hawk, perhaps from a nearby park, preying on the tern's newly 
hatched chicks. Under normal circumstances, Kelly said, the birds could defend 
against such attacks by mobbing an intruder en masse. With their numbers 
decreased, however, they now are easily overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hawk worries me," Kelly said. "If I don't do something about it quickly, 
he could do more damage than the fox." 
</P>
<P>
 The biologist said he plans to spend the next several days armed with his 
shotgun, waiting for the animal. "It's a constant battle," he said. "We don't 
like shooting birds, but you have to weigh the various factors, and right now 
the least tern weighs more heavily than the hawk."

FULL HEALTH STUDY URGED AT ROCKWELL; CHEMICALS: PANEL SAYS THE INQUIRY SHOULD 
LOOK AT THE RISKS TO ALL WORKERS AT THE SANTA SUSANA LAB, NOT JUST DEPARTMENT 
OF ENERGY EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A health study of employees at Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory should 
look at chemical hazards faced by all the company's employees, not just risks 
to workers under contract to the Department of Energy, an advisory panel 
overseeing the study said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's two-day meeting in Simi Valley erupted in confusion and dismay 
when panel members learned that a research team from UCLA -- under direction 
from the DOE and Rockwell -- was planning to limit its study to effects of 
chemicals encountered by energy department workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell employees who worked under DOE contracts represent only a quarter of 
the estimated 40,000 people who have worked at the Santa Susana site since the 
early 1950s, Rockwell officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel ordered Rockwell to release to UCLA records pertaining to all 
employees and chemical exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which began last fall, is trying to determine if there have been an 
unusually high incidence of cancer and other illnesses among Rockwell workers 
over the years due to exposure to chemicals and low levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was commissioned in 1991, and DOE is paying its estimated $840,000 
cost. The study is being conducted by a team of scientists headed by Hal 
Morgenstern, a UCLA professor of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Although health records and death certificates for all employees, former and 
current, are being examined by the UCLA scientists, in-depth epidemiologic 
studies were to be conducted on the effects of radiation and on chemicals that 
DOE workers came into contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Stockwell, acting director of DOE's office of epidemiology, said the 
scope of the study was limited because other agencies that contracted with 
Rockwell, including NASA, refused to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to include other workers," she said. "But we don't have the 
jurisdiction to make other workers participate. DOE is funding a study that has 
to do with DOE workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgenstern said he agreed to the restrictions in negotiations with Rockwell 
and DOE last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to look at everything," Morgenstern said. "But out of necessity, 
we can't. There is no way we would have the resources to cover every chemical 
used at the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hirsch, a panel member who also belongs to the community-based group 
Rocketdyne Clean-up Coalition, said the meeting increased his skepticism of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was particularly distressed that the UCLA team on its own would negotiate 
restrictions with Rockwell and DOE," Hirsch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several panel members said they believed DOE workers were not exposed to a 
number of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals -- such as hydrazine, 
trichloroethane and beryllium -- that employees in the rocket-testing area came 
into contact with regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hydrazines were used only in the Rocketdyne rocket-testing area," community 
representative Sheldon Plotkin said. "We in the community want to know about 
the hydrazine effects on those workers. What I want to know, is UCLA going to 
include that in this study?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Rozas, director of health and safety at Rocketdyne, the division of 
Rockwell that operates the Santa Susana site, said he believed the company has 
cooperated fully with the UCLA team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every bit of data we have has been available," Rozas said. "We've not said, 
'You can't look at this.' We've only said, 'Remember the focus is on DOE-funded 
areas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas called the confusion a misunderstanding, and told panel members that 
Rockwell's only concern -- under advisement from its legal council -- was that 
the research team not be allowed to look at salary and income records of former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgenstern, however, said salary records are key to completing a thorough 
epidemiologic study. He told the panel he would return with recommendations on 
which chemicals the study should focus on once preliminary research is complete 
in September.

2 EX-FEMA INSPECTORS ACCUSED OF FRAUD; CRIME: PAIR IS CHARGED WITH FAKING QUAKE 
REPORTS ON AS MANY AS 70 PROPERTIES. MEANWHILE, 13 PEOPLE ARE HELD FOR 
ALLEGEDLY FALSE CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two former FEMA earthquake damage inspectors have been accused of fabricating 
inspection reports on as many as 70 properties they never visited after the 
Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the faked reports, federal prosecutors said Thursday, some 
homeowners and tenants were denied thousands of dollars in benefits they should 
have gotten, and others received more than they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaints -- the first to target earthquake inspectors -- were 
announced as federal authorities carried out a new round of arrests of 
individuals who allegedly filed false claims for quake relief with FEMA or with 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen people, eight of them from the San Fernando Valley area -- and 
including two mother-daughter pairs -- were accused of collecting up to $12,150 
by falsely claiming they lived in severely damaged homes or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious charges, however, were brought against inspectors Phyllis 
Hawkins, 36, of Moreno Valley and Eugene Dolezal, 69, of Denver. Both worked 
for Vulcan Services Inc., one of two private firms hired by FEMA to conduct 
thousands of inspections, for $39 each, as follow-ups to applications for 
assistance filed by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials became suspicious of Hawkins' work after a bewildered Mission 
Hills homeowner sent back a $3,545 check he had received "and explained that 
his home had not yet been inspected," according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite never visiting the home or speaking to the owner, Hawkins wrote a 
report detailing damage to a sliding glass door, microwave oven and television 
-- when, in fact, the oven and television emerged unscathed and "the home did 
not have a sliding glass door," the charges state. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, she allegedly reported that a homeowner's electric fan was 
damaged, when there was none in the house, and that walls needed "Sheetrock 
replacement" -- when the walls were made of plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hawkins was formally charged with six instances of filing false 
reports, she has since admitted "that she made up 10 to 20 FEMA inspection 
reports," federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, who was arrested Thursday, faces up to 30 years in prison if 
convicted on all counts of filing false reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolezal was accused of filing nine false reports but admitted "to not visiting 
approximately 50 damaged residences . . . he claimed to have inspected," 
prosecutors said. In all, Dolezal submitted 643 inspection reports, according 
to federal records. 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, routine follow-up inspections by FEMA officials apparently 
uncovered the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolezal, who is scheduled to surrender to federal authorities in Denver, faces 
up to 45 years in prison if convicted on all counts. When confronted by FEMA 
officials, he reportedly explained that he had inspected the outside of the 
structures in each case but failed to go inside because "these inspections 
involved a red-tagged building, which was inaccessible." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said the structures were not red-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake assistance applicants told investigators that Dolezal had spoken to them 
over the phone, then asked them to come to the Van Nuys motel where he was 
staying to sign the appropriate forms. The result was "large errors in his 
evaluation of the applicants' damages," the criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't get enough and others should not be getting as much as they 
are," explained Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman. The cases are being 
rechecked to correct the errors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors also are continuing their investigation to determine if 
other FEMA inspectors "may have committed similar fraudulent acts," Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins told investigators that she could not afford to conduct inspections in 
all cases because she was working out of her Moreno Valley home and "wasn't 
being paid enough to keep coming into Los Angeles," Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $39 that FEMA paid Vulcan Services for each case, employees such as 
Hawkins and Dolezal received from $22 to $25 for each inspection, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake required a small army of inspectors to help in the 
various government assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year veteran of insurance adjusting, Dolezal said he was hired by Vulcan 
and received two days of training in Redwood City before moving to the motel in 
the hard-hit San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal complaint alleges that, unlike Hawkins, he at least spoke by 
phone with the quake victims assigned to him after they filed applications for 
FEMA grants. 
</P>
<P>
 One Northridge apartment dweller told investigators that, during their 
conversation, Dolezal explained that "since she lived within a specific ZIP 
Code area, it was unnecessary for FEMA to visually inspect her dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the woman was notified by FEMA that -- based on Dolezal's report -- she 
was not eligible for disaster funds. After she filed an appeal, however, her 
case was reviewed -- and she was found eligible for $2,300 in emergency housing 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Dolezal may have missed evidence of fraud, the complaint 
alleges. If he had inspected another Northridge apartment, "he would probably 
have learned that FEMA received five separate applications from this 
three-bedroom apartment . . . (and) paid $625 twice for the damaged kitchen, 
$2,700 for three bedroom claims . . . and $600 for a dining room that . . . did 
not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hawkins, in contrast, it was not the aid applicants but the inspector 
herself who allegedly invented damage, as in the case of a Mission Hills couple 
who she said deserved $6,655 in grants. The couple later told investigators 
that, in fact, "their vacuum cleaner, washer, refrigerator and kitchen range 
had not been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Emmitt L. Adams, a 74-year-old retiree, also of Mission Hills. 
He sent back the $3,545 check he received, alerting FEMA that his home had 
never been inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want money for something that doesn't belong to me," Adams said 
Thursday. "I knew it couldn't be mine. . . . I didn't know what I was entitled 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hawkins and Dolezal are the first two inspectors charged, 39 other 
cases have been brought by the federal task force set up to check for fraud in 
the earthquake relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The group charged Thursday included Raquiesha Williams, 23, and her mother 
Laveringe Williams, 46, of North Hollywood; Dorothy Dorsey, 48, and her 
daughter Dianna Dorsey, 27, of Hollywood; Jamaul Lindsey, 21, of North 
Hollywood; Lakesha Carroll, 20, of Canoga Park; Darius Brown, 24, of Van Nuys; 
Sonia Valladares, 20, of Canoga Park; Arturo Cano, 27, of Fillmore, and 
Shedonna Morrison, 19, of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's arrests, 29 FEMA applicants have now been charged with filing 
false claims, totaling more than $100,000. Two SBA loan applicants have been 
accused of fraudulently seeking more than $1.5 million, and eight retailers 
have been charged with illegally exchanging food stamps.

 Many San Fernando Valley residents have remarked that the aftershocks of the 
Northridge earthquake seem to be stronger and more numerous than the 
aftershocks of the 1971 Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake. But scientists say this 
is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The epicenter of the 1971 earthquake was under the San Gabriel Mountains, 
several miles north of the populated areas of the Valley, and about two-thirds 
of all its aftershocks were centered outside these populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Northridge quake was directly underneath a thickly populated 
area, and almost all aftershocks except a few at the far western end of the 
aftershock zone north of Chatsworth have been centered under populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 8,000 aftershocks from the Northridge quake, about 400 of them 
strong enough to be felt. The latest struck Wednesday at 8:27 p.m., when an 
3.7-magnitude aftershock hit a mile southwest of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Northridge earthquake was somewhat stronger than Sylmar-San 
Fernando, 6.8 as against 6.5 magnitude, the director of the U.S. Geological 
Survey's Pasadena field office, Jim Mori, said that the total number of 
aftershocks was about the same. He acknowledged that instrumentation was not as 
extensive in 1971, so many of the tiny 1- and 2-magnitude quakes were not 
recorded. But the number of 3s and larger was about the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech Seismologist Egill Hauksson, who was among those who plotted 
aftershocks for this map, noted that the Northridge aftershock zone is on a 
subterranean plane that slopesupward to the north and never intersects the 
surface. The Sylmar-San Fernando aftershock zone was on a plane sloping upward 
toward the south that did come to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The two zones differ in depth by about five miles. So even where the two 
aftershock zones seem to intersect on the map, they actually do not. In this 
area, the Northridge aftershocks actually underlie the Sylmar-San Fernando 
aftershocks. Still, the northeast Valley is the one area where aftershocks from 
both earthquakes were occasionally strongly felt. Magnitude For both quakes and 
their top five aftershocks Jan 17: Northridge-6.8 Feb. 9: Sylmar-6.6KENNETH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY RECOGNIZED FOR DISASTER READINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEBRA CANO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has received an award for "excellence in disaster preparedness" for 
its community team program. 
</P>
<P>
 The award from the American Red Cross and the Orange County Cities Emergency 
Management Organization recognizes a program started in 1991 after a tornado 
hit Driftwood Beach Club Mobile Home Park and destroyed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Community Emergency Response Team program involves 1,250 volunteer 
residents prepared to form in case of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that in a major disaster like an earthquake, the Fire Department 
can't take care of everybody," said Glorria Morrison, the city's emergency 
services coordinator. "It could be up to three days before public safety gets 
to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The program allows "neighbors to take care of themselves and each other," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also offers free monthly disaster response classes to residents. The 
next available class will be held from 8 a.m. to noon on July 9. Early sign-ups 
are recommended since classes fill up quickly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes offer instruction on first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, search 
and rescue techniques and other skills.  
</P>
<P>
 An eight-month class series also is available for people wanting to become 
certified disaster workers, Morrison said.  
</P>
<P>
 More information about the program or becoming a certified disaster worker is 
available by calling Morrison at (714) 536-5980. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LOANS OFFERED FOR PREFABRICATED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new program to make housing affordable could result in hundreds of 
manufactured homes being erected across the county over the next decade, an 
official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is scheduled to begin in Laguna Beach, will allow low- or 
moderate-income families with a deteriorating home or vacant lot to apply for 
low-interest loans to buy a prefabricated home. 
</P>
<P>
 State or federal funds will be used to temporarily relocate the family, 
demolish the old house if need be and prepare the lot for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the county could use Community Development Block Grant funds to 
restore an old home but not to build a new one, said Ken Baer, community 
development representative for the county's housing and redevelopment office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just provides for safer, more sanitary living conditions for families that 
otherwise may not be able to fix up these houses," he said. Officials say a 
three-bedroom manufactured home will cost an average of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The program could be particularly helpful to some of the Laguna Beach 
residents who lost their homes in the October firestorm, officials say. Laguna 
Beach was the first city to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, there are some fire people who could apply and be eligible," city 
planner David Ebeling said. City leaders are not worried about Laguna Beach 
being robbed of its eclectic charm by a rash of prefabricated homes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things can be made to look however you want them to look," he said. In 
addition, the homes would still have to be approved by the city's Design Review 
Board to ensure compatibility with their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer said the first prefabricated home is expected to be erected this summer 
at Sarah Thurston Park, a rural neighborhood alongside Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded with state and federal money, the Manufactured Housing Project is a 
joint venture with the Orange County Affordable Housing Clearing House, a 
consortium of 32 banks that provide low-cost loans for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities with populations of more than 50,000 can apply to the federal and state 
governments to operate their own programs, officials said. Santa Ana, Lake 
Forest, Anaheim and Orange have already applied, Baer said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county is expecting to process 12 to 18 manufactured homes per year, 
Baer said the number of prefabricated homes installed will depend on whether 
residents will like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are reluctant when they hear 'manufactured housing,' " he 
said. "They think of the old mobile homes, and they are not mobile homes."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; POLICE SEEKING MAN WHOM CHILDREN FLED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are looking for a man who has allegedly harassed children 
in Del Obispo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened youngsters reported that a man in his early 20s tried to converse 
with them May 25 at the park, causing them to flee, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was apparently trying to gain their confidence by engaging (them) in 
conversation," said sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was also seen at the park, on Del Obispo Street near Pacific Coast 
Highway, on at least one occasion in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said witnesses indicated the man spent time watching the children 
before approaching them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to talk with him to find out what his interest is in these 
children," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man is described as 5-foot-8 and about 160 pounds, with dark brown or 
black shoulder-length hair. Investigators say his face has acne scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to call Deputy Mark Simon at (714) 647-7449 
or Sheriff's Department Investigators Steve Sharpe or Joe Homs at (714)

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; EATERY PROJECT MAKES CENTS FOR FOURTH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helene Hirsch runs a tight ship, according to her employees, all of whom are 
10 years old tops. But Hirsch is in no danger of violating child labor laws at 
her bustling but short-lived restaurant "Seventeen's Place." 
</P>
<P>
 The pint-size eatery, set up in Room 17 of Erwin Street Elementary School in 
Van Nuys, was a class project, the culmination of efforts of Hirsch's 
fourth-grade class that integrated business and economics into their lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurateurs, dressed in green and white to match the decor of their 
eatery, served more than 80 people in a three-hour period Thursday, keeping the 
kids on their toes. Head chef Deosha Ball found her crew especially swamped at 
the 11:30 a.m. shift, when she had to keep telling her sandwich-makers to "pick 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than just a lesson in money management, the restaurant and the rest 
of the class is Life 101. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 kids earn their living in Room 17 by "doing what they're supposed to be 
doing," explained Hirsch. An "A" on a homework assignment equals $1, while an 
"F" means you have to dish out a buck to the teacher. Chores around the 
classroom also are worth a few cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-graders then deposit their hard-earned cash into a checking account 
at the class bank, and participate in the great American tradition of paying 
bills for rental of their desks and chairs, electricity and health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, student Andrew Lopez found out the hard way what happens 
when you don't pay your bills: his desk and chair were repossessed by the 
teacher until he earned enough money to pay off his debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to sit on the floor," he recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 For the restaurant project, Hirsch hired each of her students by having them 
apply for the jobs at the restaurant: chefs, waiters and waitresses, hosts and 
hostesses, bus people and cashiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Zamora, a cashier at Seventeen's Place, said the interview process was 
grueling: "We had to show her that we were really going to impress her." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids learned the economics of running a business, as well as the 
importance of nutrition so that they could create a well-balanced menu for 
their patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's entrees included an assortment of sandwiches served with carrot 
sticks, fruit cups and juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting that the service was "good and fast," Shlomit Shamam, who took 
Hirsch's class last year, ordered the No. 3 special: the vegetarian plate of 
tomatoes, lettuce, beans and cheese topped with croutons and dressing. MAKI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CONSORTIUM WINS BUS-PROJECT GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State lawmakers have awarded $300,000 to a Burbank-based consortium of 
government agencies and private businesses to develop a prototype of a 
40-foot-long bus powered by electricity and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale), and Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), 
announced the grant on Wednesday, to be given to CALSTART, a statewide agency 
representing 80 utilities, vehicle manufacturers and defense companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the CALSTART project comes from the California Energy Commission's 
Transportation Energy Technologies Advancement Program -- designed to promote 
development of vehicles using pollution-saving technologies, said Rogan 
spokeswoman Natalie Blanning. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement negotiated with Russell's office, CALSTART will provide 
$830,830 in matching funds to initiate the bus project. One of four bus 
manufacturers in California will be asked to build the prototype, said Dave 
Sotero, CALSTART communications associate.  
</P>
<P>
 CALSTART engineer Paul Helliker said the announcement frees up CALSTART'S 
matching funds for the project and allows him to convene a team of agency 
members formed to design a 40-foot-long bus.  
</P>
<P>
 The longer buses, similar to those used by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, are more difficult to design because they have a larger motor, 
Helliker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus will join a 22-foot CALSTART model -- used as a shuttle bus -- and a 
30-foot prototype scheduled to debut on California roadways this September. 
Three electric school buses designed by CALSTART are also being tested in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22- and 30-foot buses, built by APS Systems of Oxnard, can travel up to 
100 miles before their batteries need to be charged, Helliker said. Electric 
school buses typically travel 40 miles between recharging sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the bus prototypes has an auxiliary natural gas tank that can be used 
to recharge batteries while the vehicle is on the road -- increasing travel 
time, Helliker said. 
</P>
<P>
 CALSTART, created in 1992 to meet clean-air mandates from the California Air 
Resources Board, operates 13 programs designed to provide Californians by 1998 
with vehicles that use different technologies to decrease pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of funding for the consortium comes from its participants, with 
about 10% of the agency's budget provided by the state, Sotero said. JENNIFER

<P>
 A Van Nuys grocery clerk kidnaped in May during a robbery of the store where 
he worked was held captive for three days without food or water and driven to 
Mexico before being released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now home, according to another store employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigoberto Murillo, about 30, was left hungry but unharmed on a country road in 
the Mexican state of Sinaloa by his captors, according to Los Angeles Police 
Detective Ray Hernandez, who is continuing to investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspects are still at large," Hernandez said, and probably in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo was never considered to be a suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman who took Murillo also made off with approximately $60,000 in cash 
and $10,000 in checks during the May 7 morning holdup of the Carneceria 
Vallarta, in the 13300 block of Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are now seeking two to four Latino men in connection with the robbery, 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping confounded store employees and police alike, who said they 
didn't see any reason to kidnap Murillo, a six-year employee, when the suspect 
already had the money in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo could not be reached for comment. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; RESIDENTS CAMPAIGN FOR OWN ZIP CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of pieces of junk mail stamped "Return to Sender" will be dropped 
into mailboxes in Arleta on Saturday to kick off a new campaign by residents to 
get a ZIP code independent of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this post office took away our ZIP code and made us share the ZIP code 
with Pacoima, they have made it as if we don't exist," said Hawley Smith, a 
member of the Arleta Chamber of Commerce who has led a campaign to bring back 
the 91332 ZIP code for Arleta. The Arleta post office closed in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a petition of 5,200 signatures was presented to the Postal Service 
to have the Arleta ZIP code restored. Local postal officials in February 
recommended reinstatement of the Arleta ZIP code, but the request was 
eventually denied by postal authorities in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys post office has appealed the decision by the Washington 
headquarters, and the issue is being reviewed. Local officials do not know when 
a decision may be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a demonstration of about 50 to 100 Arleta residents is planned for 
the Van Nuys Post Office on Sherman Way. It is a protest that Smith said he 
would rather direct at Washington than the local postal officials who have 
backed the community in the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they ought to have it," said David Mazer, a Southern California 
representative for Postal Service. Mazer said Van Nuys District officials have 
backed the request although the post office usually does not change ZIP codes 
because of community identity or to lower insurance rates, the reasons 
residents want their ZIP code back. 
</P>
<P>
 "ZIP codes are really designed to move mail," Mazer said. The request had been 
denied because it did not save money for the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that about 2,000 to 3,000 pieces of junk mail delivered to Arleta 
residents with the Pacoima address have been collected in the past six months 
and will be dropped into postal drop boxes on Saturday. Residents will return 
the mail from now on, he said.

 "We're hoping to cause them to spend money so they would have to reconsider," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta residents say they have a difficult time attracting businesses and 
selling their homes because they are linked to Pacoima, which has a reputation 
for high crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the worst car insurance in the whole state of California, and it's 
because we're associated with Pacoima," Smith said. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; HOSPITAL TO CONTINUE ISSUING BIRTH LISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian is not yet ready to abandon its 
42-year-old tradition of sending a list of birth announcements to local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the local media reported last month that the hospital had stopped 
issuing birth announcements because of security concerns, Hoag officials 
recently revived the tradition until they come up with a viable alternative, 
said Maureen Mazzatenta, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in 1952, Hoag Hospital has been providing monthly lists to 
newspapers that include each baby's date of birth, the names of the parents and 
their hometown. Many parentsclip the newspaper items for souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this spring, when staff became concerned that the information could be 
used by an abductor to locate homes with newborns, hospital officials stopped 
issuing the list as they explored alternatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the list is back, but names are provided only with parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, we are releasing information with parents' permission," 
Mazzatenta said. "In the long term, we are developing an informational card . . 
. that (the parents) candisseminate to the papers as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
 At some hospitals in the county, staff members no longer issue birth 
announcements. Others leave it up to parents to provide the information for 
publication. BOB ELSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has voted to ban smoking in all publicly owned and 
operated facilities as early as July. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, approved in a 4-0 vote this week, prohibits people from lighting up 
in such facilities as City Hall and much of the Starlight Amphitheatre, in 
city-owned vehicles and within five feet of any entrance or exit to a municipal 
building. Ashtrays will soon be removed from municipal buildings and signs 
prohibiting smoking will be posted. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; REPAIRS TO PIER WILL BEGIN TODAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers will begin making repairs today to the Seal Beach Pier, which was 
damaged in a fire on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic wood boardwalk will remain closed for at least 15 more days 
during the first part of the repairs.By then, city officials hope to have 
enough lumber to complete a second and final set of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 If officials can't get enough wood by the end of June, they plan to place a 
temporary ramp over the burned portion and reopen it through the busy summer 
tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which temporarily trapped more than 100 people at the end of the 
boardwalk, caused at least $350,000 in damages. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire burned several wood supports and crossbeams, some of which must be 
replaced. Fire investigators suspect that the blaze started when charcoals from 
a grill fell below the boardwalk and ignited a gas line. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was covered by insurance, but the city must pay a $100,000 
deductible. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; D.A. BACKS 4 WHO FACE RECALL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi has thrown his support behind Mayor Charles V. 
Smith and three council members facing a recall election Tuesday, arguing that 
they have been strong supporters of public safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Capizzi has castigated city firefighters, who are behind the 
recall effort, for engaging in payroll practices that he described as neither 
in the best interest of the city nor morally defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged payroll abuses were investigated by Capizzi's office, but 
prosecutors announced last month that they have found insufficient evidence to 
prove criminal wrongdoing by the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not mean the practices which the mayor and the council put an end 
to were in the best interests of the city or morally defensible. They were 
neither," Capizzi wrote in a letter to Westminster residents mailed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lincoln Club of Orange County, a conservative Republican group, paid the 
cost of mailing about 20,000 copies of Capizzi's letter to city voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall backers said the letter was "clearly political, bought and paid for by 
political allies of the council." 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. has a long relationship with the council members," said Phil 
Giarrizzo, a consultant for the recall proponents. "He has a vested interest in 
their continued employment as council members." 
</P>
<P>
 Giarrizzo said the council members have used Capizzi as a "shield" in their 
continued attacks against the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi said Thursday that the Westminster Firefighters Assn. "applauded 
us when we concluded the investigation." Now, it's trying to discredit him, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old trick," Capizzi said. "When anyone doesn't like the message, they 
try to kill the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 An independent study by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick showed that 
firefighters failed to provide required paperwork for more than 9,500 hours of 
paid sick time, vacation and other time off work during last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors estimated possible costs to the city of the undocumented time off 
at $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Fire Department employees have been terminated and one suspended for 
alleged payroll abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the terminated firefighters have argued that they did nothing wrong, and 
that the problems were caused in part by faulty record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District court recently ruled that the city must submit to arbitration 
to resolve the dismissed firefighters' bids to win their jobs back. A date has 
not yet been set for the arbitration hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Craig Schweisinger, a recall target, said that Capizzi's letter 
strengthens the city's continuing disciplinary actions against the 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Capizzi letter confirms and concurs that what they have done was not 
right," Schweisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also targeted in the city's first recall vote ever are council members 
Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. BERT ELJERA

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HOMEOWNERS GROUPS FIGHT AIRPORT NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three homeowners associations are distributing thousands of flyers containing 
the telephone numbers that people can call to lodge complaints about aircraft 
noise from Van Nuys and Burbank airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners associations from Encino, Studio City and Valley Village are 
mailing and handing out 8,000 flyers that urge people to "lay the foundation 
for changes in flight patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 The mailing is the latest campaign in the homeowners' ongoing feud with the 
airports over aircraft noise. Gerald Silver, an outspoken activist on the 
issue, has called for drastic cuts in helicopter operations out of Van Nuys 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing it to provide a public service, to make it easy for people to 
determine the correct phone numbers," said Silver, president of the Homeowners 
of Encino. "I'm hoping it will alert the airport to the gravity of the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said that circulars are being mailed out now because people are more 
likely to hear the noise as the weather gets warmer and they spend more time 
out on the patio or leave their windows open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are heavily impacted," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City 
Residents Assn., which is distributing 6,000 of the flyers. "People are really 
uptight about this issue." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCIL TO KEEP BARRIER ON STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the upper half of the housing tract wanted the street open. Those 
who live on the lower half wanted it closed.So, in the spirit of compromise, 
the Calabasas City Council blocked off half the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, the solution to the Parkmor Road dilemma seems to have 
worked, defusing a situation that pitted angry neighbors against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Wednesday night, the council extended indefinitely the 
closure of the southbound lane of Parkmor, where speeding cars had alarmed 
residents of the hillside street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The compromise seems to have worked, because the exchange of ideas has become 
very temperate," City Manager Charles Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, more than 100 residents of the upper and lower halves of the 
tract hurled insults at each other during a special council hearing on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the lower half of Parkmor argued that increasing traffic made the 
street more dangerous, but the idea of a barrier angered residents of the upper 
half, who complained that other routes took longer to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The council ordered a temporary barrier separating the north and south halves 
of Parkmor and, in December, approved its replacement with a landscaped 
blockade of the southbound entrance to the lower tract for a six-month trial 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of Parkmor residents showed up at the Wednesday night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked city traffic planners to consider ways to keep motorists 
from driving around the barrier and other methods for slowing traffic on lower 
Parkmor, such as the possible installation of speed bumps. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; SAUNA FIRE FORCES GYM EVACUATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget aerobics and the Stairmaster. Members of a women's gym in Woodland 
Hills got a new workout Thursday night: running for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 A smoky fire that sent flames pouring from a first-floor sauna at the Total 
Woman spa sent 50 women racing to safety, some in leotards and tights, others 
in towels. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported as 40 Los Angeles firefighters extinguished the 6:30 
p.m. blaze in a shopping center at 19730 Ventura Blvd. in about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Women waiting for an aerobics class reported hearing a popping sound from the 
sauna moments before smoke began pouring from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made an announcement to evacuate and told us not to try to go get our 
stuff," said Romy Schnyder, 21, of Canoga Park, who was exercising on a machine 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Barbara Eils said two women inside the sauna alerted workers to the 
fire. "Some people were a little reluctant to leave," Eils said. "Then they saw 
the smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Littleton said the cause of the fire and 
the extent of damage was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Gym owner Art Stone said he suspected the fire was set off by paper placed on 
the sauna's electrically heated rocks in an attempt to generate more heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the earthquake, a flood a couple of years ago when somebody upstairs 
left water faucets on, and now this. What's next? Locusts and frogs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Marie Brand, 26, of Thousand Oaks said she quickly determined one thing 
as she watched the firefighters and wondered if her car keys could be retrieved 
from her locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a steam room type of gal," she said. "Forget the sauna. I'll stick with 
steam." BOB POOL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WINNETKA; MEETING TO FOCUS ON RETAIL REVITALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of architects, urban planners and west San Fernando Valley community 
leaders will gather in Winnetka beginning today to devise ways to revive the 
flagging commercial strips of Canoga Park and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Once two of the most bustling retail districts in the Valley, the downtown 
areas of both communities have fallen on hard times in the past decade and were 
heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But optimistic merchants and residents are hoping the damage wrought by the 
earthquake will give way to communities that are friendlier and livelier than 
they have been in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential is here, definitely," said Bill Brady, past president of the 
Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce, as he described the diversity of shops in both 
his neighborhood and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that potential, however, has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 So Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents both communities, 
organized a two-day workshop to connect community leaders with planners and 
architects adept at turning around failing retail areas such as the Third 
Street Promenade in Santa Monica and Old Town Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will begin at 2 p.m. today at the Marie Manogian Elementary and 
Sarkis and Seta Demirdjian High School at 6844 Oakdale Ave. with tours of the 
communities and discussions on the opportunities for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 More intense discussions start Saturday at 8:30 a.m. and continue through the 
day, with a special session for public comments between 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 
p.m. A final report detailing ways to implement and to pay for changes will be 
prepared. "Our philosophy is that the final report will serve as a starting 
point," Chick Planning Deputy Ken Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, community members are talking about ways to spruce up their 
neighborhoods. Some in Canoga Park, for instance, want to promote the antique 
stores along Sherman Way or try to reopen a closed adult movie theater as a 
concert hall or community playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same lines, some merchants in Reseda along Sherman Way and Reseda 
Boulevard want to make facade improvements so the mishmash of buildings appears 
more uniform. AARON CURTISS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CENTER REOPENS AFTER GETTING FREE REPAIRS

 An organization that provides a range of services to low-income families in 
the San Fernando Valley reopened its Pacoima headquarters Thursday after a 
development company repaired the quake-damaged facility free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Kaufman and Broad Home Corp. made about $220,000 worth of 
quake repairs to damaged walls and windows at the M.E.N.D. Center (Meet Each 
Need With Dignity). 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at the center, Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon, a 
former M.E.N.D. member and president, praised the development firm for its 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Kaufman and Broad approached me and offered to assist in the aftermath 
of the earthquake, I could think of no better organization to receive 
assistance," Alarcon said. "I know that the services M.E.N.D. provides are 
critical to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 M.E.N.D. is a nonprofit organization with over 500 volunteers, including 
doctors, dentists, teachers and others. The group provides food, clothes, 
furniture, health care and literacy training to thousands of low-income Valley 
families.  
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the quake, M.E.N.D. volunteers, working out of a tent, 
distributed food, water and diapers to quake victims living in parks. HUGO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS AMONG AWARD RECIPIENTS

<P>
 Five promising high school sophomores, three of them from the San Fernando 
Valley, have been awarded the first Christopher Scholarships, named for 
Secretary of State and former Los Angeles attorney Warren Christoper, and worth 
at least $12,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients will officially receive the awards June 17 in a ceremony at Los 
Angeles Unified School District headquarters, 450 N. Grand Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoper may attend if his schedule permits, according to Christopher's 
former law firm, O'Melveny & Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship fund, established last year by the firm, is to support bright, 
involved 10th-graders who suffer problems with family or finances that could 
make them dropout risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher himself was able to go to college because he received a 
scholarship after graduating from high school, said law firm partner Stuart 
Tobisman. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Christopher Scholarship recipients go on to graduate high school, they 
will receive a $12,000 scholarship to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they graduate high school with a cumulative grade-point average of 3.25 
or better, the award increases to $16,000. 
</P>

 A social science teacher at Garden Grove High School has been chosen as a 
winner of the 1995 Orange County Teacher of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
 Renae Boyum will receive $15,000 from the James Hines Foundation, one of the 
award sponsors. She will advance to the California Teacher of the Year 
competition, which will be held in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The state winner moves on to the national competition, with the eventual 
winners honored by the President at a White House ceremony as the nation's best 
teachers. The annual awards are intended to promote excellence among public 
school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The other county winners were Ron Archer, an English teacher at Trabuco Hills 
High School in Mission Viejo; Marilyne Coats, a language arts teacher at Willis 
Warner Middle School in Westminster, and Lois Knudson, a special-education 
teacher at Lakeside Middle School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Dean, the county's superintendent of schools, announced Boyum's 
selection during a visit last week to Garden Grove High School. A panel of 
education, business and community leaders selected the winners from a group of 
40 teachers nominated by Orange County school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum, a resident of Irvine, has been with the Garden Grove Unified School 
District for the past 21 years. Since 1992, she has served as school district 
representative to the University of California Partnership Network, which is 
studying admission changes to the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has participated in a pilot project at Stanford University to assess 
teacher performance as part of a national standards board certificate program. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum teaches civics, government and U.S. history at Garden Grove High School. 
She has worked with seven other teachers in developing Argos United, a club 
consisting of students and teachers from various ethnic groups who plan and 
organize school activities to promote tolerance and cultural diversity at the 
Garden Grove campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum, who was raised in Minnesota, earned a bachelor's degree in political 
science and social science education from the University of Minnesota. She has 
taught at Rancho Alamitos High School, Bolsa Grande High School and La Quinta 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1988 to 1992, she was president of the Garden Grove Education Assn., 
which represents teachers, nurses and librarians.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; THREAT FACED BY SCHOOL BINGO GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An effort to annex Anaheim's Esperanza High School to Yorba Linda could 
jeopardize the school's bingo operation, which brings in about $3,300 a month 
for athletic teams and other school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the annexation effort fails, the school's bingo games, where 
smoking is allowed, could be threatened by a state mandate that schools 
receiving money from the Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco Education program eliminate 
smoking on school campuses by July, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 If the annexation effort is successful, the school would have to comply with 
Yorba Linda zoning and land-use regulations. One of those regulations, the 
city's smoking ordinance, prohibits smoking in "every publicly or privately 
owned theater, auditorium, or other enclosed facility which is open to the 
public for . . . any other performance or event." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Leonard Hampel said the school's gymnasium, where the bingo games 
are held, would be considered a publicly owned auditorium, and the bingo games 
would be considered an event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board of Education could 
vote to exempt the school from the ordinance. However, to do so, it would need 
the support of four of the five board members. Two trustees, Craig Olson and 
Karin Freeman, have said they would probably not vote for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who was not on the school board when bingo was approved in August, 
1991, said he wants all schools to be smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are teaching students to be health-conscious," Olson said. "It seems 
somewhat hypocritical to say smoking is bad for you except on" bingo nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, who voted to approve bingo, said that if the high school were annexed 
into Yorba Linda, the school district should abide by that city's regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the school district would look at itself differently," 
Freeman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza Principal George Allen said bingo, which is held every Monday night, 
is the only event where smoking is allowed on campus. The games are restricted 
to those 18 years and older. Students help in setting up before bingo and 
cleaning up after, but they are not permitted to be in the gymnasium while 
bingo games are played, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bingo has never made it without smoking," Allen said. "It seems to be 
accepted elsewhere." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

3RD PARTY SURFACES TO CLAIM ARTWORKS RECOVERED FROM THIEVES; LAWSUIT: 
FOUNDATION JOINS TWO SIBLINGS IN PURSUING THE COLLECTION OF THE LATE ROSITA 
WINSTON. MEANWHILE, APPRAISERS CAST DOUBT ON THE PAINTINGS' VALUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a difficult enough legal puzzle when a second claimant surfaced to 
assert ownership of a collection of modern artworks worth, by some accounts, $9 
million, that had been stolen from a Northridge storage unit and recovered. 
Thursday, a third contender appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents and Los Angeles police officers last August returned the artworks 
to Eva Smith Weisager, 86, of Van Nuys, who said she had inherited the 
paintings from her socialite sister. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to be a happy ending until Weisager's brother, Daniel Greenway of 
Baja California, sued Weisager for $1 million in Los Angeles Superior Court in 
March, accusing her of stealing the paintings from their deceased sister, 
Rosita Winston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was revealed at a Superior Court hearing on Thursday however that the 
director of a New York nonprofit charity founded by Rosita Winston's late 
husband has weighed in with a cross complaint, contending that neither Weisager 
nor Greenway are entitled to the paintings because they rightfully belong to 
the charity, formally known as the Norman and Rosita Winston Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion were statements made by an attorney at the hearing 
that appraisers for the Sotheby's auction house in New York now believe that 
six of the works were not painted by the famous modern artists to whom they 
were originally attributed. Thomas Cano, an attorney representing Weisager, 
said the paintings may be worth only $100 apiece, not the millions originally 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano said in an interview after the hearing that Weisager had turned over 
eight of the paintings to Sotheby's, but appraisers have refused to 
authenticate six of them. She turned over a ninth painting to a Los Angeles 
auction house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges in New York and Los Angeles have issued temporary restraining orders 
barring all three parties from selling the artworks, originally attributed to 
modern masters Pablo Picasso, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall and Eugene Delacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth G. Petrulis, an attorney for the Winston foundation, said that despite 
her claims, Weisager did not inherit the paintings nor receive them as a gift 
from her sister, who was debilitated by a stroke in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrulis contends that the paintings are part of Norman Winston's estate and 
should have been passed along to his foundation upon his wife's death. Norman 
Winston amassed a fortune as a real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the owners of the paintings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrulis said he has asked the Los Angeles court to transfer the case to New 
York, where the Winstons' documents are and where the paintings were allegedly 
stolen and where most of them are now located. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisager contends she received the paintings as a gift from her sister and 
brother-in-law before they died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the allegations that the lady stole the paintings are a horrible 
thing to say," said Cano, Weisager's attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Cano said the foundation has no legal claim to the paintings since the 
Winstons did not own them when they died. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is Weisager's own brother, Greenway, who accuses his sister in court 
papers of buying a Ford LTD station wagon with the specific intent of looting 
their sister Rosita's plush New York condominium of the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Halif, an attorney for Greenway, maintained his client is entitled to a 
share of the paintings' value because he did not know the art existed when 
their sister Rosita died and he settled her estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been set for July 6 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related criminal case, three San Fernando Valley men are scheduled to 
stand trial later this month on criminal charges stemming from the theft of the 
paintings from Weisager's storage unit. Police said that the suspects' attempts 
to sell the paintings came to the attention of a person in the art world, who 
tipped off the FBI, leading to their arrests.

RAT'S BITES IN ARTERY KILLED INFANT, PATHOLOGIST TESTIFIES; COURTS: JURY IS 
TOLD THAT AUTOPSY SHOWED BOY WAS ALIVE WHEN STARVING PET TURNED ON HIM IN CAR 
WHERE FAMILY WAS LIVING. HIS PARENTS' ATTORNEYS SAY BABY WAS ALREADY DEAD.

<P>
 A 4-month-old boy died after being bitten more than 100 times by a starving 
pet rat whose sharp teeth struck a major artery in the infant's arm, a forensic 
pathologist testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for the baby's parents contend that Steven Giguere Jr., was 
already dead when the rodent turned on the boy in the front seat of the station 
wagon where the family was living. 
</P>
<P>
 But pathologist Joseph Halka told an Orange County jury that the bruising, 
discoloration and inflammation around the bite marks prove the child was alive 
when the attack occurred. Halka, who performed the autopsy, said the infant 
died after suffering "blood loss due to the rodent bites." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents, Kathyleen and Steven Giguere Sr., face up to six years in 
prison each if convicted of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment 
charges. The attack occurred in an Anaheim parking lot last August, when the 
couple was homeless and living in their car with Steven Jr., their 3-year-old 
daughter, Karissa, and the pet rat named Homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The pathologist testified that Steven Jr. appeared to have been a well-fed and 
healthy infant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury must decide whether the Gigueres were criminally 
negligent in allowing the rat -- which had a history of biting people -- to 
roam free around the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was declared dead about 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 26. Halka told jurors the 
attack began two to four hours earlier.

2 GUNMEN ROB SUSHI BAR OWNER, PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two armed bandits robbed a Ventura Boulevard sushi bar Wednesday, taking cash 
from the cash register, six patrons and three employees, Los Angeles police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred about 8:45 p.m. in the 15400 block of Ventura Boulevard, 
at the Restaurant Shihoya, said Detective Greg Demirjian. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before the robbery, patrons told police, two women walked into the 
restaurant and looked around as if they were scouting it. The gunmen entered 
shortly afterward, were seated and pretended that they were about to order, 
then drew pistols and ordered patrons and workers to lie on the floor, 
Demirjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demirjian said one gunman went behind the counter and robbed the owner of 
about $200 and took another $495 from the register. The second gunman robbed 
the patrons of about $700, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery lasted less than five minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both gunman were described as black men, between 23 and 27 years old. One of 
them was described as standing 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing about 150 pounds. 
He was wearing baggy brown pants and a hooded navy blue sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The second gunman was about 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighed about 170 pounds, 
and had braided hair and a goatee, Demirjian said. He was wearing beige khaki 
pants and a yellow and brown sweat shirt. Both men carried stainless steel 
short-barreled revolvers, Demirjian said.

MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS FILE FIRE CLAIM AGAINST LAGUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of mobile home park residents who lost homes in the October firestorm 
have filed the first fire-related claim against the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 El Morro Mobile Home Park residents are seeking more than $880,000 from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire victims' grievances against Laguna Beach include claims that the city 
failed to provide a sufficient water supply or an adequate fire suppression 
plan. The claim also maintains that city property in the area was not properly 
inspected or maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn expressed frustration Thursday upon learning 
of the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess people are looking for anything to get compensation," she said. "It 
just infuriates me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Hornberger -- an attorney with the Los Angeles law firm Hornberger & 
Criswell, which is representing the mobile home park residents -- said claims 
have also been filed against the county and the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home park is on state-owned land north of Laguna Beach alongside 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornberger said there are no fire hydrants at the mobile home park, which lost 
40 of its 297 coaches in the Oct. 27 blaze. A total of 400 homes were destroyed 
or damaged in and around Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, these people were left on their own to try and put out a 
fire with a garden hose and they couldn't do it," Hornberger said. "Here's a 
trailer park that's been there many, many years -- it's just right outside 
Laguna Beach, and their fire suppression facilities are just embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit will follow if the claim is denied by the City Council on Tuesday as 
recommended by City Atty. Philip Kohn, one claimant said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn, however, said state law "generally protects" local agencies and their 
employees from liability when property is lost in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, these types of claims don't get too far in the courts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The claimants are asking for $50,000 for the loss of each coach and $30,000 
each for lost personal property, Kohn said. He said that 11 coaches were 
involved in the claim.

NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP SEEKS 'SPACE SAVER' PLAN INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana neighborhood association has asked the Orange County Grand Jury to 
investigate the way the school district and city have handled plans for a 
controversial "space-saver" school to be built with state funds at a shopping 
center here. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, drafted by retired corporate attorney Merle Asper and approved by 
the board of the Northwest Neighborhood Assn., alleges that the school district 
has violated the public's right to freedom of information; placed a "gag rule" 
on school board members critical of the project and deprived those board 
members of information; used public money to lobby for the project; and 
participated in a "conspiracy" to pay an inflated sum for the school site at 
Bristol Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District Trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji, who has 
supported the proposed school site at Bristol and 17th streets, denied the 
allegations and welcomed an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned, because I think we have nothing to hide," Yamagata-Noji 
said when she learned of the letter, dated May 3. "If the grand jury chooses to 
act on this and make any inquiries, the district is willing to cooperate. We 
stand behind everything that we've said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which would be the first under a novel state program, has been 
mired in controversy, in part because an initial letter of appraisal was steep, 
and includes the cost of tearing down and rebuilding two businesses at the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Three complete appraisals are being reviewed by the state, but officials will 
not disclose their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't let the appraisals out so they can be held under the light," Asper 
said of the district.  
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata-Noji said that releasing the contents of the appraisal would 
compromise the district's negotiating position.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EXPLOSION AT SUSPECTED METH LAB DESTROYS 
HOUSE, IGNITES BRUSH

 A wind-whipped blaze that is believed to have started when a suspected illegal 
methamphetamine lab exploded in a house west of Lancaster burned 130 acres of 
grass and brush before it was contained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, near 230th Street West and Lancaster Road, also was destroyed in 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a drug lab, meth lab, it looked like," said Tom Little, an 
investigator with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. "They had an 
explosion down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday set the house on fire, which 
then set nearby brush on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some pretty good winds last night," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-moving fire broke out in the Baldwin Canyon area of the western 
Antelope Valley and was contained Thursday morning. About 315 Los Angeles 
County firefighters and an additional 50 from the U.S. Forest Service battled 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-year-old paid volunteer firefighter was injured when embers got in his 
eyes while he was battling the blaze, said county Fire Inspector Rick Moreno. 
The volunteer firefighter was treated at Antelope Valley Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies responding to the scene reported that a possible drug lab 
was in operation at the house, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one at the scene when deputies arrived, and no arrests have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire crews spent much of Thursday working to extinguish hot spots in the area 
that burned, Moreno said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VALENCIA NATIONAL BANK PRAISES, FIRES 
PRESIDENT; FINANCE: AFTER LAUDING ROBERT MANLEY'S WORK, THE BOARD OUSTS HIM TO 
BRING IN A 'MORE RESPONSIVE' LEADER, A MEMBER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Valencia National Bank trustees this week praised founding President Robert 
Manley for helping the institution get off the ground, expand to a second and 
third branch and make a profit during the past seven years. Then, they fired 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Board chairman Lou Garasi on Thursday confirmed that Manley was terminated 
during a special meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. He said the board 
had been concerned about Manley's management for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garasi declined to give a specific reason for the termination beyond his 
statement that Manley has not been responsive to the bank's shareholders and 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our intention to criticize Mr. Manley at this point," Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board wants a new president "more responsive to the needs of the 
community," said board member Dick Keysor. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors will seek an individual who is conservative and will help the bank 
continue growing, Garasi said, acknowledging that Manley had those qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley, 51, is on vacation out of state and could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Garasi, who is filling in until a new president is hired, was unsure if Manley 
had received news of his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials declined to say if he will receive a severance package. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, I think something like that has occurred," Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board last week asked Manley to submit his resignation and gave him a 
deadline of last weekend, but Manley failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he left the state, Manley said that his ouster came after he tried to 
collect outstanding loan payments from current and former board members. He 
said Valencia National Bank lost "several hundred thousand dollars" in 
outstanding loans to directors and legal fees spent trying to recover the 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income at the bank dropped from about $512,000 in 1990 to about $29,500 in 
1993, according to bank reports. Much of the decline is attributed to the 
recession, and the 1993 figure includes a $200,000 loss from a loan default by 
an unidentified former board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Four board members resigned during a one-month period last summer, including 
at least two who had defaulted on loans from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia National Bank has less than $800,000 in loans now out to current 
directors -- about 2% of all of its loans, according to Donald Engdahl, senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials Thursday sought to reassure the public that the Santa Clarita 
Valley's only locally based bank is financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very good bank. We have a very strong financial position," said 
Garasi, calling the bank "like Fort Knox." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no drop in business at the bank, according to James Perkin, its 
chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been lots of inquiries about what is happening, but they're not 
pulling deposits," Perkins said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE MAY CLOSE ITS METROLINK STATION; 
TRANSPORTATION: CITY IS HAVING TROUBLE FINDING MONEY FOR A REQUIRED PEDESTRIAN 
UNDERPASS WHEN A NEW TRACK OPENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After working round-the-clock to build a Metrolink station when the Jan. 17 
earthquake crippled Southland freeways and brought commuter rail service to 
northern Los Angeles County, the city of Palmdale may be forced to close its 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as July 1, Metrolink trains will begin running on 10 miles of newly 
installed track between Lancaster and Palmdale.  
</P>
<P>
 Between the new track and Palmdale's hastily constructed station are some 
Southern Pacific Railroad freight tracks -- temporarily being used by 
Metrolink. Commuter train riders will not be allowed to walk across the freight 
tracks to board commuter trains on the new tracks because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale must either build a pedestrian underpass or close its station, said 
Ron Creagh, assistant city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pivotal thing is the money, where we get the money from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The underpass would cost an estimated $300,000, Creagh said, and another 
$100,000 would be needed to build a platform next to the new tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an expense we're having trouble finding the money for," said Palmdale 
Mayor Jim Ledford. 
</P>
<P>
 At their annual breakfast meeting Thursday with Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, the Palmdale City Council asked if the county would contribute 
to the cost of the underpass. Indirectly, Antonovich said no. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to begin to get more people to ride," Antonovich said, noting he is 
not aware that Metrolink has any money available for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing ridership may be a difficult task. The earthquake-damaged Antelope 
Valley Freeway is expected to reopen soon and the reduced Metrolink fares for 
north county residents are set to expire Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said that in the coming weeks a promotional 
mailing will be sent to about 400,000 households in the area served by the 
Santa Clarita line, as well as in areas of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailing will include a coupon redeemable for a free four-trip ticket "as a 
way to stimulate ridership on the train," Hidalgo said, adding that the 
technique has been used before. In addition, track improvements are continuing 
to reduce the travel time between the Antelope Valley and downtown Los Angeles, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 6.8 Northridge quake downed the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway 
connector ramp to the Golden State Freeway, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency agreed to provide $50 million for the extension of Metrolink service 
from Santa Clarita to the Antelope Valley. That service, which had not been 
expected for a decade, began Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lancaster and Palmdale built emergency train stations in a matter of days 
to accommodate the new service. A few weeks later another Antelope Valley 
station was added near Vincent Hill just south of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 While ridership on the commuter line initially swelled to 21,000 daily, it has 
long since diminished. Ridership now amounts to about 5,000 daily, with 350 
people boarding from the three Antelope Valley stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Creagh said an estimated 80 people get on and off the train at the Palmdale 
station. The Vincent Hill station is the most popular, with about 175 people 
boarding the trains there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FEMA is expected to pay for the three emergency stations, Creagh said 
the federal agency will not cover the cost of the underpass or other 
modifications to them. 
</P>
<P>
 While Metrolink is concerned about the possibility of the station closing, 
Hidalgo said stations are owned by the jurisdictions in which they are 
operated. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we get the passengers safely from the platform at Palmdale to board 
the train?" Hidalgo said. "Metrolink wants to work cooperatively to try to 
identify some solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if money can be found to build the underpass, Creagh said the station 
will have to close during the construction, which is expected to take about 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to discuss the issue further at its meeting 
Wednesday.

FIRE AND FLAIR; HE'S FLAMBOYANT, SHOWY, COCKSURE AND WIDELY REGARDED AS A 
SUPERSTAR OF BLACK STUDIES. BUT HARVARD'S HENRY GATES IS NOT WITHOUT CRITICS. 
TO THEM, HE SAYS: DEAL WITH IT.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talking to him, you get this clear, shining picture of an American childhood 
that vanished with the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 A wholesome, loving warmth reminiscent of times gone by is what you think of: 
a dad so devoted he held down two jobs; a mom who served as secretary to the 
PTA; two boys who had their share of skirmishes, but who always managed to rank 
first in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 No one locked their doors in this idyllic village. Almost no one swore. The 
grandmas wore flower-print aprons. And everyone was, as Henry Louis Gates Jr. 
puts it, colored . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we were in the 1950s," Gates said. He is not a large man, but he 
projects an immense presence. His smile exudes unshakable confidence. With 
precisely that smile, he added: "It's endearing." 
</P>
<P>
 But not every person who totes around a copy of Gates' just-published memoir, 
"Colored People" (Knopf, 1994), would comfortably share that opinion. Some 
non-African Americans study the title quizzically, wondering if it espouses 
some racist tract. Some African Americans are also less than enamored; Horace 
Porter, for example, the chairman of the African American Studies department at 
Stanford University, coolly said the title "totally suggests his point of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 In his office overlooking Harvard Square, Gates could not be less troubled. 
His vast self-assurance enables him to fire off frank opinions with the 
absolute certainty that the objects of those opinions will have to deal with 
them on their own terms. After all, he mused, he might have called the book 
"The Melanin in Me," a title he sometimes uses for lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates, 43, wrote "Colored People" for his daughters, 14-year-old Maggie 
and Liza, 12, to whom he writes in his introduction: "In your lifetimes, I 
suspect, you will go from being African Americans, to 'people of color,' to 
being, once again 'colored people.' . . . I have to confess that I like 
'colored' best, maybe because when I hear the word, I hear in it my mother's 
voice and the sepia tones of my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, in the insularity of the ivory tower, Gates has sprinted forth with a 
meteoric trajectory that has made him a kind of legend. If his outspokenness 
were not enough to assure him of that status, colleagues say, his lyrical use 
of language would be. His scholarship seems above reproach; as a 30-year-old 
junior professor at Yale, he was among the first group of MacArthur Foundation 
"genius grant" recipients. At only 33, he earned full tenure at Cornell before 
moving on to an endowed chair at Duke -- and, now, Harvard. Then there is his 
amazing network of acquaintances, housed in an obese Rolodex. 
</P>
<P>
 His enormous circle of friends knows him as "Skip," the nickname affixed to 
him as a boy in the strictly segregated mill town of Piedmont, W. Va. Students 
and faculty at Harvard know him as the W.E.B. DuBois Professor of the 
Humanities, chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department -- and the man who 
rattled the dust off John Harvard's grave by hiring Spike Lee as a lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first major act of flamboyance three years ago after assuming 
control of the then-moribund department. The faculty had shrunk to just one 
full-time professor, prompting Gates to quip that he wouldn't have to clear out 
any deadwood "because there's no wood at all." Only 19 students were declaring 
Afro-American as their "field of concentration," as Harvard stuffily calls a 
major. Even some specialists in the subject were not aware Harvard had an 
Afro-American Studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to pull a rabbit out of a hat," Gates said, proffering his dauntless 
smile once again. "Br'er Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Street-talking director Spike Lee, Gates said, was his rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 It made this spring's announcement that Gates had lured scholar and 
best-selling author Cornel West away from Princeton less surprising. The number 
of Afro-American "concentrators" at Harvard had tripled, and the faculty had 
mushroomed proportionately. Still, Gates said, hiring West was a coup that 
assured his department new credibility by providing more than one resident 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Gates who is most widely regarded as black studies' leading 
luminary. Admirers and detractors alike think of him as the subject's 
superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Harvard Law Prof. Derrick Bell, now teaching at New York University, 
called Gates "the dean of the black academic entrepreneurs." Peter Gomes, 
Harvard's chaplain and a professor of Christian Morals, gushed to the Boston 
Globe that Gates is "the Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, at Stanford, conceded of Gates that there are those "who feel he is 
not Afro-centric enough," those "who feel he sticks his nose in too many 
peoples' business" and those "who resent his celebrity." Nevertheless, Porter 
described Gates as "an extraordinary person in American intellectual and 
cultural life right now." 
</P>
<P>
 With degrees from Yale and Cambridge -- and honorary degrees from five 
universities, including Dartmouth -- Gates' intellectual credentials are 
impeccable, said J. Eugene Grigsby, director of UCLA's Center for Afro-American 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly he is a very prolific writer," Grigsby said. But he added that Gates 
is also "a self-promoter -- and I don't mean that in a derogatory manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard, Grigsby said, "thinks of itself as king of the hill. Skip'll fit 
right in." 
</P>
<P>
 But as to whether Gates should be vaulted to the top of some select academic 
pantheon, he continued, "I hate it when someone tries to anoint someone. I'd 
like to know who the Anglo-Saxon thinker is. So why is it that somebody can 
anoint 'the Black Intellectual?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gates has questions along that line himself. "There are 30 million black 
Americans -- more black Americans than there are Canadians," he said. "But no 
one would expect Canadians to speak with one voice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even in the rarefied world of academe -- where some people are paid simply 
to be smart -- black intellectuals are regarded "as if we were ancient Athens, 
10 great minds in one room," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding Harvard's professional schools, Gates is only the third black 
professor to be hired there, and -- with his joint appointment -- the school's 
first black professor of English. He is acutely aware of the implications of 
that attainment. Among his generation, Gates said, " 'first black' is still a 
modifier." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so few of us," he said of the black academic community. "And 
because there are so few of us, we are the crossover generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under such circumstances, Gates reasons, a little showmanship -- maybe even a 
lot of showmanship -- is not necessarily out of order. He is constantly 
publishing: books, magazine articles, Op-Ed pieces -- offering his thoughts on 
everything, it seems, except sports, and maybe he just hasn't found time for 
that.  
</P>
<P>
 He writes at a stunning pace, cranking out a first draft of "Colored People," 
for example, in six weeks. (The comforts of an Italian villa, owned by the 
Rockefeller Foundation, may have helped stir his creative juices a bit.) Unlike 
the legions of academics who eschew popular publications, Gates' byline is just 
as likely to appear in the New Yorker or the New York Times as some remote 
scholarly journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do write more than most people," Gates said, calling himself "one of the 
most frequently published authors in black studies." Among "the humanists," in 
fact, as Gates thinks of himself, "I am No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates more than displays the success he began earning so early on. He flaunts 
it. He drives a Mercedes, not exactly the battered antique Volvo of standard 
academic issue. His suits are exquisitely tailored, no suede elbow patches or 
dippy knit neckties for this professor, thank you. At Duke -- which he departed 
in a well-publicized huff when he was not made head of his department -- Gates, 
wife Sharon and their two daughters lived in a house that was said to be 9,000 
square feet. At Harvard, his salary is rumored to be among the school's very 
highest. But of course, polite Cantabridgians do not discuss unseemly subjects 
like money. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes his cues from carefully chosen role models -- among them W.E.B. 
DuBois and Booker T. Washington. His current academic mentor is Brown 
University President Vartan Gregorian, who advised him: "Skip, turn everything 
into an event." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That may have been among his motives in 1990 when he testified in the 
obscenity trial of the rap group 2 Live Crew. Gates said the group's style 
reflected the traditional African American heritage of "signifying," or comical 
derision. He also argued that the group's right to free speech was no different 
than Madonna's -- or any other well-known performer. 
</P>
<P>
 So some of his activities are perhaps slightly ostentatious, Gates allowed. So 
what? 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, it's easy for my white colleagues to criticize me for being 
entrepreneurial," he said. "But we have to be entrepreneurial." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates has also drawn fire from some of his own peers in African American 
studies. Partly it's envy -- "and I'd say envy comes with the territory," Gates 
said. But he has also alienated some black scholars who think that he is 
insufficiently Afro-centric, or that he has overly homogenized the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly he ignores such sniping, sticking to his position as "a midwife, a 
conduit to help other people gain access" to his field. He is "trying to carve 
out a middle ground" that makes the discipline inclusive, Gates said, and to 
serve in much the same role as "a Talmudic scholar, protecting the traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes he gets annoyed, lashing out at the critics who fault him for 
employing whites in his department. "If someone said I couldn't teach Milton 
because I wasn't Anglo-Saxon and blind, I'd say it was racist garbage," he 
said. "There's no closed shop here by race." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates comes as honestly by his righteousness as by his talent as a raconteur. 
His late mother set a standard of fearsome excellence. "She believed there was 
a natural aristocracy, and she was it," Gates said. Both parents read "all the 
time," and his father -- who, at 81, spends winters with his younger son and 
his family -- remains a nonstop storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his older brother, an oral surgeon in New Jersey, Skip Gates began 
school just as the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision forced 
desegregation. So while the paper mill picnics ceased before they would 
integrate, the schools took a different path. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became the prince of the school because I was smart," Gates said. "In that 
classroom, no one hassled me. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, and a more modest version of his smile crept onto his face. "It was 
only years later that I realized how amazing that was," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own life, he has had "nothing but golden opportunities." Still, Gates 
said, "I get angry about the fact that structural inequality has been such a 
fundamental fact of African American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in this century, Gates writes in his new book, black entertainer Bert 
Williams observed that "it's no disgrace to be colored. But it is awfully 
inconvenient." Even at the very tip-top of the academic heap, Gates comes to 
much the same conclusion today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" he railed. "It is inconvenient, because of white racism. When I walk 
into a room, people still see my blackness, more than my Gates-ness, or my 
literary-ness." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates is an optimist -- a luxury, perhaps, made possible by his rock-solid 
family and by his steady course of success. Some things are changing, he said, 
such as "the more obvious interplay between race and class." 
</P>
<P>
 The world he grew up in has all but disappeared, Gates said. But some fine 
remnants have managed to resurface. Only a few years ago, the African American 
employees at the paper mill in Piedmont, W. Va., decided to resurrect their 
traditional picnic. And this time, the white employees asked if they could 
come, too.

AROUND TOWN: A PRIVATE PAIN -- AND A PUBLIC HEALING

 Soon, the houselights would dim, and Darci Picoult, alone onstage, would start 
discussing her most intimate body parts and functions. Backstage, she asked 
herself, "Are you crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was fall, 1991, and Picoult, a New York actress, was presenting her 
one-woman play, "My Virginia," for the first time. Later -- as she saw that 
people weren't walking out -- it would get easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Virginia" is not traditional theater, nor Picoult your ordinary 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 This, her first play -- alternately hilarious and heartbreaking -- is about 
diethylstilbestrol, or DES, a drug widely prescribed before 1971 to prevent 
miscarriage. It didn't, it turned out, but it does cause cancer and other 
reproductive system aberrations in DES-exposed daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Picoult, 37, is a DES daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, L.A. Theatre Works brought "My Virginia" to Santa Monica, where it 
was recorded for broadcast this summer on KCRW's 'The Play's the Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a riveting, 90-minute tour de force, in which Picoult plays herself, her 
"Why me?" Jewish mother, patronizing doctors, pushy drug company lawyers and 
assorted others. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins "at the beginning." She is born. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting cross-legged in a big rattan chair on a nearly bare stage, she tells 
how her mom, having miscarried twice, "took this drug, DES, to ensure healthy, 
fat babies." Darci and Darri were tiny preemie twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jump to age 11. Each twin, desperate to be first to menstruate, regularly 
searches her body for signs of puberty. One day, Darci, triumphant, finds "a 
little hair on my virginia ," her childish name for that place down there. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, counting hairs, she "noticed this strange black thing . . . a 
thingamajigee on my thingamajigee." It was melanoma, her first medical trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to grips with the issue as a young adult, Picoult wants to tell the 
world about DES daughters. She decides to write a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the film producer, also played by Picoult: "A film about DES? Where is 
the humor? . . . Can you throw in a love interest?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: A conference of DES-exposed women. Onstage, she describes 
"beautiful women in their 20s and 30s, all of whom had deformed genitals or 
reproductive organs, and some none at all." 
</P>
<P>
 For a year, she listened to their stories, interviewed their doctors, mothers, 
lawyers. Then she wrote "My Virginia." Her tragi-heroine, "Julie," is a 
fictional composite of these women. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, 22, has a Texas drawl -- done impeccably by Picoult -- a teaching job 
and an embalmer bridegroom. "While I was teachin' the young ones, Dan was 
buryin' the old ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie also has cancer. When she recoils at her OB-GYN's suggestion that he 
take out her vagina, he says: "Look at me. I'm in my 50s, and I have lived my 
whole life without one." 
</P>
<P>
 She has the surgery. Later, she files suit against the companies that marketed 
DES. Their lawyers pry into everything from her sex life to what makeup she 
uses. She says: "I can't help thinkin', if mascara is linked to vaginal cancer, 
then we are all in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie gets a settlement and, not long afterward, a grim diagnosis. The cancer 
has spread. Her husband selects her casket. She is 34. 
</P>
<P>
 When DES was identified as a killer 20-plus years ago, it made headlines. But 
soon it became yesterday's problem. DES daughters have to fight to be heard, to 
get research funded. 
</P>
<P>
 As a doctor in the play says, "No one is going to win a Nobel Prize monitoring 
a 30-year-old medical mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Picoult speaks of her play as "a healing for me and my 
mother." As with many DES mothers and daughters, there was anger and guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 She has performed for audiences of doctors for whom, she says, "it must be 
like Hollywood-types going to see 'The Player.' " But they come and they 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Married two years, Picoult is weighing whether to have children. She has not 
had cancer, but a history of minor surgeries and biopsies. "I'm always having a 
lump here, a lump there." 
</P>
<P>
 She's negotiating either a TV dramatization or a one-person film. In October, 
she'll do "My Virginia" in Brussels for the European Community of Doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 DES Action USA estimates that 5 million women took DES. Most of their children 
are unaware that they were exposed. One in 1,000 daughters can expect to 
develop clear cell cancer; the jury's still out on the risk to sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Cody, DES Action director, has seen "My Virginia" three times and "wept 
every time." She found it "very emotionally accessible. She packs in a lot of 
information in a friendly way." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Lee Braun, director of DES Cancer Network and herself a DES daughter 
who developed cancer, assisted Picoult. She calls the play "vivid and true and 
funny and terrible. . . . She caught the humor we use to cope with living." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she adds, the "almost science-fiction-like horror" of having this done to 
you by your loving mother. 
</P>
<P>
 DES Action USA is based in Oakland: (510) 465-4011. DES Cancer Network is in 
Rochester, N.Y.: (716) 473-6119. The Age of Renaissance 
</P>
<P>
 It was SRO at the UCLA conference, "Dressing the Renaissance Woman," wherein 
scholars sought to explain it all: all those sleeves, all that brocade, all 
those plunging bodices. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was this woman? Well, if she was upper-class, she was most likely an 
exquisitely gowned ornament. In 16th-Century Venice, one speaker noted, 
beautiful women were trotted out as a "decorative border" at state occasions 
(the participants being, by definition, male). 
</P>
<P>
 And, it seems, Renaissance woman rarely owned her finery. Her wedding gown 
probably cost a fortune -- family honor was at stake -- but it was apt to be 
pawned after a decent interval to pay taxes. Just as her jewels might be seized 
by her husband's creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 That was reality. Fantasy is -- well, Mela Hoyt-Heydon of the Fullerton 
College theater department will tell you about fantasy. She was the wrap-up 
speaker at the conference, sponsored by UCLA's Center for Medieval and 
Renaissance Studies and Center for the Study of Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Her topic: "Renaissance Dress and the Entertainment Industry: Fiction With a 
Touch of Fact." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to costumes for films and stage, she says, "if you're looking 
for authenticity, you're looking in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 First, costume designers must face the fact that "modern actresses are not 
used to being corseted, wearing long, hanging sleeves, wigs and large hats." 
They must be able to "act, sing, cry and even die in these clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers may spend hours studying Titians or Tintorettos in museums, but 
ultimately, Hoyt-Heydon says, authenticity is compromised by budget, script and 
modern ideas of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 A Renaissance neck ruff must be scaled down so as not to appear laughable in a 
big screen close-up, where an actor might "look like (his) head is on a 
platter." 
</P>
<P>
 Costumer and set designer must click, too, to ensure that "Juliet dressed in 
burgundy is not sitting upon a burgundy bed against a burgundy-draped wall. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hoyt-Heydon says, a designer is not simply "unfreezing a moment" from 
centuries ago, but creating a mood and feeling of the past, with poetic 
license. (A case in point: Today's bride traditionally wears white. Not so 
during the Renaissance. So how to dress Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew"?) 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyt-Heydon is also a free-lance costume designer who has created for light 
opera, musical comedy and cruise lines. And, she mentions in passing, she put 
the Chicken McNuggets in tutus for TV: "It's kind of embarrassing."

 Newswatch, Part I: Robert W. Morgan and Richard Turnage (KRTH 101.1) ask what 
Rodney King and the LAPD have in common? "Neither one got a dime out of the 
city of Los Angeles yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on the lack of punitive damages for King: "That's bad news for 
Rodney. The good news is that his lawyer gets one-third of that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Peyser, on the threat by LAPD officers to picket at LAX and tell arriving 
passengers they won't be safe on our city streets: "What, the cops think

 Part II: Talk about a powerful politician. Comedy writer Bob Mills reports 
that Congressman Dan Rostenkowski has already been elected Inmate 
Representative of Cellblock "C" at Leavenworth. Mills adds that Rosty's legal 
team is urging him to look on the bright side: "If worse comes to worst, at 
least you'll be able to see Johnny Cash for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Brighter side, revisited . . . Leno says Rostenkowski faces something like 110 
years in prison if he's convicted: "So even if he serves all 110 years, he will 
still get out in time to put the finishing touches on the Clinton Health Care 
Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Leavenworth . . . Comic Argus Hamilton says the Ladies Aid Society 
there once decided to bring a little sunshine into the federal prison by 
sending cheery letters to the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman had trouble starting her letter because she was puzzled about how 
she should handle the salutation to a man she knew only by a long string of 
numbers. She finally achieved what she believed was the proper measure of 
friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear 6528633," she wrote. "May I call you just 652?"

 A businessman wandering along Broadway in New York City heard magnificent 
music coming from a popular club. He went in and, to his surprise, discovered a 
cat was playing the piano and a mouse was singing. He asked the bartender about 
the act, and the bartender introduced the businessman to the owner of the act. 
The businessman told the owner that he had never seen anything quite so unusual 
or amazing, and asked if the act was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner said it was for the right price, and the businessman offered $1 
million. "Sold!" said the owner and a contract was drawn up and signed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the previous owner had left, the bartender ventured over to the 
businessman: "I really hate to tell you this, but you've just been royally 
taken." 
</P>
<P>
 "How so?" replied the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," said the bartender, "the mouse doesn't sing. The cat is a 
ventriloquist."

intelligence:

 "Once while I was talking to my friend Curtis on the phone, my brothers were 
jumping around and making noise because they didn't particularly like him. The 
12-year-old shouted: "Curtis is illiterate." The 9-year-old followed: "And he 
can't read."

 Parents, heed this warning: Some educational computer software programs are 
extremely addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 They say right on the package that their aim is to teach children skills in 
everything from art to finances. But these programs take up far more time than 
you could have ever imagined -- regular bedtimes will be resisted, meals will 
be missed, chores will go undone. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about your kids here. They've grown up in the computer age, 
and although at times they may binge out on a game or some other computer task, 
today's kids do not look upon computers as a novelty but as a part of their 
regular existence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's you we're worried about. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educational programs are so whimsical and imaginative that they are 
positively irresistible to grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, my name is David and I can't stop playing Kid Pix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Pix is a drawing/painting program developed by Craig Hickman, who wanted 
an art program that could be used by his 3-year-old son. Offered by Broderbund, 
Kid Pix sells for about $35 to $40 and is available in the DOS, Windows and Mac 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Like adult art programs that are far more complex and expensive, Kid Pix has 
the usual tools that turn your cursor into a pencil, brush or eraser, and it 
works in a huge range of colors. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sets Kid Pix apart from the ultra-sophisticated professional programs 
is that it draws and paints in the way people have since prehistoric artists 
depicted the hunt on cave walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even pros who make their living at graphic design find this comforting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say I have to do something as simple as a curved line," says Deborah 
Daly, a Venice-based book designer/illustrator who happily admits to 
occasionally using Kid Pix to add flourishes to her work. "I have to get out 
one of their drafting tools and architecturally create it. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Kid Pix, it's direct. It's like you take out a pen and draw right on 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Its simplicity lets those of us with no artistic training and absolutely 
minimal ability start right in on Kid Pix and have a blast. It's the closest 
thing in the digital world to Crayola heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 But because it is digital, Kid Pix can do astonishing things far beyond what 
was possible in kindergarten. In addition to making the expected variety of 
geometrical shapes, you can adorn your drawing with little rubber stamps that 
range from everyday items such as a wristwatch to dinosaurs and Egyptian 
goddesses. You can add text in a variety of fonts, "fractel" trees that come 
out different every time and even a feature that leaves a wake of stars as you 
drag the cursor across your digital sky. 
</P>
<P>
 On the slightly more serious side is The Cruncher, a program from Davidson & 
Associates (Mac and Windows versions available for about $35) that teaches kids 
about spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to admit that just the mention of spreadsheets used to quickly move me 
to the other side of the room. It sounded so, well, corporate.  
</P>
<P>
 But using a step-by-step tutorial, The Cruncher explains just how a 
spreadsheet works to organize, edit, display and calculate figures in a table. 
So what if the examples used are keeping track of candy bar sales to benefit 
the school basketball team, after-school jobs or adjustments to a cookie 
recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 These are easily applied to the adult world without the sometimes painful task 
of making your way through an adult computer program manual.  
</P>
<P>
 And so what if The Cruncher shows you how to set up a chart to determine how 
much of your allowance you'll have to set aside to eventually buy a Walkman? 
This could easily be used to instead buy adult items, such as an exercise 
machine or a hedge trimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll keep you busy during those frustrating times when the kids insist on 
using the computer.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; HIGH-TECH HELP FOR LOST DRIVERS; IN-DASH NAVIGATION 
SYSTEMS USE SATELLITES TO MAP OUT THE BEST WAY TO GET WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters often complain that our political leaders lack vision of where the 
nation is headed, but our nation's motorists are in much worse shape: They are 
lost not only figuratively but literally. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors officials say their studies show that motorists fail to take 
the most direct route 20% of the time when they drive -- either because they 
are lost or because they take the wrong roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in our society, including apparently well-educated people, are 
unable to read maps and must rely on landmarks, verbal directions or trial and 
error to get around. Stopping a pedestrian or asking a gas station attendant is 
often no help at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But new in-dash navigation systems will be coming on the market soon and 
promise to make a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldsmobile will be the first Big Three auto maker to introduce an in-dash 
navigation system, using signals from the Pentagon's Global Positioning System 
satellites to provide a driver with routing information and turn-by-turn 
directions from a computerized voice. You simply punch in the address of where 
you are going and the computer software figures out how to get your there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldsmobile system will first be offered as a $2,000 option in California 
in coming weeks and then go on sale in other U.S. markets. Although Japanese 
car makers have offered such systems in Japan, none of them comes close to GM's 
system in terms of offering voice commands and a satellite-based locating 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The price obviously will discourage a lot of buyers, but eventually these 
systems are going to come down to about $500, the same money many car buyers 
put down for car sound systems. Within a decade, 50% of new cars are expected 
to be ordered with the systems, said Bill Spritzer, GM's technical director for 
intelligent vehicle highway systems. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of automobile electronics have been long on high-technology glitz but 
short on usefulness for the driver. I put electronic dashboards and heads-up 
windshield displays in this category, but not the navigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldsmobile system has a receiver that can tap signals from orbiting 
satellites 11,000 miles above Earth and, with some sophisticated software, 
determine the car's location anywhere on Earth within 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldsmobile system will have a CD-ROM player and with only four disks the 
system will have digital-based maps of every street in America, displayed on a 
four-inch full-color screen. If you are lost, you can push a button and the 
system will give your current address and show your location on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, these systems will be linked to information systems that broadcast 
up-to-the-second information about freeway jams and provide alternative 
routing. GM demonstrated this sort of a system, which was even able to estimate 
driving time based on traffic conditions, in a test called Traveltek in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will be almost unlimited in what information it could deliver: the 
CD-ROM player could someday contain a directory of restaurants, gas stations 
and other businesses. If you want the nearest McDonald's or the nearest muffler 
shop, the dashboard screen would display the options and the computerized voice 
would tell you how to get there. Another big feature of the future system would 
be its ability to automatically alert police in the event of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has already started a pilot program with Avis, renting the cars equipped 
with the system in San Jose. Results so far are encouraging, a GM spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The introduction and use of these systems will help ensure that getting lost 
when driving in unfamiliar surroundings is very much a thing of the past," said 
Oldsmobile General Manager John Rock.

THE GOODS; MANY HAPPY RETURNS; CUTTING-EDGE IDEAS HAVE MADE BURBANK'S RECYCLING 
CENTER MORE THAN JUST SOME DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nestled below the I-5 and a ring of mountains, the Burbank Recycle Center, 
descendant of the humble city dump, looks like an environmentalist's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the cement-block complex with bright blue trim appears tidy 
as a ship's deck, despite the constant stream of trucks rumbling through the 
entrance to empty giant loads of mingled paper, cans and bottles from their 
curbside collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual citizens in cars can swing into the courtyard's buy-back center, 
deposit household paper, plastic or cans into clearly marked bins, and pick up 
cash on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 And inside the administration building, a carpeted conference center offers so 
many exhibits that it is a regular stop for school tours. (On the bulletin 
board are working sketches for a walk-in simulated compost heap with insects 
chomping leaves and twigs.) It's also a popular stop for visiting 
environmentalists and even business leaders showing off the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a user-friendly place," said Steve Maggi, recycling coordinator. With 
recycling specialist Hope McAloon, he led a tour of the sprawling complex at 
500 S. Flower St. They discussed their work in the favorite language of 
recyclers: Pounds and tons and percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 In all categories, Burbank excels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now recycling 3,000 tons of materials a month," McAloon said. "Right 
now we're diverting 38% of our trash back into circulation in some way. This is 
up from 25% in 1990." They expect to hit 50% by the year 2000, Maggi said. 
</P>
<P>
 These are figures to envy in California. A 1989 state law, aimed at lessening 
the landfill burden, mandates that cities must divert 25% of their trash by 
1995 or be subject to heavy fines. 
</P>
<P>
 While some play catch-up, Burbank is ahead of the game. "Joy Hamilton, now 
retired, was the administration officer who initiated curbside and buy-back and 
drop-off in 1982, ahead of most cities," Maggi said. "She was a visionary." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the facility's opening in 1992, the city took another forward step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clean, integrated part of the community, not just a business slapped 
onto the corner trying to make a buck," said Geoffrey Folsom of Smurfit 
Recycling, the city's partner in this venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who never saw themselves in a million years driving into a recycling 
center with their family now do it," he said. "Any Saturday we have people 
lined up to sell their cans or plastic bottles -- we have families with kids, 
we have limousines and even a few movie stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Smurfit, a division of the Jefferson Smurfit Corp., a giant paper producer and 
recycler, are experienced brokers with a global network of markets for the tons 
of material that move through the Burbank center daily.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the combination of a fairly innovative city with a company that wants to 
be on the forefront," Maggi said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Burbank was named the best recycler in the nation last year by 
the American Forest & Paper Assn., which cited the city's comprehensive program 
as a national model. 
</P>
<P>
 McAloon and Maggi describe the many parts of the program, all dedicated to the 
philosophy that "Recycling is a lot more than just picking up the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 They include:  
</P>
<P>
 * The buy-back/drop-off center, which last year paid out more than $300,000 
for paper, cans and bottles citizens brought in. And lots of conscientious 
recyclers bring in materials that don't bring money, McAloon said. "We can take 
items that most recyclers don't want, including telephone directories and 
detergent and cereal boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Household curbside collections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Waste-oil drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monthly pickup of bulky household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 * Back-yard composting, a major factor because yard waste accounts for 30% of 
most landfills. "Some cities sell compost bins," McAloon said. "We give them 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Green waste" program for yard clippings that aren't composted. "We pick it 
up and sell it to a contractor who ships it to Kern County for composting," 
Maggi said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recycling programs for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * The City of Burbank's own in-house program that encompasses both recycling 
and buying recycled products. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Christmas tree program that recycled 100,000 tons of evergreen into 
compost last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A speaker's bureau. "We'll talk to schools, clubs, business organizations -- 
anyone who will listen," McAloon said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other creative touches: Public-spirited recyclers can credit the 
value of their recyclables to an account that aids the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to stay on the cutting edge," Maggi said. Two years ago, the 
center launched a Recycling Heroes recognition program. The latest recipients' 
list illustrates the range of the city's recycling outreach.  
</P>
<P>
 One hero, Shelley Levin Billik, directs a program at Warner Bros. that not 
only recycles every scrap of paper on the lot, but also recycles scrap metal, 
wood, toner cartridges, glass, film, video and audio cassettes. The company 
also tries to buy environmentally sound products, Billik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to understand recycling is more than separating your 
discards," she said. "We really feel very strongly about it and know that with 
our size, with our volume, we can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing that belief on a personal level is Paul Herman, 87, who started 
collecting newspapers five years ago to benefit his church and has developed a 
citywide route. Three times a week he unloads 800 to 900 pounds, and he loves 
the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a difference," he said. "The old one was terrible -- all the bins out in 
the weather. I understand this is the best one in the United States. I don't 
know if that's right, but I go along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggi likes to hear the praise. "Our old place was just a half-acre with a 
little office for the cashier. But getting material in is only half the battle. 
Everything here is marketed and sold -- otherwise, we'd just be a dump." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the partnership with Smurfit comes in. "Burbank supplies the 
building, and we're the contractor," Folsom said. "We are like a tenant. We 
pick up all the materials, process them and market the finished product all 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 In the processing plant, a towering open warehouse, mountains of paper, 
plastic and glass are sorted on a moving belt and dumped into a baler to be 
crushed and baled into giant cubes, ready for export. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other commodity, recyclables are vulnerable to supply and demand, 
Folsom said, which is why buy-back prices fluctuate. And although the sudden 
growth of city recycling programs has overloaded the market with paper, he sees 
the problem diminishing as the demand for recycled paper grows: "As long as 
people realize how the whole recycling loop works, the supply we generate as a 
group will find its natural demand from consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city doesn't make a profit from the center, it is considered a 
successful endeavor, said Sylvia Glazer, Burbank's administrative officer in 
public works. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good public-private partnership and I think we are innovative in many 
of our programs," she said. "The Recycling Center is a very positive place." 
The Exchange Rates 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Recycle Center pays for these materials; the amount fluctuates 
anywhere from a third of a penny per pound for colored No. 2 plastic bottles up 
to 95 cents per pound for aluminum cans bearing California redemption logos: 
</P>
<P>
 * Aluminum cans (with or without redemption logo) * Glass bottles and jars * 
Plastic bottles (No. 1 with redemption logo and No. 2, clear or color without 
logo) * White or color office paper * Corrugated cardboard * Newsprint * 
Computer printout paper * Used motor oil 
</P>
<P>
 The center also accepts the following materials for recycling but does not pay 
anything for them: * Aluminum scrap (clean foil, food trays, screens, etc.) * 
Steel and tin cans * Non-redemption No. 1 plastic * Magazines and catalogues * 
Telephone books * Non-corrugated cardboard (such as detergent or cereal boxes) 
* Brown paper bags * Nontoxic aerosol cans

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; THE FORCE AND THE STARS WERE WITH HIM; AWARD: USC HONORS 
FILMMAKER EXTRAORDINAIRE GEORGE LUCAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE ENTERTAINMENT 
INDUSTRY -- AS 800 OF HIS CLOSEST, PERSONAL FRIENDS WATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: The title of the event is a real mouthful: The USC School of 
Cinema-Television's 65th anniversary gala honoring George Lucas with the first 
USC Award for Leadership in the Entertainment Industry. The black-tie dinner 
was held Wednesday at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the World Really Need Another Award? The film school dean, Elizabeth 
Daley, said: "It's terribly important that USC establish an award that reflects 
what this school stands for. This is about real leadership in the industry, not 
just celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Might There Be Another Reason? What better incentive could there be for 
chewing chicken at the Hilton than squeezing half a million out of the alumni? 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The dinner was co-chaired by Barbara Davis, Steven Spielberg 
and David Wolper. Art Buchwald was the main speaker. Jack Haley Jr. did the 
film clips. Among the 800 guests were Frank Price, Jackie Collins, Shakira 
Caine, Gregory Peck, Marvin Davis, Jane and Michael Eisner, Allan Carr, Sid and 
Lorraine Sheinberg, Robert Graham, Sidney and Joanna Poitier, Leonard and Wendy 
Goldberg, Bud and Cynthia Yorkin, Tom Pollock, Verna Harrah and Leonard 
Rabinowitz, Tony Thomopoulos, John Singleton (asked if film school was worth 
it, the "Boyz N the Hood" director said: "I'm workin', ain't I?"), Sid Ganis, 
and Joan Collins, who didn't go to film school -- "I went to the Royal Academy 
of Drama, dear." So there. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Go to Film School? Director Ron Howard, who went to USC for two years but 
left to do "Happy Days": "No one on the 'Andy Griffith Show' ever discussed the 
use of metaphor in film. You'd probably get thrown off the set if you did. But 
it's a good thing to know if you're going to make movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Why Not Go to Film School? Spielberg, who calls himself a "USC wanna-be," was 
turned down for admission because of low grades. He got the biggest laugh of 
the evening when he began his speech by saying, "Standards were so high that 
many of today's finest filmmakers were unable to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Special Effect: While USC's marching band played, the school mascot -- 
Traveler -- was ridden across the back of the ballroom. It was quite an effect. 
Maybe more horses should come to black-tie dinners. In comparison, the video 
tribute from President Clinton ("Congratulations and may the force be with 
you") seemed tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Prop: The stage door through which speakers passed was inscribed with the 
film school's unofficial motto: "Reality Ends Here." (Dean Daley says her 
financial officer has inscribed on her desk the phrase: "Reality Begins Here.") 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: As Harrison Ford was rushing through the lobby, he was grabbed by 
two elderly British women. They wanted to tell him what great fans they were. 
He stopped, held their hands, looked deeply and meaningfully into their eyes 
and said: "I have to go to the bathroom." They let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: During the reception, when Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg said, "Film 
school!? I didn't go to school!" Lucas leaned over and said, with a completely 
deadpan expression, "Anyone can make it in America."

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; TAKE TIME FOR QUICK BUT REWARDING READS; PRIZE

 Ah, short stories; the working mother's favorite fiction. They fit right in 
between putting on the water for the pasta and debating the merits of the 
bi-nightly bath with an adamant 4 1/2-year-old. They reward the exhausted 
reader by providing conflict and resolution in a condensed package. You can 
enter and exit a fantasy before your eyelids begin to droop. Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 This collection is supposed to be the best, winners of the 1993 O'Henry 
competition. I have a happy Pavlovian response to the name O'Henry; every time 
I hear it, I think about the girl with the long hair who cut it to buy her 
husband a watch chain -- for the watch he sold to buy her combs for her hair. 
Or the artist who painted a leaf on a wall so an elderly neighbor who expected 
to die when the last leaf fell would have to hang on a while longer. A good 
short story is such a refined entity, such an evocative mix of imagination and 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 If the publisher has made any mistake here, it was to lead off with this 
year's winner, "Better Be Ready 'Bout Half Past Eight," by Alison Baker. It's 
an almost impossible act to follow. Byron is a young scientist, an affectionate 
husband, a doting dad to baby Toby, and a longtime best friend to another lab 
rat, Zach -- who shakes Byron's circumscribed world one day by announcing his 
intention to become Zoe, thanks to the marvels of hormones and plastic surgery. 
Byron tumbles into a wonderland of sexual confusion, a place at once funny and 
poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene that will make any ambivalent child wince, he pulls his T-shirt 
back over his head (so that it resembles a woman's pageboy), borrows some of 
his wife's lipstick and -- voila! oh, no! -- stares into the mirror and sees 
reflected the unpleasantly familiar visage of his late and not so lamented 
mother. He takes Toby along to purchase a gift for Zach/Zoe's coming-out shower 
and falls into the effusive clutches of a salesclerk who thinks he'd look grand 
in a little magenta eye shadow. And he keeps having to face Zach in transition. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a wonderfully sad, appropriately befuddled story that manages, in its 
last moments, to convincingly suggest that anything's possible -- without ever 
becoming sentimental or sloppy about the notion. The water on the stove boiled 
over, unnoticed, waiting for me to finish reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Didn't," by Stuart Dybek, is a more meditative effort, although one that 
manages, with a deft twist, not to be about what it seems. At first it reads 
like some distant reverse relative to the final scene in James Joyce's Ulysses, 
in which a young boy reflects on how many ways he and his beloved managed not 
to consummate their love; how many ways she managed to say no. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has little to do, really, with their sexual passion -- more, 
interestingly, with how a sad coincidence blights their feelings for each 
other, how the tragic memory of a complete stranger can alter a seemingly 
obvious story of young love. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something here for almost everyone, including the sort of wry story 
where the author talks just over her shoulder to the reader. In "Where She 
Was," by Helen Fremont, the passing comments get a bit arch. But that's to be 
expected: The narrator is a young woman trying to come to terms with the secret 
love affair she's having with another woman ("No, my mother doesn't know. She 
thinks Jana and I are friends. I love that word: friends ."), and defensive 
cleverness is her natural posture. But just as the writing begins to verge on 
the precious, tenderness sneaks in and saves the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a refreshing collection to dip into, to pick and choose from. Nice to 
know that writers are out there working away at the fine, if slightly out of 
fashion craft of short-story writing. Hey, it may not pay like 
movie-of-the-week scripts, but the emotional rewards are great.

INK: FICTIONAL FLING WITH DIANA STIRS UP BRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, NEWSDAY; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Peter Lefcourt sat down in Los Angeles last Saturday to discuss his new 
novel, he had no idea that the book was about to kick up a front-page storm in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day's Sunday Express screamed: " 'MY AFFAIR WITH DIANA' BOOK ROW." 
Romance novelist Barbara Cartland, a step-grandmother to Princess Diana, told 
the London tabloid that Lefcourt's "Di and I" should be banned, saying, "It's 
appalling that Diana can be used to sell fiction like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters picked up the story and exported it to the United States, so Memorial 
Day newspapers and newscasts also described the fictionalized account of a love 
affair with the princess. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's the thing: "Di and I," published in this country by Random House, 
is not trash. Lefcourt, a seasoned screenwriter who won an Emmy in 1985 for his 
work on "Cagney and Lacey," is also one of those serious novelists. Two years 
after publication of "The Dreyfus Affair," his well-received tale of two 
major-league baseball players who fall in love (with each other), his wildly 
improbable "Di and I" has enough page-turning hilarity and romance to make it a 
worthy candidate for beach reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Little in this week's news stories indicated that Cartland or the other quoted 
detractors had read the book -- or could have read it, seeing that the novel 
has yet to go on sale in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Di and I" works like this: Embittered screenwriter Leonard Schecter, a 
Hollywood deal and divorce papers in hand, arrives in London to prepare a TV 
mini-series about Diana. He manages to grab a dance with her at a Togolese 
Embassy party, they click, and a Fleet Street reporter helps put him in further 
contact. Clandestine meetings lead to a sexually rich romance, and a bold 
escape from royal boredom, before Leonard and Di settle down and open up a 
McDonald's franchise in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 In this Cinderella story in reverse, Barbara Walters, Ross Perot and King Juan 
Carlos are among the other brand names who turn up. Diana is portrayed as 
appealingly sweet and fragile, an innocent who finds love outside her painfully 
loveless marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction is that it's really irrelevant for Cartland to comment without 
first reading the book," Lefcourt said Tuesday. "The book is meant to be 
romantic and sweet, and I think that Diana herself would be pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefcourt, 52, a soft-spoken New York native who worked among the Togolese 
during a stint in the Peace Corps, first came to Los Angeles in 1972. He had 
managed to sell a script for a murder mystery to Universal. "Here I was, in 
L.A., in my corduroy jacket looking at Porsches," he recalled. The movie was 
not made, but by 1975 Lefcourt was writing for TV's "Eight Is Enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, this week's publicity in Britain should sell books. The sparks 
should also light -- or maybe scorch -- the path for Lefcourt when he visits 
Britain to promote "Di and I" on June 19. Random House launched the book in the 
United States with a first printing of 25,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Book Talk: Visitors to the American Booksellers Assn.'s annual convention left 
Los Angeles on Tuesday with piles of books, catalogues, T-shirts and publishing 
tales such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * The next headache for President Clinton may come in the form of Bob 
Woodward's "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House." Woodward's view at the 
top was described by one who has read the book as unflattering when it comes to 
Clinton's decision-making skills. Simon & Schuster plans to put the book on 
sale immediately after "60 Minutes" offers a first peek on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chuck Hogan, a young writer who has been supporting himself by working in a 
Boston video store, scored a $500,000-plus contract from Doubleday for his 
first novel. Film rights are now in play for "The Standoff," praised by 
Doubleday Publisher Stephen Rubin as "pure action, a thriller about a hostage 
negotiator who has to deal with a white supremacist in Idaho." 
</P>
<P>
 * Random House has ambitious plans for the October publication of Marlon 
Brando's long-awaited autobiography. "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," which 
includes as many as 100 photos from the actor's collection, will be advertised 
extensively to support an anticipated print run of 500,000 copies. But whether 
the enigmatic -- and reclusive -- Brando will step forward to support his own 
cause on the chat circuit appears doubtful. Random House Publisher Harold Evans 
said Brando has agreed to answer prepared questions in front of a camera -- and 
this video would then be made available to interested media. Meanwhile, 
Hyperion intends to publish Peter Manso's unauthorized bio of Brando, a book 
Evans called "a spoiling operation." 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbara Bush said she felt "kind of guilty hiding behind the dog" when she 
wrote the canine chronicle "Millie's Book" (and Millie, by the way, is 
"absolutely wonderful, a great companion still"). But when the former First 
Lady's autobiography is published by Scribners at summer's end, she will be out 
on her own, with everyone from Barbara Walters to -- yes -- David Letterman 
planning to catch up with her life outside the White House. Bush presented an 
overview of her memoir at an afternoon tea in Beverly Hills and boasted that 
she wrote every word on a laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV writer-producer Stephen J. Cannell visited William Morrow & Co.'s 
convention booth on Saturday, even though his first novel is a year from 
publication. Morrow recently announced that it had acquired Cannell's "The 
Plan," a political thriller.

FOR 14,000, BARBRA WELL WORTH WAIT; MUSIC: DELAYED SOUTHLAND DEBUT OF STREISAND 
CONCERT DRAWS HUGE OVATION IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Met by a huge ovation from 14,000 people as she took the stage, Barbra 
Streisand finally launched her long-awaited and much-hyped series of concerts 
at The Pond of Anaheim Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening with "Everything's As If We Never Said Goodbye," she took a few 
good-natured knocks at rumors that she had faked her bout with laryngitis that 
led to the rescheduling of her first four Anaheim dates. 
</P>
<P>
 She offered a Letterman-style Top 10 list for reasons why she postponed the 
shows, starting with, "I've always wanted to spend four hot, muggy days in 
Anaheim in the middle of July" to No. 1, "Every time I've tried to get here, I 
got sidetracked and went to Disneyland instead." 
</P>
<P>
 She then settled into a set mixing Broadway standards and hits spanning her 
career, chatting amiably between numbers about her life and music. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans had waited a long time for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said Sue Clark, 35, of Riverside, who came 
to arena hours early with her friend to pick up their $125 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's first performance Thursday evening in Anaheim was part of her 
first tour in nearly three decades, a tour she says will be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement was especially high since the 52-year-old singer, suffering last 
week from viral tracheolaryngitis and under strict orders from her doctor not 
to talk much less sing, had postponed four previously announced shows at The 
Pond, her only stop in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out show attracted fans, celebrities and friends of Streisand from 
across the country, including director Peter Bogdanovich (who directed 
Streisand in "What's Up Doc"), actress Brooke Shields and tennis pro Andre 
Agassi. Some arrived in limos, wearing sequined gowns and suits, while others 
dressed in jeans and shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a fan of Barbra since I was in high school," Susan Bratlien of 
North Dakota said. "I'm just so excited, I don't know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay Wood, 45, from El Paso said she cried for two days after her husband told 
her they would be getting tickets for the show through the Operation USA/LA 
Earthquake Relief Fund, an international disaster relief group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fan, let's just leave it at that," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand will perform at The Pond again Saturday night. Tickets for the four 
postponed shows will be honored in July, after Streisand has completed 
engagements in San Jose and New York, the remaining cities on her six-stop 
itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the rescheduling, she issued a statement saying she felt 
"terrible that these postponements may cause severe scheduling problems for so 
many who have waited for so long for me to perform live." 
</P>
<P>
 While legions of fans were disappointed, including some of whom had flown 
across the country for the shows that did not take place, those attending on 
Thursday were thrilled to find themselves at what turned out to be the opening 
night of the singer's Southern California engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially poignant performance for a Dana Point woman. Her son, who 
died in 1989 at age 35, studied music and loved Streisand's talent above all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbra was his girl," she said. "This whole night I'm going to be thinking of 
him. It's very special. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated concert involved extra expense and some unusual security 
measures, which fans didn't seem to mind. Ticket prices were unprecedented: 
$350, $125 and $50 each from the box office. Private ticket brokers charged a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial announcement that she would be coming to Southern California 
turned Los Angeles into a "city of scalpers," in the words of one ticket 
broker, although some tickets still were available at face value Wednesday for 
the Anaheim shows. Streisand is poised to set box office records with a 
six-night gross from the Anaheim shows expected to top $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Management at The Pond jacked parking fees up to $8 from the usual $6. And 
fans had to temporarily unload their metal belongings into plastic bags and 
pass through metal detectors, a measure more commonly associated with airports, 
or at least with concerts by punk-metal bands and hard-core rap acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks fans may have felt out of place in the concession stand areas. 
Alongside food stands peddling the usual arena nachos, hot dogs and Cracker 
Jack were coffee liqueurs and $10-a-glass champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 The multilevel stage, including a full orchestra, re-created a swank sitting 
room, with stairway, elegant chairs and sofas, a fireplace and a silver tea 
service. Another of Streisand's top 10 reasons for the rescheduling the dates 
was, "I didn't realize it would take a whole week to dust all this furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Streisand took extra measures to boost sound quality in The Pond. The 
entire arena floor was carpeted, and sound-dampening fabrics were hung in other 
areas to enhance acoustics. Fans bought souvenirs at a brisk pace, everything 
from $25 T-shirts, $20 programs and $15 mugs to $50 throw rugs and $60 ties. 
One woman from Alaska left with more than $400 of T-shirts for her family, who 
also traveled to Anaheim especially for the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 * SOUNDS FINE: Voice belies laryngitis bout, Robert Hilburn writes. A18 
Barbra's Top 10 List 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's Top 10 Reasons for Postponing Four Concerts at The Pond of 
Anaheim: 
</P>
<P>
 10: I've always wanted to spend four hot muggy days in Anaheim in the middle 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
 9: I was trying to help work out Dan Rostenkowski's plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 8: I didn't realize it would take a whole week to dust all this furniture 
(that makes up her stage set). 
</P>
<P>
 7: I had to stay home and wait for the cable guy. 
</P>
<P>
 6: I hurt my voice yelling "yabba dabba doo!" 
</P>
<P>
 5: I wanted to add a new item to my line of concert souvenirs: Barbra 
Streisand tongue depressors. 
</P>
<P>
 4: They were having a shoe sale at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 3: I thought my concert tour needed more publicity.

CLINTON'S ROME VISIT TURNS INTO FAMIGLIA AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So he chatted with the Pope, captivated clerics, hobnobbed with a billionaire 
prime minister and supped of one of the world's great cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad in the hot streets of this city Thursday, it was mostly Roman passersby 
and accidental tourists who witnessed President Clinton's visit to celebrate 
what he characterized as an extraordinary, all-in-the-family relationship 
between the United States and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton seemed as much awe-struck as awe-inspiring to Romans as he 
made a relaxed, tourist-like debut in the Eternal City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came all they way from Omaha, Neb., to see this. I can't believe it! The 
tour director had tickets for the President, so we just abandoned the tour," 
said Morine Dosert in the majestic Piazza Campidoglio, where Clinton spoke in 
front of Rome's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 If Romans behaved almost as if an old friend had dropped in to call, not all 
of them were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was not good news for Kavir Ahmed, who makes his living on the 
sidewalk inscribing "Your Name on a Grain of Rice." 
</P>
<P>
 "A tourist from Vienna named Kurt had me put his name on one side of a grain 
and Clinton's on the other, but business is lousy. A lot of people are staying 
away, and the rest don't seem to care that he's here," said Ahmed, a 
28-year-old Bangladeshi. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Rome in offhanded fashion digested the friendly invasion by a 
President commanding more limousines and security cars than Hannibal had 
elephants. People went to work. Ugly orange buses growled messily. Motorini 
buzzed busily. Helicopters coptered. Everybody knew that Clinton would make the 
traffic worse, if that is possible. He did. 
</P>
<P>
 There were U.S. flags here and there, cops galore, bunches of people, but few 
crowds to speak of except at the Campidoglio. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a folksy speech partially translated by Budget Director Leon 
Panetta, an Italian American, Clinton evoked Marc Antony's "Friends, Romans and 
countrymen," hailing Italians, in Italian, as Alleati, amici, una famiglia. 
(Allies, friends, family.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I shaked his hand," shouted Jude Jeyankachan, 10, with greater exuberance 
than grammatical nicety. A police band played "Cheek to Cheek" as Clinton 
warmly greeted seven Romans born on June 4, 1944 -- the World War II liberation 
of Rome by U.S. troops -- and all named Italian variations of "America." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the hearty atmosphere and the number of people here, America is alive 
and well in Rome," said Sister Brigid Murphy, a teacher at Marymount 
International School amid a forest of Italian and U.S. flags in front of City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hillary Clinton, who swapped M & M's for smiles with chanting, delighted 
Italian school kids in the Piazza Navona ("EE-la-ree! EE-la-ree!" the children 
cried), the President seemed to enjoy the experience at every stop on a 
cloudless Roman day more summer than spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," said Clinton, enjoying Michelangelo's restored frescoes 
in the Sistine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a long news conference with new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, one of 
Europe's richest men, was outdoors in a landmark 17th-Century courtyard of the 
distinguished old Palazzo Chigi. Then on to a glittery, caloric, black-tie 
state dinner in a Renaissance villa designed by Raffaello. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of Rome's tourist season, many who saw Clinton on Thursday just 
happily happened upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first President I'll have seen since L.B.J.," said Jim Tudor of Chicago, 
who stopped in curiosity on Via del Corso and was rewarded with a motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Kubik, a German in from Frankfurt for a long weekend, observed of the 
President: "He's worth waiting for; some of us see him as a new J.F.K." 
</P>
<P>
 "Splendid advertising for us," said Raffaele Ciarelli, leading a demonstration 
for immigrants' rights that city authorities had unaccountably forgotten to 
reschedule for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who jogged his way through jet-lag in a red baseball cap and a gray 
T-shirt that said "Radio City," got his first view of the day of the Italian 
capital from a famous hilltop lookout called the Pincio. 
</P>
<P>
 After his encounter with a stiff, frail-looking Pope recovering from a broken 
thigh, Clinton was buoyant and beaming in an encounter with 140 American 
priests and seminarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding into a baroque salon at the Apostolic Palace, the President told the 
clerics that his encounter with John Paul was "an awe-inspiring experience." 
</P>
<P>
 When Raymond Flynn, former Boston mayor and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, 
assured Clinton that all the priests were Democrats, Clinton turned to 
accompanying Cardinal Angelo Sodano and joked: "After that political comment he 
(Flynn) made, he has another good reason to go to confession now." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking off the cuff, Clinton, a Baptist graduate of a Catholic university, 
lavished praise on the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. "The church 
has brought together faith and action, word and deed, bringing together people 
across the lines of rich and poor, of racial lines and other lines perhaps 
better than any other institution in our society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He commended the clerics for the "ultimate commitment of your entire lives in 
the service of that in which you believe. . . . I stand here today to tell you 
that, as an American President, I am immensely proud of the commitment you have 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Christopher Coyne of Boston had praise for Clinton, saying he was 
"very eloquent. I think he spoke from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 As he swept through Rome, Clinton received both the deference and the 
familiarity that his presence and demeanor encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vatican, "gentlemen of honor" stood at attention in morning coats. 
Swiss Guards in plumed helmets hammered their halberds in salute. And yet, by 
late afternoon, when Berlusconi invited Clinton to address a news conference, 
the Italian prime minister turned to the leader of the Free World and said in 
English: "Please, Bill."

CLINTON OPENS EUROPE TRIP, MEETS PONTIFF; ITALY: AT THE OUTSET OF D-DAY 
COMMEMORATIONS, PRESIDENT AND POPE DISPLAY FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES ON 
POPULATION CONTROL. MEETINGS WITH OTHER LEADERS SCHEDULED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton launched an eight-day European voyage of nostalgia and 
diplomacy on Thursday with a celebration of the United States' "towering 
friendship" with Italy and a search for common ground with the Pope on 
population control. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in a late-afternoon address to the people of Rome at the city's 
historical heart on Capitoline Hill, declared that the United States and Italy 
share a bond of blood and spirit forged in the 50 years since the end of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "America and Italy are more than mere partners," Clinton said, standing in the 
Michelangelo-designed plaza where his political idol, John F. Kennedy, spoke to 
the citizens of Rome 31 years ago. "We are now -- and forever will be -- 
Alleati, amici, una famiglia " (Allies, friends, family). 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's European trip is chiefly dedicated to commemorating the liberation 
of Europe from Nazism and fascism and the 50th anniversary of the D-day 
landings of June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President is combining ceremonies of remembrance with substantive 
talks with Italian, British and French leaders on current issues, from North 
Korea's nuclear ambitions to the civil war in the former Yugoslav federation to 
the surge of ultranationalist politics in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 He also used the occasion to conduct a private, 40-minute meeting with Pope 
John Paul II, their second encounter in less than a year. The pontiff, growing 
even more outspoken with the years, did not pull his punches on abortion with 
the young American President. 
</P>
<P>
 The secular and spiritual leaders made little effort to mask their fundamental 
dispute over abortion while seeking shared language on the central role of the 
family in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged "genuine disagreements" with the Pope on contraception 
and efforts to slow population growth in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President said he reassured John Paul II that, despite his and his 
wife's liberal views on abortion rights, his Administration does not endorse 
abortion as a means of contraception or population control. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and the Vatican were also far apart on spin control. While 
Clinton said he and the Pope spent the bulk of their time discussing problems 
in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, the Vatican, in a statement, said 
that "the most important part of the meeting" was dedicated to the subject of 
the "defense and promotion of life" -- the Roman Catholic Church's code words 
for its unwavering opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this regard," the Vatican statement said, "the Holy Father made an appeal 
to the responsibility of a great nation such as America, whose origin and 
historical development has always promoted ethical values that are basic to 
every culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope also upbraided Clinton on abortion at their first meeting, in Denver 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the Pope and viewing the newly restored frescoes of the Sistine 
Chapel, Clinton met with American seminarians at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the seminarians that seeing the Pope was an "awe-inspiring experience" 
and praised their commitment to a life of faith and self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told the earnest theologians: "In all secular societies, it is 
recognized that very few people have the capacity to make a commitment of that 
depth and constancy. And yet, all of us know that, ultimately, the meaning of 
our lives depend upon the constant effort to achieve a level of integrity 
between what we feel and what we think and what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton's two-hour visit to the Holy See, the President and the new 
Italian prime minister, billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, met for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian leader reaffirmed his government's commitment to political and 
economic reform, despite the presence of five neo-fascist ministers in his 
25-member Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he would judge Berlusconi's conservative new government on its 
record and said he was confident that Italy will continue to hew to its 
democratic traditions. But he expressed concern about the appeal and spread of 
totalitarian sentiment, not just in Italy but throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "No country is immune to people who run making extremist statements trying to 
divide people, trying to, in effect, play on both the economic frustrations and 
the social and moral frustration that people feel in all countries where there 
is both economic stagnation and social disintegration," Clinton said in a news 
conference with Berlusconi at the Palazzo Chigi, seat of the Italian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "People everywhere yearn for a certain sense of order and discipline and 
hopefulness about the daily conditions of life," Clinton added. "And when those 
things are under stress, every political system will be vulnerable to people 
who try to play on fears and to divide people." 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that he was reassured by Berlusconi's promise that his 
government is unequivocally committed to democracy "from top to bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the media-magnate-turned-politician asserted that his right-wing 
government will not be polluted by fascism in any form and denied that Italians 
yearn for a return to its brown-shirted past under dictator Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you how my government stands, truly," Berlusconi said. "In Italy, 
there is no such thing as nostalgia for a period that we consider to be 
completely buried in the past and having been condemned by history." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior American official said Berlusconi had told Clinton that Italy under 
his government could be "your closest partner in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The new prime minister's assertion struck many as ironic because Berlusconi's 
economic platform is much closer to those of President Ronald Reagan and 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher than to Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide said the President had raised concerns about piracy of U.S. software 
and entertainment products, a widespread practice in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi responded that he is well aware of the problem, having been a major 
consumer of U.S. entertainment as a media executive.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began his official day with a visit to Italian President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, whose post is largely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Clinton visits the American cemetery at Nettuno, near the site of the 
disastrous Anzio landing of January, 1944, where thousands died after being 
hemmed in on the beach for almost four months. 
</P>
<P>
 He will pay homage to the war dead and speak about the struggle to extend the 
hard-won freedom of Western Europe to the struggling nations of the former 
Soviet Union.

COLUMN ONE; WHEN TWO CULTURES COLLIDE; AS SEOUL WEIGHS LIFTING AN IMPORT BAN ON 
JAPANESE FILMS, VIDEOS AND EVEN COMIC BOOKS, BITTERNESS LINGERS OVER 35 YEARS 
OF COLONIAL RULE. MANY SAY S. KOREA'S NATIONAL IDENTITY HAS ALREADY BEEN 
GUTTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask sixth-graders here about Japanese comic books, and their eyes light up. 
Slam Dunk, a macho basketball player, is hot, says one boy. So are Dragon Ball, 
a futuristic space warrior, and Dr. Slump, a mad scientist who designed the 
perfect robot girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese comics deliver the ultimate in thrills, chills and "interesting stuff 
with girls, like nakedness," he said. "We all like Japanese comics better, 
because Korean comics are too sissy." 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what worries Kwag Young Jin, a Ministry of Culture bureaucrat, 
and other officials. Bootleg Japanese comics may be runaway hits, they say, but 
the violence and sex rampant in them are twisting young Korean minds. Likewise, 
they predict, if samurai movies were freely shown, violence would increase as 
people imitate the slashing warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Korean officials tell it, all that stands between their refined Land 
of Morning Calm and a hellish descent into Japanese cultural vulgarity is an 
import ban on Japanese movies, music, videos and other forms of pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was adopted in 1945, after South Korea was freed from 35 years of 
Japan's repressive colonial rule. It remains the most prominent symbol of the 
lingering sense of han , or bitter resentment, that many Koreans still feel 
toward the Japanese. (Korean officials acknowledge the ban also protects their 
media markets from well-financed Japanese competitors.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the long-entrenched prohibitions may soon be lifted. Earlier this year, 
President Kim Young Sam broke the taboo and pushed Korea closer to 
reconciliation with its erstwhile enemy by declaring in a goodwill gesture that 
the ban should be ended. Saying it conflicts with global trends toward open 
markets, Kim ordered the Ministry of Culture to review how and when this should 
be done. The review is expected to be finished this month. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, however, is far more than whether Koreans will get to see samurai 
slasher flicks or Dragon Ball videos. The ban reflects what Kwag called the 
Korean people's "complex feelings of jealousy, contempt and hatred all mixed 
together" toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a lightning rod for centuries of accumulated grievances: Claims 
that Japan robbed Korea of cultural treasures in raids of priceless art and 
decimated its national identity by forcing Koreans to adopt Japanese customs, 
language and names during the colonial period. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, they say, Japan still refuses to acknowledge adequately 
its cultural debt to Korea. Scholars say that Koreans introduced everything 
from the tea ceremony and flower arranging to temple architecture and kabuki 
during waves of migration to Japan beginning in the 4th Century. Some even 
claim that Japan's indigenous religion, Shintoism, stemmed from Korea's 
shamanism and that the Imperial family originated from Korean aristocrats in 
Japan. (Most Japanese authorities reject that view.) 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop of bitterness, talk of Slam Dunk and Dr. Slump provokes 
withering looks. "The teacher was hurt by his student in a barbaric way," said 
Kwag. "Our pride was hurt. This feeling will not go away soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting it is flagrantly ignored, he added: "We don't think this import ban 
means much. But we need something to remind the Japanese that they need to 
frankly admit their acts and do something to comfort Koreans." 
</P>
<P>
 Such attitudes perplex many Japanese. Although they understand the emotion and 
feel a sense of guilt, many wonder what they can do about it today and why 
Koreans cling to hatreds half a century after the colonial period. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, a growing number of Japanese scholars are starting to 
acknowledge Korean influence on Japan's culture. However, many view Korea 
largely as a bridge through which Chinese culture passed to Japan. The tea 
ceremony, for instance, originated in China and was introduced by Korea to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese scholars still challenge claims that culture flowed to Japan. 
Korean archeologists recently unearthed ancient clay figures used in burial 
rites identical to those found in Japan, a find they say adds to evidence that 
Japanese tombs are heavily influenced by Korean traditions. Yet Inokuma 
Kanekatsu, head of the National Institute for Nara Cultural Heritage, said the 
discovery showed that "culture cultivated by the Japanese flowed back into the 
Korean peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 And Japanese authorities are impeding research into the roots of the imperial 
family by preventing the royal tombs from being opened to scholars. Since many 
tombs predate Japan's written history, which began in the 7th Century, they 
could provide priceless clues about Japan's murky origins and the assertion 
that early emperors were from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, after defeating Russia and China in wars over control of Korea at the 
turn of the century, colonized the nation from 1910 until its 1945 defeat in 
World War II. Officially, Japan and South Korea resolved most issues when they 
re-established diplomatic ties in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan compensated Korea for colonization and gave economic development aid, 
guaranteed certain rights for Korean residents in Japan and returned 1,326 
cultural properties such as pottery, temple paintings and statues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, they have signed other agreements, ranging from technology 
transfers to greater rights for the estimated 700,000 Koreans in Japan, many of 
whom were conscripted as laborers in the 1930s and '40s. But each time an issue 
is settled, Japanese officials say, new ones surface, such as Japan's use of 
Korean women as sex slaves during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Or old issues fail to fade away: Despite the 1965 treaty legally settling the 
matter, some Koreans are pushing for further surveys to determine just how many 
priceless ceramics and temple artworks were expropriated to Japan. Beginning 
with 13th-Century pirate raids, stretching to warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi's 1592 
invasion and later to colonial rule, tens of thousands of treasures were said 
to be taken, turning up in such places as Tenri University near Kyoto and the 
Museum of Oriental Art in Osaka, said Shin Yong Ha, a social sciences professor 
at Seoul National University. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent record-shattering sale of a 15th-Century Korean porcelain dish for 
$3 million at Christie's in New York deepened resentment. Only two similar 
dishes are known to exist -- and both are in museums in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the passage of time, the Korean sense of han still comes up at 
surprising times. Etsuo Miyoshi, a Shikoku island glove maker, decided to close 
his factory in Korea in 1989 because rising labor rates made it unprofitable. 
Korean labor activists protested at his Shikoku headquarters, coming by the 
busloads from nearby Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said: 'You occupied us for 35 years! This is a historical problem!' I 
couldn't say anything," Miyoshi recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials were likewise startled when then-Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa visited South Korea in 1992. He was told by then-President Roh Tae Woo 
that Japan was obliged to provide economic assistance because it was better off 
than Korea, which was having hard times. The meeting eventually resulted in the 
establishment of a joint foundation for scientific and technical cooperation, 
and a package to promote Korean exports in Japan. Still, Roh's logic was lost 
on many Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably a lot of Japanese couldn't understand this. Economic relations and 
private business are not like an older brother helping a younger brother," said 
a Japanese Foreign Ministry official. "If it's profitable, they'll do it. If 
it's not, they won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Katsuhiro Kuroda, dean of Japanese correspondents in Seoul as the Sankei 
Shimbun's bureau chief, said the resentment toward Japan may be a form of 
"self-confirmation" for Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps because Korea was constantly invaded from long ago, they can unite 
themselves" by harboring collective grudges against an external enemy, Kuroda 
said. "It is not necessary for we Japanese to get excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Koreans agree. Lee Jan Soo, a popular producer with the Seoul 
Broadcasting Station, is airing a 16-part series, "The Ghost Is Going," that 
examines what he argues is a basic lack of identity among Koreans. He asserts 
that a true national identity has not been allowed to bloom under the 
overwhelming influence of Chinese culture, which Korea absorbed as a vassal 
state until the late 19th Century, the Japanese colonization, and today's 
hybrid of Japanese and Western pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The series aims its barbs not only at the Japanese, but also at Koreans who 
slavishly imitate their ads, TV shows and fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not important to assert that Japanese culture is actually Korean 
culture," Lee said. "What we need to do is rediscover Korean identity." 
</P>
<P>
 He says Korean identity is so diluted that the first page of middle-school 
textbooks reads: "Contribute to the common prosperity of humankind." In 
Germany, the textbooks say: "Be a good German," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what, exactly, represents Korean culture, Lee falters. Maybe arirang , 
the traditional folk song, he muses. Or hanbok , the brightly colored 
traditional woman's dress. Yet Lee and others lament that such culture is not 
widely known outside Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be assertive," he said. That is precisely Kim's aim as he nudges 
his nation to lift the ban and put old grudges behind. Thanks to a generational 
shift, increasing economic ties and new political overtures between Kim and 
Japan's coalition government, a growing number of Koreans seem ready to mend 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 In a February poll by the Federation of Korean Arts and Culture, 4% said the 
culture ban should be retained, 48% said it should be lifted eventually and 15% 
said it should be abolished immediately. Ten years ago, officials say, the very 
mention of lifting the ban was taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans also are showing new attitudes on another hot issue: Whether to 
demolish the Japanese colonial headquarters in Seoul, as Kim has proposed, or 
preserve its historical and architectural legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three years ago, when a Korean architect protested the demolition on TV, 
he was bombarded with hate mail and phone calls. But in February, four of 
Korea's leading architects said the building should be preserved, both to 
memorialize the colonial experience and to protect the ornate, 
Renaissance-style architecture -- the best remaining example of it in Asia. 
Many Koreans seemed to agree: About 56% of those asked in 1992 by Korea Survey 
Gallup said it should not be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Masatoshi Muto, political counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, was 
in Korea 20 years ago, he said people could not tell their relatives they were 
studying Japanese and camouflaged their textbooks. Today, Japanese is the 
second fastest-growing foreign language in colleges, after Chinese; Japan's 
economic might is seen as the key reason. 
</P>
<P>
 At a major bookstore in downtown Seoul, clerk Hwang Pan Keun said demand for 
Japanese-language books is growing about 15% each year, especially on economics 
and Korea-Japan relations. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent customer was Lee Kyong Hwa, a graduate student in Japanese at 
Hanguk University. She said she took up Japanese because it was closer in 
structure to Korean than other Asian languages and would probably be easier to 
master. "It's absolutely accepted these days," she said, as she browsed through 
Japanese dictionaries. "I teach Japanese part-time, and the students are 
sincere and very enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 The study of Korean is also growing in popularity in Japan. As the ethnic boom 
proceeds apace, sparking more interest in Asian culture, promoters recently 
held the first Korean film festival, and Korean singers are mainstays on 
televised Japanese music shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel between the nations has boomed since the Roh administration liberalized 
foreign travel about five years ago. The number of Koreans going to Japan has 
increased from 158,000 in 1987 to 800,000 in 1993; Japanese going to Korea from 
708,000 in 1987 to 1.3 million in 1993, the Japanese government says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean government has also initiated more cultural exchanges through the 
Korea Foundation, offering fellowships and funding for Korean studies programs 
at Japanese universities. Last year, the Korea-Japan Forum brought together 
opinion leaders in both countries for the first time, modeled after the Shimoda 
Conference for U.S.-Japan experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million households pull down Japanese TV broadcasts 
via the NHK Network satellite -- largely without paying the requisite fees and 
sometimes illegally copying the programs for sale to local video stores. About 
10,000 young Korean women buy the Japanese fashion magazine Nonno, which is 
legally distributed in South Korea, according to SNU professor Shin. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Japan absorbed Chinese culture through Korea centuries ago, Koreans 
are absorbing Western culture through Japan today -- imitating everything from 
Japanized grunge fashions and torn jeans to henna-dyed hair. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the ubiquitous comic books. About 200 kinds command 70% of 
the market, most of them pirated. But even as sixth-graders snap them up, they 
do not forget their lessons in political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is a bad country," said Song Ju Hwan, a sixth-grader at Kwan Ak Primary 
School in Seoul. "They attacked Korea and beat Koreans in older days. I'm going 
to strike them back!" she added, with a rambunctious punch in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Korea-Japan ties continue to have their bad moments. One of the 
hottest best-sellers is "Japan Is Nothing," by Chon Yo Ok, a former Tokyo 
correspondent for the Korean Broadcasting System. The book castigates 
everything from Japan's cramped homes to its sexism and racism to its 
"infantile" culture. Judging from casual interviews, a fair number of Koreans 
have read it and shifted their image of Japan from bad to worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Underneath the economic might, there is a people whose history is dirty, 
whose culture infantile and who are discontented and twisted," Chon writes. 
"Koreans and Japanese may look alike, but they are a world apart." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in general, Muto and others say the long and uneasy relationship between 
the two peoples is on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Young Hee and Kim Duk Soo are two reasons why. Lee writes a widely read 
newspaper column and has written several books, all devoted to interpreting the 
Japanese collection of classic poems known as the Manyoshu using ancient 
Korean. Through her work, she has solved the riddle of previously unclear 
passages and uncovered the common roots of both peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 Her following is strong in Japan as well, where she enjoys a 2,000-member 
supporters group. She has received more than 5,000 letters expressing both 
surprise and appreciation for revealing the ancient Korean link to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim is a noted master of the traditional Korean drum. Founder of the Samulnori 
drum group, he was an early influence on Japan's world-famous taiko group, 
Kodo, and travels to Japan each year to share and teach his music at a training 
camp in the mountains of Nagano prefecture. 
</P>
<P>
 More than government decrees or official forums, it is through the deep 
rhythms of a common musical heritage that Koreans and Japanese can heal the 
lingering han and, at long last, make peace, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are singing our songs, no one knows whether the origin is Korean or 
Japanese," Kim said. "What is certain is that the rhythms and feelings between 
us are exactly the same."

BLOOMINGDALE'S MAKES PLANS FOR 4 STORES IN SOUTHLAND; BUSINESS: DEPARTMENT 
STORE CHAIN IS SHOPPING FOR SITES, CHAIRMAN SAYS. MOVE COULD REVITALIZE AREA'S 
RETAILING SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bloomingdale's, the ritzy New York retailer known for its extravagant store 
displays and pricey merchandise, has announced plans to open four stores in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. The move could inject a new spark into the 
region's moribund retailing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-store chain is shopping for sites from the Westside to the San Fernando 
Valley and Orange County. The first California store could open by spring, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that California is back," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the 
Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "Retailers are in a frenzy to 
get in here and lock up the best locations. This is a sign that the Southern 
California economy is no longer at rock bottom -- it's beginning to rebound. 
Orange County has boomed back to life this year, and there are signs of life in 
Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, said: "This is great. We hope 
it's another signal of the ever-improving California business climate. . . . 
This should serve as a small but notable example that California is still 
attracting business." 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the famed East Coast retailer, owned by Cincinnati-based 
Federated Department Stores, is sure to intensify competition locally, analysts 
say. It could also revitalize a retailing segment that was among the hardest 
hit industries during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Buffums went out of business, Bullock's closed stores and the 
Robinson's and May Co. stores were combined into a single chain. The closures 
left numerous malls scrambling to find creative ways to fill the empty shells 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, discounters such as Price Club, Wal-Mart and Ikea have taken root 
in so-called "power centers" across the country and pulled away many regular 
department store customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional retailers have learned their lesson, analysts said. "Department 
stores are beginning to adapt themselves to a more value-conscious consumer," 
said Kurt Barnard, publisher of a New York-based retailing newsletter. 
"Department stores are beginning to climb down the ladder and make themselves 
more accessible and more affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's, under the leadership of Chairman Michael Gould, is among those 
chains making changes to lure back customers from the discounters. For 
instance, it now offers more private-label apparel, which has the look and feel 
of designer clothes at a fraction of the price, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth of department stores could also mean the blossoming of regional 
malls, which were battered in the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gould said he expects his chain will build new locations rather than 
take over existing sites, its presence could pump life into malls that have 
lost anchor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Some malls just left their closed stores empty, dressing up the fronts with 
stages for community plays or simply boarding them over.  
</P>
<P>
 Gould said Bloomingdale's has been negotiating with mall owners, including 
those at the rival Fashion Island Newport Beach and South Coast Plaza malls. 
Sites are also being scouted on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, 
though Gould would not identify specific locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mall that gets a Bloomingdale's will get a big lift," Kyser said. "The 
question is: How well will Bloomie's adapt to Southern California? Bloomie's 
built its reputation on being ultra-New York. However, I expect Bloomingdale's 
to turn up the competitive pressure on more upscale retailers in the area -- 
chains like Nordstrom, I. Magnin, Saks and Barney's." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordstrom officials, however, said they would welcome Bloomingdale's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Competition makes everyone better," said Pete Nordstrom, a regional manager 
in greater Orange County and a great-grandson of the chain's founder. He said a 
Nordstrom store is situated in the same mall as Bloomingdale's in Minneapolis, 
and both stores have thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's glamorous reputation is derived largely from its flagship store 
on 59th Street in New York City. Upscale shoppers consider the store to be a 
place "to see and be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers cutting-edge fashion presented with elaborate displays using 
spotlights and other glitzy adornments, prompting some to dub it retailing's 
"Greatest Show on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's is credited with a number of modern retailing innovations. It 
helped turn fashion designers such as Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin 
Klein into celebrities by dividing its sales floor into boutiques that feature 
their products.  
</P>
<P>
 The retailer is also known for exclusive offerings. In its "Only at 
Bloomingdale's" collection, the company offers certain clothing and goods for 
the home that no other U.S. retailer sells. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been considered a glamour icon of retailing, Bloomingdale's 
also developed a reputation for curt and inattentive service -- a reputation it 
has been trying to change with improved customer attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's managers say they are also tailoring their stores to suit the 
tastes and shopping habits of shoppers in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bloomingdale's Southland competition will include Bullock's and I. 
Magnin -- two chains that Federated formerly owned and subsequently sold to New 
York-based R.H. Macy & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould said in an interview that he believes his chain can find its place in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Southern California lends itself to our business," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though its western-most store is in Minneapolis, Bloomingdale's has seen 
steady catalogue sales from this region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the number of customers shopping with us in California, and it's 
about time we came out and took care of them," Gould said. He added that he is 
not put off by the lackluster Southland economy. "We want to have a beachhead. 
. . . There is a big opportunity."

SAFETY INQUIRY BEGINS ON SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday opened its inquiry into the 
safety of saline breast implants, provoking the same intensely emotional debate 
that surrounded the agency's decision two years ago to sharply curtail the 
availability of silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing, sponsored by the FDA, was called to hear views about when 
manufacturers should be required to submit safety data to the agency. But it 
quickly turned into a public opinion forum on the implants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm alive and happy with my body again," said breast cancer patient Susan 
Yuriditsky of Washington. "I'm happy saline implants were available to me at my 
time of need." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Spieker, a Florida woman who has suffered life-threatening infections 
she is convinced were caused by implants she received for cosmetic 
augmentation, implored: "Women can live without saline implants." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over silicone implants, which ultimately resulted in their 
virtual removal from the market, pitted women against women over the freedom of 
choice to use the implants and raised soul-searching questions about the values 
of a society so conscious of women's breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of those who undergo implant surgery do so for cosmetic reasons. The 
remaining 20% seeks implants for reconstruction, usually after breast cancer 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Saline implants, which are the only breast implants still widely available, 
generally are considered safer than silicone, although their long-term safety 
has not been established. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how many women have saline implants, although one manufacturer 
said that his company has sold enough implants for about 1,500 women a month. A 
second firm estimated it had sold implants for about 125,000 women since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Saline implants, which are filled with salt water, can leak or rupture, 
requiring further surgery to remove or replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other known risks include infection, capsular contracture -- which is the 
hardening of scar tissue around an implant -- interference with mammography, 
and altered breast sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the two companies that manufacture saline implants, McGhan 
Medical Corp. and Mentor Corp., both of Santa Barbara, said that they have 
safety studies under way but do not expect results for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on preliminary data, however, they said the saline implants could 
continue to be used safely and urged that they remain available. 
</P>
<P>
 McGhan said that results from its first two years of research show only 3% of 
the nearly 500 patients studied had experienced capsular contracture, 2% had 
suffered deflation of the device, 0.2% had developed infections and less than 
1% had developed breast disease or immune system disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The early results indicate that "there would be no immediate health concerns 
associated with continued marketing," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Implants have been on the market for more than three decades but escaped 
strict regulation until recent years because they were introduced before 
passage of legislation in 1976 that gave the FDA authority to regulate medical 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other devices grandfathered under that law, implants were allowed to 
remain in use with the understanding that the agency would later require 
manufacturers to submit evidence of product safety and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women had blamed silicone implants for connective tissue diseases and 
other immune system disorders, although the association has not yet been proven 
scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, the FDA banned almost all cosmetic uses of the silicone 
implants -- except for specific and closely monitored research purposes -- and 
restricted their use to breast cancer patients and those with other valid 
medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all women who receive silicone gel implants, including for the purposes 
of reconstruction, must agree to participate in an overall research program to 
evaluate their long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, the FDA announced that it would require manufacturers of 
saline implants to begin the process of proving their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is expected to call for data later this year. It will then be 
evaluated, probably by an advisory committee of outside experts who will 
recommend whether to allow the implants to remain on the market, or what 
restrictions -- if any -- should be placed on them. The process could take a 
year or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women should be allowed to make their own choices based on the information 
available," said Cindy K. Wofford, a Texas woman who underwent reconstruction 
after breast cancer surgery. "My feelings of self-confidence in my body have 
been restored." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spieker, the Florida woman, said that the implants totally disabled her. 
She attributed her health problems to a faulty valve design that caused 
contamination with a fungus that spread throughout her body. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she suffered severe pain, chronic fatigue, memory loss so severe 
that "it took me three hours to get dressed in the morning because I could not 
put the right clothes together," allergies to all drugs, and other chronic 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 She was at the hearing, she said, because she felt the panel needed to know 
"how difficult it is to live my life."

U.S. TO PRESS U.N. FOR SANCTIONS ON N. KOREA; DIPLOMACY: ATOMIC AGENCY SAYS IT 
CANNOT DETERMINE IF REACTOR FUEL WAS DIVERTED IN 1989 FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The International Atomic Energy Agency declared on Thursday that its ability 
to tell whether North Korea diverted reactor fuel to make nuclear weapons in 
1989 has been "seriously eroded," and President Clinton said the United States 
would press the United Nations to enact sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President is traveling in Europe, special U.S. negotiator Robert L. 
Gallucci is scheduled to meet with South Korean and Japanese envoys today and 
Saturday to hammer out a proposal on sanctions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were fresh indications the effort to punish Pyongang may prove 
difficult. Both China and Russia repeated Thursday that, despite North Korea's 
actions, they are not yet prepared to support a resolution imposing economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's decision ends 15 months of maneuvering between the U.N.-affiliated 
atomic energy agency and North Korea. Pyongyang initially invited the agency's 
inspectors to its Yongbyon reactor, then barred them entirely and finally 
allowed them access only to part of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, while the inspectors have confirmed that North Korea is not now 
diverting spent fuel rods to make nuclear weapons, they have been unable to say 
whether it did so during an earlier reactor shutdown in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue is important because U.S. intelligence agencies suspect that North 
Korea may have used the spent fuel to build one -- or possibly two -- nuclear 
weapons. If North Korea does have a nuclear bomb, it could threaten Japan and 
the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, North Korea has warned repeatedly that it would regard the 
imposition of sanctions as an act of war, raising fears in some quarters that 
the North might initiate military action against South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military authorities said Thursday that they have not put American forces 
in the region on alert, partly to avoid any actions that might be deemed 
provocative. But the Pentagon is considering scaling back a fleet exercise to 
leave ships available in case of hostilities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere at the United Nations was increasingly tense. The Security 
Council is expected to meet informally to discuss the issue as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats cautioned that the 15-nation body likely will not get around to 
firm action until late next week after members reach agreement on a measure 
that can be passed by a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear just how much the continuing reluctance of China 
and Russia to go along with sanctions would hurt the American effort in the 
United Nations. Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin told reporters in Moscow 
that imposing sanctions now would be premature. But he warned that "if North 
Korea takes a stubborn stance," eventually "we will be forced, step by step . . 
, to resort to international sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, Chinese spokesman Shen Guofang took a similar tack, warning that 
resorting to sanctions now "might sharpen the confrontation." But neither 
Russia nor China indicated whether they would veto a Security Council 
resolution imposing sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior American official traveling with Clinton in Rome said the President 
was trying to arrange a telephone conversation with Yeltsin to discuss the 
issue. The official also conceded that Washington is uncertain how quickly or 
how forcefully it could get the Security Council to act. That "will depend on 
the nature of discussions that we're engaged in," he said. "We simply will have 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The job facing the international inspectors has been complex. The standard 
method by which the agency's experts tell whether a country is diverting spent 
nuclear fuel for weapons is to test fuel rods in a reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling whether spent fuel had been diverted in previous years -- such as in 
1989, when analysts believe North Korea may have begun making a bomb -- is more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, the inspectors must measure how fuel rods in various parts of the 
reactor have been used up. 
</P>
<P>
 The task was complicated substantially a few weeks ago when Pyongyang 
announced to the West's surprise that it would begin shutting down its reactor 
immediately and start removing the spent fuel rods well ahead of schedule -- 
much faster than the atomic energy agency had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea removed the rods at such a rapid pace that the inspectors were 
unable to determine if any of the spent fuel had been diverted during the 1989 
shutdown -- leaving the West still uncertain whether Pyongyang has a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Blix, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a 
letter Thursday that the agency still might be able to find clues to what North 
Korea did in 1989 by testing materials at two remote waste sites. But Pyongyang 
refused inspectors access to those areas 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Blix said, the ability of the Vienna-based agency to measure the 
fuel rods in accordance with international standards -- and to verify the 
accuracy of North Korea's claim that it does not have nuclear weapons -- has 
been "seriously eroded" and essentially has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Blix is expected to travel to New York to confer with U.N. officials as early 
as today. But officials said that the agency's board of governors is scheduled 
to meet in Vienna on Monday and he may delay the trip until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration lost no time in beginning its push for sanctions. 
Senior officials were busy contacting their counterparts in Britain, France, 
China and Russia -- the other permanent Security Council members -- to discuss 
the timing of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hoped to work simultaneously with South Korea and Japan this 
weekend and to discuss the issue with America's major European allies while 
Clinton is overseas. Officials said that debate in the Security Council on the 
issue could come on Monday.

Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report.

ISRAEL ATTACKS GUERRILLA BASE; DOZENS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli warplanes and helicopter gunships attacked a training base of 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas near the Lebanese town of Baalbek early 
Thursday, killing as many as 50 and wounding 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking at 2 a.m., as the estimated 400 guerrillas slept in tents on a rocky 
hillside, 10 Israeli fighter-bombers rocketed the base in waves and followed 
with intensive cannon fire, according to Lebanese officials. Six helicopters 
then raked the exposed camp with more rocket fire and strafed it with machine 
guns for nearly 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez, putting the death toll at 45, called 
the attack "a massacre" and "naked aggression against Lebanon's sovereignty and 
security and a big challenge to the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah declared that its revenge would be "swift and merciless." 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 hours later, the first of three barrages of Katyusha rockets -- 25 in 
all -- fell in Israel's western Galilee region, landing mostly in farm fields 
and causing no casualties and little damage. Hezbollah also rocketed Israel's 
self-declared "security zone" in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mordechai Gur, Israeli deputy defense minister, quickly warned that 
Israeli forces would respond "seven-fold" against Hezbollah if its rocket 
attacks upon Israel continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we won't put up with," Gur declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating intensified clashes, Israeli forces increased their firepower in 
southern Lebanon early Wednesday, 24 hours before the raid on Baalbek, by 
bringing four heavy, long-range artillery guns north across the border into 
Lebanon, according to U.N. sources. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first rockets fell near the northern Israeli town of Nahariya early 
Thursday afternoon, residents in the region were ordered into bomb shelters and 
fortified "security rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin described the Baalbek attack as part of "an 
ongoing war" between Israel, Hezbollah and other Islamic fundamentalist groups 
opposed to Israel's agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on 
Palestinian self-government and to other efforts to achieve Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we have an opportunity to hit terrorist organizations such as 
Hezbollah without causing civilian casualties, we will do it," Rabin said. "We 
have always done so, and we will continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel had acted in self-defense in hitting the Hezbollah base, Gur said, 
because the guerrillas had "all participated in operations or were about to 
take part in operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, Israeli chief of staff, said Israel had acted on 
extensive information on the Hezbollah training session from aerial 
reconnaissance and other "very precise intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Cabinet approved the operation at special session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attack brought warnings that the unrelenting confrontation between 
Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon could endanger efforts to negotiate peace 
agreements throughout the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said 
he was concerned by "the escalation of violence at a sensitive time in the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was one of Israel's most successful against Hezbollah and the 
fiercest since its weeklong bombardment of southern Lebanon in July -- a 
demonstration of Rabin's determination to ensure not only Israeli security in 
the face of Hezbollah attacks but to protect the peace process from a backlash 
among Israelis concerned about weakness on the part of Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also reflected Rabin's loss of faith in Syria -- the dominant power 
in Lebanon -- as a partner in the Middle East peace process. Rabin said earlier 
this week that he saw no chance of an early breakthrough in Israel's talks with 
Syria despite U.S. mediation in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be seen as a signal to the Syrians: You aren't doing anything 
against Hezbollah, about the (Israeli) MIAs, so don't expect us to make any 
concessions to you," said Yossi Olmert, a leading Israeli specialist on Syria 
and Lebanon. "What you didn't do, we'll do -- regardless of your 
sensitivities." 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah enjoys Syrian protection in Lebanon, as well as Iranian patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 The base hit Thursday is in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, about seven miles from the 
Syrian border and 44 miles east of Beirut. With 40,000 troops in Lebanon, Syria 
is the dominant political and military power in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel halted its onslaught in July only after Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher had secured Syrian pledges that Hezbollah would not attack Israeli 
communities from southern Lebanon.

<P>
 The Israeli bombardment last summer killed about 150 people, mostly Lebanese 
civilians, and drove several hundred thousand people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Baalbek attack, Olmert suggested that Israel has moved to a 
preemptive rather a retaliatory approach to Hezbollah, which likes to describe 
itself as waging the Arabs' only sustained armed confrontation with the Jewish 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't know what's going to come next -- they should be nervous," Olmert 
said. "It creates uncertainty, and that is always good for Israel. . . . This 
was a serious blow, but not a crippling one." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beirut, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi summoned the country's Supreme 
Defense Council, which includes the nation's top defense and political 
officials, to an emergency meeting. Lebanon decided to file a complaint with 
the U.N. Security Council over the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact toll was uncertain, even at nightfall. Hezbollah said 31 of its 
guerrillas had been killed, Radio Lebanon reported 45, quoting Bouez and other 
government officials, and Israeli sources said initial assessments and 
intelligence reports put the likely death toll at more than 50. Rescue workers 
reported that Iranians, presumably members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, 
were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid was Israel's second attack on Muslim guerrillas in the Bekaa Valley 
in two weeks. Helicopter-borne commandos abducted Mustafa Dirani, leader of the 
small pro-Iranian faction Faithful Resistance, pulling him from his bed before 
dawn May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said it hopes to get information from Dirani on Capt. Ron Arad, an 
Israeli air force navigator whose plane was shot down over southern Lebanon in 
1986. Arad was captured by Dirani's followers but was later handed over to 
Iran. His whereabouts are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dirani raid, which greatly embarrassed Syria and Lebanon, Hezbollah 
vowed revenge and said the combat zone would now be expanded beyond southern 
Lebanon.

3 GIRLS DIE AFTER 15-YEAR-OLD DRIVER CRASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On almost any Wednesday night for the past two years, JoKema Du Bois, 15, and 
her 14-year-old sister, Barbara, would either call their pastor for a ride, or 
get their grandmother to drop them off for youth night at a local church. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were too young to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, JoKema hopped in the driver's seat of her grandma's 
gold-colored 1986 Chrysler LeBaron anyway. Piling in behind her were Barbara 
and several friends, Gena Watkinson, 15; Alicia Acevedo, 14, and 3 1/2-year-old 
Jesica Noell, who lived with a boarder in the Du Bois home. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone put seat belts around Jesica in the back seat, but she was not 
restrained in a child safety seat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said it was the first time JoKema had taken the car. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, after the girls had listened to a sermon on eternal life, 
police said JoKema lost control of the car, sideswiped a pickup truck, and then 
slammed head-on into a second truck. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the night, JoKema and Gena were dead, and Barbara and Alicia 
were hospitalized in critical condition. Jesica died Thursday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Three other people in the vehicles they hit were not seriously injured, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Barbara lay in the pediatric intensive care unit at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center with numerous broken bones and a punctured lung, while 
Alicia was in another room with a broken leg and a head injury. Friends and 
families of the two prayed and waited in the hospital waiting room, anxious for 
updates. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Du Bois, the 21-year-old sister of JoKema and Barbara, described JoKema 
as a good-natured kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just snuck out to go to church," she said. "She was a normal kid. I mean 
what kid doesn't tell a fib or so. But they don't usually snag the car." 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema, a freshman cheerleader at Canyon High School, loved to hang out at the 
Valencia Towne Center and had a close relationship with her sister, Barbara, 
relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two insisted on sharing a bedroom even though their grandmother's Canyon 
Country house had a spare room. They shared makeup and clothes and slept in a 
black leather-covered water bed. Pictures of black, red and white roses were on 
the walls. Until this year, the two had season passes to Magic Mountain, where 
they spent much of their summer days, relatives said. They had matching hearts 
tattooed between the thumb and forefinger. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema's driving experience was limited to practice runs on dirt roads at her 
grandfather's 90-acre ranch in Acton. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were raised by Mary McWilliams, their grandmother, whom they called 
"Momma," relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gena Watkinson, also a freshman at Canyon High School, was a member of the 
school's junior varsity swim team, a member of the school and church choir, and 
an avid horse lover, said her grandmother and guardian, Sandra Watkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old won numerous medals and ribbons in horse jumping and other 
riding competitions, her grandmother said. She also wrote poetry using a 
special technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took the title and used each letter as the first (in each line of the 
poem)," Sandra Watkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students at Canyon High School who knew the girls expressed sadness 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just really shocking," said Dan Hart, 16, a junior who said he was a 
friend of JoKema's and knew the other three teen-age girls in the car. "I can't 
imagine seeing a person one day and the next . . . they're in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Allmandinger, the school's principal, said Canyon High teachers and 
faculty had been victim to a string of tragedies over the past several years, 
including an assistant football coach who was paralyzed in a traffic accident, 
and a student who died after he fell off the bed of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a number of things that have gone wrong," he said. "It's hard 
on kids, it's hard on a school." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, JoKema's grandmother, Mary McWilliams, said she did not know the 
girls had taken her car until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gena's grandmother called me and she said Gena was riding home with JoKema," 
McWilliams said. "I said 'What?' Then I looked down for my keys, and when I 
noticed they were missing I hung up."  
</P>
<P>
 Both families got into cars to look for the girls, but couldn't find them at 
either the Taco Bell or the Jack-In-The-Box, McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said the accident occurred about 8:30 p.m., after the 
girls had attended an IMPACT meeting -- an hourlong sermon and social gathering 
designed for teen-agers at Canyon Country First Assembly Church of God. Each 
Wednesday night, the girls took Jesica while the little girl's mother, Jamie 
Noell, 27, stayed at the house with McWilliams, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema and Barbara had been going to the meetings for two years, while Gena 
had gone for about three years, said the church's youth pastor, Ralph Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan said while the meetings were designed for youths at-risk, both JoKema 
and Gena came from supportive households headed by grandparents. On Wednesday 
night, he said he did not notice anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came like they always do," Millikan said. "I didn't even think to ask 
how they had gotten there." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, about 9:15 p.m., the girls headed home. On a straight 
stretch of Seco Canyon Road near Santa Clarita Park, JoKema lost control of the 
car, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputy Mark Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema was pronounced dead at the scene. Gena died two hours later at Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharron Eineke, a Saugus resident, said she was driving her Mazda pickup west 
on Seco Canyon Road when she noticed JoKema's brown Chrysler swerving between 
two lanes. Eineke said the car suddenly crossed the center divider and she 
could do nothing to avoid a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just came right straight across in front of me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrysler struck Eineke's truck in the left lane and then collided with a 
Toyota Landcruiser in the right lane, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eineke said she was "shaky," but suffered no major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who knew them, the deaths have not yet sunk in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too unreal," said Anna Du Bois. "I don't know what I'm going to do when 
I walk in their bedroom."

COURT TO REVIEW BOY SCOUT BAN ON GAYS, ATHEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court granted review Thursday of cases brought by Anaheim 
Hills twin brothers and by a former Eagle Scout that will decide whether the 
Boy Scouts can exclude gays and atheists. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite adding the two cases to its docket, however, the court may not 
actually decide them. The justices suspended further action on the cases until 
they rule on another pending case, about whether a private country club is 
covered by California's anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The court took the country club case in March, 1993, but hasn't yet scheduled 
a hearing. After that case is decided, the court may take up the Boy Scout 
cases; but if it follows its usual practice, the court will instead tell lower 
courts to reconsider the question of whether the Scouts are covered by the same 
law and, if so, whether they have a constitutional right to discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, 12-year-old twins Michael and William Randall can remain Cub 
Scouts in Anaheim Hills, where the Scouts sought to exclude them because they 
do not believe in God. And Timothy Curran, a former Eagle Scout, is editing 
film documentaries in Washington, 13 years after a Scout council in Contra 
Costa County rejected his application to be an assistant Scoutmaster because he 
is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Randalls' lawsuit, filed by their attorney father, James G. Randall, in 
1991, argued that the brothers' First Amendment rights were violated when they 
were ousted from the Scouts for refusing to swear an oath to God. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard O. Frazee Sr. ruled that 
the boys could remain in the Scouts. Earlier this year the 4th District Court 
of Appeal in Santa Ana upheld the verdict 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The supreme courts of Oregon and Connecticut have ruled that the Boy Scouts 
are exempt from anti-discrimination laws in their states. But American Civil 
Liberties Union lawyer Jon Davidson said California's 1959 civil rights law, 
the Unruh Act, is broader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unruh Act forbids discrimination by "business establishments" in a wide 
range of categories, including religion and sexual orientation. The state 
Supreme Court has interpreted the law broadly in the past, applying it to a 
Boys Club in 1985, but the current conservative majority has shown signs of a 
narrower view.

LEAST TERN RESERVE TAKES A SERIOUS TURN FOR THE WORSE; WILDLIFE: NESTING 
GROUNDS IN THE BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY FOX AND HAWK 
PREDATION. A BIOLOGIST FEARS THAT THE POPULATION WILL BE SO DEPLETED THAT THERE 
WILL BE NO CHICKS TO RETURN NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A red fox and a sparrow hawk have raided more than two-thirds of the nests of 
least terns at the Bolsa Chica wetlands, jeopardizing the colony of the 
endangered species at the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecological reserve is home to about 10% of the state's population of the 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem began last month when a red fox attacked 60 of the bird colony's 
90 nests, wiping out about two-thirds of its eggs. Troy Kelly, a California 
Department of Fish and Game biologist, said it was the most devastating attack 
by a predator since the breeding area was established in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Kelly said, a marauding American kestrel -- commonly known as 
a sparrow hawk -- has carted off more than a dozen of the terns' surviving 
chicks, raising concerns about the colony's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a potential of losing the entire nesting effort for this year at 
Bolsa Chica," Kelly said. If that happens, he said, the birds might never come 
back. "The situation is pretty critical," Kelly said. "I'm very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox attacks are not uncommon. A red fox preyed on the birds in Bolsa Chica two 
years ago, but the damage was not so extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the alarm was sounded early last month when a volunteer visiting a 
half-acre breeding island noticed the destroyed tern nests. 
</P>
<P>
 A small bird with a black cap and yellow bill, the California least tern 
numbers about 2,000 mating pairs statewide and is on state and federal 
endangered species lists. It generally spends the winter in South America. 
About mid-April, Kelly said, the birds migrate north to various California 
locations, including Bolsa Chica, where they nest in the sand and lay eggs that 
hatch in late May or early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1978, the wetlands attracted an annual least tern population of only 
about 25 mating pairs. But a breeding island was built, complete with open 
stretches of sand and tile shelters for older chicks. Today, the area is 
visited annually by about 200 mating pairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly -- who oversees six wetlands areas in Southern California -- was at a 
meeting in Sacramento when he heard of the volunteer's discovery that a fox had 
raided nests. He rushed home, he said, and for three nights he slept in his car 
near the breeding grounds, armed with a spotlight and shotgun and hoping that 
the fox would return. Then, at an expense of about $5,000, the state hired a 
professional trapper who unsuccessfully stalked the animal for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was probably just passing through," Kelly said of the fox. "He could 
return." 
</P>
<P>
 That would spell major trouble, the biologist said. No more funds are 
available to hire another trapper. And with his staff thinned by budget cuts, 
all he can do is patrol the area regularly with shotgun at hand, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a patrol this week that the biologist encountered evidence of 
the second major threat to the area's least tern population: a foraging sparrow 
hawk preying on the tern's newly hatched chicks. Under normal circumstances, 
Kelly said, the birds could defend against such attacks by mobbing an intruder. 
With their numbers decreased, however, they are easily overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hawk worries me," Kelly said. "If I don't do something about it quickly, 
he could do more damage than the fox." 
</P>
<P>
 The biologist said he plans to spend the next several days waiting for the 
predator with his shotgun. "It's a constant battle," he said. "We don't like 
shooting birds, but you have to weigh the various factors, and right now the 
least tern weighs more heavily than the hawk."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; BROWN-GARAMENDI MEDIA WAR GROWS INCREASINGLY 
BITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The media war in the Democratic gubernatorial campaign grew increasingly 
bitter Thursday as John Garamendi's campaign denounced as false a Kathleen 
Brown ad accusing the insurance commissioner of possibly costing a woman her 
old-age pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In another new ad, Brown contends that Garamendi flip-flopped on the death 
penalty -- 18 years ago. Garamendi emphatically denied changing his views on 
the death penalty, and the Brown campaign had seemingly inconclusive support 
for the contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's television commercials this week -- her first direct response to 
Garamendi's underdog attacks -- were broadcast as the campaign headed into the 
final weekend before Tuesday's primary. Garamendi has tried to use Brown's 
personal opposition to the death penalty to leverage an upset for the 
Democratic nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, consistently the leader in opinion polls, has contended that her 
personal views are not relevant because she pledges to enforce the death 
penalty, if elected, just as rigorously as would Garamendi or Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown began running the pension ad to counter any Garamendi surge as the 
campaign closed. In the ad, 64-year-old Helen McGrath of Concord appears on the 
screen saying that after her husband died, she depended on payments from an 
Executive Life Insurance Co. policy to help her in her old age. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she adds, "Because of John Garamendi, I don't know that I'll see any of 
these payments in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Insurance Department said Thursday that McGrath already had 
received a $52,500 payment in October, 1991, and is guaranteed to get at least 
$231,900 of the original $270,000 she had banked on. She may ultimately get all 
$270,000 on basically the same schedule as first promised, department spokesman 
Bill Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" McGrath said to a reporter who relayed the news. "How wonderful, if 
true. I'll believe it when I see it. . . . It would be nice if they put it in 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schulz said McGrath and thousands of other policyholders who opted for a 
replacement annuity plan from the successor to Executive Life had signed 
documents acknowledging the proposed payments and schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she said in the TV ad that "I don't know if I'll see any of these 
payments in my lifetime" when she already had gotten $52,500, McGrath 
responded, "Fifty-two thousand -- big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, Brown's campaign press secretary, said, "She's talking about 
her future payments," although that was not clear in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 In his fourth month as insurance commissioner in 1991, Garamendi seized 
Executive Life on the grounds that it was sinking into insolvency under a heavy 
debt of junk bonds. Critics accused him of selling off Executive Life assets at 
bargain prices, but Garamendi said he had to act as he did under state law 
requiring him to protect policyholders' investments. He says that 92% of all 
policyholders eventually will recoup their full investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, Brown began running an ad that opens with an announcer's 
statement: "What John Garamendi doesn't want you to know -- Garamendi opposed 
the death penalty. Flip-flopped. Then said it couldn't solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi insisted that he never had opposed the death penalty in his public 
life, going back to his first run for the state Assembly in 1974. Every vote on 
the death penalty during his 16-year career in the Legislature was in support 
it, campaign manager Darry Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major sources of the Brown allegation were one paragraph from a story in 
the Stockton Record in 1974 and one paragraph from the same newspaper in 1976 
when he ran for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1974 article quoted Garamendi: "To say you are going to solve crime with 
the death penalty, an issue 2 years old, is not realistic. The death penalty is 
not an issue. Neither is marijuana. To say these are important issues is 
naive." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional, 
wiping out all pending death sentences. Garamendi voted to reinstate the death 
penalty when the issue came up in the Senate in 1977 and, after then-Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. -- Kathleen Brown's brother -- vetoed the bill, 
Garamendi voted to override the legislation, Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said all the reports stem from an erroneous reading of the 1974 
Stockton Record article. 
</P>
<P>
 To support their position, Brown campaign officials urged reporters to contact 
state Sen. Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), who managed Garamendi's 1974 Assembly 
race, and Doug Watts, who ran the campaign of the GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, who has been on less than friendly terms with Garamendi recently, 
said in a telephone interview that he could not recall Garamendi "speaking in 
opposition, or in support of the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, reached in New York City, said that "Garamendi was clearly against the 
death penalty. . . . Clearly one of our big issues that he never refuted at the 
time was that he was opposed to the death penalty. It was pretty classic 
bleeding-heart stuff for those days." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials said Garamendi also flip-flopped by saying the death 
penalty is needed to solve today's crime problems. They quoted a 1989 Garamendi 
statement made in response to a proposal by then-Gov. George Deukmejian to 
extend the death penalty to those who commit first-degree murder during 
drug-related crimes: "Does anybody for a minute believe the death penalty or a 
longer sentence is going to solve the problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said that one reason for her personal opposition to the death 
penalty is that she does not believe it deters violent crime.

DELTA SMELT DEATHS RAISE CONCERNS; ENVIRONMENT: SURGE IN MORTALITY AMONG 
ENDANGERED FISH INDICATES NEW SAFEGUARDS ARE NOT ADEQUATE, OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A sudden, dramatic rise in the mortality of the threatened delta smelt has 
sounded a new alarm about the biological degradation of the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay just a few months after a new plan was 
adopted to protect the tiny fish's fragile habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California 
Department of Fish and Game began to find that smelt were dying at up to five 
times the maximum daily mortality rate the species can survive. Listed as 
"threatened" under the Endangered Species Act, the finger-size fish is regarded 
as a barometer of the ecological health of the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a whole series of protective measures in place, but what we're seeing 
basically says those measures weren't enough, at least not in the kind of 
critically dry year we have had," said Bob Sweetnum, a biologist with the 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to 400 fish and plant species, the delta is one of the largest and 
richest estuaries on the continent and is also the source of most of the 
state's drinking water and irrigation supplies. The estuary is sustained by the 
brackish mixture of saltwater and freshwater. But as pumping from the 
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers has diverted fresh water for agriculture, 
industry and urban growth, excessive salt levels have degraded the estuary and 
reduced its levels of spawning fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has proposed a stringent set of rules to protect 
the delta by restoring an average of 540,000 acre-feet of water per year. 
Although that plan has not taken effect, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued 
an opinion in February regulating minimum freshwater flows into the delta and 
setting limits for the number of smelt that can be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pine, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service who worked on the 
opinion, said there had always been a concern that the prescribed freshwater 
flows would not be enough in an exceptionally dry year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to put together a biological opinion that would deal with the 
survival of the smelt and fulfill state and federal water contracts. But we 
couldn't come up with a formula for a critically dry year." 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit in February, arguing that 
the protections under the opinion were not adequate. On Thursday, David Behar, 
director of the Bay Institute, one of the groups that filed the suit, said that 
the recent mortality rates -- as high as 4,000 fish a day -- were proof that 
the level of protection was not sufficient. But Behar also said that state and 
federal officials violated the opinion by failing to reduce freshwater 
diversion when the number of dead fish began to exceed the maximum limits set 
by the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The smelt die when they are sucked into the pumps that divert the water. The 
smelt thrive in the delta's mixing zone where freshwater and saltwater meet. As 
pumping increases, that zone moves east toward the pumps and the smelt move 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Potter, chief deputy director of the California Department of Water 
Resources, said that pumping is 10% of what it was last week when the high fish 
kill was reported. He said the level would remain low for the next few days 
while officials try to come up with a solution. But he said there was no way 
the state could maintain those low levels for more than a few days and meet its 
obligations to water users. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter also held out the possibility that the high mortality rate reflected an 
usually high number of smelt. "It could mean that the biological opinion has 
provided enough flow to grow a zillion fish."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / GLENN F. BUNTING: THE SHARK-INFESTED WATERS OF 
RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pugnacious political commentator John McLaughlin first disclosed the juicy 
rumor to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another major scandal will erupt in the Congress soon, perhaps this coming 
week!" McLaughlin roared May 15 before signing off on his nationally syndicated 
television shout show. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, McLaughlin's tantalizing tidbit was recycled in Roll Call, the 
Capitol Hill tabloid that is a must-read for Washington insiders. The 
newspaper's front-page "Heard on the Hill" column revealed that the "big 
scandal" involved allegations of ghost voting by House members. 
</P>
<P>
 When no other news organization pounced on the bait, House Minority Whip Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.) tried to peddle the story. At a weekly breakfast gathering of 
Washington journalists, Gingrich predicted over greasy bacon and wet eggs that 
the forthcoming scandal would be "dramatically large" and "very serious." With 
an impish grin, the notorious Democrat-basher added that Minority Leader Bob 
Michel (R-Ill.) had asked him to keep quiet about the sordid details. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of Gingrich's prodding, all four major TV networks, the 
Associated Press, United Press International, the Washington Post and the Wall 
Street Journal were chasing a story that had "explosive" written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It came as little surprise that no hard facts were served up at the Gingrich 
breakfast. Top elected officials rarely name names when leaking stories to the 
press that contain less proof than a wine cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican staffers (speaking only on the condition of anonymity, of 
course) were all too happy to fill in the details: House leaders were looking 
at allegations that Democrat Maxine Waters of Los Angeles had cast votes 
electronically on the House floor for members of the Black Congressional Caucus 
while they were out of town.  
</P>
<P>
 The flood of press inquiries that followed prompted Michel's office to issue a 
statement denouncing the story within hours of the Gingrich breakfast. None of 
the ghost voting could be substantiated based on available evidence, Michel's 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the many salacious tales that circulate inside the Beltway, the 
ghost-voting scandal never materialized. But the hallway chatter and ensuing 
publicity created considerable Angst for two California lawmakers -- Waters and 
freshman Republican Richard Pombo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pombo, a rancher who represents the Central Valley town of Tracy, found 
himself in the uncomfortable position of explaining to African American 
community leaders in his rural district why he had finked on one of the 
nation's most prominent black elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in February when the Southern California earthquake relief package was 
before the House, Pombo observed Waters drop on the floor what appeared to be a 
number of cards used to access the electronic voting machines. To Pombo, it 
appeared that Waters may have voted not only for herself but for other members 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lawmakers routinely are permitted to vote by proxy without showing up 
at committee meetings, House rules strictly prohibit members from casting 
ballots for anyone else on the floor. "Nothing," the Ethics Committee opined, 
"is more sacred to the democratic process than each person casting his own 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 When Pombo privately shared the episode with his California Republican 
colleagues, some of them began to salivate over the possibility of tainting 
Waters, one of the most liberal members of Congress who regularly clashes with 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a group of some of the congressmen from Southern California who for 
partisan reasons wanted a scandal and wanted to fry Maxine Waters," said one 
Republican aide. "They wanted to pump it up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pombo's Republican colleagues took the case to their minority leader, Michel, 
who in turn notified Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.), who dutifully alerted Waters. 
Pombo was then summoned by Republican leaders and gave a statement to the House 
Ethics Committee staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, an outspoken legislator known for her combustible personality, reacted 
by angrily confronting Michel and Gingrich on the House floor. She told House 
Democratic leaders that she carries other invalid voting cards in her purse as 
souvenirs. When Pombo saw her, Waters said, she was searching for the valid 
card assigned to her for the current 103rd session of Congress. A subsequent 
review of computerized House voting records turned up no evidence of ghost 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters declined to be interviewed. "All we really know is that the Speaker and 
the minority leader have said the matter is over with," her spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident serves as a reminder that Republicans lurk in the shark-infested 
waters of Washington ready to attack a Democrat at the slightest opportunity. 
And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Such vindictiveness between political parties stifles the work of Congress, 
Pombo says. "This place is much more partisan than I ever dreamed it would be."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; BROWN ROLLS THROUGH STATE AND LOOKS TO 
NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Kathleen Brown's rolling campaign for governor Thursday, the death penalty 
competed for time with a make-believe rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown's senior adviser, Michael Reese, briefed reporters on her campaign 
bus about the candidate's new TV commercial, the candidate sat next to him, 
reading "Peekaboo Bunny" to her towheaded grandson Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign bus rides frequently allow candidates the luxury of living in their 
own sacrosanct environs, sheltered from the election's harsh realities, and no 
more so than Thursday. As the campaign commercial warfare between Brown and the 
other gubernatorial candidates escalated wildly, she spent a relatively 
leisurely day in meandering stops from San Diego to the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 For major portions of the day, the lushly appointed Brown bus doubled as a 
rolling photo opportunity for Brown and her grandchildren, Brandon and 
Katherine, the twins born two years ago to her elder daughter, Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the sorts of occasions that Brown -- the target of photographers 
when her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. was governor -- admits she used to 
decry -- until she became a candidate with photogenic offspring. It makes for 
good pictures, and occasionally jarring moments. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Brown asked her granddaughter's opinion on an issue that Gov. 
Pete Wilson has sought to press among California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I tough enough? Tough enough to be governor?" the candidate asked 
jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight-faced, Katherine answered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Take my bib off, please." 
</P>
<P>
 Four days before the primary election, Brown is fighting the general election 
against her presumed November opponent -- Wilson. One can tell by the territory 
-- she was traveling in areas that could go to either party in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And the grandchildren? They are part of the tableau, meant to personalize 
Brown to voters as much as their presence serves to relax a candidate in the 
last throes of the primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 From Brown's demeanor Thursday, one would hardly know that primary day was 
coming. She never so much as mentioned Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- 
who has launched a series of ads hitting Brown's stance on the death penalty -- 
until reporters asked about him. She left details of her response ads for her 
aides to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 At Riverside Community College's Moreno Valley campus, her sentiments were 
clear. "I believe I will do just fine on Tuesday," she said in her only 
reference to Election Day. "I can't wait to face one opponent -- Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 The bus tours are meant to call attention to the failings of Wilson's economic 
policies by highlighting struggling businesses and homeowners at risk of losing 
their jobs and their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the treasurer believes the road trips serve another purpose -- introducing 
California voters to her and her to California voters before November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't win this race just on TV," she said over a chicken salad at a coffee 
shop in Escondido. "I've got to get my voters out. . . . Traveling through the 
state helps me do that, and the primary offers the opportunity to do the dry 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the road provided her with a litany of the woes facing some 
Californians. There was the man in Chula Vista who had lost his job, and with 
it his insurance, as his wife lay in the hospital with heart problems. There 
was the woman in Moreno Valley whose husband lost his job and whose house is up 
for foreclosure on June 20. As Brown acknowledged, there is not a lot she can 
do about their difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the answers are not apparent, contact with rank-and-file voters 
plays to Brown's ability to connect with people, born of her political lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 At a fruit stand in Beaumont, where Brown and her entourage disembarked long 
enough to pick up fresh fruit and snacks, she stuck her hand out to all 
potential voters and surprised one woman by insisting that the two have a 
picture taken together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There you go," she said. "That'll be valuable some day, as my daddy would 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she asked the stand's owner, Francis Dowling, for his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever heard of my dad?" she asked. "Pretty good guy. My brother was too, in 
his way. Listen, I'm running for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of her self-professed joy at riding the bus, Brown seemed 
fully at ease Thursday, shedding her notorious caution to expound forcefully on 
several pending issues. 
</P>
<P>
 She told reporters aboard the bus that she favors the bill by Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) that would legalize domestic partnerships, and she said 
that she favors allowing local agencies to provide clean needles to drug 
addicts, which experts say could slow the pace of AIDS infection. 
</P>
<P>
 She also expressed concern that the so-called Save Our State initiative 
expected to be on the November ballot would be harshly divisive. The initiative 
would bar state services to illegal immigrants and require state agencies to 
report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so scared today," she said, ticking off immigration and crime as 
two issues that are nourished by fear. "People are so easily able to blame 
other people and find scapegoats in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she will campaign against the initiative in the fall. "I will 
address it and won't walk away from it," she said.

BODY OF MAN IN 1953 LSD TEST EXHUMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A forensic expert said the 40-year-old remains of a scientist who fell to his 
death days after he was given LSD in an CIA experiment were found in good 
condition when they were exhumed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Olson's family wanted his remains examined to try to determine whether 
he jumped from the 13th floor of a New York hotel on Nov. 28, 1953, or whether 
he was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's death was classified as a suicide, and the CIA said Thursday it had no 
reason to think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of CIA employees in the events leading up to his death was 
extensively investigated in the 1970s. The facts were made public at that time. 
President Gerald R. Ford made a formal apology on behalf of the federal 
government and a monetary settlement was awarded to the Olson family. The 
investigations indicated no reason whatsoever to suspect that homicide was 
involved," the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A government commission investigating the CIA indicated that the agency had 
experimented with LSD and other hallucinogens in the early 1950s and that a 
number of experiments were conducted on unwitting federal employees, including 
Olson, a civilian biochemist involved in biological warfare research at Ft. 
Detrick. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Eric clutched a photo of his father as a backhoe cleared the dirt 
covering the concrete vault at Linden Hills Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a pressing question for me all the time and the questions certainly 
were not laid to rest with the CIA story in 1975," the 49-year-old psychologist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffin was taken to the Hagerstown police station, where Olson's remains 
were removed and X-rayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remains are in exceedingly fine condition and that's attributable to the 
embalming done in New York and to the container," said James E. Starrs, 
professor of law and forensic sciences at George Washington University. "We 
have remains that are in mummified condition. We even have the opportunity to 
get fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic experts plan to analyze hair, brain tissue, fingernails and bones for 
injuries not attributable to the fall, Starrs said. They will look for toxins 
and drugs, including LSD and other hallucinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 The body is to be transported to York, Pa., where the skeleton will be 
examined by Dr. John S. Levisky, chairman of the behavioral science department 
at York College. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report is expected in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Olson and his brother, Nils, said they decided to have their father's 
body analyzed now because they were moving it to another cemetery where their 
mother and sister are buried.

'UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT' IS BLAMED FOR DRUG TEST DEATHS; MEDICINE: PANEL OF 
DOCTORS CLEARS RESEARCHERS WHO WERE STUDYING HEPATITIS TREATMENT. THE FINDINGS 
CONTRADICT AN EARLIER FEDERAL PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disagreeing with the findings of an earlier federal investigation, an advisory 
panel of private physicians appointed by the National Institutes of Health has 
labeled the deaths of five hepatitis patients using an experimental drug as "an 
unavoidable accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy, which has shaken the world of biomedical research, involved 
people with chronic hepatitis who had been taking a drug known as fialuridine, 
or FIAU, in a clinical research project sponsored by the NIH. The deaths of a 
third of the 15 patients who were on the drug in 1992 and 1993 occurred weeks 
after their last dosages, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the Food and Drug Administration, concluding a study of the 
tragedy, said scientists, physicians and drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. had failed 
to fully disclose the drug's potential risks or to take note of its ominous 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new study released Thursday by an NIH panel of outside experts found 
no fault with those who developed the drug or administered it to chronically 
ill patients who had volunteered for the research project.  
</P>
<P>
 David R. Challoner and David M. Kipnis, who headed the panel of seven 
physicians asked to determine what went wrong, said in a report to NIH Director 
Harold E. Varmus that the deaths resulted from "delayed drug toxicity" and 
could not have been foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subcommittee emphasizes that it could not see itself having concluded or 
acted differently from the investigative team or the patients, given the 
information available at each step," the report said. Challoner is vice 
president for health affairs at the University of Florida and Kipnis is a 
professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said, however, that U.S. scientists must do a better job of checking 
for drug toxicity by testing patients for six to nine months after they have 
taken certain experimental drugs. But it said that should not be done for all 
drug trials because of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Challoner said his panel's study has been forwarded to the FDA. Because that 
agency and the NIH are both divisions of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the department's assistant secretary for health will be asked 
ultimately to develop a federal position on the controversy. The drug in 
question no longer is being used, although research on it is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the conflicting conclusions, Challoner said, was a difference 
in approaches by FDA investigators and the NIH panelists. He said his panel 
focused on the quality of the clinical research project while the FDA found 
faults based on records kept by those who conducted the research. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipnis said the recent FDA report, for example, criticized some physicians for 
failing to report abdominal pains experienced by some people taking the new 
drug. But he said interviews by panel members found that the doctors conducting 
the study believed that "abdominal discomfort did not reach the degree of 
severity to be reported." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard F. Corlin, another panelist, said there was "no pattern of new 
symptoms" by most patients using the drug that was distinguishable from 
symptoms they were experiencing from hepatitis itself. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the panel also found, contrary to the FDA report, that "no patients 
felt any lack of attentiveness" by their physicians and that all patients were 
warned that their lives could be at risk if experimental drugs were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, the NIH's lead investigator of FIAU, was criticized by the 
FDA for alleged "significant violations" of federal regulations. But the 
panel's report defended him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Hoofnagle was enthusiastic about the possibility of developing an 
efficacious treatment for hepatitis B. However, his approach was careful," the 
panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, as a result of the failed drug trial, the FDA adopted new 
drug-testing regulations that were proposed by an internal review task force. 
The new rules require researchers to gather and report more data on potentially 
adverse effects of trial drugs and to assume that any medical problems in 
patients may be caused by the test drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Challoner said if researchers had suspected "delayed toxicity" from 
administering FIAU, they should have monitored patients for longer periods 
after the dosages stopped. "But there was no reason to suspect this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis B, which scientists hoped could be cured by FIAU, is regarded as a 
significant global problem. Caused by a virus, the ailment is believed to 
infect an estimated 300 million people worldwide -- 5% of the population -- 
primarily in Africa and Asia, particularly China. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, about 300,000 new cases of infection are reported each 
year, while 4,000 to 5,000 Americans die from the chronic effects of the 
infection -- cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer. Like AIDS, 
it is transmitted primarily through blood transfusions, sex and sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipnis said FIAU probably caused genetic damage to the sub-units of liver 
cells, causing the next generation of cells to die. This would explain why 
FIAU's side effects did not appear until long after patients took the drug, he 
said.

AFRICA; NEIGHBORS WATCHING PRETORIA WITH HIGH HOPES, HESITATION; THEY HAVE THE 
MOST TO GAIN -- AND LOSE -- FROM AN ECONOMY THAT COULD SWAMP THEIRS. THE THREAT 
OF A BRAIN DRAIN LOOMS.

<P>
 In the three weeks since President Nelson Mandela's inauguration, a host of 
international organizations has rushed to embrace South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's new flag flies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at the headquarters of 
the Organization of African Unity, once one of apartheid's bitterest enemies. 
On Wednesday, South Africa rejoined the British Commonwealth, more than three 
decades after it stormed out because of Commonwealth objections to its racist 
political system. And full re-integration into the United Nations is expected 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But as South Africa re-emerges onto the world stage, its immediate neighbors 
have the most to gain -- and to lose. They look on with a mixture of 
expectation and alarm after decades of mutual hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-apartheid bloc known as the Frontline States Organization formally 
welcomes its neighbor at a meeting in Zimbabwe today, which Mandela is 
attending. The group does so in the hope that South Africa's renewal will also 
be its own, but member countries fear being swamped by its much stronger 
economy. Already, the gravitational pull southward is draining some African 
nations of their best brains and threatening to divert international investment 
and aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pretoria, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director-general for Africa, Derek 
Auret, says one of Mandela's priorities in meeting with Frontline leaders will 
be to assess ways of establishing political and economic stability in southern 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Auret says South Africa's peaceful transfer of power to Mandela's African 
National Congress might encourage a settlement of the continuing civil war in 
Angola and provide a reassuring example to Mozambique before it holds 
multi-party elections in October. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to stability, he argues, will be ensuring that South Africa's 
expected economic growth spills over to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the best chance is in coming together around common economic 
objectives and achieving collective economic growth, which will lead to all the 
benefits that this government would like to see accrue to South Africans (and 
to) all southern Africans," Auret said. "South Africa cannot be an island of 
prosperity in a sea of poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pretoria is keen to discourage exaggerated expectations. "South Africa's 
potential is a long-term issue," Auret said, "and won't have any immediate 
spinoffs for the rest of the continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of South Africa's new leaders do feel a deep emotional debt to nations 
such as Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania because they helped hold the line against 
apartheid over the years. They also recognize that assisting their neighbors 
eventually will conflict with their own government's interests and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela needs rapid economic expansion if he is to provide jobs and housing to 
his constituents, yet South Africa's economy is already three times larger than 
the economies of the seven Frontline states combined. It exports five times as 
much to the continent as it imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists point out that further expansion will likely widen the financial 
gap between South Africa and its neighbors. Among the few African exports into 
South Africa today are professionals -- doctors from Ghana and Zaire, managers 
from Nigeria, teachers from Zimbabwe. While South Africa welcomes them, the 
other nations despair at the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 And domestic pressure is building on Mandela to stem the flow of unskilled 
migrant labor from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi and Lesotho -- a vital source 
of revenue for those nations. There are estimated to be at least 2 million 
illegal immigrants in South Africa holding jobs the ANC urgently needs to 
provide to its own citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Other African nations also fear Pretoria will garner a sizable chunk of what 
little foreign investment and Western aid the continent gets.

RUSSIA; ANALYST'S STUDY CASTS DOUBTS ON VOTE RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when President Boris N. Yeltsin thought it was safe . . . just when it 
looked like Russia's spasm-racked political system might finally be on the road 
to stability . . . along came Alexander Sobyanin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobyanin, a bespectacled physicist-turned-political scientist, does not look 
like the kind of man to shatter parliaments and constitutions with a single 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers he crunches pack such a charge that they threaten Russia's 
whole new political system by casting doubt on its foundation -- the Dec. 12 
balloting that approved the Russian Constitution and put the current Parliament 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 His computations indicate massive fraud in the critical vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "These figures are political dynamite," the respected daily Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Russian Duma, the lower house of Parliament, ordered its 
Credentials Commission to look into Sobyanin's allegations. The commission 
chairman brushed off a proposal for a two-week deadline on a commission report, 
but sooner or later the truth will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Sobyanin is right, it is a truth that nobody particularly wants to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when Sobyanin's group of Kremlin-appointed sociologists 
began to analyze the Dec. 12 results, using samples and mathematical principles 
to dissect overall results. His team has worked over results of every Russian 
election since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, charges of widespread cheating abounded after the election, 
mainly from Russia's Choice, the pro-Yeltsin party that gained only an 
embarrassing 15% of the vote compared to the whopping 23% that went to 
neo-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his party. 
</P>
<P>
 The falsification charges gained credence after local counters took more than 
two days to send their tallies to Moscow, with many results coming in much 
later. The longer the delay, election monitors know, the more chances for 
fiddling with the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 4, Sobyanin dropped his bombshell. Quoted in an Izvestia article, he 
alleged that about 9 million votes out of an electorate of 106 million had been 
falsified, apparently mainly by regional leaders intent on their own election. 
He identified three types of election fraud -- padded voter lists, 
ballot-stuffing after the fact and official coercion of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that the fraud had largely worked against reformers and in favor 
of Zhirinovsky and also the Communist Party. That calculation, with the 
prospect that it could be corrected and reformers given more seats, was sure to 
please Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But any pleasure was outweighed by horror at the flip side of Sobyanin's 
allegations -- that the faked ballots had so plumped up the total voter 
participation that it had passed the 50% mark needed to make the referendum on 
the constitution valid. In fact, Sobyanin believes, about 46% of the population 
voted -- which means the new charter never really passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian president had thrown every ounce of his political weight behind 
the constitution, touting it as the only way to avoid the kind of political 
bloodshed that Moscow suffered last fall when the fight between the president 
and Parliament climaxed in artillery fire at the White House, the old 
Parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's aides have responded to Sobyanin's charges with outrage and denial.  
</P>
<P>
 Sobyanin himself does not want to see the Constitution invalidated. He 
believes that if his fraud allegations are proven, Yeltsin can simply hold a 
nationwide public opinion poll asking people if they believe that the 
Constitution needs to be voted on once again, and the vast majority will 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Sobyanin believes, his findings are likely to end up as nothing 
more than a historical footnote because neither the reformers, who want the 
constitution to remain in force, nor opposition members, who would lose seats, 
believe a challenge to the election results to be in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, he hopes the ruckus over his findings will lead to a change in the 
slapdash laws that would allow such rampant abuse. Sobyanin's Score Card 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Sobyanin's group analyzed voting data using samples and mathematical 
principles to dissect overall results. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout: Official figure: 58 million Sobyanin's figure: 46 million 
</P>
<P>
 % of total population*: Official figure: 54.8 million Sobyanin's figure: 46.1 
million 
</P>
<P>
 Other Findings by Sobyanin Total falsified votes: 9 million 
</P>

of voters

 Hillary Rodham Clinton charmed Italians on Thursday, handing out candy to 
Roman children like the American troops who liberated the city 50 years ago and 
chatting with Sophia Loren over a glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady greeted a group of schoolchildren waving their arms and 
screaming out her name in the central Piazza Navona. 
</P>
<P>
 They cheered even louder when she began giving out chocolate candies -- whose 
box bore the American flag and husband Bill Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited when she gave me the chocolates," said Alessandro, a student 
at a local state school. "She told me her husband ate them too." 
</P>
<P>
 During a lunch at the U.S. ambassador's residence, Mrs. Clinton greeted a 
handful of the country's most prominent women, including actress Loren and 
Nobel Prize-winning scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini.

 A Canadian officer faces up to three years in prison for the death of a Somali 
teen-ager during the U.N. famine relief mission, military officials said in 
Ottawa. Maj. Anthony Seward, 40, is the highest-ranking soldier convicted on a 
charge of negligence of duty in the death of Shldane Abukar Arone on March 16, 
1993. Seward's superior, Lt. Col. Joseph Carol Mathieu, is also standing trial 
and entered a not-guilty plea in connection with Arone's death. The 16-year-old 
Arone was found beaten to death after allegedly being caught breaking into the 
Canadian compound at Belet Uen in Somalia.

 Twenty-nine people, including top Northern Ireland undercover police fighting 
the IRA, were killed when the helicopter flying them to a security conference 
crashed in thick fog on a remote Scottish headland. A spokesman for the Royal 
Air Force said there were no survivors after the twin-propeller Chinook crashed 
on a flight from Belfast to the conference at an army base in the Scottish city 
of Inverness. Police investigators discounted sabotage as the cause for the 
crash.

 The United Nations postponed Bosnian peace talks in Geneva after Serbs reneged 
on their promise to withdraw forces from around a Muslim enclave. The Bosnian 
Serbs promised more than a month ago to get their troops out of a 1.9-mile zone 
around the eastern town of Gorazde. U.N. observers say 150 to 200 armed Serbs 
are still there, having swapped military garb for police officer's uniforms. A 
U.N. envoy said negotiations will start only after a Serb withdrawal.

NORTH REVERSES SELF, SUPPORTS TRUCE IN YEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government in northern Yemen reversed its position Thursday and accepted a 
U.N. call for a truce in the month-old war against southern secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear what caused the government's change of heart about the U.N. 
resolution adopted Wednesday.Northern forces appeared to be overpowering the 
south, and the north had called international attempts to win a truce a 
"flagrant interference" in Yemen's internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the government's new position coincided with reports that 
northern troops had come within 10 miles of Aden, the stronghold of the 
southern secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal, conservative North Yemen and socialist South Yemen merged into a 
single state in May, 1990. The union was popular but beset by cultural and 
ideological differences and a power struggle between President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh, a northerner, and Vice President Ali Salim Bidh, a southerner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is ready to respond to the resolution in a positive spirit. 
This will lead to full implementation of the resolution by all concerned," the 
government in the northern capital, Sana, said in a statement read on Sana 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, backed by the southern forces, called for an immediate 
cease-fire, an arms embargo of the warring parties and the dispatch of a U.N. 
fact-finding mission to Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, northern forces fired a missile on Aden in their drive to 
capture the city and crush the southern secession. The missile exploded over 
Aden after southern forces shot at it, and there were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The north had rejected any suggestion of outside mediation, and before 
accepting the truce call, said it would only touch off further fighting. The 
south has called for the Arab League to oversee negotiations, but has not 
suggested a willingness to reunify.

 Eight American Airlines baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables 
from bags they handled at National Airport, FBI officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport police and the FBI installed hidden cameras in the baggage area and 
recorded numerous instances of the workers breaking into baggage. The workers 
would examine the contents and remove valuables such as video cameras, jewelry 
and laptop computers, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the airline suspected a problem, notified police and 
cooperated with investigators.

ROSTENKOWSKI TO FIGHT CASE WITH NEW LAWYER; LEGAL: CONGRESSMAN WILL REPLACE 
COUNSEL, WHO ALSO REPRESENTS THE PRESIDENT. RIFT SUPPOSEDLY DEVELOPED WHEN HE 
REJECTED A PLEA BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Thursday he is parting company with 
attorney Robert S. Bennett, confirming speculation that began after the 
lawmaker's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Bob Bennett, my attorney in the House post office investigation, and I 
mutually decided to go our separate ways. I will soon retain new counsel, and 
will present a vigorous defense to the charges recently brought against me," 
Rostenkowski said in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Bennett confirmed the split earlier in the day, saying Bennett 
would stay on until Rostenkowski found other legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the names mentioned as a possible replacement is Dan Webb, a former 
U.S. attorney in Chicago who is now in private practice. Webb did not 
immediately respond to a request for comment left at his office Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A rift in the way the case should be handled became evident after Rostenkowski 
decided to fight a 17-count indictment announced Tuesday rather than accept a 
plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 One legal source said Rostenkowski "lost confidence" in Bennett after the 
lawyer decided to take on representation of President Clinton without first 
consulting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with Bennett's thinking said the problem had to do with his 
needing more control as the case proceeded toward trial. Arraignment is 
scheduled for June 10 before U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett felt he was losing control when Rostenkowski rejected his advice to 
publicly comment after the indictment and earlier when Rostenkowski refused to 
accept Bennett's guidance that he accept a plea bargain with a six-month prison 
term, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the congressman's refusal, Joseph diGenova, a defense lawyer and 
former head of the U.S. attorney's office that now is prosecuting the case, 
said he also thought Rostenkowski "should have taken the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett has denied any conflict in his representation of Clinton and has said 
the two cases have no relationship. Clinton is being sued by a former Arkansas 
state employee, Paula Corbin Jones, who has accused him of making unwanted 
sexual advances when he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury indictment against Rostenkowski accuses him of hiring ghost 
employees, including some who performed personal services for him, of having 
some of the workers kick back part of their paychecks to his office, of asking 
a witness to withhold information from the grand jury and of obtaining cash 
illegally from the House post office. 
</P>
<P>
 By deciding to fight in court, Rostenkowski risks a longer sentence unless he 
can win on every count of the indictment. He could get a minimum of five years 
under U.S. sentencing guidelines if convicted on all counts.

SAYING 'NO' NOT ENOUGH FOR RAPE CASE; LAW: PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT SAYS 
FORCE MUST BE USED OR THREATENED TO FIT STATUTE'S DEFINITION OF CRIME. WOMEN'S 
GROUPS DECRY THE RULING.

 She kept saying "no." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it when Robert Berkowitz locked his college dorm room. She said it 
when he pushed her on the bed and removed her underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not try to escape. She did not try to fight. He did not use force. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Pennsylvania law, Berkowitz did not commit rape, the all-male state 
Supreme Court said in a ruling issued at the end of last week but not 
publicized until Thursday. The 7-0 ruling, women's rights advocates say, runs 
counter to advice often given about what to do if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Geller Myers, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, 
said it sends a dangerous message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't teach women to fight back because it escalates the violence in an 
already violent situation," she said. "No one can say why she didn't kick or 
scream. The law can't dictate what an individual's survival instincts should 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court said state law specifically defines rape as the use of force 
-- physical or psychological -- or at least a threat of force. Justice Ralph 
Cappy, in writing the opinion, said the woman acknowledged that Berkowitz did 
not use force and did not restrain her during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "As to the complainant's testimony that she stated 'no' throughout the 
encounter with appellee, we point out that, while such an allegation of fact 
would be relevant to the issue of consent, it is not relevant to the issue of 
force," Cappy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkowitz's lawyer, Mark Sheppard, said the ruling was a further definition of 
the legal term rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a step backward," Sheppard said. "All the court did was to 
interpret the statute and its fair meaning, and gave strength to the view that 
just saying 'no' wasn't enough if force wasn't used." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred at East Stroudsburg University in 1987 after the woman -- 
a student -- entered Berkowitz's room, looking for his roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkowitz was convicted in Pennsylvania's Common Pleas Court of rape and 
indecent assault. He was sentenced to one to four years in jail but remained 
free on bail pending appeal. The convictions were overturned in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court said the rape conviction was correctly reversed. It reinstated 
the conviction on indecent assault, a misdemeanor punishable by six to 12 
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Karen Ritter has introduced legislation to change the definition of 
rape. The current law allows for no charges other than rape and indecent 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her proposal, prosecutors could seek convictions of sexual assault and 
aggravated sexual assault in cases with a lack of consent but no evidence of 
force. Both are second-degree felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania ruling comes a month after the California Supreme Court ruled 
the opposite way in a similar case. The California court unanimously held that 
a man may be convicted of rape even if he was unarmed and the victim submitted 
without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The California high court ruled in a 1990 San Diego case in which a 
22-year-old woman was raped on the eve of her wedding as she slept at a 
friend's house. She said she was too afraid to cry out or struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Babcock, an attorney for the defendant in the California case, said 
"by the (California) Supreme Court's decision, as long as it includes elements 
of fear, it is rape."

 ANTEDILUVIAN ORTHOGRAPHIZED BY 7TH-GRADER TO WIN BEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ned G. Andrews, a seventh-grader from Knoxville, Tenn., spelled his way to 
glory Thursday in his third appearance at the National Spelling Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," Ned, 13, said after correctly spelling antediluvian, meaning 
ancient, or dating to before the biblical flood. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave much of the credit for his win to his mother, Carolyn, an editor. "I 
don't have a professional coach but my mom coaches me and she ought to be 
paid," he said, grinning broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned lasted 15 rounds over two days to win the annual spelldown. He 
successfully spelled dyskinesia, (characterized by involuntary motions), 
proboscis (snout) and naiad (nymph). These were just a few of the 1,068 words 
spelled during the bee. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place winner, Brian Kane Lee, was also making his third appearance 
at a national spelling bee. Brian, 12, of Minot, N.D., was done in by 
parvenuism, which means to behave like one who has risen above the station to 
which he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Third place went to Anthony Chuang, 14, of Ft. Worth. He was stopped by his 
13th word, psalmodist, a composer of sacred songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned won $5,000; Brian, $4,000, and Anthony, $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The second day of competition began with 152 spellers still in contention. 
After nearly nine hours Thursday, only 20 still had their equipoise (balance), 
successfully spelling everything from quiddity, (a trifling point) to plectrum 
(a small piece of material used to pluck stringed instruments).

FAA BACKS OFF PLANS TO DEVELOP NEW SYSTEM FOR PLANE LANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an investment of 27 years and $400 million, the Federal Aviation 
Administration said Thursday it is scrapping development of a system to guide 
airplane landings because the program has been overtaken by an alternative 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came as the agency was preparing major changes in a troubled 
multibillion-dollar contract to modernize the computers in the nation's air 
traffic control system.Officials said the agency plans to announce today that 
it will scale back efforts to develop new equipment and focus on buying 
"off-the-shelf" technology that it hopes will lower costs.

 The Microwave Landing System (MLS) had been intended to replace the instrument 
landing system (ILS) now in use to guide planes to runways under conditions of 
limited visibility. But the FAA reached a conclusion long espoused by some 
aviation industry groups that satellite-based technology has greater potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA on Thursday canceled MLS contracts with Raytheon Corp. and Wilcox 
Corp., saying the move would save taxpayers $59 million through 1997.

RENO TARGETS BORDER PATROL BUREAUCRACY; IMMIGRATION: PILOT PROGRAM WILL 
COMPUTERIZE CERTAIN PROCEDURES TO PUT MORE AGENTS IN THE FIELD. A BETTER 
FINGERPRINT SYSTEM IS ALSO UNDER DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service is testing an automated system in 
the San Diego area that would free Border Patrol agents from paperwork burdens 
so they can concentrate on tightening U.S. borders, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Border Patrol agents have, up until now, been spending 40% of their valuable 
enforcement time doing paperwork," said Reno, who complained after a border 
visit last August of finding agents driving buses and performing tasks that 
could be handled by technology. 
</P>
<P>
 At her weekly press conference, Reno also announced that a fingerprint system 
currently under development for the INS will identify criminal illegal 
residents at the border within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The automated paperwork system, called ENFORCE, was turned on Wednesday at 
three border patrol sites near San Diego and "will provide the equivalent of 
redeploying 48 agents to the line," Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system handles by computer 43 of 51 forms that agents previously have 
completed with typewriters or filled out longhand, freeing Border Patrol agents 
from much of the paperwork involved in processing illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, the system will be used to track cases by linking immigration 
enforcement and deportation systems that currently lack the means of exchanging 
data, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In unveiling the technology, Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner noted 
that the agency has only enough money in its current budget to run the pilot 
effort for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Final enactment of House and Senate crime bills now in conference to resolve 
differences would provide $200 million for INS technological developments, 
including the ENFORCE system and the fingerprint identification. That would be 
the largest part of the two to three years of funding needed to fully implement 
the system, according to Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to deploy these technologies all along our border and develop 
others, Congress needs to pass the crime bill and appropriate funds," Reno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fingerprint system, which was described as in "the late stages of 
development," will enable Border Patrol agents to identify an illegal immigrant 
from an electronic fingerprint within three to five minutes and to retrieve the 
individual's criminal records, photographs and other information. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said the technology would help close a gap in the INS fingerprinting 
system that allows private firms to take prints from illegal residents for use 
on their INS applications without requiring them to prove their identities. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS has failed to regulate private companies and has no means of 
preventing immigrants intent on hiding their arrest records from enlisting 
someone with a clean history to submit their prints instead, according to a 
report by the Justice Department's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the Justice Department announced that 53 Mexican 
nationals now in U.S. prisons after criminal convictions will be sent back to 
Mexican prisons today. It will be the third transfer under an accelerated 
program that resulted from Reno's meeting in Mexico last October with Jorge 
Carpizio MacGregor, Mexico's then-attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno praised the Mexican government for its role in the transfer, saying, "It 
is a common-sense answer to help ensure that U.S. prison space is used for U.S. 
citizens." One-hundred eighty-six criminal foreigners have been returned to 
Mexico in the stepped-up transfers, which began last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the transfer program are two state prisoners -- one from 
California and the other from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's transfer also will involve the exchange of seven Americans, including 
one woman, now being held in Mexican prisons and who will serve out their 
sentences in federal prisons. The Justice Department refused to identify any of 
the prisoners who are being transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said it anticipates further transfers on a regular basis. The 
status of 8,000 Mexican nationals now serving time in federal prisons is under 
review by the Bureau of Prisons. About 330 Americans currently are serving time 
in Mexican prisons.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; FROM VOICE TO MANNER, OPENING NIGHT JUST RIGHT

 Talk about drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the laryngitis that forced the postponement of four concerts until 
next month, the big question at the opening of Barbra Streisand's engagement at 
The Pond of Anaheim Thursday night wasn't so much how the show would be but how 
the voice would be. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as she stepped through the curtain to sing a customized version of 
"Everything's As If We Never Said Goodbye" from the musical "Sunset Boulevard," 
the voice seemed rich and full. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the opening 50-minute half of the concert, she hit notes with the 
same dynamics and command that she had shown on earlier stops of her first 
concert tour in almost three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been changes in material and dialogue since her triumphant return 
to live shows on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, but the central elements remain: 
It is a warm, witty and revealing evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Given an image sometimes characterized in the media as humorless and aloof, 
Streisand was particularly disarming early in the performance when she voiced 
surprise over media speculation that she hadn't really been suffering from 
laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, from voice to manner, her opening night at The Pond was a gem.

<P>
 Seeking to curtail grade inflation, Stanford University faculty leaders voted 
overwhelmingly Thursday to reinstate a failing grade and make it tougher for 
students to retake classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Faculty Senate decision came after two lengthy meetings and weeks of 
contentious debate on campus that saw compromise policies proposed by some 
students and professors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the faculty has done is send a clear message to students to take 
the life of the mind seriously," said Gail Mahood, chairwoman of the faculty 
committee that proposed the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new policy will reduce the number of A's and Bs.

HOT DOGS LINKED TO HIGHER RISK OF CANCERS IN CHILDREN; DIET: BUT SOME SCOFF AT 
THE STUDY SHOWING THAT MORE THAN 12 WIENERS A MONTH INCREASES CHANCES OF 
LEUKEMIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children who eat more than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the normal 
risk of developing childhood leukemia, a USC epidemiologist has reported in a 
cancer research journal. Two other reports in the same issue of Cancer Causes 
and Control suggest that children born to mothers who eat at least one hot dog 
per week during pregnancy have double the normal risk of developing brain 
tumors, as do children whose fathers ate hot dogs before conception. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent findings, which are generating a great deal of controversy and 
concern, could help explain why the incidence of childhood leukemia and brain 
tumors has been increasing over the last two decades, say the researchers, led 
by USC epidemiologist John Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists caution that the studies are preliminary and based on 
relatively small numbers of cases -- a total of 621 cancer victims in the three 
studies and an equal number of controls. They also note that the statistical 
association is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, as well as the researchers themselves, point out that such studies 
are difficult to conduct and interpret because people have a hard time 
recalling what they have eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the scientists argue that the results are significant and the 
issue deserves much more intensive scrutiny. In response to the findings, 
researchers at the University of Minnesota have modified their National Cancer 
Institute-sponsored study on childhood leukemia to explore the possible 
connection to hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers suggest that the trigger for the cancers might be the nitrites 
used to preserve processed meats such as hot dogs. Nitrites are converted in 
the body to highly carcinogenic nitrosamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, none of the investigators argue that people should stop eating hot dogs 
based on the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the low incidence of these childhood tumors, "this is not a hazard 
at the level of tobacco smoke or high-fat diets," said epidemiologist David 
Savitz of the University of North Carolina, author of one of the studies on 
pregnant women. "The rational response would be a small modification of your 
consumption."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an intriguing idea because hot dogs certainly contain chemicals that one 
might wonder about," said Dr. Clark Heath, vice president for medical research 
of the American Cancer Society. "I don't think they prove the case," he said, 
but the results are feasible because animal studies have established that 
nitrites cause cancer. "Obviously, it is an idea that will need to be explored 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers from the hot dog and cured meat industries were not available for 
comment Thursday. A spokeswoman for the National Cancer Institute could not 
provide anyone familiar with the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other researchers scoffed at the findings as an example of the "carcinogen of 
the week" syndrome. "The problem is that there are an enormous number of 
variables in a study like this," said nutrition expert Michael Pariza of the 
University of Wisconsin. "You don't know whether they were undernourished, for 
example, or if they had adequate exercise. . . . It would be extremely 
premature to draw any conclusion from this type of study." 
</P>
<P>
 Other researchers also attacked the studies because they were published in a 
journal that is not peer-reviewed, meaning that experts did not have a chance 
to critique the results before they appeared in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Leukemia and brain tumors have been a concern to pediatric oncologists because 
they have been increasing more than twice as fast as childhood cancer overall. 
In the 17 years that such data has been collected, Heath said, cancer among 
children up to age 14 has increased by an average of 0.8% per year, while acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia has increased 1.7% per year -- a 27.4% total over that 
period. Brain tumors have increased 1.8% per year over the same period, a 32.8% 
total. The cause of the increases has been a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the cancers are still considered very rare. Acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia strikes only about three in every 10,000 children, so even a ninefold 
increase still amounts to a relatively small risk.  
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they did not set out to indict hot dogs. Peters and 
Savitz have been key players in the studies examining the link between 
electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and childhood tumors. As part of those studies, 
they decided to explore other potential causes. "Our idea was to test as many 
hypotheses about possible causes as we could think of," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding about hot dogs "was a real surprise," he added. "It was the 
biggest risk for anything we saw in the study -- about four times the risk for 
EMFs." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and his colleagues identified 232 children under age 10 in the Los 
Angeles area who developed leukemia between 1980 and 1987 and a comparable 
number of matched children who did not develop it. The parents answered 
extensive questions about lifestyle, parental occupations, exposure to 
potential carcinogens and diet for the children and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, they were questioned about consumption of cured meats, 
including hot dogs, bologna, bacon, sausage and ham -- all of which contain 
nitrites -- as well as charcoal-broiled meats, which contain other carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 They found no link to any food other than hot dogs. In addition to the 
findings for the children, Peters found that the risk of leukemia in children 
whose fathers consumed hot dogs regularly before the children were conceived 
was 11 times normal. He did not distinguish among various types of hot dogs 
because all contain nitrites. 
</P>
<P>
 Savitz and Greta R. Bunin of Children's Hospital in Philadelphia performed 
similar studies among children with leukemia and brain tumors. Savitz studied 
234 cancer cases and 234 controls in Denver; Bunin studied 155 cancer cases and 
155 controls in Philadelphia. Both found about twice the normal risk of brain 
tumors among children whose mothers consumed hot dogs weekly during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Savitz also found a doubled risk of leukemia among children who ate at least 
one grilled hamburger per week and a doubled risk of brain cancer among those 
who ate at least one hot dog per week. All the researchers found that the 
greatest risk was among children who did not take vitamins -- implying that 
vitamins may have some type of protective effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the researchers suspect nitrites in the cured meats, they agree that 
it could be something else as well -- perhaps the high fat content of hot dogs, 
bacteria or some other chemical in them. Or it could be that a high hot dog 
intake "is simply a marker for a very bad diet," Bunin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the studies were not designed with hot dogs as a primary concern 
means that there are many unanswered questions, Savitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not by modern standards a sophisticated study of diet and cancer. We 
know how to do better, but hot dogs just weren't a prominent enough issue to 
devote extensive parts of the questionnaire to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he concluded, "now they are."

SENATE NARROWLY APPROVES REFORMS IN CLAS EXAMS; EDUCATION: PROPOSED CHANGES 
INCLUDE A BAN ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS AND A LARGER ROLE FOR PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Senate on Thursday narrowly passed legislation aimed at shoring up public 
confidence in the state's school performance tests through several reforms, 
including giving parents a bigger role in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed reforms include a prohibition against asking students about their 
sexual, moral and religious beliefs or those of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, designed to overcome heavy criticism of the California Learning 
Assessment System tests, also would add parents and other members of the public 
to the teams of teachers who develop the tests and create a citizens committee 
appointed by the Legislature to review the final product. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (SB 1273) by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), which would 
reauthorize the California Learning Assessment System for five more years, was 
approved on a bipartisan 21-14 vote, the exact majority required. The measure 
goes to the Assembly, where its fate is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Assembly Republicans are expected to propose amendments that 
would give the performance-based examinations a more traditional academic cast. 
Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser, said the Senate bill 
does not meet the governor's demand for reforms "but it's coming" closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old CLAS tests have been praised and criticized. They have been 
lauded as a national model for measuring students' progress, but are criticized 
by some parents and conservative Christian organizations that object to the 
reading and writing segments of the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the tests invade a student's personal beliefs, do not accurately 
measure knowledge and are so shrouded by secrecy that they cannot be legally 
examined by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear Lake), who two years ago supported the 
CLAS legislation, led the opposition Thursday in the Senate. He accused the 
state Department of Education and acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson of imposing a blackout on test material, which he said helped fuel rumor 
and myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said parents should be allowed to examine the tests. But Hart and 
others argued that allowing parents to see the tests in advance would 
compromise the tests' integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart bill would order the compilation of previous sample exams that would 
be distributed to the public in as "broad a manner as possible" so citizens 
would know the types of questions that have been asked.

 A fiery explosion possibly caused by leaking gas ripped through a three-story 
apartment building in the city's Tenderloin district shortly before 10 p.m. 
Thursday, scattering flaming debris and shattering glass that injured at least 
six people. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers began searching through the smoldering rubble as soon as the 
blaze was put out, but no bodies had been found an hour after the destructive 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're literally peeling floor by floor," Mayor Frank Jordan said. "We're 
mainly going through the debris, seeing if we can find somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 At least five people suffered minor injuries and one person was taken to San 
Francisco General Hospital with more serious injuries, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion may have been caused by natural gas, but Fire Chief Joe Medina 
said investigators were looking into other possibilities as well. Medina said 
he will investigate whether there were reports of gas leaks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't imagine what happened here. All the glass broke," said Mehdi 
Hussein, a salesman at a liquor store across the street from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90 firefighters were on the scene.

NO STATUTES GOVERN PUNITIVE DAMAGES, BUT THE IDEA IS SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Punitive damages, which jurors denied to Rodney G. King on Wednesday, are not 
governed by any precise federal statute but the legal philosophy behind them is 
straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general idea of punitive damages is very simple," said USC law professor 
Gregory Keating. "It's to exact an extra price from the defendant beyond what 
he owes the plaintiff for injuring him." 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said there are two basic rationales for punitive damages: to deter 
repetitions of egregious conduct and to provide extra compensation for a person 
who has been subjected to particularly reprehensible treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 King had to show "by a preponderance of the evidence" that punitive damages 
should be awarded. The jury was instructed by federal Judge John G. Davies that 
it could award punitive damages only if it found that a defendant's conduct was 
malicious or that a defendant acted in reckless disregard of King's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conduct is malicious if it is accompanied by ill will, or spite, or if it is 
for the purpose of injuring another," Davies told the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that former Los Angeles Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer 
Laurence M. Powell acted with malice toward King. But in an unusual decision, 
the jurors, acting within the discretion the law permits them, declined to give 
King any additional money beyond the $3.8 million in compensatory damages they 
awarded him last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with The Times, jurors explained their decision by noting the 
size of the compensatory award and the fact that Koon and Powell have limited 
financial resources and already are serving prison terms for violating King's 
civil rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Manes, a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer who has represented plaintiffs 
in excessive-force cases against police officers for more than 30 years, said 
he thought the jurors' decision was an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had a case where the jury said the defendant acted with malice 
and then didn't award punitive damages," Manes said. "But then I never had a 
case that led to a riot or a case where the culprit officers wound up going to 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Punitive damages have grown increasingly controversial in recent years. Large 
corporations that have been hit with big awards have attempted, often with 
success, to get them reduced. The corporations, however, have been unable to 
persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to impose limits on the scope of punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the high court ruled that juries can impose virtually unlimited 
damage verdicts on companies to punish them for malicious conduct or deliberate 
fraud, upholding a $10-million judgment that stemmed from a $19,000 land title 
dispute.

KING CALLS VERDICT NO SURPRISE, BUT LAWYER SPEAKS OF AN APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King, making his first public comments since the verdicts in his 
civil trial, said Thursday that he was not surprised that the jury awarded him 
no punitive damages, but King's lawyer said the jurors themselves might provide 
grounds for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first (verdict) in Simi Valley, nothing surprises me," King said. 
"I've gotten the short end of the stick from the Simi Valley trial until now." 
</P>
<P>
 But King said he had to concentrate on the millions that came out of the first 
verdict and "make something out of that." He said he is attending classes to 
learn to "hold on to the money." 
</P>
<P>
 King's lead attorney, Milton Grimes, said Thursday that discussions with a 
juror troubled with the way the verdict came about could provide the basis for 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are areas that warrant an investigation," Grimes said at a news 
conference outside his office. "It does bring out some information . . . that 
the verdict may be impeachable." 
</P>
<P>
 King, looking slim and healthy in a white dress shirt, slacks and suspenders, 
said he would not have sued for punitive damages if the officers "had shown 
some sign of remorse. None of them came up to me and said they were sorry."

<P>
 Grimes declined at the news conference to identify the juror who contacted 
him. But a juror, Cynthia Kelly -- a self-employed seamstress from South 
Pasadena -- met with Grimes at his office later in the afternoon. Grimes said 
he was concerned by statements made by Kelly, the only African American on the 
jury, that justice had not been not done and that she had to "fight like hell" 
to get the earlier verdicts favoring King. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he had also been contacted by a second juror, whom he also did not 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can say this is the final chapter in the trilogy of Rodney 
King," he said. "We're still looking for justice." 
</P>
<P>
 After 11 days of deliberations, a nine-member federal jury found Wednesday 
that former LAPD officers Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon had acted with 
malice in the 1991 beating of King. But the jury decided unanimously that the 
officers had been punished enough and declined to award King as much as $15 
million he was seeking in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the jury awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages, payable 
by the city of Los Angeles, for the police beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he could not say how much of the $3.8 million King will receive 
once attorney fees and other expenses are subtracted, but "Mr. King will be 
left with a substantial part of the money." Grimes refused to let King comment 
on the possibility of another trial but said the jury "left us with an 
unresolved type of feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he plans to investigate reports that three jurors may have 
discussed the case during a weekend barbecue, and he added that he might appeal 
the dismissal of former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates as a defendant.

KING, HIS ATTORNEY SAY JURORS' REACTION MAY BE BASIS FOR APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Rodney G. King, making his first public comment Thursday since the verdicts in 
his civil rights trial, said he was not surprised that the jury awarded him no 
punitive damages, but King's attorney said the jurors themselves might provide 
grounds for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first (verdict) in Simi Valley, nothing surprises me," King said. 
"I've gotten the short end of the stick from the Simi Valley trial until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, King's lead attorney, said that discussions with a juror, 
troubled with how the verdict came about, could provide the basis of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are areas that warrant an investigation," said Grimes, flanked 
by King at a press conference outside his office. "It does bring out some 
information . . . that the verdict may be impeachable." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, King, 29, said he was not surprised by the jury's refusal to 
financially punish the officers who beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 But King said he had to concentrate on the millions that came out of the first 
verdict and "make something out of that." He said he is attending classes to 
learn how to "hold on to the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes declined to identify the juror who approached him or to reveal details 
of the discussions. But the juror, Cynthia Kelly, a self-employed seamstress 
from South Pasadena, said she had contacted Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he was concerned by statements made by Kelly, the jury's lone 
African American, that justice had not been not done and that she had to "fight 
like hell" to get the verdicts favoring King. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he had also been contacted by a second juror, whom he also did not 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, after 11 days of deliberations, a nine-member federal jury found 
that former LAPD officers Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon had acted with 
malice in the 1991 beating of King. But the jury decided unanimously that the 
officers had been punished enough and declined to award King as much as $15 
million he had sought in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the jury had awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages, 
payable by the city of Los Angeles, for the police beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Both King and Grimes said they believed the racial makeup of the jury, which 
included six whites, one Latino, one Filipino American and one African 
American, seriously impacted the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 If there had been 12 black jurors, Grimes asked, "Wouldn't you be concerned 
about justice?" 
</P>
<P>
 King said he felt "blessed and happy" to have at least one African American on 
the civil rights jury. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his future, King said he is seeing a psychologist to deal with his 
continued anger over the beating and is back coaching a Pasadena Little League 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he had conquered fears that caused his chest to tense up and his 
body to break out sweating and shaking, but he still has trouble viewing the 
videotape of his beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I look at it I can remember what they were saying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine not seeing it anymore. It's a sick sight." 
</P>
<P>
 King said he still feels like a "marked man" in Los Angeles: "Like someone's 
always following me. Someone's out to get me." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he didn't know if he could forgive the officers who beat him, but 
would stay as far away from them as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Grimes refused to let King comment on the possibility of another trial, but 
said the jury "left us with an unresolved type of feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can say this is the final chapter in the trilogy of Rodney 
King," he said. "We're still looking for justice." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the jury foreman leaving in tears, the dissatisfaction of the 
only African American juror, and "11 days of people coming out shaking their 
heads and crying and saying they don't know if they made the right decision." 
He also said he planned to investigate reports that three jurors might have 
discussed the case during a weekend barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes also challenged the dismissal of former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates as a defendant and said he is considering appealing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daryl Gates was one of the main players I thought we'd get," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he could not say how much of the $3.8 million King will receive, 
after attorney fees and the expenses are subtracted, but "Mr. King will be left 
with a substantial part of the money."

SEN. HILL'S CO-DEFENDANT IS FINAL WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testimony in the political corruption trial of state Sen. Frank Hill concluded 
Thursday with the Whittier Republican's co-defendant, Terry E. Frost, being 
grilled by federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, a former Senate Democratic aide, acknowledged that he had "my foot in 
my mouth a lot" when bantering about campaign fund raising to an FBI informant 
who was secretly tape-recording the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who make misstatements," but they don't necessarily 
reflect criminal intent, testified Frost, who is charged with a single count of 
conspiracy to commit extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, 44, was the final witness. Final arguments are scheduled for June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Frost led the undercover informant to his friend, 
Karin Watson, an Assembly Republican consultant. Watson, in turn, unwittingly 
guided the FBI to Hill, then a rising star in the Assembly, and allegedly 
helped arrange a $2,500 honorarium for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill faces charges of extortion, conspiracy and money laundering stemming from 
his receipt of the honorarium from an undercover FBI agent posing as a Georgia 
businessman seeking legislation to help him locate a shrimp processing center 
in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost testified that Watson never told him that Hill or anyone else "was going 
to receive any money" related to the bill proposed as part of the undercover 
sting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frost acknowledged that he told Watson that the bogus shrimp entrepreneur 
would have a $10,000 budget for campaign contributions to dole out to 
Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, who recently left a job as a lobbyist, also conceded that he asked the 
undercover informant how much he was willing to contribute as a way "to open 
some doors" in the Capitol. He insisted that he wanted to provide the 
businessman with legal access to lawmakers, not break the law.

STREISAND'S FANS DELIGHT IN OPENING NIGHT IN ANAHEIM; MUSIC: CROWD OF ABOUT 
14,000 INCLUDES CELEBRITIES, FRIENDS. SHOW FEATURES HER HITS AND BROADWAY 
FAVORITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Met by a warm ovation from a crowd of 14,000 as she took the stage, Barbra 
Streisand finally launched her long-awaited and much-hyped series of concerts 
at the Pond of Anaheim Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening with, "As if We Never Said Goodbye," she took a few good-natured 
knocks at rumors that she had faked the bout with laryngitis that led to the 
rescheduling of her first four Anaheim dates. 
</P>
<P>
 She offered a David Letterman-style Top 10 list of reasons why she postponed 
the shows, including, "I've always wanted to spend four hot, muggy days in 
Anaheim in the middle of July," and "Every time I've tried to get here, I got 
sidetracked and went to Disneyland instead." 
</P>
<P>
 She then settled into a set mixing Broadway standards and hits spanning her 
career, chatting amiably between numbers about her life and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fans had waited a long time for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said Sue Clark, 35, of Riverside, who came 
to the Pond hours early with a friend to pick up their $125 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's performance Thursday night was part of her first tour in nearly 
three decades, and she said this tour will be her last. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement was especially high because the 52-year-old singer, reportedly 
suffering last week from viral tracheolaryngitis and under strict orders from 
her doctor not to talk, much less sing, had postponed four previously announced 
shows at the Pond, her only stop in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out show attracted fans, celebrities and friends of Streisand from 
across the country, including actress Brooke Shields and tennis player Andre 
Agassi. Some arrived in limos, wearing sequined gowns and suits, while others 
dressed in jeans or shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a fan of Barbra since I was in high school," said Susan Bratlien of 
North Dakota. "I'm just so excited, I don't know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand will perform at he Pond again Saturday night. Tickets for the four 
postponed shows will be honored in July, after Streisand has completed 
engagements in San Jose and New York City, the remaining cities on her six-stop 
itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the rescheduling, she had issued a statement saying she felt 
"terrible that these postponements may cause severe scheduling problems for so 
many who have waited for so long for me to perform live." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's much-anticipated concert involved extra expense and some unusual 
security measures, which fans didn't seem to mind. Ticket prices were 
unprecedented: $350, $125 and $50 each from the box office. Private ticket 
brokers charged a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial announcement that Streisand would be coming to Southern California 
turned Los Angeles into a "city of scalpers," in the words of one ticket 
broker, although some tickets still were available at face value Wednesday for 
the Anaheim shows. The singing star is expected to set box office records with 
a six-night gross from the Anaheim shows likely to top $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pond management increased parking fees to $8 from the usual $6. And fans had 
to temporarily unload their metal belongings into plastic bags and pass through 
metal detectors, a measure more commonly associated with airports, or at least 
with concerts by punk-metal bands and hard-core rap acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks hockey fans may have felt out of place in the concession stand 
areas. Alongside food stands peddling the usual arena nachos, hot dogs and 
Cracker Jacks were dainty dessert carts offering fresh berries with Grand 
Marnier ($4) and chocolate truffles (two for $3). 
</P>
<P>
 Beverages included a variety of liqueurs in coffee, and champagne at up to $10 
a glass.

FREEMAN SPOGLI OFFERS TO BUY STAKE IN KOLL MANAGEMENT; ACQUISITIONS: THE L.A. 
INVESTMENT FIRM WOULD GET 48% OF NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY AS PART OF A 
$23.6-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles investment firm of Freeman Spogli & Co. has offered to buy a 
48% stake in Koll Management Services as part of a $23.6-million deal that 
would take the nation's second-largest industrial and office property manager 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Koll Management, based in Newport Beach, said Thursday that the 
buyout would enable the firm to continue an aggressive acquisition campaign. 
Purchases of other property management companies, such as Rubloff Inc. in 
Chicago, have nearly doubled Koll's portfolio to about 120 million square feet 
in the past year, but the costs of those acquisitions has cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow us to obtain additional financing to speed up our acquisition 
program," said Ray Wirta, chief executive of Koll. "We think this is an 
opportune time to be buying." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll went public in July, 1991, with an offering of 1.1 million shares priced 
at $10 each. The company was spun off from privately owned Koll Co., a real 
estate firm formed in 1962 by prominent Newport Beach developer Donald M. Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of falling rents and rising office vacancies during the real estate 
downturn of the early 1990s, however, Koll Management has posted only 
lackluster profits. The benefits of the company's recent buying spree has yet 
to bolster earnings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "KMS has not done well as a publicly traded company," said Mark Matheson, an 
analyst with the brokerage Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "The stock 
hardly trades. They just don't have the resources to attack everything on their 
plates right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout proposal boosted Koll Management's stock $2.75 a share to $14.75 in 
Thursday's Nasdaq trading, though only 8,700 shares changed hands.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Freeman pulls this off, they will get the company cheaply," said Lawrence 
Horan, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "Due to recent 
acquisitions, company earnings are still depressed. I would not be surprised if 
they were to double in the next three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Freeman Spogli would pay $15 a share for most of the stock 
now held by Koll Management's executives, plus all of the shares now publicly 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Koll, who is also chairman of Koll Management, would receive $6.6 
million for part of the 64% stake he now owns in the property management firm. 
Freeman Spogli would pay about $17 million for the public investors' stake, an 
estimated 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction would reduce Koll's ownership to 48%, provide Freeman Spogli a 
48% stake and give key employees of Koll Management the other 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has not yet been filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, is being studied by a special independent committee of the Koll 
Management board, which has hired lawyers and an investment banker to evaluate 
the plan, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 For its latest fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $56.7 million, up 
46%. Earnings rose 11% to $3 million, or 93 cents a share. Koll's Stock Surges 
</P>
<P>
 News that Koll Management Services may be taken private again boosted its 
stock Thursday. Monthly closing stock prices: 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's close: $14.75 Gaining Space 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the company has nearly quadrupled the amount of space it manages.

IN THE EYE OF THE STORM; TISCH IS CONFIDENT HE'S PUT CBS ON THE PROPER COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When New York businessman Laurence A. Tisch made his first investment in CBS 
Inc. nine years ago, he was dubbed a short-term player. Wall Street expected 
him to sell his CBS shares quickly for a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tisch confounded the skeptics and is now completing his eighth year as 
CBS' largest shareholder and chief executive. Instead of a short-term player, 
critics now say he's a short-term thinker whose miscalculations are coming home 
to roost. As evidence, they cite Fox Broadcasting Co.'s raid last week of eight 
CBS affiliates, and CBS' loss of National Football Conference broadcast rights 
to Fox for the next four years. These critics predict that CBS' value will 
inevitably diminish under a protracted Tisch regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch -- in Los Angeles on Thursday for a meeting of CBS affiliates -- shrugs 
it all off with his characteristic blunt confidence. "I think we're doing the 
right thing by shareholders," the 71-year-old chairman said in a breakfast 
interview. "I think long-term, not short-term." 
</P>
<P>
 With understandable pride, he points to 1993 earnings of $316.8 million, or 
$20.39 per share -- nearly double the results of the previous year. Among the 
networks, CBS ranked No. 1 last year in daytime, prime-time and late-night 
ratings, in a "triple crown" feat accomplished only once before in network 
television, when CBS dominated the 1983-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
 His long-term strategy? To invest in programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought that we could not increase our earnings every year for the next 
five years, I would say, 'Jeez, maybe we have to be a little more daring or 
something.' But we see a clear path for increased earnings every year," Tisch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've built this asset; we haven't diminished it," he continued, citing the 
increased market value of CBS' radio stations as an example. The radio 
properties could fetch $800 million if they were for sale, compared to $400 
million or $500 million five years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tisch worked hard to turn the network around, and he won the respect 
of some of Wall Street's most prominent analysts, who praise his discipline. 
"The crazies are not in charge of this thing, and football is the classic 
example of that," said David Londoner, a managing director of Wertheim Schroder 
in New York. By his calculation, CBS would have reduced its per-share earnings 
by 25% if it had matched Fox's winning bid for a four-year package of Sunday 
football games.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the criticism persists. By selling off CBS' recorded music business and 
publishing, the company's remaining broadcast business is hobbled by government 
restrictions and is vulnerable to economic downturns or new competitors. And 
unlike the other networks, CBS has not invested in cable television or business 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "His primary asset is getting attacked, and he's got nothing else to draw on. 
If I were him, I'd sell it," said one big media investor who holds Capital 
Cities/ABC stock. But the investor -- who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
-- mused that Tisch does appear to relish his status as a network chief, 
adding, "I don't know how much he likes it as a toy." 
</P>
<P>
 To such talk, Tisch responded: "How could it be a toy after eight years? I 
don't run around after stars; you don't see me at the parties. I'm not there 
because it's a game or a toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch does move in New York's most powerful social circles, with a style that 
is both hospitable and purposeful. Few doubt that he enjoys hobnobbing with 
power brokers, but frivolity is not a Tisch trait. As a youth in Brooklyn, he 
worked in his father's clothing business and his New Jersey summer camp, then 
entered New York University at age 15. Tisch has a master's degree in 
industrial engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. During World War 
II, he worked in Washington on military codes. In 1946, he dropped out of 
Harvard Law School to invest in a resort hotel with his close-knit family. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next decade, the Tisches built a chain of resorts before Larry and 
his younger brother, Preston (Bob), invested in Loews Theaters. After the death 
of their father in 1960, the Tisch brothers merged their hotels with the 
theater chain and Larry became chief executive. Loews became their vehicle for 
shrewd investments in cigarette manufacturer Lorillard, CNA Financial and, 
eventually, CBS. Although the theater chain was sold in the 1980s, the Tisch 
family still controls 26% of Loews Corp., which boasted $13.7 billion in 1993 
revenue. Loews controls 19.6% of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tisch has characterized his CBS holdings as a legacy to be passed on 
to his family, he acknowledged Thursday that none of his children have 
expressed interest in joining the CBS executive ranks. Nor does he think his 
brother, Bob, would step in as chairman should anything unforeseen happen to 
him. He said the question of succession would fall to the CBS board. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Loews, CBS has no chief operating officer. CBS directors have not 
questioned the need for one, Tisch said. With just one business, he said, CBS 
Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer in effect fills the role. The 
management is lean but collegial, Tisch said. "You don't have to go through 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
 For advice, the CBS chairman said he relies on Stringer and other top 
executives. Outside the company, "I don't have advisers." Still, he insisted 
that no company spends more time "looking to the future" than CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have our heads buried in the sand. But you show me the niche where 
we can be successful. I'd like to see it!" Tisch said. Broadcasting, he said, 
has a "bright future," although he foresees trouble for cable TV operators who 
will have to engage in a price war with telephone companies to expand their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have over $1 billion in cash that's earning 7%, 8%, 9%," he said. "What 
better security does a company have than to have that liquidity and those 
earnings that can't disappear on you?" The Bloodshot Eye Network 
</P>
<P>
 While CBS Inc.'s earnings increased sharply last year and it continues to top 
the network ratings race, concern over its recent loss of affiliates to Fox 
Broadcasting Co. has contributed to a fall in its stock price.

 The Commerce Department said Thursday that its chief gauge of future economic 
growth leveled off in April and that factory orders fell for only the second 
time since last summer, further indications that recent Federal Reserve Board 
interest rate increases are cooling the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the department said its index of leading indicators in April held 
steady with the record levels of March and that factory orders slipped only 
0.1%, analysts said the reports indicate that the economy is now growing at a 
slower, more sustainable pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, the government said that sales of new homes and overall 
consumer spending also fell in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving into a period of slow but steady growth, which is far better 
than having an economy that is growing too fast for its own good," said Ken 
Ackbarali, senior economist at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "The table 
is set for a gradual expansion that could last for a couple of years, instead 
of running out of gas a few months down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The index, which measures everything from employment trends to orders for new 
clothing, is used to forecast the economy's health six to nine months down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the 11 index components were negative in April, and a sixth was 
unchanged from March. First-time claims for unemployment benefits rose as stock 
prices, consumer spending and Americans' confidence in the economy declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Business orders for new plants and equipment also fell. Analysts said the drop 
signals that manufacturers and other companies have become more cautious about 
where the economy is headed and are a bit nervous about spending to modernize 
or expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fear that could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as new 
orders drop, everybody's business starts to slow down," said Sung Won Sohn, 
chief economist at financial services giant Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Five components of the index -- inventories, permits for future construction, 
prices of raw materials, delivery times and the money supply -- showed 
improvements in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed launched the first of four increases in short-term interest rates in 
early February, after the economy grew at a 7% annual rate during the fourth 
quarter of 1993. By raising rates, the Fed hoped to cool the economy and keep 
inflation from skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's reports seem to indicate that the central bank's strategy is 
working.  
</P>
<P>
 Sohn and most other analysts say the economy should grow at a more sustainable 
2.5% to 3.5% rate in the second half of the year, as it digests the additional 
rate increases the Fed instituted in March, April and May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department report showing a 0.1% drop in orders to U.S. factories 
in April from March shows that the manufacturing sector is already beginning to 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in orders was widespread, affecting nearly every type of 
manufacturer. Orders for durable goods -- appliances and other items expected 
to last more than three years -- fell 0.1%. Orders for non-durable items such 
as food and textiles also dropped 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 If a sharp rise in the volatile military-orders category is excluded, April's 
decline would have been a much steeper 0.6%. But if a big increase in the 
equally volatile transportation component is excluded, orders would have eked 
out a 0.1% gain. Index of Leading Indicators

NME HOSPITAL PROBED FOR ALLEGED KICKBACKS; HEALTH CARE: FBI INVESTIGATING 
WHETHER CENTURY CITY FACILITY GAVE DOCTORS INCENTIVES TO INFLUENCE REFERRALS. 
HOSPITAL SAYS ALL WAS LEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1989, Century City Hospital created what it hoped would be a premier 
center for the treatment of back and spinal injuries. It recruited top-notch 
orthopedists and neurosurgeons to form the West Coast Spine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract such talent, the hospital -- one of Santa Monica-based National 
Medical Enterprises' most prominent general hospitals -- devised a complicated 
agreement under which it would help manage the doctors' practices and also 
arrange for medical office space near Century City Hospital so the doctors 
could practice together at one location. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement never lived up to Century City's expectations, and now the FBI 
is investigating allegations that the hospital may have violated federal 
anti-kickback laws. The investigation focuses on whether assistance offered by 
Century City was in effect a kind of payment to doctors at West Coast Spine to 
influence them to refer patients to the hospital, knowledgeable sources told 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Deals similar to the Century City arrangement are common among the nation's 
5,300 general hospitals. But federal regulators have long suspected that many 
of the deals may be illegal. Now the Clinton Administration, as part of an 
effort to crack down on abuses that contribute to the spiraling cost of health 
care, has stepped up investigations of specific deals considered questionable 
and has signaled that it will test the legality of more cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that doctors involved in such arrangements may make patient 
referrals based on their own financial interest, and that patients may end up 
paying more for health care and may not get high-quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of NME asserted that Century City Hospital did not violate any laws 
in its arrangement with West Coast Spine. "It was a very innovative, 
cutting-edge concept that turned out to be a very complicated, ill-fated idea," 
said Christi Sulzbach, a National Medical senior vice president. "It did not 
bind these physicians in an exclusive fashion to Century City, and it was not a 
payment-for-patients relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The probe of Century City is part of a sweeping federal fraud investigation of 
National Medical. Century City is the first of National Medical's general 
hospitals to be identified as a target of the overall investigation, which 
focuses mostly on National Medical's psychiatric hospitals, most of which it 
has sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has said that acute care, general hospitals will form the core of 
its business, and charges of wrongdoings in that segment could further tarnish 
the company's image. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law generally prohibits health care providers from giving or receiving 
financial inducements for referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients. The law 
is intended to limit the corruptive influence of money on a doctor's patient 
referral decisions so doctors will be more likely to base their referrals on 
the issues of price and quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is investigating whether Century City Hospital paid kickbacks to some 
West Coast Spine Institute doctors, in the form of below-market office rentals 
or remuneration for office overhead expenses, to influence doctors to perform 
more surgeries at the hospital, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 To recruit doctors, many hospitals pay a portion of the rent on physicians' 
medical offices, pay their medical malpractice premiums or guarantee that 
doctors will receive a minimum annual income, lawyers said. Such practices 
became widespread in the 1980s as competition in the health care field 
intensified and hospitals struggled with declining occupancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been confusion within the medical field about which types of 
hospital-doctor deals fall within the bounds of the law. Health care lawyers 
say the federal government's increased enforcement activity -- and legislation 
pending in Congress -- should establish clearer standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Patric Hooper, a Los Angeles health care lawyer, said the anti-kickback laws 
have "been a very gray area for some time and have not gotten much clearer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Said one hospital industry official: "The line between what's legal and what's 
illegal is a fuzzy one, but some hospital chains definitely write contracts 
that, if tested in court, would likely prove to be on the illegal side." 
</P>
<P>
 Health care kickback cases pose a challenge for federal prosecutors because it 
is usually difficult to demonstrate that financial incentives offered to 
doctors were intended to influence their referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 "These contracts almost never say you'll be paid for a referral," one law 
enforcement source said. "Often there is no evidence of quid pro quo." 
</P>
<P>
 But hospital industry officials and health care lawyers said National Medical 
gained a reputation during the 1980s for some of the most aggressive physician 
recruiting practices in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "National Medical set the standard for how far out on the limb you were going 
to go," one San Francisco health care lawyer said. "It became sort of a reverse 
arms race, where the most aggressive people set the standard." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sulzbach said National Medical began reviewing its hospital-doctor 
business deals in 1991, following widely publicized reports of problems in its 
psychiatric hospital business. "I think for the last three years we've been the 
most conservative in the industry," she said, "to the point where people who 
run our operation say we've been competitively disadvantaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Elliott Blinderman, president of West Coast Spine Institute, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulzbach described the Century City Hospital-West Coast Spine deal as a 
well-intentioned plan "to enhance our services" for the hospital's patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no commitment from these physicians that they would shift their 
practices away from UCLA or Cedars or that they would exclusively use Century 
City Hospital . . . " Sulzbach said. "Certainly we hoped that if we helped 
bring together this group of world-class physicians that some of their practice 
would be at Century City, and our patients would benefit from that. You hope 
they will be able to use some of the hospital's services. But that's part of 
doing business." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, she noted, the doctors finally began practicing together at 
an office in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical said in April that it expected to settle all federal and 
state fraud investigations for about $375 million, which would be the largest 
fraud settlement ever in the health care industry. Such an agreement would 
include any possible fraud charges against Century City Hospital.

FREEMAN SPOGLI OFFERS TO BUY STAKE IN KOLL MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles investment firm of Freeman Spogli & Co. has offered to buy a 
48% stake in Koll Management Services as part of a $23.6-million deal that 
would take the nation's second-largest industrial and office property manager 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Koll Management, based in Newport Beach, said Thursday that the 
buyout would enable the firm to continue an aggressive acquisition campaign. 
Purchases of other property management companies, such as Rubloff Inc. in 
Chicago, have nearly doubled Koll's portfolio to about 120 million square feet 
in the past year, but the costs of those acquisitions has cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow us to obtain additional financing to speed up our acquisition 
program," said Ray Wirta, chief executive of Koll. "We think this is an 
opportune time to be buying." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll went public in July, 1991, with an offering of 1.1 million shares priced 
at $10 each. The company was spun off from privately owned Koll Co., a real 
estate firm formed in 1962 by well-known Newport Beach developer Donald M. 
Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of falling rents and rising office vacancies during the real estate 
downturn of the early 1990s, however, Koll Management has posted only 
lackluster profits. The benefits of the company's recent buying spree has yet 
to bolster earnings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "KMS has not done well as a publicly traded company," said Mark Matheson, an 
analyst with the brokerage Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "The stock 
hardly trades. They just don't have the resources to attack everything on their 
plates right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout proposal boosted Koll Management's stock $2.75 a share to $14.75 in 
Thursday's Nasdaq trading, though only 8,700 shares changed hands.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Freeman pulls this off, they will get the company cheaply," said Lawrence 
Horan, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "Due to recent 
acquisitions, company earnings are still depressed. I would not be surprised if 
they were to double in the next three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Freeman Spogli would pay $15 a share for most of the stock 
now held by Koll Management's executives, plus all of the shares now publicly 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Koll, who is also chairman of Koll Management, would receive $6.6 
million for part of the 64% stake he now owns in the property management firm. 
Freeman Spogli would pay about $17 million for the public investors' stake, an 
estimated 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction would reduce Koll's ownership to 48%, provide Freeman Spogli a 
48% stake and give key employees of Koll Management the other 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has not yet been filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, is being studied by a special independent committee of the Koll 
Management board, which has hired lawyers and an investment banker to evaluate 
the plan, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 For its latest fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $56.7 million, up 
46%. Earnings rose 11% to $3 million, or 93 cents a share.

BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS SIGNS VIETNAM MARKETING AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beckman Instruments Inc. said Thursday that it has signed a dealer agreement 
to market its products in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealer, Europ Continents, also buys and resells Beckman equipment in Laos 
and Cambodia. Fullerton-based Beckman makes diagnostic equipment for hospitals 
and bioresearch equipment for life sciences laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asia-Pacific market, which makes up 13% of Beckman's business, is the 
fastest-growing region in the medical equipment industry, the company said. As 
Asian economies improve, growing middle classes are demanding better health 
care, said Louis Rosso, chairman and chief executive of Beckman. Universities 
and national research centers in Asia are also expanding and increasing demand 
for the company's products, he said.

 Pension Funds to Reject Kmart Stock Plan: The California Public Employees' 
Retirement System and New York City's pension fund said they will join several 
other large shareholders in voting against Kmart Corp.'s proposal to issue new 
classes of stock in its specialty retail divisions.CalPERS will also vote 
against Kmart management's slate of five incumbent directors to "express 
dissatisfaction with the board's stewardship," said Jose Arau, principal 
investment officer for CalPERS. The $82-billion fund, the largest public 
pension fund in the United States, owns 2.3 million Kmart shares. New York 
City's $50-billion pension fund will vote against the stock plan but not 
against the board. It owns 2.8 million Kmart shares.

SLOWER MAY RETAIL SALES REVERSE TREND; ECONOMY: UNSEASONABLE WEATHER, 
DISSATISFACTION WITH FASHIONS ARE CITED IN LULL AFTER STRING OF GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Retail sales slowed in May, falling victim to unseasonable weather and 
consumer disenchantment with the fashions at many stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The results announced Thursday created at least a temporary lull in the strong 
gains that most big retailers have enjoyed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a weather problem," said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & 
Co. He noted that temperatures were lower than normal in many parts of the 
country last month. "Merchants say the problem has been in shorts and tops and 
swimsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Terence McEvoy, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said the lower 
sales reflected women's continuing unhappiness with what's on the rack at 
apparel stores. "Everyone claims fashion is better, but I'm not sure the 
consumer believes it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have been dissatisfied with the clothing sold by many retailers for 
some time, although they did go on a buying spree before Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the problem was the weather or the styles, May results show that 
consumers remain frugal.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, they're willing to buy if the price is right -- J.C. Penny Co. and 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., which stress value in apparel selections, fared well last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line retailers -- those selling hardware, furniture, appliances and 
garden equipment -- were also hurt by the cooler weather, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several retailers said they were disappointed with their results. Allen 
Questrom, chairman of Federated Department Stores Inc., said business fell 
below his expectations, although home furnishing lines did well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salomon Bros. retail index, the investment firm's barometer of sales 
performance, rose 2.4% after a 3.3% gain in April and a 6.9% increase for the 
first quarter. In May, 1993, the index rose 3.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said sales from stores 
open at least a year rose 4.7% from May, 1993, while total sales were up 21%. 
The results were down sharply from Wal-Mart's strong pace earlier this year, 
reflecting continuing problems in its Sam's Club wholesale stores as well as 
the effects of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, are 
considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's strength. They exclude the 
results of newer stores, where sales tend to be high. Same-store sales also 
exclude results from stores closed over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart Corp., showing the effects of its sluggish discount store division, said 
same-store sales fell 2.5%, while overall business was up 1.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears said same-store sales advanced 8.8% and overall sales rose 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Penny said same-store sales at its flagship stores rose 5%, while total 
sales, including its drugstore and catalogue operations, rose 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 May Department Stores Co. reported a 1.1% same-store sales gain and a 4.5% 
overall increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated said same-store sales rose 1%, while overall business rose 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., owner of the Broadway chain, said same-store 
sales fell 4.2% in May. The company said total sales for the four weeks ended 
May 28 were $131.9 million, down 9.9% from $146.4 million a year earlier. The 
Los Angeles-based retailer said total sales remain affected by four stores 
closed as a result of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp. said same-store sales rose 3.5% while overall business 
gained 9.3%. The company owns department stores, the Target discount chain and 
the Mervyn's clothing chain. Mervyn's sales were below expectations, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited Inc. reported that same-store sales dropped 8% while overall business 
fell 1.9%. Gap Inc. said same-store sales rose 1%, while total sales picked up 
11%. 
</P>
<P>
 These results are narrower than the monthly retail sales report from the 
government, which includes sales from supermarkets, restaurants and car 
dealers. Those figures will be released June 14.

WORKERS STRIKE GM TECHNICAL CENTER; AUTOS: 3,500 EMPLOYEES PROTEST IN WEEK'S 
SECOND UAW WALKOUT. CHIEF ISSUE IS THE USE OF OUTSIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 3,500 General Motors Corp. employees went on strike Thursday in the 
second walkout this week at a major automotive technology center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, 850 workers began a strike at Chrysler Corp. Neither walkout will 
affect production of current cars but could disrupt design and engineering 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 United Auto Workers struck the centers after negotiators were unable to agree 
on local contracts. A chief issue is the auto makers' use of outsiders -- 
either contract workers or employees of GM suppliers -- inside the technology 
centers, working alongside union members, the UAW said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just plain doing the work," said David Corless, secretary-treasurer 
of UAW Local 412, which represents striking designers, model makers and other 
employees at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The main issue is the transfer of new technology," said Earl Hartman, first 
vice president of UAW Local 160, which represents the striking workers at GM's 
vast technical center in Warren, Mich. "What's happening here at the tech 
center is we've been part of the new technology . . . (and) management is 
transferring the work into the salaried work force and to outside contractors." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither GM nor Chrysler would comment on those issues. Bargaining at GM is 
scheduled to resume today. No talks were scheduled for Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler strikers make up about 12% of the 7,000 employees at its technology 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The GM strikers are part of a 20,000-employee force at a complex that includes 
headquarters for the company's North American operations and its Chevrolet and 
Cadillac divisions in addition to its design and research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said it believes the walkouts could hurt even though current car and 
truck production will be unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with the future product line at General Motors, so you won't see any 
immediate impact in the marketplace," Hartman said, but "our expertise in the 
prototype arena is every bit as important as the design and engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. auto makers have worked to reduce costs and shorten the process of 
developing new vehicles. One way they have done that is to involve suppliers in 
the early stages of planning and design. In some cases, that means supplier 
employees are placed in the technical centers, working with so-called platform 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a trend in industry worldwide," said Dale Brickner, associate director 
of the School of Labor and Industrial Relations at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Brickner said the conflict over the practice at GM and Chrysler is a logical 
outgrowth of disputes over "outsourcing," a word coined to describe auto 
makers' shift to buying components from non-union suppliers instead of using 
their own union workers to make them.

 AlliedSignal Inc. will provide auxiliary power units for Boeing Co.'s 
next-generation 737 jetliner, a contract the aerospace concern valued at $2 
billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 AlliedSignal's Torrance-based aerospace unit edged out Auxiliary Power 
International of San Diego, a Sundstrand Corp. subsidiary, for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing, the world's leading civilian aircraft manufacturer, expects to make 
about 2,000 of the airplanes, called the 737-X, with the first delivery set for 
October, 1997, to Southwest Airlines. Boeing said it has 63 firm orders for the 
plane, all from Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The auxiliary power unit, called the 131-9(B), supplies pneumatic power for 
cabin air conditioning and main engine ignition. It also provides electrical 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Cai Von Rumohr, aerospace analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston, said he had 
expected AlliedSignal, the world's leading APU manufacturer, to receive the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing that's going to hit (the bottom line) this year or next, but 
(it) will when the market starts to turn around in 1996 or 1997," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of AlliedSignal rose 62.5 cents to $35.375 on Thursday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 AlliedSignal also supplies auxiliary power units for the Boeing 777, the 
Airbus A330/340 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-90. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to auxiliary power units, the AlliedSignal Engines unit designs 
and makes turbofan and turboprop engines.

UPJOHN WINS ANOTHER LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER HALCION; PHARMACEUTICALS: A FEDERAL 
JUDGE IN MASSACHUSETTS DISMISSES A CLAIM THAT THE SLEEPING AID CAUSED A 
SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upjohn Co. has again beaten back legal claims that its sleep-inducing drug 
Halcion causes bizarre and sometimes violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company and some drug industry analysts said Thursday that they are 
skeptical about whether such victories will do much to change an image problem 
that has led to sinking sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to undo the story that gets implanted in people's minds 
when there's a whole string of negative media about the product," Upjohn 
spokeswoman Kaye Bennett said. "When patients say, 'Don't ever give me that 
drug Ed Bradley talked about on '60 Minutes' last night,' (doctors) aren't 
going to spend much time arguing . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Upjohn won a civil case Wednesday in Worcester, Mass., in which it was claimed 
that the drug caused a user to commit suicide. A federal judge issued a 
directed verdict dismissing the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time the drug maker has been exonerated of allegations that 
Halcion, once the most widely prescribed sleeping drug in the world, can cause 
suicidal, homicidal or psychotic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that Halcion can also cause depression and short-term memory 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 lawsuits involving Halcion have been filed against the Kalamazoo, 
Mich., company. Upjohn has settled some, Bennett said, but she declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Upjohn has lost one case, and even that was a partial loss. In 1992, 
a jury found Upjohn 20% responsible for the actions of a man who killed his 
best friend. The man and his doctor were given the rest of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has maintained that Halcion is safe and effective when used as 
recommended. Even if someone uses too much, Bennett said, "there is no 
scientific evidence . . . it causes any unexpected behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Halcion came under worldwide scrutiny in 1991 when British medical authorities 
banned its sale there because of concern over side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled that the drug could stay 
on the market in smaller dosages and carrying stronger warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Halcion hit its sales peak in 1988, when it generated $258 million for Upjohn. 
It was the company's No. 2 seller, behind the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales dropped precipitously after the controversy erupted in 1991. By 1993, 
sales had dropped to $121 million, and they have continued to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to Upjohn's worries is the fact that as of last fall, Halcion no longer 
enjoys patent protection. This means generic versions of it could be sold. 
There have been none so far, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two New York analysts say the legal victories should help Upjohn fight any 
future legal claims and reassure patients who already use the drug. But the 
persistence of the image problem and the threat of generic competition mean the 
days of strong sales are over, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Catch-22 for Upjohn is that if demand for Halcion were to increase 
because this cloud is slowly being lifted, (then) as soon as it becomes a 
product of significance, the more likely they are to face generic competition," 
said Carl Seiden, a drug analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halcion is unlikely ever to return to its robust period of sales growth, 
whether they experience legal victories or not," PaineWebber analyst Ronald 
Nordmann said. "It's an old, mature drug in decline and has lost its patent." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one analyst, Sharon Dorsey Wagoner of Argus Research, believes 
the legal victories could have a stronger effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the damage is irreparable," Wagoner said. "If the company can 
show efficacy or improve the image and offset the damage . . then there is a 
chance for almost any product to regain lost market share."

 Credit Lyonnais Reaffirms MGM Support: Jean Peyrelevade, who became chairman 
of the French bank late last year, said after a visit to the Santa Monica 
studio that the bank is committed to its current plan of rebuilding MGM before 
selling it. Banking laws require Credit Lyonnais to sell the studio, which it 
acquired after former owner Giancarlo Parretti defaulted on loans, by 1997. The 
statement is being viewed in Hollywood as another attempt by the bank to quash 
frequent rumors that it is about to sell the studio.

 Milken Partnership Sues Beatrice: Carlton Investments, an investor group 
founded by convicted financier Michael Milken, is suing TLC Beatrice 
International Holdings Inc., contending management has squandered resources of 
the nation's leading black-owned company. The lawsuit, filed in Chancery Court 
in Delaware, where TLC Beatrice is incorporated, raised pressure on the family 
of founder Reginald Lewis, which has been running the company since his death 
from brain cancer in January, 1993.Milken is a stockholder in TLC Beatrice 
through his Carlton partnership, which owns a 26% stake and a seat on the TLC 
Beatrice board. Carlton said it is suing to force Beatrice to surrender company 
accounting books and records so the partnership can accurately evaluate the 
worth of its investment. Beatrice's stock is not publicly traded, and its inner 
workings have largely been kept from public view.

 Boeing Gets 777 Certification Guidelines: The Federal Aviation Administration 
issued a new set of guidelines that the jetliner must meet in order to obtain 
early certification to fly overseas routes.By issuing the guidelines, known as 
ETOPs for extended-range twin-engine operations, the FAA has essentially told 
Boeing that certification is possible before the new twin jet goes into 
operation. The first 777 is to be delivered to United Airlines in May, 1995, 
and Boeing hopes that by then the plane will be the first ever to be certified 
for overseas routes before customers fly on it. Usually, planes are given 
overseas certification only after establishing in-service reliability records.

 Rockwell May Unload Unit: The defense contractor said it may sell, spin off or 
strategically link its Switching Systems division with another company to 
maintain its leadership in telephone call processing.Switching Systems, based 
in Downers Grove, Ill., pioneered technology used by companies such as 
airlines, home shopping networks and financial institutions to handle a large 
number of incoming or outgoing calls. Rockwell said it has hired Dillon, Read & 
Co. to help it evaluate alternatives to ensure the unit's dominance in the 
rapidly evolving call center market, while providing maximum shareholder value. 
A spokeswoman said a sale or strategic alliance would probably involve 
telecommunications and information companies.

 Dean Witter Cuts IBM Rating: An analyst cut the rating on International 
Business Machines Corp. to "neutral" from "accumulate," market sources said, 
sending the stock down sharply.Jay Stevens, the analyst, was not available for 
comment. IBM stock closed off $1.50 to $62 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
According to traders, Stevens said IBM's stock is selling at 19.5 and 13.4 
times 1994 and 1995 earnings, respectively, and that it is likely to encounter 
some selling in the mid-$60s range. Traders also said Stevens sees IBM earnings 
in the second half of 1994 coming in line with aggressive Wall Street 
estimates, after a strong second quarter, which ends June 30.

 Stock prices rallied modestly Thursday, boosted by lower bond yields, but 
investors stayed pretty much on the sidelines ahead of today's employment data 
for May. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields fell on both short- and long-term issues, 
responding to new economic reports suggesting a slowdown in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the 30-year Treasury bond yield was at 7.34%, down from 7.39% on 
Wednesday. The one-year T-bill yield dropped to 5.27% from 5.36%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the 
New York Stock Exchange, a healthy ratio. But the Dow industrial average eased 
1.84 points to 3,758.99, hurt by declines in IBM and Sears shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in both stock and bond markets was moderate, which analysts said was a 
reflection of investors' nervousness about today's employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 "After being burned the past couple of months by the employment figures, 
investors are a little gun-shy about making big bets before the numbers come 
out," said James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the bond market was clearly heartened by economic reports Thursday 
pointing to slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said its chief forecasting gauge, the index of leading 
economic indicators, was unchanged in April and that orders to U.S. factories 
declined 0.1% in April, the second drop in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 A strengthening in the dollar was also cited by some traders as helping bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar broke out of a narrow range against the German mark, fetching 1.653 
marks in New York, up from Wednesday's 1.645. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders attributed the rise to technical factors and optimism about 
today's employment figures. In any case, a stronger dollar encourages foreign 
investors to buy U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also said overseas investors were rumored to be moving into the U.S. 
bond market to escape the recent turmoil in European bonds, where yields have 
been surging on expectations of renewed economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think there's money coming back home from abroad," said James 
McGroarty, managing director at Athena Global Investments in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in London on Thursday, bond yields finally pulled back from their recent 
highs, falling nearly one-third of a percentage point as buyers rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "With yields near 9%, even if inflation pushes toward 4% next year, that 
equates to 5% real yields," said Chris Anthony, head of bond research at ABN 
Amro Hoare Govett Sterling Bonds Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement in the British bond market helped push the FTSE-100 stock 
index in London up 48.9 points to 2,980.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris shares also rallied, with the CAC index up 27.70 points to 2,007.38. The 
Frankfurt market was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average ended down 44.11 points at 21,009.00, 
after having climbed as high as 21,198.74, topping its best level of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index added 7.08 points to 2,446.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers' stocks reacted to May sales reports. Sears fell 1 3/4 to 50 
despite reporting an 8.8% rise in May same-store sales, or sales at stores open 
at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Penney was also lower, down 2 to 49 3/4 after saying same-store sales 
rose 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among retail winners were Circuit City, up 1 1/2 to 21 1/4; Good Guys, up 1 
1/4 to 13 1/4, and Nordstrom, up 3/4 to 43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM fell 1 1/2 to 62 after brokerage Dean Witter downgraded the stock to 
"neutral" based on its recent price appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial stocks continued to rally. Ahmanson gained 5/8 to 19 3/8, 
California Federal Bank rose 1/2 to 12, Coast Savings jumped 1 to 16 and First 
Chicago added 1 to 54 1/4. Banking shares generally gain when investors expect 
interest rates to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues rebounded, including Caterpillar, up 1 1/8 to 106 
5/8; Clark Equipment, up 1 3/8 to 65 5/8, and Ameron, up 1 3/4 to 37 7/8. Also, 
engineering giant Fluor jumped 2 to 53 3/4 on strong second-quarter earnings. 
</P>

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY ; IDB MUST PROVE THAT ITS BOOKS WEREN'T 
COOKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When IDB Communications Group's stock price collapsed on Wednesday in the wake 
of news that its auditors quit in a huff, the firm's 38-year-old founder admits 
he faced the same basic question over and over again from shareholders: Was he 
a crook? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Jeffrey Sudikoff insists, he's not a crook. He understands that he must 
prove that, he says, and probably in court. (The shareholder lawsuits are 
already piling up.) But whatever else people may say about him, Sudikoff has 
900 employees, tons of telecommunications hardware and a long list of clients 
worldwide to show that his 10-year-old, Culver City-based firm isn't some 
grandiose fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The devil, however, is in the details, and that's why Wall Street sent the 
stock plummeting from $14.50 on Tuesday to $7.125 by Wednesday's close in wild 
trading. IDB's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, abruptly resigned in a dispute over 
certain IDB accounting practices. IDB says the disagreements are minor. But 
until Deloitte gives its side of the story (expected soon) many investors will 
assume the worst -- that IDB's books have been cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, this is probably what we'll find out: IDB didn't grossly 
misrepresent its sales and earnings growth over the past few years. But in 
remaking itself from a $61-million TV-radio signal relayer in 1989 to a 
$311-million global long- distance phone firm by 1993, IDB was guilty of too 
much hype and overly "aggressive" accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a game that many small companies play. Wall Street wants hot stocks, 
and once it identifies a "growth stock," analysts create high standards for the 
firm to meet each quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 If your earnings come in under expectations just once, your stock may fall 
almost as much as if, say, your auditors were to quit. And if, like IDB, you're 
using stock to make big acquisitions in your fast-growing industry -- competing 
with giants like AT&T and MCI -- you need a high share price. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, companies like IDB find themselves in the business of managing earnings. 
With a sharp pencil, you can adjust your numbers -- take a capital gain here, 
delay a charge there -- to make your quarterly results meet estimates. Wall 
Street understands this and doesn't much care, as long as the basic trend in 
the business is strongly up. 
</P>
<P>
 Purists may argue that there is only one set of accounting rules, and that 
aggressive accounting is by definition wrong. But the reality is that "there's 
discretion in accounting, and companies can be more aggressive" if they choose, 
says Bruce Miller, a professor of that trade at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the auditor is to make sure that aggressiveness doesn't turn into 
outright fraud. Deloitte, in giving unqualified opinions in support of IDB's 
financial reports in 1992 and 1993, effectively said IDB's growth was for real. 
If it now recants, Deloitte's liability could be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have aggressive accounting and a unique business that has subtleties of 
accounting? Yes," Sudikoff admits. But Deloitte "never had a problem with that 
in that past," he says. Disagreements about the numbers in 1992 and 1993 were 
always ironed out, Sudikoff says. And he notes, correctly, that it isn't 
unusual for companies and their auditors to have disagreements on details. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Deloitte partner handling IDB changed this year, the disagreements, 
from Deloitte's view, evidently became insurmountable. Why? IDB President 
Edward Cheramy says it was a personality clash, not a major accounting issue. 
We'll have to wait and hear from Deloitte. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is not to paint IDB as a poor victim. There's a reasonable 
argument that IDB was setting itself up for a fall. It has fed the hype machine 
with way too many self-congratulatory press releases about its expanding client 
base in global long-distance. And when Sudikoff bought into the Los Angeles 
Kings hockey team this year, Wall Street worried he had delusions of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's only one real issue here: Does IDB have a viable franchise? 
Tony Robertson, analyst at brokerage Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore, notes 
simply that "global telecom is deregulating, and somebody is going to be a 
competitor to AT&T (in international long distance)." IDB, among others, is 
already there; whether it can stay there, or make good money at it, is the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, some investors felt intrigued enough with IDB's potential to bid 
the battered stock up $1.19 to $8.31 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff says three major accounting firms are already vying for IDB's 
account. Assuming new auditors certify that IDB has grown as claimed, Sudikoff 
says his course in global long-distance will stay the same: Eat, or be eaten. 
And he concedes that with his stock cut in half, IDB is now as much a potential 
target as it is an acquirer. How IDB Grew Key financial data for IDB

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY ; WALT DISNEY'S 'RETURN OF THE 
REBATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Return of Jafar," the sequel to Walt Disney's best-selling "Aladdin" 
videocassette, could well be subtitled "The Return of the Rebate." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are being offered a $10 rebate on "The Return of Jafar" if they also 
purchase certain Pillsbury cake mixes and-or Mattel toys. In the case of 
"Aladdin," consumers received rebates if they bought Colgate toothpaste and 
toothbrushes -- and remembered to send in receipts and proofs of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're planning a bake sale -- or an early Christmas -- the "Jafar" 
rebate deal isn't for you. You must spend at least $6 on icing and three boxes 
of cake mix by the end of June to get the $5 rebate from Pillsbury. To get the 
rebate from Mattel, you must buy one of four toys at prices ranging from $8 to 
$30. (The parents of boys should be mad: The toys aimed at boys -- a rocket set 
and a racing car set -- cost between $25 and $30, while two dolls in the offer, 
presumably for girls, cost $8 each.) 
</P>
<P>
 In order to get the $10 rebate, consumers end up spending between $15 and $40 
over the cost of the video, usually between $15 and $22. Quite a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't count on the rebate to lower the cost of the video, what's a good 
price for "Jafar"? Amy Innerfield of the New York consulting firm Alexander & 
Associates said retailers are paying between $13 and $15 for the video. 
Merchants selling "The Return of Jafar" at those prices are forgoing profits on 
it to lure you into their stores.

 Here's a real vote of confidence: As the summer beach season gets under way, 
Weight Watchers International is reaching out to former clients. The unit of 
Heinz Inc. is mailing them coupons that can be redeemed for free Avon skin 
creams and lotions. 
</P>
<P>
 A reward for people who have managed to keep the weight off? Hardly. To use 
the coupons, former clients must be at least two pounds over their "goal 
weights" and be willing to "come back to Weight Watchers" to shed the extra 
pounds. The coupons can be redeemed only at participating Weight Watchers 
centers.

 Food fight: Big Bird is readying to take on Ninja Turtles for control of the 
lunch table. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Food Products this summer will introduce "Sesame Street" canned 
pastas, with less sodium, sugar and fat than its line of Chef Boyardee pastas, 
some shaped like sharks, dinosaurs or Ninja Turtles. Product manager Barbara 
Pound says American Home reduced amounts of those ingredients at the insistence 
of Children's Television Workshop, producers of "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Sesame Street" pastas aren't low in sodium. The amount per serving ranges 
from 240 to 520 milligrams, depending on the kind of sauce. (Meat sauces have 
more.) The government defines a low-sodium food as one containing 140 
milligrams of sodium or less.

 Odds and ends: The personal touch: Inside an envelope addressed to "Resident" 
is a questionnaire from Watterson College in Pasadena that begins, "You have

. . . Money machine: American Express is testing sales of traveler's checks 
through automated teller machines in Dallas, Boston and Hartford, Conn. . . . 
Name game: The Federal Trade Commission has reached a false-advertising 
settlement with Beverly Hills Weight Loss Clinics, which runs nine Eastern 
centers from a headquarters in Portsmouth, R.I. The allegations involved claims 
about the price and success of the program, not the name.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; BMG, TCI HALT PLAN FOR MUSIC CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't want their MTV, or each other for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Berteslmann Music Group and Tele-Communications Inc. confirmed Thursday that 
they have dropped plans to launch a music video network. The two companies 
blamed the decision on "changing market conditions" and said they will continue 
to discuss other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The BMG-TCI channel, announced last year, was supposed to combine music and 
retailing through sales of music-related products such as concert tickets and 
CDs. By trading on their combined strengths -- TCI is the country's largest 
operator of cable systems, and BMG owns RCA, Arista and other record labels -- 
the companies intended to mount a challenge to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 But those plans began to unravel this year when Warner Music Group, Sony 
Software, EMI Music, PolyGram Holding and Ticketmaster announced plans to start 
another music network. Analysts said TCI and BMG would be hard-pressed to 
compete with the new rival, given the superstar acts aligned with those 
companies and Ticketmaster's telecommunications reach. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI declined to comment on reports that its chief executive, John C. Malone, 
personally pulled the plug on the network Thursday. But TCI and BMG both left 
open the possibility that they will join the network being developed by Warner, 
Sony, Ticketmaster and the others.

 Universal Pictures Chairman Tom Pollock raised a few eyebrows earlier this 
week by handing "green light" authority and other broad responsibilities to 
newly named studio President Casey Silver. But knowledgeable sources say that 
may have been the only way to keep Silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive, who has maintained an unusually low profile while working as 
Pollock's production president for the past five years, is said to have 
demanded a more significant role as part of a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casey would not have stayed without getting that additional responsibility," 
said one source with close ties to the studio. "They (MCA/Universal) seem to be 
intent on keeping stable management, and the only way to maintain that 
stability was by giving Casey more authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Stability is a hallmark of MCA, Universal's parent company. Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg like to point out that their 
combined tenure there exceeds 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA may have tipped its hand to what was in store earlier this year when it 
expanded Pollock's duties as part of his long-negotiated contract renewal. 
Aside from his studio responsibilities, Pollock is quietly working to resolve 
threats to United International Pictures, the international distributor under 
fire in Europe on antitrust grounds. He is also looking for ways to pump up 
MCA's minority-owned Cineplex Odeon movie theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our business, once you've expanded your own arena, you're much more 
comfortable delegating," one executive said, referring to Pollock's willingness 
to share more power with Silver. "And Casey's responsibilities are real." 
</P>
<P>
 People who have worked with Silver do not foresee any big policy changes at 
the studio. Like Pollock, they say, Silver is attracted to star-driven projects 
and high-concept material. Universal's two biggest suppliers also happen to be 
two of the industry's most mainstream companies: Steven Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment ("Jurassic Park," "Schindler's List" and "The Flintstones") and 
Imagine Films Entertainment ("The Paper" and "Parenthood"). 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, who came up through the production ranks, is well-liked by talent. One 
producer says Silver thinks like a filmmaker. "He understands the process and 
is passionate about it," the producer said. "That's not always true with people 
in that job." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Universal has been criticized for ceding too much control to 
big-name talent, especially during the long box office slump that was finally 
broken by "Jurassic" last summer. "They have a tendency to get very deeply into 
expensive movies without thinking what they're doing," said one critic, who 
asked not to be named. "They also allow themselves to be muscled into doing a 
lot of bad movies. Other studios have more calm and self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal's upcoming films include "The Cowboy Way," "The Shadow," "Demon 
Knight," "The Little Rascals" and "Junior," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
After a string of duds that included "The Getaway" and "Greedy," the studio hit 
pay dirt over Memorial Day weekend, when "The Flintstones" took in $37.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Its upcoming slate also includes "Waterworld," starring Kevin Costner. The 
studio has denied reports that the film's budget has spiraled past $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>

 Rupert Murdoch's honeymoon seems to have been short-lived. After being 
showered with accolades for his masterful raid on CBS affiliates last week, the 
Fox Inc. leader is being challenged on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) on Thursday accused Murdoch of treating African 
Americans with "apparent contempt" by scratching "Roc," "South Central" and 
"Sinbad" from the Fox network's fall schedule. The Congressional Black Caucus 
is expected to take up the cancellations on Wednesday, based on a complaint 
from "South Central" producers Ralph Farquhar and Michael J. Weithorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Towns, a former chairman of the CBC, accused Murdoch of offering "plantation 
programming" in place of the racier, youth-oriented shows that built Fox. 
"Apparently, as the network moves to become more mainstream, its attitude to 
positive black programs is, 'We don't need, nor want them anymore,' " Towns 
charged in a statement. Fox has said the shows were canceled because of poor 
ratings. It also pointed out it is airing "Mantis," the first black superhero 
TV show this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, federal regulators say they are reviewing Murdoch's purchase of 
six prominent TV stations in 1985. At issue is whether the deal violated laws 
prohibiting foreign ownership of U.S. broadcasting properties. Murdoch denies 
any impropriety.

 Multimedia: Video rental giant Blockbuster Corp. and film producer John Davis 
are expected to announce a joint venture Tuesday in an interactive technology 
firm called Catapult, to be headed by former Sony Pictures new-media guru Adam 
Grosser. Davis' father, billionaire Marvin Davis, is also an investor in the 
venture, sources close to the deal said.They said the firm's technology team 
has developed a system that will allow home video game players to compete with 
each other over standard phone lines without the delayed reaction time that has 
so far been a stumbling block for on-line multi-player gaming. The Catapult 
system can be used with any existing video game cartridge and is said to be 
compatible with all cartridge-based game machines. Consumers would plug a phone 
line into a jack on the device, dial a number and be connected to a national 
game service. The firm hopes to capitalize on game players' desire to compete 
with each other rather than against a machine. Blockbuster and Davis declined 
to comment. AMY HARMON

that the company, which owns more than 100,000 copyrights, has profit of $5 
million to $7 million annually and could be sold for as much as $150 million to

 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Thursday that Stanley Skinner, the company's 
president and chief operating officer, will succeed Richard Clarke as chief 
executive on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, 64, will remain chairman of the utility until June 1, 1995, when PG&E 
bylaws mandate his retirement. He may remain on the board as a director until 
age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced that Robert Glynn Jr., currently a senior vice 
president and general manager for customer energy services, will become 
executive vice president on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Jerry McLeod, 58, who led the company through the 
restructuring of its natural gas business during the past five years, will 
leave PG&E "to pursue other interests," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said he is accelerating the company's management succession plan by a 
year because "the team that will be leading PG&E in the future should be making 
decisions that will shape that future." 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the next few years will bring greater change to PG&E than 
the last 10 to 15 years because of proposed restructuring of electric services 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke became chairman and chief executive of the San Francisco-based utility 
in 1986. Skinner, 56, has been president and chief operating officer since 
1991.

CITICORP SELLS ITS 44% STAKE IN PIP PRINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citicorp has sold its 44% stake in Agoura Hills-based PIP Printing to majority 
owner Kane-Miller, PIP said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane-Miller, a privately held investment firm based in Tarrytown, N.Y., is now 
the sole owner of PIP, a pioneer in the $6-billion-a-year instant printing 
business.The purchase price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane-Miller bought out Citicorp's share as part of its plan to pump more money 
into PIP's operations, spokeswoman Susan Falck said. The company would not 
provide further details of its plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, PIP, which has 745 outlets nationwide, has been sued by 
numerous franchisees, who claim the company has failed to provide technical 
support and regional advertising as promised. In turn, the company last year 
filed suit against many of its franchisees for failing to pay royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 PIP is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for possible 
violations of franchise disclosure rules. The company said the investigation is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 PIP, formerly known as Postal Instant Press, was founded in 1968 by Los 
Angeles commercial printer Bill Levine. It was taken over in a $68-million 
leveraged buyout involving Kane-Miller and management in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp, which put up $53 million to finance the takeover, forgave the loan 
in 1992 in return for PIP stock.

SURVEY SAYS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AMONG WORKING WOMEN RISES WITH INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The incidence of substance abuse among working women rises with their incomes, 
while among men the reverse is true, experts said at a conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of women earning less than $12,000 a year, 10.2% reported substance abuse, 
compared to 26.8% of men in the same income bracket, said Terry Blum, a 
professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Management.  
</P>
<P>
 Of women making more than $30,000 a year, 14.4% reported substance abuse, 
compared to 10.5% of the men in the same wage category, Blum said, citing a 
1988 survey of 8,800 households that defined substance abuse as use of 
marijuana, cocaine and other drugs, as well as excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the substance abuse among working women in particular can be traced to 
the stress of managing both job and family roles, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in traditionally male-dominated fields drink more than women in 
female-dominated fields, according to data released at the conference. These 
women are more influenced by male values and cite unhappiness as a cause of 
their drinking, the research shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidence of substance abuse was 11% to 12% among women in manufacturing, 
retail trades and professions, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of women ages 18 to 34 with full-time jobs, 10.6%, or 1.9 million, reported 
illicit drug use, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug and alcohol abuse by women causes serious problems in the workplace, 
particularly because 70% of women who are substance abusers hold down jobs, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those problems are lower productivity, higher absenteeism, more 
workplace accidents, increased health care costs, theft, and the price of 
prevention and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that overall, employees who abuse drugs and alcohol take more 
than twice as many sick days as other employees and file for twice as many 
health care benefits, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are five times as likely to file workers' compensation claims and three 
times as likely to have workplace accidents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They cost U.S. business an additional $50 billion in additional health 
insurance, Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 women in the United States will die this year of illnesses 
related to substance abuse, more than four times the  
</P>
<P>
 number who will die of breast cancer, said Joseph Califano, former secretary 
of health, education and welfare and founder of the Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those women, about 77% will die from tobacco-related illnesses, 20% from 
alcohol-related illnesses and 3% from drug-related illnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was sponsored by CASA and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; MANAGEMENT TEAM FOR ITT FEDERAL BANK SHIFTS TO BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli: Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since its president left 14 months ago, fast-growing ITT Federal Bank has 
gradually shifted its management team from Irvine to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan, one of the financial subsidiaries of giant ITT Corp. in 
New York, still has its three full-service branches in Orange County and a 
business office in Irvine.But the top corporate officers are in the Bay Area, 
and many of them report to the immediate parent company, ITT Residential 
Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the management group turned over, we found ourselves replacing them (with 
executives) in the Bay Area," said Graham J. Williams, the S&L's chairman, 
president and chief executive. He holds the same positions with ITT 
Residential. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in corporate headquarters, though, isn't intended to signal a 
possible sale or an end to the S&L's presence in Orange County, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, ITT Federal nearly doubled its size in a year as its loans, 
investments and other holdings grew from $1.7 billion at the end of 1992 to 
$3.2 billion a year later. Its assets at the end of April rose to $3.8 million. 
With half of its mortgage loans made in Texas, the Pacific Northwest and New 
England, ITT Federal earned $25 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the bank very much, and we like being involved in Orange County," 
Williams said. "The thrift is the heart of our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who lived in Orange County for 10 years, still spends much of his 
work time in Southern California. He said he and other executives find the 
commute easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&L was opened 15 years ago as Newport Balboa Savings Bank in Newport 
Beach. It was sold to ITT in 1983 and now has branches in Newport Beach and 
Garden Grove.

FLUOR POSTS SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT OF $47.7 MILLION; EARNINGS: STOCK VALUE RISES 
ON BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED RESULTS, WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTED TO A DIVERSIFICATION 
STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fluor Corp.'s stock rose about 4% Thursday after the giant construction and 
engineering company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted a profit of $47.7 million, or 58 cents a share, for its 
second fiscal quarter, which ended April 30. That compared to earnings of $42 
million, or 51 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue was 
$2.1 billion, up 4% from $2 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six-month period, Fluor said its earnings rose to $91.7 million, or 
$1.11 a share, from $77.6 million, or 94 cents a share, for the same period a 
year earlier. Six-month revenue was $4.1 billion, up from $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's backlog of orders at the end of the quarter stood at $2.2 
billion, down slightly from $2.3 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, rose $2 a share Thursday to 
close at $53.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Les McCraw, chief executive, said in a statement that the Irvine-based 
company's core construction unit, Fluor Daniel Corp., posted a profit increase 
of 20%. The results show that the company's diversification strategy to expand 
its construction services and to reach beyond oil refinery construction is 
working, McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were better than most Wall Street analysts had anticipated, said 
Herb Hart, a San Francisco analyst for S.G. Warburg Group, a London-based 
investment bank. As a result, several analysts raised their projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did better in the coal business, where prices were better than usual," 
Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's A.T. Massey unit mines and sells low-sulfur coal. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Fluor announced Thursday that Chief Financial Officer James O. 
Rollans, 51, was promoted to senior vice president and chief administrative 
officer, with responsibility for coordinating the company's administrative 
functions, such as legal and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Michal Conaway, 45, vice president of finance, will succeed Rollans as 
chief financial officer. Fluor Corp. Earnings

 S&L Sale Possible: Independence One Bank of California is a savings and loan 
that its owner has long yearned to convert into a bank. Instead, the owner may 
peddle the Mission Viejo institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National Corp., which received government aid to buy the failed 
Beverly Hills Savings & Loan on the last day of 1988, has hired an investment 
bank to help it make some financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. will "review an array of financial matters" and 
will "look into all aspects of the company," including a possible sale of the 
thrift, said Michigan National spokeswoman Ariadne Magoulias. 
</P>
<P>
 But she quickly added a caveat: 
</P>
<P>
 "Independence One Bank of California is doing an excellent job, and we have no 
plans at this time to consider a sale, but we are constantly looking at our 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward H. Sondker, Independence One's president, said the decision is one for 
the holding company to make after it evaluates reports from Keefe Bruyette. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's environment, you can never predict what can happen," Sondker said. 
"But for the immediate future, no firm decision has been made one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Independence One, with $750 million in loans and other assets, has seen the 
number of its mortgage fundings drop significantly this year as the boom in 
home refinancings died with recent rises in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National, based in a Detroit suburb, could be looking at a sale of 
the thrift as a way to improve what some analysts see as a lagging performance. 
It has already agreed to sell its two Texas banks in a deal that is expected to 
give it a net gain of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With $10 billion in assets, Michigan National has also been under some 
pressure by investors to sell itself to the highest bidder. But its chairman, 
Robert J. Mylod, told shareholders at its annual meeting in April that 
directors unanimously agreed to keep the banking company independent.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LAWSUIT ACCUSES MCGAW BUYER OF SECURITIES FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former chairman of an Irvine medical products company filed a lawsuit 
Thursday in federal court against the Miami company that acquired it, accusing 
that company and its chairman of securities fraud, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Sweeney alleges in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa 
Ana, that IVAX Corp. and Chairman Phillip Frost misrepresented their company's 
financial condition before it acquired McGaw, a maker of intravenous products, 
last March.IVAX is a leading producer of generic pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Sweeney, who resigned from McGaw in February, said in a statement 
that IVAX issued false and misleading predictions of the value of its 
best-selling product, a drug called Verapamil. But when the first-quarter 
results were issued, earnings declined compared to the fourth quarter, which 
led IVAX's stock to drop from a high of more than $38 to $16.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Sweeney alleges that McGaw shareholders did not receive the 
proper value from the $600-million transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sweeney nor Frost or their lawyers could be reached for comment.

CARE PROGRAMS TURNING ATTENTION TO SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN; FAMILIES: CONSULTING 
SERVICES AND EMPLOYERS ARE BROADENING THE HELP THEY OFFER, NO LONGER FOCUSING 
ONLY ON PRESCHOOLERS AND THE ELDERLY.

 Natalie Hay was desperate. She and her husband both worked full time, and her 
two teen-age children refused to do homework in the afternoons after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real problem," said Hay, who works with Society National Bank in 
Columbus, Ohio. "Their report cards said they were always missing their 
assignments. I'd tried everything, including grounding them." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hay called a counseling service that suggested drawing up a contract 
allowing the teens to determine homework hours and the punishment if they 
weren't kept. The last two report cards showed the two haven't missed any 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, run by the Boston consulting group Work-Family Directions, is one 
of many new programs responding to a growing cry for help from working parents 
with school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 When many companies started recognizing in the 1980s that employees needed 
help balancing work and family if they were to be productive, most attention 
was given to preschool and elder care. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, although much remains to be done in those areas, a new wave of dependent 
care programs is beginning to help some parents cope with children's vacations, 
as well as the time before and after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "As society has aged, the bulge in the work force that seven or eight years 
ago was screaming for preschool care now needs school-age care," said Jonathan 
Carson, president of the Educational Publishing Group. "It's a real problem for 
parents, trying to fill a huge amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing number of working women, of single-parent families and the 
increasing concerns about safety and education have pushed many parents to the 
edge, said Betty Southwick of Work-Family Directions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 57 million women now work outside the home. Some 40% have at least one 
child, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And while 18 million 
working parents have children under age 5, 28 million have children of school 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are concerned about the preschool years, but they are obsessed with 
the next 10 years," said Ted Childs, director of work force diversity programs 
at International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the changes in their employees' lives, companies are starting to 
sign up for counseling and referral services that help. Some of the most 
progressive firms are sponsoring or helping to set up summer camps, vacation 
activities and before- and after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Work-Family Directions, set up two years ago, averages 300 calls a week from 
parents needing practical advice from guidance counselors, principals, 
teachers, college admissions personnel and others in education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Educational Publishing Group puts out a newsletter eight times a year 
discussing trends in education as well as resolving work and family conflicts. 
It's aimed at parents with school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication, first issued in 1990, is free to employees of the 70 
subscribing companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Dow Chemical Co. 
The companies pay $5 to $9 annually per subscription. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed that work and family programs primarily focused on preschool and 
elder care," Carson said. "We try to plug the gap for parents of school-age 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hancock Financial Services in Boston is among the pioneers in addressing 
the concerns of parents of older children. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the company started a program to help employees and their families 
after surveys showed workers were having a tough time handling after-school 
hours and vacations, said Kathy Hazzard, director of work-family programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Kids-to-Go, parents can bring children of ages 6 through 14 to the 
office during vacations in February, April and the last week of June and on 
Columbus Day. From there, a staff takes not more than 50 children on trips to 
local museums, the beach, roller skating or elsewhere. The day trips cost $20 
and are so popular that there was a waiting list for the most recent one. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees have told Hazzard they would be hard pressed to leave Hancock 
because of its school-age program as well as its on-site child care center for 
200 preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company with programs specifically for older children is AT&T, which 
has invested $2.4 million in 117 such projects in 80 communities, said Deborah 
Stahl, director of the company's Family Care Development Fund. Many of those 
are in their first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all companies have been willing or able to commit the time and resources 
to such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have addressed the issue through the American Business Collaboration 
for Quality Dependent Care, companies that pool resources to address issues 
related to work and family conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of the initiatives sponsored nationwide by the 
collaboration, which is now in its second year, are related to school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 One is an after-school program at an elementary school in downtown New York. 
There, about 270 kindergarten through sixth-grade children can choose from a 
range of activities between 3 and 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for care at Manhattan Youth Recreation and Resources is less than 
many after-school programs, but still relatively steep at $1,750 per year for 
five days a week of care. Manhattan Youth offers $80,000 in scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents with school-age children can't afford such programs and 
corporations do little to subsidize them, said Michelle Seligson, director of 
the School-Age Child Care Project at Wellesley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one-third of the programs receive some sort of government or private 
support, research by Seligson's group and others has found. She said that 
leaves "a huge number of the children of the working poor out on the streets 
during vacations and after school." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at programs that are largely still middle class," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, she said, about 3 million children are enrolled in some sort of 
after-school program.

THE SCENE: BOYZ UNDER THE HOOD; THERE'S PLENTY OF VINTAGE HORSEPOWER RUMBLING 
DOWN THE STREETS OF O.C., WHERE YOUNG MENARE HAVING THE RIDE OF THEIR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When it comes to the Twilight Zone of fiction-meets-reality, I've always been 
haunted by "Christine," the film based on Stephen King's novel. In it, the star 
and namesake, a '58 Plymouth with all the muscle of a bodybuilder jacked up on 
steroids, flexes demonic powers on whomever comes between her and her teen 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if I'm living in fear of the day when automobiles wake from the 
dead to rebel against those who don't lube or wax. No, it's the psycho teen 
protagonist and his obsession over a car that freaks me out. I do, after all, 
know firsthand that these guys exist. 
</P>
<P>
 My best friend, Mark, who used to drive me and my girlfriends to rockabilly 
gigs while we were in high school, had a peculiar relationship with his 1961 
Chrysler New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 We were allowed to ride in it only so we could experience the car's power: the 
413-cubic-inch, ram-inducted engine could catapult us 140 m.p.h. down the 
freeway at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But get within a foot of its polished Tahitian turquoise exterior and Mark was 
there ensuring we wouldn't so much as breathe, let alone lean, on it. Yeah, and 
eventually the engine was clean enough to dine off of. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when I see guys rumbling out of high school parking lots in their 
super-souped up vintage rides, copping me an attitude as I let them pass my 
wanna-be sporty Toyota Paseo, I just can't return the vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intimidating hearing the engine rev," assures Serra High senior Rob 
Taylor of Laguna Niguel. Though he adds he's got nothing to prove, Rob, 18, 
enjoys tapping the gas pedal of his 1967 Camaro SuperSport with the 450 
horsepower.  
</P>
<P>
 He gets five to eight miles a gallon and drives about 250 miles a week -- most 
of the time with no particular destination. "Sometimes I drive around just for 
the hell of it," Rob says. "It's better than sitting at home watching TV. I 
might drive around aimlessly -- but in style." 
</P>
<P>
 Such style costs him $7 of high octane every day . "It's a daily ritual," Rob 
says. Why not save himself the hassle and just fill 'er up? "I'll just use it 
up that same day cruising around," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rob, Silverado High senior Gordon Smeed of Mission Viejo spends much of 
his time and money behind the wheel of his mighty machine. It's a 1965 Pontiac 
Le Mans with a 326 cubic inch engine, all original parts, all the numbers (of 
the parts) match and even all the original receipts, he says in one deep 
breath. (The more original a classic, combined with all its original paperwork, 
the greater the financial value.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon eases down the main streets of town or along beach-bound strips on any 
given night of the week, always with the windows rolled down, better to hear 
the accolades from passersby. The frosty Meridian blue ride glows from the 
interior lights he replaced with blue bulbs, turning it into "the blue light 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 His buddies cruise with him, but in their own muscle cars. Apparently, he can 
only carry one passenger in the car or the oversized back tires will scrape up 
the inner wheel wells. The idea is to try to tuck in as much tire as possible 
for greater traction. 
</P>
<P>
 His queen, Silverado junior Dena Pinnell, usually gets the esteemed passenger 
seat. For weekend jaunts, Gordon soups up the engine, like adjusting the 
carburetor. "Little things to make it stronger," he says. The result is lower 
mileage, but, boy, hear that motor roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a macho thing," confides Dena, 16. "They like the power of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raw power is, indeed, among the reasons Gordon, Rob and other guys in high 
school are lured to muscle cars. Back in the pre-1972 muscle car era, the 
consensus was bigger is better. Performance was everything. The larger the 
engine, the more horsepower, the quicker it will go faster. As Gordon puts it: 
"There's no substitute for cubic inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the highly polished shine of these motor marvels sounding off a 
baritone vvvroooooom, I can appreciate the craftsmanship of these automobiles. 
Ironically, I haven't a clue about my engine's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people figure that (young guys) are into muscle cars to compensate for 
something else that's missing," Rob says. "We're not playing with swords and 
dueling. This is just something else guys do nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "Camaro fiend," Rob got his SS in March with the $5,000 he 
got from the insurance company after his newer '87 Camaro burned up. "I've been 
looking for one of these for five years. It's my dream car." He first locked 
onto it when he spotted it in the 1985 cult film "Better Off Dead." He says, 
"That did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The SS was in pieces in a Westminster garage when he found it. It took an 
additional $800 to put it together. Rob, who plans a career in architecture, 
expects to learn more about cars this summer while working as a mechanic. The 
job will also pay his insurance, which, because the '67 SS is considered a 
high-risk theft car, is pricey. But he always keeps it within sight. "After 
five years looking around, I'm not about to lose it. I plan to keep it 
forever," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a head-turner. People give me the thumbs up. So I usually rev up 
the engine just to kid around and see them smile. It's usually older people who 
remember the car from their youth, but a lot of guys my age check it out too. 
It's like a common bond I have with them." 
</P>
<P>
 He shares that bond with his uncle, who has 20 classic cars. One of his most 
fond memories of being a kid, Rob says, is sitting at age 7 in his uncle's 1967 
Corvette. "I have it in my blood I guess. I don't like new cars. There's just 
nothing desirable about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon calls new cars "spaceships." He, too, has his fave kid memory: "I had 
this T-shirt that said 'Corvettes are Keen' that I wore until I grew out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 'Vette was his dad's custom '69 with a cherry 350 engine; Dad sold it in 
1982 for $80,000. Gordon and his brother grew up going to car shows and drag 
races with their father, so it's natural that he attend events with his Le 
Mans, like the weekly showcase at Fuddruckers on Tuesdays or Weinerschnitzel on 
Thursdays, both in Mission Viejo. The two attract as many teens as they do 
"older" guys (we're talking upward of 30). 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot rodding is about guys standing around telling fish stories," Gordon says. 
The fish certainly fly at these parking lot congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's also about dedication. Gordon puts in time daily cleaning and adjusting 
the Le Mans, which he inherited on his 16th birthday from his brother. Even 
then he knew it inside out, having worked on it since the family acquired the 
car from the original owner eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "In elementary school I could describe the mechanics of an engine," says 
Gordon, who sports several auto-inspired tattoos, including the Pontiac logo on 
his left ankle, a cartoon-like distributor on his left shoulder blade and 
whimsical works of Robert Williams, the comic king of crazy car culture, on his 
arms and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is slightly car crazy. Besides pouring every dime from his detailing 
business into the Le Mans, he plans to attend a technical school to learn 
everything about cars and eventually open a restoration shop. And the only 
reason, he says, he keeps up a 3.0 grade point average is to maintain his car 
insurance discount. 
</P>
<P>
 This semester he started up American Muscle, a car club of hot rods from 1955 
to 1972, that includes mostly teens, some as young as 13. Each member is 
checked out to ensure that they're not troublemakers who would give the club a 
bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking and driving is out -- because it can damage the car.  
</P>
<P>
 Rob agrees. "I won't drink and drive. I don't do drugs. I mean, all my money 
goes into my car anyway. I just have better things to do. This is something 
productive." He also doesn't allow anyone to smoke or eat in the Camaro.  
</P>
<P>
 "Any time people get too near," Gordon says, "I say, 'Step back.' It's cool 
with the guys with muscle cars because they respect all the work involved. When 
people notice your car and go ('wow'), you feel on top of the world. There's a 
feeling of superiority to it, like, 'who's going to beat me?' "

TRUE GRIT: IT'S THE COWBOY WAY; AT AGE 75, BEN JOHNSON IS STILL TALL IN THE 
SADDLE. FOR 54 YEARS, THE ACTOR HAS ROPED, RIDDEN AND SAILED WITH THE BEST OF 
'EM -- LIKE THE DUKE, WHOSE WILD GOOSE IN NEWPORT HARBOR WASTHE SITE FOR THE 
ACTOR'S WALK OF FAME STAR PARTY THIS WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 He taught B-Western hero "Wild" Bill Elliott how to ride a horse, rode as a 
stunt double for Gary Cooper and Randolph Scott and had roles in such classic 
Westerns as "Shane" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Ben Johnson chummed around with the biggest cowboy of them all: 
John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been on this thing in 40 years," marveled Johnson, boarding the 
Duke's old yacht, the Wild Goose, now a dinner boat docked in Newport Harbor.  
</P>
<P>
 "We went out fishing a little bit, drinking a little bit. We were just having 
fun, just a lot of fellowship," Johnson, 75, recalled Wednesday in his deep 
Oklahoma twang, a grin forming beneath his tan cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was a private party in Johnson's honor on the eve of the 
unveiling of his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Johnson's old friends -- including fellow actor Harry Carey Jr. 
and former Western movie bad man Pierce Lyden of Orange -- joined about 100 
Western movie buffs for the party, which featured music by members of the Sons 
of the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The host was John Wayne look-alike Ermal Williamson, a Van Nuys actor who met 
Johnson on the Western film festival circuit.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're all friends of Ben Johnson, and we all got together and figured this is 
a good time to give him (another) welcome aboard the Wild Goose," said 
Williamson. With a Wayne-like sweep of his arm, the ersatz Duke said, "This is 
all John Wayne country."  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who won a 1971 best-supporting Oscar for his role in "The Last 
Picture Show," worked frequently with Wayne during a 54-year career that has 
included more than 300 movies, a majority of them Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on an Oklahoma ranch, Johnson was a working ranch hand in 1940 when 
producer Howard Hughes purchased a load of horses for his film "The Outlaw." 
Johnson was hired to accompany the horses out to Hollywood and began his career 
as a movie wrangler and stunt double. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bygone movie-making era in which most screen cowboys were city-bred, 
Johnson was the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best I ever saw," said Carey, a long-time friend who worked with 
Johnson on "Wagon Master," "Rio Grande" and other classic Westerns. "I was 
raised around a lot of cowboys, and I'm talking about shoeing a horse, 
doctoring a sick horse, hooking up teams, mending harness, doing anything with 
cattle. He could do everything. He's an all-around cowboy -- and he's a damn 
fine actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a blue blazer with a commemorative Hollywood star on his lapel 
("Well, it's an honor; I'm just sorry they waited until I'm so darn old before 
they gave it to me"), Johnson graciously signed autographs and posed for 
pictures -- not unlike his old buddy Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wanted his picture, why, he didn't raise cane with them," Johnson 
said. "He was a good fella. He wasn't like some of these freaks now that don't 
want to get their picture taken and don't want anybody to talk to them. I want 
to throw them in the creek. I stay in hot water all the time because I can't 
quit cussing 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on the ramp leading down to the yacht, Johnson reminisced 
about the old Hollywood days when he was making films with the likes of 
legendary director John Ford and once rode 10 bucking horses in one day for a 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very fortunate in the business in getting to work in a lot of good 
movies and working with a lot of good people," he said. "That was really my 
education in the business, working with John Ford." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who lives in Mesa, Ariz., said he's glad to see that Westerns appear 
to be making another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'd like to be able to make some decent entertainment," he said, noting 
that he'll be running the Ponderosa in an NBC revival of "Bonanza" scheduled to 
begin shooting in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "What my goal in the business today is to make something decent that you can 
take your family to see," he said. "I don't appreciate these hippies getting up 
and using all their four-letter words in front of my family; makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson acknowledges that they never dreamed when making the old Westerns that 
there would still be an audience for them 50 years later, but he understands 
the enduring appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like John Ford always told us, 'Any time you can put something up on 
that screen that everybody wants to do or be, you've got a success.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not working in films or television, Johnson often shows up at 
Western film festivals around the country. He's also no stranger at rodeos and, 
in fact, recently won two silver belt buckles for team roping at a rodeo in 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, after all, the top team roper in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course at the end of the year I was the world champion, but I didn't have 
three dollars. All I had was a worn out automobile and a mad wife. So I went 
back into the picture business, and I stayed there ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 And Johnson, who turns 76 this month, has no intention of hanging up his spurs 
and retiring: 
</P>
<P>
 "No sir, not as long as I can get on and off my horse, I ain't gonna quit."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; STEALING FROM THEIR FUTURE; CRIME: SOME TEENS 
SHOPLIFT FOR TRENDY CLOTHES AND CHEAP THRILLS. WHATEVER THE REASON, IT ENDS UP 
COSTING THEM -- AND US.

 Tricia remembers the first -- and last -- time she stole anything. When the 
16-year-old walked into Montgomery Ward with a group of friends, she says her 
heart was pounding: "I thought I was going to get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 She did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all walked in the store together," she said. "One of my friends had 
got a bag for everybody and we put the shirts in the bag. I was scared. We saw 
a security guard and dropped the stuff. Then some more security guards came in 
the door we were going to leave. . . . They handcuffed us and put us in the 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Guards took Tricia and her friends to the police station, where she was booked 
and later put on informal probation for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," her mother, Janet, says. "She didn't have to do it, because 
she gets everything she wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia says she shoplifted mostly " 'cause my friends were doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although store managers and security experts agree that shoplifters can be any 
age, initiation often begins in the teens, and sometimes among kids as young as 
10 or 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 (the most recent reporting year available) in Orange County, 10,203 
juveniles 17 years old and under were arrested for petty theft offenses, which 
includes shoplifting. That was a drop from 1991, when there were 11,377 
arrests. In 1983, juvenile arrests for petty theft only numbered 8,858, but had 
been on the increase until 1989, when it leveled off, according to county 
Probation Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists say more girls shoplift than boys, but store owners and law 
enforcement officials say the numbers of those apprehended are about evenly 
split between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most youths steal because of peer pressure, the thrill of breaking rules or 
simply because they want something. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the reasons are darker. Psychologists say the thrill and danger 
can provide a rush that temporarily relieves depression or fills unmet 
emotional needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And a few make the leap from prankster to professional, devising elaborate 
schemes and learning early the lucrative rewards of selling hot merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical psychologist Edna Hermann divides teen shoplifters into two groups: 
normal teen-agers looking for excitement and kleptomaniacs. 
</P>
<P>
 For most youths, she says, shoplifting is an expression of normal teen 
rebellion and satisfies real material wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's maybe part of the peer culture," she says. "There is the rush of danger. 
Would they be caught? Wouldn't they? There is also wanting something they need 
immediately. 'If I have this lipstick, I will be beautiful for my date.' At a 
home where the family is on a budget and there isn't money for all the frills, 
this satisfies the need for beautiful things." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, shoplifters try to fill an empty space in their lives by 
pouring in pilfered items. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people steal to replace the emotional deprivation, the lack of 
love, lack of attention they feel at home," Hermann says. "It doesn't have 
anything to do with the value of what they steal. They are replenishing 
depleted emotional supplies for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with traditional traumas of adolescence -- dates, grades and parents who 
just don't understand -- teen-agers today face life-threatening crises that 
generate a powerful need for escape, says clinical psychologist Michael Peck. 
And some use shoplifting as an antidepressant, much as some people use drugs, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of depression in young adolescents. Years ago, we thought 
teen-agers could not get depressed. It's harder for a child to enter 
adolescence in the '80s and '90s than in the '50s and '60s. It's more 
achievement-oriented (now). There's more scary threats. Thirty, 40 years ago, 
we didn't worry about drugs, didn't worry about gang violence," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the struggle to provide materially for their children may leave parents 
less time to help teen-agers through the terrors of growing up, Hermann adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have all the money in the world and they'll shoplift, just to get 
their parents' attention, because they're not giving them love," says one 
17-year-old shopping for shoes at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, parents who don't heed their children's need for 
independence may inadvertently encourage them to shoplift as well, says 
clinical psychologist Robert Rome, adding that youths who lack privacy at home 
may not respect private property of store owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "My two friends were, like, neurotic until they got caught," said a 
19-year-old. "They were always shoplifting clothes. . . . One of them, she was 
an abused child. She used to run away all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other one, her parents were divorced and she lived with her father, and 
he was a wacko. He'd take her stuff and keep it. . . . They didn't have any 
privacy, that's true. And plus, they did need new clothes and they couldn't 
afford any." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting desires of teen-agers to establish their individuality and to 
fit in with the group find a focal point in fashion. Styles change by the 
season, month or week, and an urgent need for $100 running shoes or $50 jeans 
can keep kids racing on a treadmill to win acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fall behind fashion trends meet with derision, says a 16-year-old 
browsing at a mall. "These days, kids are supposed to have an image. If you 
don't wear the kind of clothes, or the makeup, they misjudge you, they think 
you're stupid. . . . They think you're poor and they don't want to talk to you. 
If you dress house, with baggy pants, clothes that are in, they think you're 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Those taunts can be hardest on children of immigrants, she says. Struggling to 
adapt to American expectations, they may be ridiculed for wearing clothes 
traditional to their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 While some youths race to follow the dictates of fashion, others shoplift to 
capitalize on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shoplift and bring it to school and sell it," says a 16-year-old. "If 
shoes cost $100, they sell them for $45 to $60, depending on the brand. They go 
to different places, three times a week. . . . They know it's wrong, but they 
do it because they need the money, they want the money. A boy on my block does 
it. He's about 11." 
</P>
<P>
 Stolen compact discs -- small, light, with high resale value -- can also be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big business," says Sheri Lunn, manager of a Wherehouse. "We have people 
called boosters. They're professional shoplifters who do it for a living. 
They'll get 15 of the same thing. They can be in and out in anywhere between 15 
to 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leif Lauritzen, executive director of the Stores Protective Assn., puts annual 
losses from shoplifting at $2 billion to $4 billion nationwide. And stores pass 
that on to customers. Five to eight cents of every dollar spent in stores is 
related to shoplifting losses, he says, and ends up costing a family of four 
about $500 yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores respond by stepping up surveillance and installing high-tech monitors 
to catch thieves. And the tug of war between shoplifters and store security 
escalates with each advance.

MY TURN: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; 'WITH HONORS' PASSES WITH FLYING 
COLORS / TEEN REVIEWS OF BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES AND OTHER THINGS OF INTEREST.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TARA BUDZYN and DANA LENETZ, Tara Budzyn and Dana Lenetz are students at 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tara: Have you noticed that the quality of films being produced lately is less 
than adequate to review? Movies such as "Bad Girls," "Cops and Robbersons" and 
"Serial Mom" clutter the box office with mediocrity. Thank goodness "With 
Honors" has hit theaters, and it's good! 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Good? Food is good. People look good. Little children are good. But 
"With Honors" is fantastic! Boasting the talented cast of Brendan Fraser, Moira 
Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton, this film develops the story of four 
Harvard roommates who learn about life, love, parents, stress and reality from 
a self-proclaimed bum portrayed by Joe Pesci. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Gee, how realistic. How many students would actually take a homeless man 
in just for a thesis paper? Although the premise of the movie might be a little 
far-fetched, the meaning touched close to my heart. Fraser plays Monty, a 
scholastic steam engine of a student in pursuit of academic success. His plans 
are curtailed when a power outage leaves him with only a printout of his senior 
thesis, the mainstay of his life. His desperate pursuit to photocopy the 
remaining pages leads him eventually to lose the paper in the boiler room of 
Harvard's library. However, he really "loses it" when he meets Pesci's 
character, Simon Wilder, who extorts him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Oooh, extortion. Have we been reading the dictionary again, Tara? 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Yes, some of us have matriculated beyond "Cat in the Hat," Dana. That's 
right, matriculated. Look it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Speaking of looking up, I'd like to look up on the handsome face of 
Dempsey, who plays the womanizing, wine connoisseur, philosophizing deejay. For 
the men, Moira Kelly's character is also worth looking up at. Her new page-boy 
haircut accentuates her soft facial features and is a fresh change from her 
preppy look in "The Cutting Edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Thank you, Vidal Sassoon. Now I'd like to delve into something more 
interesting than looks: music. "With Honors" jumps on the musical bandwagon of 
using an enticing soundtrack to enhance the mood of the film. Heavy-metal songs 
such as the Cult's "She Sells Sanctuary" and Candlebox's "Cover Me" sharply 
contrast Madonna's romantic ballad "I'll Remember" and create an eclectic 
myriad of songs that any music fan can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: I think the whole movie is something everyone can enjoy. It has 
heart-felt impact and may make some viewers want to go out and give money to 
every homeless person they see. 
</P>
<P>
 We recommend "With Honors" for anyone who wants a "Harvard education" for only 
$6.50.

 Mexican War -- A story about the Campo de Cahuenga in the May 23 edition of 
The Times incorrectly reported that it was the site of the signing of the 
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the agreement that ended the Mexican War. That 
treaty was signed in Mexico in 1848. The Campo de Cahuenga, near what is now 
Universal City, was where the 1847 signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga occurred, 
ending hostilities between the United States and Mexico in California.
