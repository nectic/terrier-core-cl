CONTAINING AN URBAN CANCER; EARTHQUAKE-CAUSED 'GHOST TOWNS' BRING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The major temblors appear to have stopped but, in a sense, the earthquake is 
far from over. Now Angelenos are struggling to deal with mini ghost towns that 
have grown up in the wake of Jan. 17's Northridge earthquake. There are at 
least 10 of them in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood: Scores of apartment 
buildings, businesses and condominiums lie abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden economic vacuum is strangling adjacent communities, too, much like 
the situation that existed after Hurricane Andrew ravaged parts of Florida. But 
here in Los Angeles, there's an ominous twist -- the ghost towns are being 
occupied at a frightening pace by gangs, drug addicts and dealers, prostitutes 
and squatters, becoming beachheads for crimes of many sorts. This is a public 
safety issue that demands immediate attention. City officials gathered Thursday 
to try to form a strategy, and more meetings are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they should use some discretionary federal funds to fence off and board 
up structures, but that is only a stop-gap solution. The buildings need to be 
sealed more strongly than that, and demolition is required in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people ask what is happening with Mayor Richard Riordan's call in May for 
at least $150 million in federal and local monies for low-cost rebuilding 
loans. This plan must proceed apace. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for speed are simple. First, when damaged buildings are exposed to 
the elements, they deteriorate rapidly. The longer they are unrepaired the more 
it takes to repair them. Second, some of the new occupants are stripping the 
structures of everything of value, adding significantly to the costs of 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the defeat of Proposition 1A, the $2-billion earthquake repair bond 
issue, in the June 7 election looms even larger now. Gov. Pete Wilson, 
incredibly, had no plan to fall back on if the voters rejected the proposition. 
The ghost towns and their increasingly criminal atmosphere point out that it is 
time for Wilson and the Legislature to enact a temporary quarter-cent increase 
in the sales tax to fund the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also apparent that greater speed in the processing of Small Business 
Administration loans is in order. Some owners cannot even afford to fence off 
their structures, much less rebuild, without those funds. Absent such action, 
the ghost towns will persist -- and perhaps spread their decay in a city that 
is already battling the tugging forces of economic upheaval and malaise.

A DEATH IN THE L.A. FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles has suffered a death in the family. Family is an abused word, but 
it is the only possible metaphor for the set of relationships that this 
charismatic man created and maintained. Franklin D. Murphy's people were not a 
network. Whatever edge of calculation any of them brought into an exchange with 
him was quickly, mysteriously, caught up in something more exuberant. Los 
Angeles owes much to that exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
 For the family, any of us will do more than for a stranger. Murphy had a 
God-given knack of capturing that willingness and all but bottling it. "For 
Franklin," they would do it -- whatever it was and whoever they were -- and 
feel glorious about it not just for the moment but for years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean of the University of Kansas School of Medicine at 32, chancellor of UCLA 
at 44 (he himself made the acronym official), chairman and CEO of Times Mirror 
at 52, Murphy could legitimately be called a legend in his own time, for 
everyone who knew him had a tale to tell about him. These tales continue to be 
told, and the mood that comes over the tellers is a moral in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 What do Murphy's people remember? They remember a rumpled demeanor, suits more 
often battered than bespoke, and a voice that could acquire, when necessary, a 
quarterback's bark. But more than any of that, they remember an invincible and 
invigorating confidence. When you were with Murphy, you knew that there was a 
solution. (You might even be the solution.) For a will like his, there was 
always a way. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback and the artist, the scientist and the humanist, the corporate 
executive and the teacher are not often found to be the same person. Murphy 
kept these antinomies and others in dynamic resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years pass, however, and his memory fades, those who want to know what 
made his many accomplishments possible should visit the sculpture garden he 
created at UCLA (the grateful university later named it for him). There they 
may find that the deepest, most fruitful tension in his character was between 
contemplation and action, the private and the public. The strong, beautiful 
works in the garden call the viewer inward. But they stand in a public garden 
and, as his monument, call the viewer outward to a life lived as his was, to 
the last moment, with splendid and multiplying energy.

THERAPY WATCH; AND NEXT, SOME TEETH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organized medicine has finally started to grapple with the thorny issue of 
repressed memory of childhood sexual abuse. The House of Delegates of the 
American Medical Assn. passed a resolution Wednesday declaring such memories, 
often retrieved by hypnosis or other therapeutic methods, to be of "uncertain 
authenticity" and "fraught with problems of potential misapplication."A few 
months ago, the board of trustees of the American Psychiatric Assn. stated that 
there is "no completely accurate" means of verifying such memories without 
corroboration. 
</P>
<P>
 These actions respond to growing evidence that some psychotherapists have 
planted false memories in vulnerable patients. Last month, a jury in Napa, 
Calif., ordered two therapists to pay damages to a winery executive who charged 
they had cost him his job, marriage and home by persuading his daughter that he 
had raped her when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA report is properly cautious, noting that childhood abuse has often 
been ignored by practitioners in the past. It urges doctors to address the 
needs of patients reporting such abuse "quite apart from the truth or falsity 
of any claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA action is fine, but it has no teeth. It is now incumbent on the state 
boards, in California and elsewhere, that license therapists to bring closer 
oversight to psychotherapy, which is largely unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many families have been torn apart by apparently imagined memories for 
this to go on without intervention by the normally lax medical authorities.

HOW NOT TO MAKE THE GRADE; SCHOOL IS SHAKEN BY DISCLOSURE THAT COUNSELORS 
ARBITRARILY BOOSTED MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Academic counselors at Brea Olinda High School in Orange County came up with a 
new grading system several years ago that was creative, to say the least. 
Students got the normal A, B, C, D or F; but for a favored group, a C or a D 
could be changed magically to P, as in "Pass." Presto, a student's grade-point 
average went up. Shazam, colleges received a better picture of the applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they were not told of the practice. It turns out that counselors 
acted on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students got other help as well. Need a few more credits to meet the 
240-credit minimum for graduation? No problem. That three-credit English course 
became six credits, thanks to a friendly counselor, and the minimum was met. 
Grades were changed for about 55 seniors in a graduating class of 306; about 40 
received double credit in some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials report that the counselors did draw the line at changing a failing 
grade to a pass. That's encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher said he and his colleagues were enraged when they learned of the 
practice, which appears to have been going on for four to 10 years. They should 
be. This is academic fraud and it demeans the educational process. Clearly, the 
Brea Olinda Unified School District failed to set fixed standards for all 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic counselors are supposed to offer guidance to students about course 
work and possible college careers. They are not supposed to decide grades, let 
alone improve them on their own or improve a student's chances of being 
accepted by a college. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent of the Brea Olinda district said that the actions were a 
violation of state law and that corrective steps now have been taken. He called 
the actions "a judgment error." We prefer the term outrageous . 
</P>
<P>
 Besides English and math, responsibility and honesty are appropriate lessons 
for high school students. It's unfair to those who work hard if others' grades 
are improved by fiat. Students deserve to be told where they stand. Giving 
false marks to a select few hurts all involved -- students, teachers and 
colleges.

14TH ST. PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank David Ferrell for the wonderful story about the 14th St. 
Players "Laughing Through the Pain" (June 12).The Players and I would like to 
point out that they are not victims, that their main goal is to educate the 
public on mental illness and the stigma attached, through the use of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, we have not had a suicide attempt in six years. The Players come from 
all walks of life -- people who dropped out of school, people with master's 
degrees. One out of every four families suffers some kind of mental illness.

WAR'S RISK TO THE SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the very poignant article by Col. Jeffrey Barnett, "War's Worst 
Risk Is to the Soul" (Commentary, June 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Many years ago I was fortunate to attend the graduation of a class of 
paratroopers in the Israeli army. The ceremony was performed in Jerusalem, the 
city holy to three of the world's major religions; an area not far from where 
the Ten Commandments were created. It was there that I heard the late Golda 
Meir, while prime minister of Israel, admonish the graduates to never use their 
weapons for anything other than defense. For, she said, "I can forgive our Arab 
neighbors for killing our sons; but I will never forgive them for making our 
sons killers." 
</P>
<P>
 If only diplomacy could solve differences between nations and people -- what a 
wonderful world we would have.

sisters who risked spiritual distress for us.

 * Barnett's commentary brought back the difficult experiences we had in 
treating so many veterans during and after World War II. Barnett wrote: 
"Warriors kill. Killing is the essence of war." Growing up and incorporating 
into our character the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," the new recruit is 
suddenly confronted with the exact opposite, i.e., "You must kill." In order to 
fit in, most incorporated that opposing moral view into their behaviors, but in 
our V.A. clinics we repeatedly saw a tragic aftermath as the victorious, 
man-killing soldier was now back in civilian life. That aftermath often was 
experienced in sleep disturbances, nightmares, generalized anxiety attacks, 
periods of depression and withdrawal. In the therapy with them, we soon became 
aware of their inner struggle within their psyche -- "how do I now live with 
and accept the fact that I have killed -- and at times gloried in having done 
so?" 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett wrote, "We seldom praise veterans for risking their souls. . . . When 
the nation fails to comfort those who killed in its name, it leaves those 
warriors to face their souls alone." The drugs prescribed can only suppress the 
disturbing inner memories and images. Intensive therapy over long periods of 
time provides an opportunity for the fullest confrontation and ultimate freeing 
of the self from the guilt over having been a killer of other humans.

FEDERAL FUNDS FOR IMMIGRANT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, states in 
"Funding Services Is a 2-Way Street" (Commentary, June 3) that the 
Administration is seeking a 30% boost in assistance on repayment to border 
states of costs related to illegal immigration, such as incarceration, 
education, medical services and welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 He fails to accept state estimates of these costs or the number of illegal 
aliens residing in California. He also plays the common game of blurring the 
line between legal and illegal immigration. In a direct slap at Gov. Wilson, he 
rejects his estimate of $3 billion as the cost of services delivered to illegal 
immigrants in California. This figure is based on a number of studies by 
respected researchers from the nation's leading institutions of higher learning 
and actual documented figures from various state agencies. What basis does 
Panetta cite for his figures, other than INS estimates, which still do not 
account for the wide disparity in the amount offered by the Administraton 
compared to the claim by California? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Panetta fails to indicate what actions the Administration plans to 
correct this problem, other than adding more border patrol agents. What Panetta 
offers is a Band-Aid for massive hemorrhaging of state funds that impedes our 
ability to deliver vital services to legal residents. 
</P>

<P>
 The border problem is a result of the federal government's failure to stop the 
flow of illegal immigrants into this country, not the fault of the individual 
states that border those foreign countries. Panetta asks those states to share 
the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Panetta, they have been shouldering the majority of the burden. It is 
because of this that they are suing your level of government for its "fair 
share" of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 We border states bear this burden for the entire nation. Let citizens of 
Kansas, South Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee, etc., sink or swim with us. Why the 
discrepancy in cost between Texas and California? Well, perhaps it is more 
expensive to live in California than Texas. I wish Washington, D.C., were on 
the border along with California. I bet if you and your Administration had to 
live with us in the border states that you would be singing to a different 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping illegal immigration is not a cure-all for the ills that plague our 
country. I know this as well as millions of other citizens. We object to 
illegal immigration in the same way we object to, say, crime or higher taxes. 
Not stopping or controlling the flow of illegal immigrants because it isn't a 
magical solution to all of our societal ills is not a valid reason for allowing 
it to continue unchecked.

<P>
 A substantial majority appear to favor the so-called "Save Our State" 
initiative -- the anti-immigration initiative (May 29). Most of our public 
officials also seem to favor such legislation to bar illegal immigrants from 
attending public schools and to exclude them from public health services. 
</P>
<P>
 The American people have always had traits of fundamental fairness. As such, I 
would think that, being fair, if illegal immigrants are to be denied such 
public services, the public would not expect them to pay for services not 
received. Therefore, I believe the public would support the idea of exempting 
illegal immigrants from paying state income or sales taxes.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Lerner writes in "To Invite Farrakhan Is to Invite Racism" 
(Commentary, June 8) that "the NAACP invitation has given (Farrakhan) new 
avenues of entrance to more respectable communities." The NAACP knows what most 
mainstream organizations can't seem to accept.The people that come to hear 
Farrakhan speak are respectable people who are concerned about the condition of 
their community. You insult the intelligence of the black community when you 
insinuate that we are not morally able to tell wrong from right or recognize 
anti-Semitism and racism when it raises its ugly head. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of our community have the God-given right to come together for the 
benefit of the people. This historic meeting of the leaders in the black 
community is a monumental step to stop crime and uplift the poor and alienated 
masses. It has absolutely nothing to do with hate, racism or anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL K. JONES 
</P>
<P>
 Covina 
</P>
<P>
 * Lerner has, once again, exceeded the expectations of his readers. His recent 
article decrying the NAACP's invitation to Farrakhan to speak before their 
National Leadership Conference simply could not rest with a condemnation of 
Farrakhan or Khallid Abdul Muhammad's racism and anti-Semitism. No, Lerner 
needed to trot out the same themes he has hammered away at in his magazine, in 
a recent Op-Ed in the New York Times and elsewhere -- blaming Commentary 
magazine and the New Republic for the venomous hate of Farrakhan and his 
minions. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems convinced that he alone is the protector of rectitude in the Jewish 
community because there are "mainstream Jewish organizations and publications" 
that have "defected from the social justice agenda." What self-righteous, 
self-serving, arrogant baloney.

KING JURY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rodney King jury correctly applied the laws on punitive damages (June 2). 
The objective is to punish the defendants and deter them.The poorer the 
wrongdoer, the smaller the award need be. Valid punitive damage awards are no 
more than a fraction of the defendants' net worth. Laurence Powell and Stacey 
Koon are destitute. An award of zero shows more common sense and legal 
correctness than millions (legally invalid) or $5, a fraction of their net 
worth. The jurors deserve our thanks for the right stuff.

 * Based on what I read in "King Jury's Voice of Reason Carried a Private 
Burden" (June 3), I think the forewoman, Ester Soriano-Hewitt, not only did a 
very difficult and professional job in working with the jurors in this case, 
but she did something far more important. 
</P>
<P>
 She was able to put her own personal feelings secondary to resolving the case 
for the good of the whole. She considered that there was more than one point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a major problem throughout the world today. Factions are trying to 
"get even." If they would get the chip off their shoulder and truly negotiate, 
the world would calm down significantly.

RAISING BUS FARES WOULD MAKE THEM LESS FAIR; TRANSIT: TRAIN SUBSIDIES HELP THE

 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority staff's fare-increase proposal shows 
lack of creativity and the crisis-management approach of the MTA's predecessor

<P>
 Management wants the base fare to go from $1.10 to $1.35 and for all passes to

The poor are penalized, the rich subsidized.

 Most MTA local bus rides are under four miles. The same seat may be occupied 
by consecutive riders, and several $1.10 fares collected, for one bus trip. The 
lowest-income riders on crowded routes -- such as the 204 Vermont Avenue 
service -- pay almost the entire cost of their transportation and travel in the 
worst conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 While the subsidy to the 204-line rider is pennies, express-bus users draw 
several dollars a trip from the public purse. The freeway surcharge is only 40 
cents per four miles. With everyone headed downtown, each seat brings in only 
one fare per trip. Management wants an increase of just 10 cents, to 50 cents 
per express zone, even though riders are generally higher in income than 
local-bus riders. To correct this, the base fare should be reduced to $1 per 
ride, while the express charge should go up 20 cents, to 60 cents per zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical Blue Line riders travel twice as far as local-bus riders for the same 
price, and at more than four times the subsidy per mile provided to the average 
bus rider. This reduces money to maintain local buses, on which those who lack 
an alternative depend. Management proposes supplementary fares for journeys 
over seven miles, but rail would remain cheaper than freeway buses. The same 
fare structure should be adopted for both express bus and Metrorail systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink riders, meanwhile, get a subsidy of more than $20 per trip. 
Meanwhile, management is talking of bus service cutbacks as well as fare 
increases, ignoring the ethical problem of maintaining high-cost Metrolink for 
the wealthy few at the expense of local buses for the many poor. Metrolink 
should be replaced with lower-cost express buses, which would serve a wider 
variety of destinations than does the commuter-rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating passes is a mistake, especially as MTA police believe their recent 
anti-fraud campaign has eliminated organized forgeries. Boarding time will be 
slowed, while the incentive to leave the car at home once a bus pass is 
purchased will be lost. Some low-income people, for whom transit is their only 
mobility, make heavy use of local passes. Removing passes would restrict their 
mobility. Passes should stay, but at higher prices relative to one-way fares. 
Discount coupons might be offered as another incentive. Lower 
automobile-insurance rates for those who choose to commute with monthly passes 
might be particularly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-week local pass, priced proportionately to a monthly pass ($11.25 if a 
monthly costs $50) should also be available. More affordable to the poor, the 
weekly passes could be sold through newsstands and convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA really wants to take people out of cars, it must review its 
spending priorities. The Proposition A bus-fare reduction to 50 cents between 
1982 and 1985 saw ridership expand by 143.1 million annual passengers over the 
three years. Two fare increases then shot it down by 96.1 million annual 
passengers over the next five years. The Blue Line, in contrast, is expected to 
achieve only 20 million annual passengers in the year 2000. Far more people 
would ride public transport now if the resources spent on rail had been kept on 
the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA curtails its wasteful rail-expansion plans, bus service can be 
improved and fares kept low. We must avoid the tendency to haggle over the size 
of the fare increase while ignoring public service and equity. To simply 
provide a proportional fare increase for all would be fair to none. To make 
fares fairer, we need to better relate what each passenger pays to the cost of 
providing the service each uses.

RENT CONTROL MYTHS AND LANDLORD MONEY; HOUSING: REAL ESTATE LOBBIES ARE PUSHING 
HARD IN SACRAMENTO TO PREEMPT LOCAL RENT LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER DREIER, Peter Dreier is a professor of public policy at Occidental 
College. From 1984 to 1992, he served as director of housing at the Boston 
Redevelopment Authority. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the departure of rent-control champion David Roberti from the state 
Senate, the landlord lobby -- the California Apartment Assn., California Assn. 
of Realtors and California Housing Council -- sees a chance to kill local rent 
regulations. The lobby's bill, introduced by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), 
would remove local communities' right to limit rent increases when a rental 
unit is vacated. If enacted, this legislation would exacerbate the state's 
already severe housing crisis. Some Los Angeles officials have also suggested 
eliminating the city's mild rent control, a move the City Council opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the landlords' lobbyists have tried to persuade legislators to 
preempt local rent regulation, which protects residents from housing 
speculation and displacement. According to records filed with the secretary of 
state, the landlord lobbies spent $7.2 million in 1992 and 1993 combined, not 
including their campaign contributions. But pressure from local officials (who 
view such legislation as a violation of local control), tenants and senior 
citizens, and the powerful Roberti, has thwarted the landlords' agenda. Now, 
the landlords smell a new opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 California has the highest housing prices and the biggest gap between incomes 
and rents in the nation. Nearly one-third of all California renters pay at 
least one-half of their incomes for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has reduced some rents, but the situation overall is worse, not 
better. Layoffs and unemployment make many families' housing situation even 
more precarious. Where rent levels have declined, it has been almost entirely 
at the high end of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 14 municipalities in California (including Los Angeles, Oakland, 
San Francisco and San Jose) have some form of rent regulation on apartments; 
about 100 regulate rents on mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, much of the debate around rent control is based on myth rather 
than the actual experience. Studies conducted by independent researchers and 
not sponsored by the real-estate industry conclude that rent control does not 
have adverse consequences for new construction, maintenance and other measures 
of investment in rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people believe that providing needy Californians with rent subsidies is a 
more efficient way to help house people who really need it. In fact, rent 
control is more cost-effective for taxpayers. One recent study estimated that 
if Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Berkeley abandoned their rent-control 
programs, it would cost the state's taxpayers about $160 million a year to 
maintain the existing levels of affordability. Costs for a statewide program 
would bust the state's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people also mistakenly believe that rent control freezes rents and makes 
it unprofitable to own rental housing. In fact, every rent-control system in 
California provides for annual across-the-board rent increases as well as 
individual rent adjustments. These allow landlords to make capital 
improvements, maintain buildings and derive a fair profit. Rent control simply 
limits gouging and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 But doesn't rent control lead landlords to defer maintenance? Experience says 
no, because local rent-control laws require landlords to maintain their 
properties in accord with health and safety codes in order to receive approval 
for rent increases. Then doesn't rent control lead landlords to abandon their 
buildings? Common sense and hard reality suggest otherwise. Santa Monica and 
West Hollywood have the state's strongest rent laws, but earthquake aside, 
there are few abandoned or foreclosed apartment buildings in either city. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord lobby argues that rent control discourages builders and banks 
from investing in rental housing. But all rent-control laws specifically exempt 
new construction. Some critics also claim that such laws mainly help affluent 
Yuppies. The landlord lobby can certainly point to a few upper-income people 
living in these apartments -- anecdotes they use to make their point. But these 
are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A new UCLA study demonstrates that in the four cities with the strongest 
rent-control laws (Santa Monica, West Hollywood, East Palo Alto and Berkeley), 
the mix of renters -- including the elderly, the poor and people of color -- 
remained relatively constant between 1980 and 1990. Without rent control, 
low-income tenants and people on fixed incomes would face constantly rising 
housing costs. Many would face displacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment industry has enormous resources invested in attacking the rights 
of localities to protect renters from the forces of the housing market. The 
reality is not what the landlord lobby wants people to believe. No powerful 
group should be able to hang a "for rent" sign on the state Capitol. The 
Legislature should resist the tide of myth and money pouring from the landlord 
lobby and reject the Costa bill.

'WOLF' MAN JACK IN THE WILDS OF N.Y.; THE NICHOLSON-PFEIFFER THRILLER MEANDERS 
DOWN SEVERAL PATHS -- A SATIRICAL LOOK AT PUBLISHING, A STAR VEHICLE AND A 
MEDITATION ON THE NATURE OF DISEASE AND IMMORTALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Pfeiffer, Jack Nicholson and the passionate animal inside him, 
hellbent on getting out. "Wolf" sounds so simple, so effective, so foolproof. 
Would that it were. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Mike Nichols and written by novelist Jim Harrison and Wesley 
Strick (with an uncredited assist from Elaine May), "Wolf's" problem, as those 
very different sensibilities indicate, is that it can't seem to decide what 
kind of a movie it wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the straight-ahead endeavor the premise promises, "Wolf" meanders 
down several paths. At varying times it is a satirical look at New York 
publishing, a star vehicle, a meditation on the nature of disease and 
immortality and even, in its spare time, a standard-issue werewolf horror 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these sections are effective, some less so, but they pull in so many 
different directions that finally all they have in common is how awkwardly they 
mix with one another. And without coherence, a movie that is only sporadically 
involving is the inevitable result. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the difficulty with "Wolf" is that whatever its aspirations are, it 
must be firmly grounded in the horror genre to have any effectiveness at all. 
But neither the screenwriters nor Nichols, who considers the movie "a poetic 
expression of an inner state," possess the requisite touch, dooming sections of 
the picture to be flat or silly rather than gripping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wolf" begins traditionally enough, with a man driving alone through a cold 
and snowy Vermont night. He is New York publishing executive Will Randall 
(Nicholson), who has so much trouble coping with the elements that his car hits 
what looks to be a wolf. And when Randall gets out to investigate, the beast 
retaliates by taking a bite out of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Manhattan, no one believes the animal really was a wolf and Randall is 
too busy with his own crises at the publishing firm MacLeish House, where he is 
editor in chief and his friend and protege Stewart Swinton (James Spader) is 
head of marketing, to think about it much. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly acquired by pompous billionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer), one 
of those who believes that taste and individuality are literary handicaps, 
MacLeish is in the throes of an amusingly portrayed shake-up that threatens to 
affect everyone's future. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Randall tries to cope with interoffice politics, he starts to notice 
changes in his life, changes, the film interestingly claims, that may not be 
all bad. His eyesight and hearing get more acute, his sense of smell heightens, 
he even edits copy at a greatly increased rate and finds a way to open wife 
Charlotte's (Kate Nelligan) robe with his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wolf passed something along to me," he tells new friend Laura Alden 
(Pfeiffer), the billionaire's bored and sarcastic daughter, in one of the 
film's sporadic philosophical moments. "But I'm afraid it will have a price." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a prop pipe and an exhausted voice, Nicholson is problematic at best 
in the film's initial stages, when the script insists he is the kindest, most 
decent and civilized literary editor in all of Manhattan, which is casting 
against type with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably an involving actor to watch, Nicholson is adept and surprisingly 
low-key and subtle in many of the scenes that require him to increasingly feel 
the presence of the wolf within. The joke of the transformation, however, is 
that as Will Randall becomes less like himself, he becomes more like Jack 
Nicholson, albeit a Nicholson who is thankfully resistant to the fearful 
extremes of mugging. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the star vehicle, "Jack's back and Michelle's got him" part of the 
movie, Nicholson and Pfeiffer play nicely together, though the part of Laura is 
uninvolving enough to make it uncertain why Pfeiffer took it on in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Also uncertain is "Wolf's" treatment of the conventional horror moments that 
any film of this type must have. Despite Rick Baker's restrained makeup, seeing 
Nicholson's Randall sniff the air, curl his lip and engage in some of the 
bloodier aspects of werewolf behavior is much more unconvincing than it needs 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, the odd affecting moment like Randall's dialogue with werewolf expert 
Dr. Vijay Alezias (Om Puri) aside, it is not really possible to make a genteel 
werewolf movie. In any event, with its final third focused firmly on disturbing 
physical violence, "Wolf" resists carrying even that notion all the way to the 
end. Though its premise must have had intellectual appeal to all involved, 
"Wolf" doesn't feel like anyone believed its story could really happen, and 
that is a tough barrier to overcome. 
</P>
<P>

 Box-Office Roar: Disney's new animated musical "The Lion King" broke 
box-office records in both Los Angeles and New York on Wednesday as it opened 
with exclusive engagements at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre and the Radio City 
Music Hall. About 6,000 movie-goers paid $43,435 in six sold-out screenings at 
the El Capitan, while more than 11,000 jammed into Radio City, ringing up 
$262,217 in sales. El Capitan's previous top Wednesday opening was set last 
year by "Aladdin." Advance ticket sales at El Capitan, where the movie is 
accompanied by a live stage show, already total more than $750,000. TELEVISION

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DAD' A TEPID WEEPIE IN KID-POWERED UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kiddies longing for a Mac attack this summer won't be enlivened by the tepid 
shenanigans and mushy maunderings of "Getting Even With Dad." Macaulay Culkin 
plays the estranged 11-year-old son of an ex-con, and he doesn't bare his 
tonsils once. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes moisten on cue, however. Such acting range! 
</P>
<P>
 Culkin's Timmy, motherless, has been living with his aunt for the three years 
his father, Ray (Ted Danson), has been in prison for stealing VCRs. (A "cute" 
crime.) Dad, a baker by trade, is out of the clink now and planning a rare coin 
heist in San Francisco with two bumbly accomplices (Saul Rubinek and Gailard 
Sartain) when Timmy is deposited on his doorstep for a week's visit. The boy 
quickly figures out a way to blackmail his father into loving him -- he hides 
the stolen coin cache and won't reveal its whereabouts until his father takes 
him to the amusement park and the aquarium and the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to determine what's more unbelievable -- Culkin as an unhappily 
neglected boy in need of male bonding or Danson as a tough-talking, tattooed 
ex-con. Actually, Ray is a softened good/bad guy from the start, which leaves 
no doubt about the ultimate fate of his fathering. He's a baker , after all -- 
how terrible can he be? He can't keep the plant in his apartment watered, but 
it's clear he's a closet nurturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray has a lot to learn about feelings and his life teacher is Timmy. Ray may 
be useful to his son showing him how to catch a fish or shoot a basket, but 
"Getting Even With Dad" is all about -- apologies to William Wordsworth -- the 
son being the father to the man. The title for this film should be taken 
literally: Timmy gets even with his errant dad by transforming him into his 
emotionally caring equal. 
</P>
<P>
 Any movie that asks us to glean life lessons from a character played by 
Macaulay Culkin is asking for a lot -- and asking for trouble. His tyke fans 
probably won't connect with the film's civics lesson tone or its touchy-feely 
bond-a-thons. (When Culkin's character was stung to death by a bee in "My Girl" 
it sent shock waves through kiddieland.) So, as insurance, the filmmakers -- 
director Howard Deutch and screenwriters Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein -- 
toss in a lot of stoogey shenanigans involving Rubinek and Sartain. These guys 
drip chili dogs on their shirts, get crunched in garbage dumpsters, fall down 
flights of stairs. Now that's entertainment. Timmy is allowed only one 
comparable moment: He sips a soda through straws in his nostrils. 
Interestingly, in a movie clogged with product tie-ins, the soda goes 
unlabeled. (This could be a commercial miscalculation since kids will want to 
try this at home.) 
</P>
<P>
 Culkin's acting, such as it is, is deadpan minimalist. Has he been looking at 
early Clint Eastwood movies for inspiration? He doesn't seem to have much inner 
life to draw on for this film, which bollixes its meaning. Timmy's blackmailing 
of his father, which is supposed to come out of an inner pain, instead seems 
like a species of torture. Culkin's flat line readings have Bad Seed vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe this is the fantasy level that will put "Getting Even With Dad" over 
the top. Timmy gets to torture his dad in the process of defusing him. Isn't 
this what every kid wants? He even maneuvers to get a smitten undercover cop 
(Glenne Headly) to romance his father, and they all go out together to fancy 
restaurants and museums. In the kid-power universe of this film, the boy gets 
to pick his parent's suitors -- another big-time child fantasy. It's all a bit 
smug and suspect. You get the feeling that, by the time Timmy hits his teens, 
dad and he will be double-dating. 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA rating: PG, for mild language. Times guidelines: It includes a character 
drawing a gun and a robbery .

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TANG'S ADDS NEW FLAVOR TO PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tommy Tang's signature pink neon triangle now blazes in Old Town Pasadena -- 
"Right across from Victoria's Secret," the hostess tells me when I call for 
directions. The third variation on this popular Melrose Avenue/Greenwich 
Village restaurant is wooing Pasadena with a swank Hollywood hipness and a 
hybrid Asian American cuisine.  
</P>
<P>
 Oddly configured in a narrow, L-shaped storefront, this Tang's has an airy bar 
and dining area that gives way to several smaller eating areas to the rear. The 
design is crisp, spare, elegant. Wood floors are whitened, walls are rubbed to 
a feathery silver brown, iron chairs are graceful, simple, amusing. High 
ceilings and brick walls amplify the noise, especially in the back room, where 
laughter at a nearby table periodically makes conversation impossible at ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff wear flattering, Asian-style cotton pajamas and manage to look quite 
hip. "Do you have to wear a ponytail to work here?" a friend of mine wonders. A 
dishwasher, bringing glasses to the bar, flexes mind-boggling, intricate 
tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, service staff exude capability, but over the course of several 
meals, we're disenchanted. We do have one terrific, energetic waitress, but on 
subsequent visits waiters advise us poorly on food (the whole fish that we were 
once discouraged from ordering is one of the best items on the menu) and 
provide indifferent, erratic service. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the original Melrose restaurant, the Pasadena Tang's as yet has no 
sushi bar and this, I think, is unfortunate. Sushi could provide a leaner, 
clearer dimension to the food here, which presently is what I'd call 
"wine-and-cream Thai" -- Thai food with a Euro spin and a decent wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Thai food scarcely needs improvement -- and some of the more authentic 
dishes on Tommy Tang's menu prove this point. Mint noodles, despite the 
introduction of olive oil, taste as hot and lively as they do in my favorite 
Thai noodle house. 
</P>
<P>
 While I am not a stickler for authenticity, it seems to me that the only 
reason for melding cuisines is to produce something that tastes great. Some of 
the food at Tommy Tang's certainly meets this criteria: I loved a soup with 
nubbly Thai black beans and smooth sour cream. Thai sausage slices with an 
incendiary, flavorful tomato compote and designer field greens make a lovely, 
effective appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Often, one element on a plate works better than the others. A special 
appetizer, for example, puts a heap of lovely pencil asparagus and four 
tasteless shrimp in a silly Cabernet-cream-beet sauce. A hunk of two-pepper 
salmon is moist and well-seasoned, but the accompanying Thai couscous, flavored 
strongly with cumin and topped with bean paste, is perfectly ghastly. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide range of Tang's original dishes neither triumph nor disappoint. Crispy 
oysters are plump and fresh, Malaysian clams audaciously spicy. An endive salad 
has tiny cubes of mozzarella that provide density and contrast to the endive's 
persistent succulence. There are plenty of good meaty slices of wild mushrooms 
in the wild mushroom salad, but the honey-soy vinaigrette is acidic and 
insipid.  
</P>
<P>
 Waiters continuously sing the praises of "The Original Tommy Duck," but anyone 
who has had a juicy, sticky-skinned local Chinese bird, say from Sam Woo's, 
will find this a rather pedestrian cousin; the yam served with it, however, is 
delicious.  
</P>
<P>
 Vegetable side orders are fresh and generally excellent, especially steamed 
string beans, sauteed spinach, spicy bean sprouts and Thai eggplant. Black 
olive brown rice reminds us how tasty and hearty a brown rice stir-fry is.  
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp here were repeatedly tasteless and tough: We picked them out of 
otherwise decent pad thai and mint noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, given its eclecticism, is a bit under-explained. Had we known, for 
example, that the Thai-sausage appetizer comes with a green salad, we probably 
wouldn't have ordered the wild mushroom salad as well. And who would have 
guessed, even after the waitress described it, that Thai risotto with wild 
mushrooms is essentially a very rich Thai curry? 
</P>
<P>

and dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Closed Monday. Full bar. Valet parking.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CONSUMMATE CABARET FROM KAREN AKERS AT CINEGRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cinegrill's recent return to first-rate cabaret programming continues for 
the next two weeks with a welcome appearance by Karen Akers. The New York 
singer's opening set on Wednesday superbly defined the musical intricacies and 
emotional subtleties of this most intimate of pop music arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed by a small turnout, Akers took immediate physical command of the 
stage, the lithe, expressive movements of her long arms gracefully framing the 
classic look of dark, bobbed hair and sculptured cheekbones. 
</P>
<P>
 Working an artfully constructed set of tunes ranging from the familiar to the 
obscure, she brought her unique interpretive qualities -- a deep contralto 
voice and an unerring connection with a song's story -- to everything she sang. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights: a fascinating harmonic medley (via music director's Mike 
Abene's arrangement) of the Gershwins' "Isn't It a Pity" and Cole Porter's 
"Every Time We Say Goodbye"; a bittersweet rendering of Maltby & Shire's "If I 
Sing," and Akers' signature reading of Edith Piaf's "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien." 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, and a consummate example of Akers' ability to get inside a song, 
was her brilliant interpretation of Craig Carnelia's anthem to the freedom of 
the spirit, "Flight." It was the perfect climax for a near-perfect evening of 
cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
 * Karen Akers appears at the Cinegrill , Radisson Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 
7000 Hollywood Blvd., at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. tonight, Saturday, June 24 and 25 
, and at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. $20 cover charge, two-drink 
minimum. (213) 466-7000. DON HECKMAN

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WHITE' A CAUTIONARY TALE OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As in the monumental "The Decalogue," in which Polish director Krzysztof 
Kieslowski probed the relevance of the Ten Commandments in modern life, 
Kieslowski has been considering the contemporary meaning of the French 
Revolution slogan "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity" in his provocative ongoing 
"Three Colors" trilogy, which began with "Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 His second installment, "White," a darkly whimsical cautionary take on the 
dangerous distortions of the notion of equality, begins in Paris but is set 
primarily in Warsaw, which allows Kieslowski to revel in warm, wry Eastern 
European absurdist humor while considering the moral chaos of his 
post-communist country. 
</P>
<P>
 The film opens with a wistful, unprepossessing-looking young man named Karol 
Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) apprehensively approaching one of Paris' grand and 
imposing government buildings. Trying for an optimistic attitude, the poor guy 
is dumped on by a pigeon, a harbinger of far worse to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dizzyingly swift sequence, his beautiful but awesomely cruel French wife 
Dominique (Julie Delpy) of six months divorces him, closes their joint account 
and even devises a way of making him wanted by the police. Although they had 
been lovers prior to tying the knot, Karol has been unable to consummate the 
marriage. (Delpy can be glimpsed in "Blue," "Blue's" Juliette Binoche in 
"White.") 
</P>
<P>
 Karol is reduced to playing his comb as a harmonica, hoping that passersby in 
a Metro station will toss him coins. He encounters Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), a 
fellow countryman, who offers to get him back to his native Warsaw -- with 
strings attached. This journey, too inspired and funny to reveal here, further 
brutalizes and humiliates Karol to the extent that he is ripe for exploiting 
ruthlessly the new anything-goes Polish society and economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Not content to resume working at the beauty salon his sweetly solicitous 
brother (Jerzy Stuhr) has been running single-handedly in his absence, he soon 
becomes a tycoon. But when he at last risks a call to Dominique, her response 
inspires in him a course of action at once drastic and stunningly ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribulations of Karol allow Kieslowski not only to comment on the current 
state of Poland but also on the exceedingly perverse twists and turns that love 
can take, especially when couples get carried away in playing games with 
consequences that spin out of their control. There's lots of plot in "White," 
but it is the work of a master of the visual; here Kieslowski has a strong 
assist from the precise yet buoyant camerawork of Edward Klosinski, who shot 
his monumental "Decalogue."  
</P>
<P>
 Kieslowski is generous in his praise of his longtime colleagues who serve him 
so well, co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz and composer Zbigniew Preisner, who 
this time has come up with a mournful yet jaunty tango to accompany Karol on 
his destiny. There's lightness in the performances of the film's principals 
despite the convolutions of their roles, and a lightness in this most rueful of 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA rating: R, for some sexuality and language. Times guidelines: It includes 
highly adult themes, situations.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'OWN WOMAN' CELEBRATES A UNIQUE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Rosa von Praunheim's beguiling "I Am My Own Woman," smiling, white-haired 
Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, who might be mistaken for a plain, sturdy farm woman, 
is seen receiving Germany's Federal Order of Merit Cross in 1992. Presumably, 
Mahlsdorf is being honored for having managed to establish in the former East 
Germany the only private museum and sustain it, against enormous odds, for more 
than 30 years. But Mahlsdorf, born Lothar Berfelde in 1928, might just as well 
have been honored for simply having survived and even prevailed as a gay 
transvestite in a notoriously homophobic communist society. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahlsdorf is a perfect subject for veteran gay filmmaker Praunheim, who has 
over years developed a deft, effortless manner in blending documentary and 
drama in presenting the lives of outsiders and eccentrics. As Mahlsdorf's 
recollections commence, Praunheim gracefully segues into vignettes in which 
Berfelde/Mahlsdorf is portrayed by three actors and finally by himself at 
various stages of his often harrowing life. In the process, this sweet-natured, 
amusing yet stirring film demolishes the lingering stereotypes of gays, 
especially those who also happen to be transvestites, as helpless, limp-wristed 
weaklings. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesser person might have found antique collecting and running a museum 
all-consuming, but Mahlsdorf managed to have a lively romantic life -- depicted 
in some mildly risque scenes -- and to turn his museum home into a meeting 
place and refuge for East Germany's gays and lesbians. Like Quentin Crisp, 
Charlotte von Mahlsdorf exemplifies the individual with the courage to be 
himself -- or herself -- no matter what, and you believe his parting words, 
"I'm a totally happy person." 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes casual frontal male 
nudity, intimations of kinky sex, adult themes and much discussion of 
homosexuality.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ARTY, R&B-FLAVORED ROCK FROM TEXAS VIA SCOTLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The band Texas is from Glasgow, Scotland, and its place in the pop spectrum is 
similarly ambiguous. Its thoroughly American-sounding R&B-flavored rock would 
seem to make it an ideal opening act for, say, the Allman Brothers Band.And its 
hints of an arty edge suggest an "adult alternative" audience that might slip 
Texas into the multi-disc CD player with Cowboy Junkies and Maria McKee. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Texas hasn't been able to get onto a commercial fast track. After 
three albums, it's still playing to small audiences at clubs like the Roxy, 
where Wednesday's show presented the band's established strengths -- Sharleen 
Spiteri's arresting vocals, Ally McErlaine's forceful, flavorful blues-rock 
guitar, evocations of a panorama of Southern music, from roots blues to Stax 
soul to Al Green. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Green hit "Tired of Being Alone," Texas showed the value of following 
the spirit rather than the letter of a song, avoiding the easy, seductive band 
arrangement it plays on its new album in favor of a spare, acoustic setting 
that encouraged a free, instinctive performance by Spiteri. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all these admirable ingredients, Texas' impact was spotty instead of 
sustained. Its best material conveys disturbing currents of emotional conflict, 
but the melodies and arrangements often tend to be dry and anonymous, and on 
stage the band tends to fall into flavorless power jams. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still great potential in this outfit, but after eight years it's time 
to get it in gear. RICHARD CROMELIN

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; EPIC TREATMENT OF 'BEN-HUR' IN COMMEMORATIVE EDITION; THE 
LASER DISC RELEASE MARKING ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY INCLUDES A COMPELLING HOURLONG 
DOCUMENTARY WITH HISTORICAL FOOTAGE AND INTERVIEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Epic films seem to call for epic laser-disc presentations, so the 35th 
anniversary of "Ben-Hur" brings with it a commemorative MGM/UA Home Video 
edition ($100) almost as imposing as the 212-minute movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1959 film, starring a dashing Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur, the Judean 
locked in combat against his childhood pal Messala -- played by Stephen Boyd -- 
a key Roman commander in biblical Jerusalem, swept the Academy Awards with 11 
statuettes, more than any other film before or since. Its Oscars include best 
picture, director (William Wyler), actor (Heston), supporting actor (Hugh 
Griffith), color photography, editing, set decoration and music (Miklos Rozsa). 
</P>
<P>
 The film, based on Gen. Lew Wallace's popular 19th-Century novel, is a 
mesmerizing view of Christ through the eyes of a contemporary, the ultimately 
converted Ben-Hur. Wyler says in footage from a 1981 interview, included in the 
compelling documentary made for this commemorative edition (and also available 
on video), that he staged all the scenes with Christ "so that you only show the 
back of his head. You saw the way people reacted to him. You think you saw him, 
you think you heard his voice, but you didn't really." It is an effective means 
of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's monumental 20-minute chariot race pitting Heston against his enemy 
Boyd has never been more exciting on the home screen than in this full 
wide-screen laser presentation. The race itself took more than a year to 
prepare, with legendary stunt man Yakima Canutt overseeing it. He put the stunt 
men who were to race the chariots through a rigorous daily regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Heston determinedly showed up at every session. "When the picture started he 
could drive a chariot just about as well as anyone in the business," the late 
Canutt says admiringly in an archival interview in the accompanying 
documentary, "Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Heston was not the first choice for the lead. In fact, reports Gore Vidal, 
who was never credited with the script by the Writers Guild but was among those 
brought in to help salvage it, "Heston was never on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Newman ("Silver Chalice") was, but said he would never again "act in a 
cocktail dress." Others considered included Kirk Douglas, Marlon Brando and 
just about every other actor in and out of Hollywood, many who tried out in an 
open casting call. Some of these screen tests are included in the hour 
documentary as part of this lavish laser package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wyler, just coming off "The Big Country," remembered the actor who had 
played the intense ranch foreman for him. Wyler thought he would be perfect, 
his daughter Catherine recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The new five-disc laser set comes in the CAV mode (standard play), so that the 
full features of the format (freeze frame, single frame, slow motion) can all 
be used as all three hours and 42 minutes unreel on eight sides. Presented in 
its big-screen aspect ratio of 2.76:1, the thin band of film is topped and 
bottomed with wide black bands. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes it possible to see director Wyler's original framing and vision, 
but it does reduce the image to roughly a third of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich color digital video transfer loses none of the big-screen epic's 
detail or power, with the color as brilliant as though it had been shot 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Miklos Rozsa score can be isolated and enjoyed simply as a 
musical sound track on a separate analog track, re-mastered to Dolby Surround 
sound from the MGM film's original magnetic masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth side, in CLV (extended play), offers the 59-minute documentary, 
narrated by Christopher Plummer. It's not a bad idea to watch it first, 
especially if you're not familiar with the film's background. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the documentary is not letterboxed, it helps you appreciate how much is 
lost, especially in the chariot race and the Roman galley scenes, when the 
action is reduced to the ratio of a TV screen without letterboxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as engrossing as the film itself, the documentary, produced by Scott 
Benson over nine months, includes wonderful archival footage tracing the 
history of the epic, from novel through stage and film incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its 1926 predecessor, the 1959 "Ben-Hur" was also the most expensive 
movie of its day. A costly $18-million gamble (when the average film ran $2 
million-$3 million), it was in production for three years. In today's dollars 
that would translate to roughly $150 million, according to MGM/UA Home Video 
chief George Feltenstein. Was it worth it? See for yourself.

 Bravo to FreightTrain Shakespeare. In "Pericles," the young Culver City troupe 
has taken Shakespeare's seldom-seen romance and turned it into a dazzling 
theatrical odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 There's hardly a dull moment in this fairy tale of incest and exile, largely 
because director Tom Quaintance and his hard-working 13-member cast grasp that 
imagination, not extravagance, is what counts in the theater. (Speaking of hard 
work, the company is running this show in rotating repertory with "Henry V.") 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rankin, who has a bit of Kenneth Branagh's boyish athleticism, plays the 
title hero, a prince who flees his native Tyre after discovering the incestuous 
secret of Antiochus (Franc Ross), a neighboring king. Thus begins a rollicking 
maritime adventure that has Pericles finding a queen (Judy Waters), losing a 
daughter (Deirdre Imershein) and eluding death through his own wit and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Such epic sprawl might have vanquished a less inventive company, but 
Quaintance always finds ways to stay one step ahead of the audience. For 
instance, Gower, the lone narrator of the text, is here split into a 
three-actor Brechtian chorus (Maria Spassoff, Michael Bryan French and Gregg 
Koski) sporting suitably eclectic attire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of a first-act sword duel, the cast very quickly and deftly acts 
out a similar scene from the end of "Hamlet," complete with a poisoned goblet 
and snatches of dialogue from that tragedy's denouement. It's a smart, funny 
twist that's over in a few seconds -- and yet it delivers so much pleasure to 
the stunned audience that there's never any question whether it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of production that restores one's faith in Shakespeare on a 
shoestring. 
</P>

, 30 minutes. Land Ark Garage Treads Water 
</P>
<P>
 There's water, water everywhere in two new one-acts by the Land Ark Garage 
Theater at Theatre/Theater, but unfortunately there's nothing much to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, "Holy Water," by Land Ark co-founder Gene H. Butler, concerns 
Johnny (Rod Arrants), a harried middle-aged man who has fled his boring job and 
marriage by taking a weeklong bubble bath. Following his own weird brand of 
bliss, Johnny now makes bad plumbing jokes and hums "The Girl From Ipanema" 
while shooting bubbles with a red squirt gun. 
</P>
<P>
 This aimless reverie is interrupted -- not a moment too soon -- by Roger 
(Butler, in a sharp bit of comic underplaying), a timid baker sent at the 
behest of Johnny's angry wife. Johnny finally sheds his slap-happy facade and 
tells Roger, in the would-be climax: "Six days ago I died, murdered by the fear 
of living." 
</P>
<P>
 A more literal murder forms the basis for Butler's other one-act, "The Grand 
Old Blue." Here, two outlaws, Jesse (Angelo McCabe) and Frank (Butler), sit at 
the oceanside (hence the title) and argue over their roles in a botched 
robbery. Not surprisingly, this soon descends into a contrived dialogue about 
the nature of freedom, and the freedom of nature, with the sea invoked as a 
kind of catchall metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few nicely written passages, both plays, as directed by Butler, 
strain for a cosmic significance that stays well out of reach. "Holy Water," in 
particular, seems to be aiming for Christopher Durang-type zaniness but winds 
up playing much like a half-baked college skit. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening is, you might say, a wash. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: POST-COLD WAR LIFE IN TAMARIND'S 'NEBRASKA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First produced at La Jolla Playhouse in the summer of 1989, Keith Reddin's 
"Nebraska" at the Tamarind Theatre is a fascinating and humorous take on the 
post-Cold War political climate explored through the microcosm of a U.S. 
military base in rural Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Reddin thinks globally but writes locally. The military personnel marooned on 
this remote outpost are hardly on the cutting edge of world affairs. But there 
is a nuclear silo on the base. And however pastoral and bucolic the setting, 
the knowledge of that awesomely destructive force hangs in the air along with 
the constant haze of cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, USAF Lt. Dean Swift (Tom Provost) smokes. Swift drinks. He even cheats on 
his wife. But that's not why Swift feels so anxious and uncertain. (What's a 
little fooling around when you're dealing in terms of global annihilation?) 
It's just that now, with the "evil empire" of Russia effectively neutralized, 
Swift is having trouble feeling like a good guy.  
</P>
<P>
 For Swift, the absence of moral certainty has resulted in a pervasive moral 
malaise, an endemic affliction on this military base. Swift has lost his 
crucial ability to view the world in black and white absolutes, a 
career-breaking deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Henry Polic II uses isolation as a key metaphor in his effectively 
disorienting staging. Russell Pyle's purposely ugly set and moody lighting 
further contribute to the atmosphere of dread and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't laughs as well, and the actors know how to play the 
comic rhythms in this very black comedy. The fine cast includes Provost, 
Suzanne McKenney, Ed Beechner, Christopher V. Alessi, Christy Noonan and 
Patricia Tallman. Greg Allan Martin is heartbreaking as the hapless Maj. Jack 
Gurney, a man destroyed by his own inflexible goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Nebraska," Tamarind Theatre, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends July 17. $15. (213) 466-1767. 
Running time: 2 hours. 'Charlemagne' on Transforming Roles 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Miles' "Charlemagne" at the Fountain is a charged examination of 
transvestism and transsexualism that narrowly avoids melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-blooded beauty Clara (Jan Cobler) desperately longs for an heir to keep 
her family estate intact. The title of the play refers to Clara's prize horse, 
a former champion who has recently been put out to stud. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Clara's husband, Harry (Hans Tester), feels like a prize stud 
himself. However, the pressures on Harry are not all procreative. An actor, 
Harry likes to dress up -- and not just for his latest role. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clara finds out that Harry frequently bedecks himself in women's clothing 
and goes out on the town, she's alternately disgusted, perplexed and 
guilt-ridden. Even Clara's best friend Lilibet (Lynn Ann Leveridge), an 
inveterate yenta, cannot oil the waters of this troubled marriage -- especially 
after Harry realizes that he is actually a transsexual and starts taking steps 
toward his ultimate goal of becoming a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot may sound like the topic of a daytime talk show, and indeed Miles 
(best known as an actress in such films as "Ryan's Daughter" and "The Sailor 
Who Fell From Grace With the Sea") treads a fine line between emotionalism and 
bathos. However, Miles' elegant language and splendid sense of dramatic irony 
salvage this, her first full-length play, from being yet another 
aberration-of-the-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Zentis' cozy British cottage set makes one want to book the next 
flight to Heathrow. Director Ted Weiant renders Miles' vision with sensitivity 
and humor, neatly avoiding any trace of camp. Tester, Cobler and Leveridge 
avoid similar pitfalls throughout, tempering Miles' brittle, frequently facile 
dialogue with sincerity and restraint. Tester, especially, negotiates a 
particularly difficult role without a misstep -- even while wearing six-inch 
heels. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; GARCIA DIRECTS AN ENGAGING 'RACE2LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Race2Love," in Los Angeles Theatre Center's downstairs hall, is a wry and 
engaging one-act chronicling an interracial romance, related by a man and a 
woman in both the past and present tenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Its big drawing card may be the fact that movie star Andy Garcia directed it 
-- and his direction is smoothly professional. But the real star of the show is 
writer-actor Joe Drago, who writes with a simple, unassuming voice and likewise 
acts the role of Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's a Sicilian American guy who falls for an African American woman but 
isn't sure how far to fall. The woman is played by Paunita Nichols, who adds 
considerable charm and also takes on the brief roles of Michael's other 
girlfriends and his mother with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with the play is an abrupt ending that leaves us dangling 
about three-fourths of the way into the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago's duet is preceded by Rick Simone's one-man, three-character piece, 
"These People." He plays an L.A. dude who works in a surf and ski shop, plus 
two New Yorkers -- an Italian American pizza maker and an African American 
woman who works at Kentucky Fried Chicken and attends NYU. The three appear to 
be loosely connected by a fourth, unseen character. 
</P>
<P>
 Simone's first go-round with his people looks superficial, but as he returns 
to them, we hear less predictable revelations about their families and their 
love lives -- and the characters deepen. Simone, who himself looks like a teen 
idol, skillfully delineates his characters with posture and voice. 
</P>
<P>
 His writing is flavorful and funny but occasionally stoops to manipulative 
heart-tugging, and he should shorten his own sermonizing at the beginning and 
end. Keny Long directed. 
</P>
<P>
 The double bill, produced by George Fernandez and Colin Cox in association 
with Will & Company, benefits the Venice Arts Mecca, an organization that 
creates arts training programs for youth in Venice and also campaigns to revive 
the Venice Beach Pavilion as an arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Race2Love" and "These People," Los Angeles Theatre Center Theatre 3, 514 S. 
Spring St., Los Angeles. Tonight, Saturday, June 23-25, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m.

STUCK IN TIME; CLOSED SINCE THE QUAKE, THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM'S BURBANK 
BRANCH REOPENS WITH 'TREASURES OF THE TAR PITS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Shaw was mounting the cast of a 20,000-year-old camel skull in the Media 
City Center when a shopper came up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camels?" she said. "We had camels here?" 
</P>
<P>
 You bet. Camels and lions and short-faced bears and imperial mammoths and 
large-headed llamas and saber-toothed cats and a host of other animals, most of 
them long extinct. And the reason we know so much about those animals and the 
other living things that once filled the Los Angeles Basin is because countless 
numbers of them were trapped in the sticky asphalt of the La Brea tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural History Museum/Burbank has been closed since it was shaken Jan. 17 
by the Northridge quake. It reopens today on a high note with "Treasures of the 
Tar Pits," an exhibit that tells the story of the Southland's Ice Age animals 
and the unique asphalt deposits that both killed and preserved them. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the first traveling exhibit to document the amazing cache of Ice 
Age fossils that have been pulled from the pools of asphalt (not tar) that 
continue to bubble up in Hancock Park, perfuming the air with pitch. After five 
years on the road, the exhibit will end its tour in Burbank, where visitors can 
do everything from handle a fossilized thigh bone to see for themselves just 
how tenacious asphalt can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, 42, who lives in Granada Hills, is collections manager at the George C. 
Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries in Hancock Park and helped organize the 
show. As Shaw explains, he and his colleagues set out to give visitors a 
coherent picture of what life was like in the Los Angeles Basin in the late 
Pleistocene era, about 20,000 years ago. Shaw thinks many people will be 
surprised by what they see. In Shaw's view, the biggest misconception most 
people have is about the climate of the period. "People expect it to be a more 
tropical environment," he says. In fact, the Southland of the time was probably 
several degrees cooler than it is now and somewhat more humid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 40,000 years, Los Angeles' asphalt deposits have acted as what 
Shaw terms a "self-baiting trap." Over the eons, millions of animals have 
stumbled onto the surface asphalt, which someone once described as "the color 
of very good licorice and the consistency of very bad fudge." 
</P>
<P>
 Less like quicksand than flypaper, the asphalt held onto its victims, which 
sometimes died of starvation and exhaustion. More often, the struggling animals 
attracted predators, many of which were snared in turn. In warm weather 
especially, when the asphalt becomes more viscous, the deposits become 
carnivore traps. Four sabertooths, dire wolves and other carnivores died in the 
tar pits for every imperial mammoth, Western horse and other large herbivore 
that lost its life there. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, the tar pits trap pigeons and other small mammals and even the 
occasional human. A few years ago, a Page Museum staffer got stuck when he 
scrambled over a fence to recover a traffic cone someone had tossed onto the 
surface of Pit 61/67. The worst of it, he said after his colleagues rescued 
him: "One man came by and said to his son, 'See! That's how the dumb animals 
got stuck,' and then walked away!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Dunn, administrator of the Burbank museum, says one of the show's 
highlights is the Mark Hallett mural that was commissioned for the traveling 
exhibit. The painting, which measures 4 by 8 1/2 feet, details a moment in the 
Darwinian struggle that took place daily at the tar pits. Depicting a 
remarkable number of the more than 550 plant and animal species that have been 
found at the site, the mural, Dunn notes, "is not only correct scientifically, 
it's a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
 The show also features six skeletons -- all real fossilized bone -- of animals 
that died in the local asphalt. Originally the skeletons were exhibited in the 
"dead-animal poses" typical of older museums, but Shaw and a colleague 
remounted them in more evocative positions. Now the Ice Age coyote seems to 
howl at the moon. The male dire wolf sniffs the female. The American lion 
stands with cocked head. And the sabertooth crouches as if ready to pounce, 
while its intended prey, a Harlan's giant ground sloth, raises an arm to defend 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A major scientific discovery is reflected in the exhibit: the importance of 
micro-fossils to our understanding of the Ice Age. During the early period of 
excavation at the tar pits, which began in 1913, the fossil collectors showed 
"a bias toward the large," Shaw says. More than a million bones were dug up 
during that period, but less than 1% were remains of plants or animals smaller 
than a rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Today scientists know that smaller fossils often contain more scientific 
information about matters such as the former climate of the site than mastodon 
skulls and other big, dramatic trophies.  
</P>
<P>
 "The animals and plants that produce micro-fossils usually live in the area 
where they were born," Shaw explains. "They can tell you a lot more about the 
conditions in the specific sites where they are found than the fossils of large 
mammals and birds that can migrate as much as 30 miles a day."  
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the only fossils of insects and other tiny living things that 
survive from the early digs were found in dirt inadvertently left inside the 
skulls of sabertooths. Fossilized plant matter has been found packed into pits 
in the teeth of extinct bison. Since scientists began excavating again in the 
mid-1960s at Pit 91, they have added more than 300 species, most of them small, 
to the 250 originally found. 
</P>
<P>
 The show offers other treasures, including a cast of the skull of the only 
ancient human whose remains have been found in the tar pits. Called La Brea 
woman, she was a Chumash-like Indian felled in her 20s by a blow from a blunt 
instrument. Museum folks refer to the 9,000-year-old woman as Los Angeles' 
first murder victim. The kids are going to love her story and everything else 
here. Just warn them before they go that they aren't going to see dinosaurs. 
The Jurassic giants were extinct long before the tar pits began to work their 
wicked, fascinating work. Where and When

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; CELEBRATING A MUSICAL LEGACY; WELLINGTON'S PLANS A 100TH 
BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE SONGWRITER JIMMY MCHUGH. CABARET SINGERS WILL 
PERFORM THE EVER-POPULAR TUNES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While not as well-known as some of his more famous contemporaries such as 
George Gershwin or Irving Berlin, the songs of Jimmy McHugh remain an integral 
part of the American musical landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 McHugh, who died in 1969 at the age of 74, was the composer of many hits of 
the pre-rock era, such as "I'm in the Mood for Love," "I Can't Give You 
Anything but Love," "Don't Blame Me," "On the Sunny Side of the Street" and "I 
Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night." McHugh's songs have been performed by 
artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to Bob Dylan and Carmen Miranda to Cab 
Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
 McHugh, who started his career writing for Harlem's Cotton Club revues, later 
moved to Hollywood, where he wrote songs for more than 50 films. McHugh's 
collaborators included Dorothy Fields, Harold Adamson, Frank Loesser and Johnny 
Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellington's Restaurant and Cabaret will host a 100th birthday anniversary 
tribute to songwriter McHugh at 7:30 p.m. June 26 at the North Hollywood 
eatery.  
</P>
<P>
 Wellington's resident pianist and music director Holly Addy first conceived 
the show after a serendipitous meeting with Lucille Meyers, McHugh's former 
secretary, and Gretchen Adamson, widow of McHugh's collaborator, lyricist 
Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I literally fell into," Addy said. "It's a wonderful 
opportunity for me as a singer/pianist." The show will feature Addy and several 
other cabaret singers performing more than 25 of McHugh's compositions.  
</P>
<P>
 Although she has been an accompanist all her professional life, Addy's singing 
is relatively new. She started at Wellington's about five years ago as a dinner 
pianist, and only at the urging of the restaurant's owner John Moses did Addy 
start singing about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's thrown anything at me yet," Addy said. "It's turned out to be 
extremely satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the Jimmy McHugh tribute are $21 and include dinner, tax and tip. 
Wellington's, 4354 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Call (818) 980-1430.

 A PLAY TENT: The Northridge earthquake hit at possibly the worst time for 
Actors Alley theater company. The company had spent months readying a new 
venue, El Portal Theater, and on the eve of its first production at the new 
facility, the temblor struck, severely damaging the theater on Lankershim 
Boulevard. A search for a temporary venue ensued, and two productions were 
staged at Valley College.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the company's summer/fall season will be presented in a 99-seat tent on 
the grounds of the Television Academy across the street from El Portal. The 
tent was made possible by support from the Community Redevelopment Agency and a 
grant from the Irvine Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ultimately appropriate that we're across the street from the El Portal," 
Robert Caine, Actors Alley managing director, said philosophically. "Never say 
die. We're coming back."  
</P>
<P>
 Caine estimates El Portal theater will not reopen until at least next June. 
The company is trying to secure support from FEMA and the SBA. The quake also 
is forcing company officials to go through a second round of building permits 
and other bureaucratic red tape in the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get from a liability to an asset," Caine said. "You make do 
with what you have."  
</P>
<P>
 The season, alternately titled "A Summer of Contentment" or "The 6.8 Encore," 
is comprised of three pieces that are all upbeat and light, Caine said. It 
begins July 13 with previews of "Light Sensitive," a dramatic comedy about a 
blinded former New York City cabbie who rediscovers love, which will run 
through Aug. 21.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Ayckbourn's "Round and Round the Garden" will preview Aug. 31 and run 
through Sept. 25. This comedy, part of a trilogy, "The Norman Conquests," is 
about three women and a man who confuse innocent intentions with honorable 
ones. The season concludes with a musical, "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the 
Ukraine," opening Oct. 12 and running through Nov. 20. Additionally, Actors 
Alley will hold three AIDS benefits, one scheduled for the first Friday 
performance of each production. 
</P>
<P>
 Season subscriptions and individual tickets are on sale. Regular single 
tickets are $18, with discounts available for seniors, students, teachers and 
acting union members. Call (818) 508-4200.  
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC DOCTORS: These days, when many Angelenos find their lives to be one 
blurred freeway ride after another, how do people find the time to rehearse and 
perform with a symphony orchestra and continue a medical career? Members of the 
Los Angeles Doctors Symphony Orchestra do just that.  
</P>
<P>
 "How can we not find the time?" asked Dr. Ivan Shulman, the orchestra's music 
director. "Music is important. The arts are essential to our spiritual and 
emotional well-being. Music is a respite from our troubled times." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, founded in 1953, claims to be the oldest of its kind in the 
United States still presenting regular concerts. The orchestra plays between 
four and six concerts annually, usually for charitable organizations. Its name 
notwithstanding, the 75-piece ensemble consists of physicians, dentists, nurses 
and other medical personnel. It is financially self-supporting and has no 
outside sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will perform Tuesday at the Stephen S. Wise Temple. Guido Lamell is 
the guest conductor and the featured soloist is Chinese violinist Yun Tang. The 
program will include the "Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 73" by Brahms, "Les 
Preludes" by Liszt, and "Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor" by Bruch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Doctors Symphony Orchestra concert begins at 8 p.m. Tuesday at 
the Stephen S. Wise Temple, 15500 Stephen Wise Drive. Admission is free. Call 
(310) 476-8561.

DRAWING ON EMPATHY; GRAPHICS STUDENTS LINK THEIR SKILLS WITH CONCERN FOR THE 
COMMUNITY BY DESIGNING WINNING LITERACY POSTERS.

 In Kay L. M. Wilder's graphics classes at Woodbury University, students learn 
not only design techniques, but responsibility to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graphics students should involve themselves in the community once or twice a 
year," she said. "I do this in my work and I encourage students to do it and 
give back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder's spring quarter Graphics II class recently got the opportunity to do 
that together. Each student was asked to join in a competition, to design a 
poster that would promote the free literacy services of the Alliance of Burbank 
Literacy Educators (ABLE). 
</P>
<P>
 A committee from the alliance -- which includes the Burbank Public Library, 
Burbank Adult School, Salvation Army and YMCA in Burbank and Woodbury -- judged 
the entries and selected one student's poster for display in businesses, 
government offices and community organizations throughout Burbank. They looked 
for an image that would appeal to older people with limited reading skills, ESL 
(English as second language) individuals and school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning poster design, by Kai Vilmi, and five other entries recognized for 
graphic or conceptual merit, are on view in Woodbury's art gallery, along with 
the annual student art / design exhibit. The 25 other submissions may be seen 
in Woodbury's Design Center on graduation day, June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Vilmi, a sophomore from Finland, could relate to someone having language 
difficulties here. Despite nine years of English instruction in Finland, he 
found it difficult to speak English when he came here two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His poster design incorporates photographs of people from various backgrounds 
with the text, "Reading. Writing. For your life. Learning is free." He chose to 
keep "the text simple, like a political poster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vilmi's poster shows "what you can do when you learn to read: Read to your 
child, get a better job, have more unity in your family and a better self-image 
-- be a part of society rather than be on the outside," Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratna Widjaja came to the United States 3 1/2 years ago from Indonesia knowing 
English grammar but having difficulty speaking the language. She enrolled in 
ESL classes in Santa Monica and later at Glendale College and Woodbury. Her 
whimsical depictions of the alphabet convey her desire "for people to look at 
the poster and think 'learning the alphabet will be fun' rather than it has too 
much type," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Runner-up Lillian Wong had her mother in mind when she designed her poster. 
"She's from Hong Kong, and her English isn't that good," she said. "Living in 
Chinatown, she doesn't have to speak English that much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Smart, who chairs the alliance and is the Burbank Library's literacy 
coordinator, said students were asked to meet four criteria in their designs: 
Express a positive message about getting literacy help, appeal to prospective 
new readers, be suitable for display in business windows and have ABLE's phone 
number clearly visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the judging committee's members were two women enrolled in Burbank's 
literacy programs. One student is an adult new reader who speaks English as her 
native language. She is working with a tutor from the Burbank Library's 
program. The other is in an ESL class at the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the library, we try to include students in the decision-making," Smart 
said. These women contributed insight into whether "one poster was easier to 
read than another," she said, and whether a poster might repel potential new 
readers by inadvertently talking down to or demeaning them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a challenge not to insult" new readers, said sophomore Sean Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 His understanding of their dilemma, and that of his classmates, was heightened 
by Wilder's groundwork for the assignment. She invited Smart to speak to the 
class. Wilder showed a film documentary about a young man who could not read to 
his child, and the feature film, "El Norte," about a brother and sister who 
come to this country from Central America and struggle to survive without 
English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder said she wanted the assignment to be "more than just a concept. I 
wanted to introduce a feeling of empathy, to help (students) identify with 
someone outside of themselves and feel the magnitude of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of literacy posters," Smart said, "and I think these Woodbury 
posters are superior to anything I've seen designed by professional advertisers 
because the students have been sensitive to the topic." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to produce 1,000 posters based on Vilmi's design. Smart said they 
could be displayed by the end of this summer.

THEATER REVIEW; NOTHING FISHY HERE; THE MUSICAL REVIVAL OF BERTOLT BRECHT'S 'A 
MAN'S A MAN' IS THE ODESSA THEATRE'S BEST PRODUCTION SO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a while there it appeared that anti-war plays might be growing as passe as 
Cold War spy novels. That was before (fill in any of several developing or 
ongoing wars), which makes a musical revival of Bertolt Brecht's 1926 pacifist 
drama, "A Man's a Man," achingly relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Director and actor James Kennedy has dusted off this difficult but stinging 
satire of a military war machine (written when Brecht was only 28) and turned 
the Odessa Theatre in North Hollywood (formerly the Gnu) into a carnival-like 
army recruitment poster. 
</P>
<P>
 That would have been fine with Brecht. His anti-war dialectic and theoretical 
Theater of Alienation (in which ideas are designed to supplant emotions) can be 
seen in their formative stage in this odyssey of a wimpy husband and dockworker 
named Gayly Gay (the impressive Gary Iverson) who goes off to buy a fish and 
winds up in His Majesty's Imperial Army. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear how stern director Kennedy was with his alter-ego acting self. 
Kennedy co-stars in his own show as a fierce military commander nicknamed 
Bloody Five who winds up reversing roles with, of all people, the passive Gayly 
Gay, the softy who's transformed by regimentation into a killer-warrior. (One 
of Brecht's big themes here is power and dominance and the subsequent loss of 
identity.) 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the characteristic Kennedy bombast informs both the direction 
and his acting. What's intriguing about his stage presence is his fireplug 
likeness to James Cagney at his rat-a-tat-tat best. The bellowing Kennedy takes 
the stage like a smoking Tommy gun, whether barking at his scummy regiment or 
its sexual purveyor, Widow Begbick (Barbara Murray's 
right-on-the-Brechtian-mark camp follower). 
</P>
<P>
 The production, from Eric Bentley's translation, is certainly the 6-month-old 
Odessa Theatre's best work to date. The trouble is that theatergoers who are 
Brechtian neophytes will get lost in the tangle of farce, satire, song, 
vaudeville and dance. Even Brechtian enthusiasts have their work cut out for 
them, because the production too often is too busy and frenetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly incomprehensible are a pair of Indian characters from the Pagoda 
of the Yellow God. (The musical drama takes place in India, a classic Brecht 
fantasy land that could be anyplace.) These two quasi-Oriental characters 
(unwisely cast with Anglo actors) murkily advance a major plot point about a 
drunken soldier, Jeraiah Jip (co-artistic director Reese Howard's well-cast 
battlefield Everyman) who goes AWOL and is replaced by the unwitting faceless 
man out shopping for a fish, the aforementioned Gayly Gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's obvious strength is Tanya Everett Bagot's brash choreography, 
notably Adrienne Hurd's black-clad bar girl, whose towering body and dynamic 
footwork threaten to blow everyone else off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is an ensemble production with a huge 19-member cast. Almost as 
choreographically propulsive as Hurd is Roumel Reaux as a saber-flashing grunt 
who opens the production with a mesmerizing, strobe-lit military dance drill 
number under fight choreographer Walter Bagot (Tanya Bagot's husband). 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the musical action is musical director and onstage pianist Gordon 
Glor. The cast's singing is dangerously uneven in the case of co-stars Kennedy 
and Iverson, who would do well to merely recite their lyrics. Vocally, the 
show's sterling, soaring thrush is Donna Christy, as one of three sibling 
vixens who flaunt their body wares at the base brothel/saloon. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighting (Gregory Santana) and the sound design (Renji Philip are sharp 
components. But the austere stage and blank walls cry out for some imaginary 
decor, some vestige of a set design, instead of the emptiness here. Where and

LONELY HEARTS TV CLUB; PLAYWRIGHTS TRACE THE TALK SHOW PHENOMENON SWEEPING 
AMERICA.

 It all started in 1932, during the Depression. An ex-con named Lester Kroll, 
jailed twice for non- payment of child support, presuming his failed marriage 
gave him some insight, got into the marriage advice business. And where better 
to give it than on the radio. As "John J. Anthony, Expert in Marital 
Relations," Kroll gained national fame giving listeners what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Agony on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Times haven't changed. If anything, they've gotten worse, according to the 
creators of "Flight to Arkadelphia," opening this weekend at the NoHo Studios. 
The dark comedy was created through improvisation by four people, but the 
playwrights of record and the production's co-directors, Marc Silver and John 
Mueller, have strong feelings about the kind of programming television viewers 
are glued to by the hordes, from "Geraldo" on up -- or down. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy concerns four people who answer the phones for "Unresolved 
Miseries," one of those shows that brings the ugly to the millions. Until 
recently, Silver, probably best known for a recurring role on "Designing 
Women," was himself answering the phones for a similar show. The idea for the 
play was born while he listened to the callers' woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people would call in," Silver says, "because they wanted to tell their 
own stories. They pretty much want to tell you what's happening in their lives. 
And they want to be on TV. I would listen to this week after week after week, 
and suddenly this idea started formulating in my little brain. . . . It's a big 
part of their lives. It becomes a little eerie after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 As the idea fermented, Silver called in three other actors, including Mueller, 
laid out the basic story line, and improvs began. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver continues: "It's about those talk shows and what they're really 
starting to do to people. It's starting to affect the way we deal with other 
people, the way we think and the way we have ideas. Especially these four 
particular people who answer the phones. They're an example of the people who 
are calling in to the TV shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller, who last appeared on stage in "Be Bop A Lula" at Theatre / Theater in 
Hollywood, and was in the recent film "These Friends of Mine," says the play is 
basically about loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially," Mueller explains, "society is becoming more and more lonely. 
More people are having a hard time communicating. Everything gets blown out of 
proportion, and you have murderers becoming celebrities, and all kinds of 
things like that. That's what we wanted to touch upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller says that as the play progresses, the four characters slowly start to 
become like the callers, the desperately lonely people who phone in just to 
hear themselves talk. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the play's points is that today's viewers seem to be getting their 
ideas about life from these programs. Silver, who has seen the phenomenon from 
the inside, says, "We're getting our values and our morals from "Geraldo" and 
other talk shows, and call-in informational shows, crime shows. Viewers' 
picture of how things are supposed to be (is) coming from very bizarre places." 
</P>
<P>
 With a wry chuckle, Mueller agrees. "The general public finds that 
fascinating, to see all that aired out right in front of them," he says. 
"Nothing is sacred anymore, nothing is private. You have access to everything, 
with video cameras everywhere. Major crimes are captured on video." 
</P>
<P>
 As Paddy Chayefsky predicted in his film "Network," Silver and Mueller agree 
that the networks are close to creating havoc themselves, just to raise 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really happening," Silver says. "We see the talk show host trying to 
incite riots on their own shows. They're trying to get people to confront each 
other. They're trying to create explosions, because it's good television." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller shakes his head at the thought, and pauses to let the idea take shape. 
"The next step would be something very drastic," he adds. "It would be very 
bleak. There is -- I don't remember the name -- but I heard there's a video out 
there that has nothing but death scenes. If it went any further," he says, "it 
might just be madness in the streets."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a lonely, sad thing," Silver adds. "I'm confused about it. I 
don't know if we have any answers for it. In the play we're just showing it, 
and showing its effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiterating that "Arkadelphia" is a comedy, Silver is also concerned that its 
serious intent comes across. "We're getting to this strange area," he says, 
"where human feelings and important things that we need to share with each 
other are getting lost. We're forgetting who we are. And what we're here for."

COVER STORY; CYBERVAL; A WRITER OVERCOMES THE FEAR OF A NEW PC WITH A LITTLE 
HELP FROM YOUNG EXPERTS.

 Not long ago I became part of a trend, both nationally and here in the Valley. 
Like the other Americans who bought 50 million personal computers last year 
alone, I bought a new PC -- a better, faster, more powerful model than the 
Stone Age IBM clone my son took off to college eight years ago. This is the 
story of the first weeks of the bittersweet romance between me and my new IBM 
compatible.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I have a standard answer for friends who ask what kind of computer I bought. 
"It's beige," I tell them. Because I knew from the outset that I didn't want to 
devote the rest of my adult life to figuring out how much electronic firepower 
I needed, I turned the task over to my 24-year-old son, Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-literate (computer-gifted, if you ask his mother), Eric made lists of 
possible options and checked them twice. He tapped his more expert pals for 
advice, then worked the phones to compare prices. Finally, he asked an 
especially knowledgeable friend, Mark Bentkower, if he would join us, and we 
made an appointment at a computer store known for customizing PCs at a 
competitive price. 
</P>
<P>
 At the store Eric and Mark did most of the talking. They had strong views on 
such things as how fast the modem should be. They spoke of the rate in bits per 
second and baud. Baud? I'm a recovering English major. When I hear baud, I 
think of the Wife of Bath, Moll Flanders, those bawds. Actually, I too know 
that baud rate indicates how quickly your computer sends or receives 
information. As such, it has a major impact on how much you enjoy your system. 
Too slow a modem will drive you crazy and will ultimately cost you a fortune in 
phone charges (since the modem is the part of the system that allows you to 
connect with other computers and exchange information over phone lines). The 
higher your baud, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 From Day One, I had decided to have the kind of relationship with my computer 
I have with my Honda. What matters to me is that it works, not how it works. I 
don't want be a computer doctor when I grow up. But not everybody feels that 
way about their machine helpers. Earlier this year, at a conference on women 
and the Internet at the Huntington in San Marino, I ran into the aptly named 
Rhonda Super. A North Hollywood resident, Super, 42, works in the entertainment 
industry and dreams of the day when she will configure the elements she has so 
carefully researched into the computer of her dreams. "I love hardware," says 
Super. "I like making quilts, and I think it's the same concept. You construct 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't make quilts, but I did write the check after the Biederman deal was 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 To be really accurate, I would describe my new computer as ecru. Getting 
Started, or Is There Anything on TV? 
</P>
<P>
 If you are like most people, which is to say, if technology doesn't make you 
tingle, the first thing that happens when you get a new computer is that you 
are afraid of it. Not the way you're afraid of getting carjacked or losing the 
game of life, but the way you're afraid of having to program your VCR in a 
timed test. You're intimidated. This happens to virtually everyone. Actor John 
Goodman was brave enough to screech at Elizabeth Taylor in "The Flintstones" 
movie, but he recently revealed on a TV talk show that he had just bought a new 
computer and -- these are his exact words -- "I'm scared to death of it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a reason for this. Computer culture isn't nearly as amicable as terms 
such as user-friendly would lead you to believe. Cyberculture has a 
we're-hip-and-you're-not aspect to it that can put off all but the most 
confident. For example, take the Internet (please). Finding your way onto the 
Internet may be the single hardest thing you will ever have to do (see 
accompanying story). Even the guides to the Internet seem to be written in 
secret code. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason the Internet is harder to join than an Afrikaner country 
club is that nobody who is already on the Internet really wants to help you 
over the Great Technodivide to their side, where the cool people pass 
electronic notes at the speed of light. And once you do manage to get 
connected, "newbies," as Internet plebes are called, are often treated to 
cyberscorn, especially if they came aboard via a commercial access provider. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's gonna happen is one day, soon after you unpack your new computer, 
you're going to sit down in front of your monitor, hands hovering Van 
Cliburn-like over the keyboard, focusing all your mental energy on whatever 
computing task lies before you, and you're going to decide: To hell with it. I 
wonder if anything good's on cable? 
</P>
<P>
 One evening recently, I was making up excuses for not practicing on the 
computer when my son finally got impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, Mom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carpe datum." Those Pesky Gender Differences  
</P>
<P>
 Computers were invented mostly by men, mostly with other men in mind. Want 
evidence? Read any history of computing or, alternatively, look where the ads 
for computers run in your daily newspaper. The Saturday sports section, that's 
where. Want more? What does 90% of the world's software consist of? Games. 
Games that combine the principles of target shooting and Dungeons & Dragons, 
two pastimes that have mesmerized perhaps four females in all of recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all of these thousands of computer games, only one -- Tetris -- is popular 
with women, including Hillary Rodham Clinton. According to a heart-rending 
story published recently in the Wall Street Journal, there is a 66-year-old 
grandmother in Indiana who is so Tetris-obsessed that she plays five hours a 
day, prompting her granddaughter to inquire about treatment centers! 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of the Journal story is that software designers are analyzing 
Tetris' distaff appeal in hopes of creating more games that attract women, 
thus, doubling the market! Great idea. But will the guys charged with solving 
the puzzle be able to stop playing Sim City long enough to do it? 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for the mature woman with a computer? It means she should 
find herself some of these nice young experts and let them ease her way onto 
the Infobahn. In fact, many of you have probably given birth to one already. If 
so, don't waste a nanosecond feeling guilty about asking for help. You've 
already prepaid through the year 2000 in laundry. Expect to be patronized a bit 
even as you are assisted. One of my son's friends recently gave me his 
electronic mail address and when he came to the @ that is a standard feature, 
he didn't call it an "at," as he would have with his cyberbuds, he called it 
"an 'a' with a lasso around it." Do I care? I do not. He is generous to a fault 
with his formidable expertise and, like my son, has already helped me skip the 
"Hooked on Phonics" phase of mastering my machine and get to the good parts. 
</P>
<P>
 You think it's wrong for a woman to allow men to do the electronic equivalent 
of opening the car door for her? I'll bet Gloria Steinem has a couple of male 
hackers in her Rolodex, and I'll tell you who else doesn't think it's cheating. 
Guys. Men who are just getting started on the Internet sometimes adopt 
female-sounding computer names in hopes of enlisting the aid of the male 
computing majority. These men in electronic drag know that another male's cry 
for help is routinely dismissed with the abrupt message, "RTM," computerese for 
"Read the Manual." The actual response is usually "RTFM," but remember, 
standards of behavior in cyberspace are closer to "Lord of the Flies" than to a 
church picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of women are excited by the information revolution, and they want to 
make sure that they get on the Information Superhighway too. Barbara Stites, 
who lives in Van Nuys, is frustrated because she doesn't yet have the money to 
upgrade her computer. Stites, 47, got her master's degree in history at Cal 
State Northridge a couple of years ago, and she is eager to tap into the many 
electronic archives that could advance her research on life in Mississippi in 
the early 1800s. But she needs a whole new system, including a modem, to do 
that. "I need to be able to get out there and communicate," she said. Stites 
worries that the Internet is creating an electronic elite and an electronic 
underclass, made up of people without the money or training or even time to 
take advantage of the opportunities being created by the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're connected," Stites observed, "you get the benefits. And if you're 
not, you don't." The Personal Computer: A Really Versatile Small Appliance  
</P>
<P>
 I bought my new computer because I thought it would make my life easier. It 
would allow me to work on stories at odd hours, late at night, for instance, 
without having to schlep into the office. 
</P>
<P>
 And I thought it would encourage me to do more of my own writing. This was an 
issue I had been brooding about lately with one of my dearest friends, a woman 
I met on our first day of sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 A college professor in upstate New York, Toni is an anthropologist, a mother 
of five and a superb writer in at least two languages (she also has a black 
belt in karate). But in recent years she has been increasingly troubled by the 
question of whether, as a writer, she has been a good steward to her talent. 
And so she came up with a plan that would help us both. We would start writing 
to each other regularly and see what our correspondence became. Maybe a book, 
maybe two books, maybe nothing at all beyond a stack of letters. Whatever we 
produced, we knew we would have a great time doing it. Because long before we 
had computers, we were teen-age best friends who spent hundreds of nights 
whispering happily to each other on such eternally fascinating subjects as 
books, men (boys, we called them then) and the meaning of life. Now Toni and I 
would whisper electronically, probably on the same topics. 
</P>
<P>
 So far we have got as far as exchanging e-mail addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Things I have actually done on the computer (besides routine writing): 
</P>
<P>
 1. Installed a personal-finance program. Like most people, I dream of a 
perfectly balanced checkbook, meticulously tracked investments, a balanced 
budget -- the economic equivalent of being born again. And with this software, 
I thought, peace of mind -- if not wealth -- would be mine. Of course, to 
achieve fiscal Nirvana I first had to input all the boring details of my 
financial life, including the particulars of every check I've written since the 
first of the year, into my computer. At which point, I realized that, for the 
time being at least, my laudable desire for financial order can be met quite 
adequately, thank you, by my check register and a pocket calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Played Tetris. Bor-ing. I just don't get the appeal. Should I get my 
estrogen levels checked? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Lurked on the Internet. You can do amazing things on the Internet -- tap 
into entire libraries, including the Vatican's, for instance -- but one of the 
most fun things you can do is to look at the messages people send each other on 
the system's 4,000 newsgroups. The technical term for reading these messages 
(which are public), without participating in the exchange, is lurking, and it 
is a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, you scroll through an electronic list of the myriad newsgroups 
in existence, and you choose the ones that pique your imagination. The best 
place to start is the stuff labeled with the prefix alt., for alternative. This 
is cyberspace's answer to the tabloids, except more so, since you can actually 
tap into the mind-set of people with every imaginable sexual fantasy as well as 
such decidedly minority enthusiasms as Chia pets, ketchup and (I am not making 
this up) Karl Malden's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious concerns are also shared among newsgroup participants -- a number are 
devoted to recovery and to specific disabilities and disorders. This week, for 
example, a man told alt.support.stuttering that he stutters and said he'd 
appreciate information about the genetic basis of the condition since his 
7-year-old son stutters too. But for every serious newsgroup, there are two 
that remind you just how zany, even demented, your fellow computer users truly 
are. You try not to peek when you encounter such provocative forums as 
alt.psychotic.roommates, alt.sexy.bald.captains or alt.conspiracy.abe-lincoln.  
</P>
<P>
 Which is how I found myself eavesdropping recently on a newsgroup devoted 
entirely to bashing Barney. Alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die is the place to 
go if you think the big purple guy may cause cavities (of tooth or brain) in 
his young fans. Messages about Barney -- a.k.a "the purple pervert" and "the 
spongy one" -- included the news that Barney had been named (for unstated 
reasons) in a $77.9-million lawsuit. A woman added to the group's growing body 
of "Insidious Barney Symbolism Theories," by reporting, "My 3-year-old daughter 
and I have come to the same conclusion: That Barney is a sick representation of 
a phallic object." That prompted another group member to respond: "Now that you 
mention it, I think I can see it. Gives all new meaning to 'I love you. You 
love me. . . .' " And, of course, there were the Barney song parodies, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 I hate you.  
</P>
<P>
 You hate me.  
</P>
<P>
 We're gonna go out and kill Barney.  
</P>
<P>
 And the shots rang out and Barney hit the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 No more purple dinosaur!  
</P>
<P>
 This is nothing more than good clean spleen. I have yet to encounter the 
really Dark Side of the Force. More and more Internet users are apparently 
playing rough, engaging in nasty electronic encounters known as flame wars. 
Wired magazine ran a recent story about the feud between a group of cat lovers 
and a group called alt.tasteless , who stopped swapping dead-baby jokes long 
enough to torment the feline enthusiasts with cruel postings, such as a request 
for a recipe for Polynesian cat. Turks and Armenians have apparently taken 
their ancient differences with them into cyberspace. But so far I've only seen 
the sunny side of the Infobahn. One of my favorite things about computers is 
how playful they are. Last time I went into Microsoft Word to edit a story, the 
program sent me the following tip of the day: "Did you know you can hurt 
yourself if you run with scissors?" 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a great technology, or what? A Final Word  
</P>
<P>
 Almond. My new computer is definitely almond.

COVER STORY; ROAD MAP TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET; DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR GAINING 
NETWORK ACCESS

<P>
 Say you're at the corner of Ventura and Winnetka in Woodland Hills. How do you 
get to the Internet from here? 
</P>
<P>
 First off, the Internet is not a place. It's a thing -- a worldwide network of 
more than 15,000 computer networks. It's also hot, hot, hot. Fifteen million 
people are already hooked up to the Internet, exchanging electronic mail (far 
superior to so-called "snail mail" if only because it's free), flirting, 
following the stock market, playing games, sharing their views electronically 
on everything from "Melrose Place" to bondage, doing research, telling the 
White House what they think and generally having a cyberhoot. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you get there from here? 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, there are two ways. For years now, Internet access has been one of 
the standard perks of being affiliated with a college or university. Virtually 
all college students, faculty and staff have Internet access at no cost to them 
through their campus computer systems. That's true at Cal State Northridge, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 For those without academic access, by far the cheapest way to get on the 
Internet from the Valley is to register with Los Angeles' first free 
public-access provider, or free-net. Offered through Encino-Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center, the L.A. Free-Net provides full Internet access, including 
e-mail, for an annual donation of $10 (the donation will be waived for those 
who can't afford to pay). According to the nonprofit Hope Unit Foundation, 
which is the medical center's partner in the project, the donations will pay 
for additional phone lines as usage of the free-net grows. For more 
information, call the foundation at (818) 954-0080. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in October, free or low-cost public access to the Internet will also 
be provided through many local libraries, thanks to a grant from the California 
State Library. Valley libraries that are expected to have computers set up and 
ready for public use include the L.A. Public Library branches in Canoga Park, 
Chatsworth, Encino-Tarzana, Granada Hills, North Hollywood, Northridge, 
Pacoima, Panorama City, Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Sun Valley, Sylmar, Van 
Nuys, the West Valley Regional and Woodland Hills. The Glendale Public Library 
and the Calabasas branch of the L.A. County Library have also signed up for the 
program. The branches will be able to give you more information in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 More expensive, but easy to use are the major commercial on-line services such 
as Prodigy and Compuserve. The big problem here is that, for now, only DELPHI 
offers access to all the resources of the Internet (most offer little more than 
e-mail). The good news is that you can sign up for a five-hour free trial of 
DELPHI (800-695-4005), and its fees begin at a relatively low $10 a month (for 
the first four hours nights and weekends). The bad news is that DELPHI doesn't 
have a graphical interface for its Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me explain that in English. The big obstacle to carefree Internet surfing 
is a historical one. The Internet was created by relatively sophisticated 
computer users, in the U.S. Defense Department and elsewhere, whose computers 
ran on an operating system known as UNIX. When using this system, they typed 
various combinations of letters and symbols into their computers to get them to 
do what they wanted. That was long before the invention of what is fast 
becoming the standard way to tell your computer what to do -- also known as the 
easy way: Take your mouse, point at an icon on the screen and click. You have 
to learn at least a few of the arcane UNIX commands to access the Internet the 
old-fashioned way. You will probably want to point and click your way around 
the Internet, for example, by using a software program called Mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major commercial users, the one that is gearing up fastest to serve 
the computer challenged is America Online (800-827-6364). When you sign up, 
America Online sends you software that allows you to do most of your business 
by pointing and clicking. (The software is also packed in with the June issue 
of Scientific America and other magazines.) American Online costs $9.95 a 
month, for the first five hours. And it has an Internet Center that offers an 
electronic guide called "Zen and the Art of the Internet" and services from the 
Infobahn's favorite magazine, Wired. America Online recently increased its 
Internet offerings. Subscribers can now tap into Usenet newsgroups (get a grip 
on yourself, Chia pet fans) as well as a menu system called gopher and a search 
feature called WAIS. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you can reach the Internet via one of the smaller commercial 
providers. Netcom (800-501-8649) is especially popular among local computer 
users because it has full access, local access numbers and its basic service is 
$17.50 a month (with credit card), no matter how many hours you use it. There 
is a one-time sign-up charge of $20. That's for something called Shell service 
that allows your computer to interact with another computer that is hooked into 
the Internet. Real buffs, seeking to hook their computers directly into the 
net, thus, becoming a node on the Internet, will want something called SLIP or 
PPP access. For that, Netcom charges $17.50 a month on a credit card, plus $50 
to sign up and $2 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Netcom is about to become infinitely more attractive to people who would 
rather fight than surrender their mouses. By the end of June or the beginning 
of July, subscribers will have the option of signing up for Internet access 
(the Shell kind) via Net Cruiser, Netcom's new point-and-click software. The 
company plans to charge $19.95 a month for as many as 25 hours of access. There 
will be a one-time charge of $25. "It's a very nice system, but it still has 
some bugs in it," warns a Netcom salesperson. Netcom will automatically update 
the software for subscribers as the bugs are discovered and worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can also get full Internet access via a new provider in Covina, called 
Lightside (1-818-858-9261). Lightside specializes in SLIP and PPP access and 
costs $29.95 a month for the first 30 hours of access, $2 an hour after that. 
There is no sign-up charge.

COVER STORY; ELECTRONIC RENDEZVOUS

<P>
 In the '50s there was the malt shop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s there is Baud Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to get together with your friends after school? Want to meet somebody 
new? There's no need to leave the privacy of your own home. Unlace your Doc 
Martens, sit down at your computer, sign on and start to chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baud Town is a social meeting place, geared to everybody," explains Linda 
Saenz, 41, SysOp, or system operator, of one of the Valley's most popular 
computer bulletin boards. (Van Nuys-based Dreamscape is another hot local 
bulletin board system, or BBS.) Baud Town has been around forever by 
cyberstandards -- it's 5 years old. And, according to Saenz, it has a 
constantly changing roster of about 1,500 subscribers who make 15,000 calls a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many bulletin boards, which are explicitly sexual, Baud Town is a 
PG-rated operation, open to anyone 14 and older. As such, it attracts vast 
numbers of teen-agers, especially teen-age boys, who spend hours expounding 
their views in any of more than 50 Baud Town open forums or chatting 
electronically on whatever topics strike their fancy. The two most popular 
forums, by far, says Saenz: Homo Sapiens vs. Homo Sapiens and Lies, Rumors and 
Innuendoes. But Baud Town is an understanding community, where two people can 
slip off in cyberspace and whisper a deux if they are so inclined as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked electronically why they hang out in Baud Town, subscribers cited 
everything from not having a car to the sense of personal safety that 
electronic communication provides. Overwhelmingly, though, they talked about 
that most basic of human needs -- having contact with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made friends who added so much to my life," said Sharon Harleigh of 
Westwood. "BBSers were here for me when I went through hard times in my life 
(my parents' divorce, cancer, etc.)" Many regulars (addicts, some called 
themselves) said how much they like meeting people personality-first, without 
having to think about looks or clothes. "No stupid getting-dressed-to-go-out 
junk like that," as Rebecca Him of Chatsworth put it. And then there are those 
who have got lucky in Baud Town. "I met the love of my life . . . by sheer 
serendipity," said 23-year-old Minsun Park of West Hills. "We sent e-mail for a 
month and finally just met for the hell of it and he turned out to be the most 
adorable, brilliant, sensitive man I've ever known. We've been together for 10 
months now and are madly in love, not bad for two blinking blips in the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers can talk as long as they want in Baud Town, reachable by modem at 
(818) 893-0340. No meter runs on their conversations. Instead the company sells 
different levels of access. To get on costs $13.50 for three months. That buys 
you the right to use the bulletin board as long as no one with more privileged 
access wants to use any of Baud Town's 32 phone lines. Should one of the 
electronic elite come along, you will probably be bounced off the system, 
especially in the evening and at other peak usage times. Subscribers pay $99 a 
year for the highest level of access. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz founded the North Hills-based business with her late husband, Frederick 
Gernand. Both had entrepreneurial backgrounds and saw the growth potential of 
an electronic bulletin board. They especially liked the idea of starting a 
local board, one that would link subscribers who were close enough 
geographically to get together in the flesh if they so chose. Crucial to 
getting the business off the ground, Saenz says, was coming up with a 
compelling metaphor, a term that would both describe it and help it to grow in 
the desired direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we wanted a town metaphor," she says, and, indeed, she regards Baud 
Town as a real community, albeit one with no buildings except the modest home 
office in which it is housed. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz points out, for instance, that Baud Town has its own Neighborhood Watch, 
whereby members keep an eye out for potential troublemakers. "Everybody watches 
everybody else," she says. Electronic bulletin boards have the potential for 
abuse, she explains, including people who misrepresent themselves or harass 
others. But Baud Town is a peaceful, congenial place, she says, "because I run 
the system on a no-nonsense basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz requires everyone who joins to send in a copy of their photo ID. "On a 
bulletin board barriers come down, but facades also go up," she says. "You can 
be anybody behind the barrier." But in Baud Town, "you're not going to say 
you're 32 if you're 16, or vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds of people gather in Baud Town. "We have the town eccentrics," she 
says, "and we have the town intellectuals." The population -- which changes as 
people graduate from high school, go away to college and alter their lifestyles 
in other ways -- includes an unusual number of "really smart kids," she says. 
Baud Town has more female members than most bulletin boards, but the board is 
still predominantly male, about 70%. "I need more women," says Saenz. "I need 
them to keep my guys happy." 
</P>
<P>
 A good SysOp is many things, in her view. "I'm a mom, a counselor, a 
psychologist, a sort of bartender and a peacemaker." Other roles include mayor 
and baby-sitter. Once in a while, she is called upon to act as a justice of the 
peace and to join two subscribers in electronic matrimony. "The marriages 
aren't binding, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to Baud Town are introduced to the etiquette that has quickly become 
standard in cyberspace. This includes the oddly prim practice of not writing 
messages in all capital letters. "It's the electronic equivalent of being rude 
or shouting," Saenz explains. Baud Town also prohibits subscribers from 
attacking each other, either directly or behind their electronic backs, a 
practice called "flaming" in much of cyberspace. "We call it bagging and 
ragging," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz says she really came to appreciate the special quality of Baud Town when 
her husband died of cancer in 1992. She was bereaved, frightened at the 
prospect of running the business by herself, afraid that she might somehow 
break the electronic entity they had put together. Comfort came over the 
computer. "When Fred died, who helped me through was Baud Town," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I don't think of it as a bulletin board service," Saenz says. "I 
think of it as a living entity. I would never give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Saenz has big plans. "I want to make Baud Town Baud World," 
she says, dreaming of augmenting the service to include Internet access and 
other town improvements.

DIFFERENT AND FRESH; LEHMAN-CARR PROJECT STRIVES FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF 
PERFORMANCE AND INTERACTION IN JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of times, bands are formed pretty much like interpersonal relationships: 
A couple of people bump into each other, feel they have some thing in common, 
and it kind of gets going from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Lehman-Carr Project, a quartet led by pianist Sydney Lehman and 
saxophonist Steve Carr that performs every Thursday at Duet. The musicians 
played together on a number of commercial jobs, liked each other's playing and 
decided to take it a step further by forming a jazz group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started playing seriously about six months ago," says Carr, who's in his 
40s and lives in Tarzana. "We've been together long enough that we're getting 
to the point of playing something that's a piece of music from beginning to 
end, that starts out, evolves and grows, rather than that is a piece with just 
a bunch of solos." 
</P>
<P>
 The Project provides the performers with a rigorous musical atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz forces you to think," Carr says. "If you want to do it well, you're 
constantly working on it, by, say, trying to improve your note choices or how 
you phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 The band -- which features Kirk Smith on bass and Jack LeCompte on drums -- 
plays a wealth of material, from originals crafted by the leaders to 
tried-and-true standards, like Duke Ellington's "Sophisticated Lady." The 
ever-present challenge is to reach higher levels of performance and 
interaction, and Lehman thinks the quartet succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a willingness to try something different and fresh," says 
Lehman, 35, who lives in Burbank. "There's the quest for adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman and Carr relish the process involved in composing. "I'm influenced by 
people like Bill Evans and Dave Grusin," says Lehman, who studied with veteran 
writer Hank Levy at Towson State University in Baltimore in 1979-80, then later 
studied film soundtrack writing at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "My music tends toward the melodic, which you might find in Grusin or even Bob 
James, but maybe not Ornette Coleman," she says. "It's very listenable," but 
she hopes, not repetitive. "I know when I write, I try to listen" to the 
direction the music dictates. . . . It will tell me the life path it needs to 
follow, then you rely on education and awareness to smooth out the rough 
edges." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, who holds a master's degree in composition and theory from UC-Riverside, 
is eclectic in his work. "I write jazz pieces with classical forms, I write 
Latin pieces, I write contemporary pieces," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist describes one work that can vary with the players. " 
'Sorcerer' depends on the drummer," he says. "I tell him it's either a jazz 
tango, or it has a Cajun feeling" a la Dr. John, the renowned New Orleans 
pianist. "The drummer usually comes up with something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band is a featured aspect of the jazz policy at Duet, where music is on 
tap Thursdays through Saturdays. "Sydney and Steve are great musicians with 
great style," says David Archuleta, restaurant manager at Duet.  
</P>
<P>
 Lehman, a native of Santa Monica, started on piano at age 7 and discovered 
jazz at 13. In 1980, she joined the Airmen of Note, the Air Force's top 
performance ensemble stationed in Washington, D.C. Back in Southern California 
since 1985, she has done everything from writing music for the 1993 ABC-TV 
mini-series "Wild Palms" to playing with Roger Neumann's Rather Large Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is sometimes financially terrifying, but musically and creatively, 
it's always been bliss," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr was born in Seattle but raised in Van Nuys. He first took up piano at age 
4, then added clarinet at 7 after seeing "The Benny Goodman Story." Currently 
focusing on composing for film and TV -- he's written for National Geographic 
specials and the Playboy Channel -- Carr says music "communicates what you 
can't say. . . . It's wonderful, and it gives you a reason for living." Where 
and When

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: THE SEARCH FOR SLACKS; LOUBELLA PANTS, WITH THEIR ELASTIC 
WAISTS AND VARIETY OF COLORS, ARE MADE TO LAST. AND AT S & Y APPAREL, THE 
PRICES ARE REASONABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There comes a time for most of us when the waistline begins to disappear, and 
it gets harder and harder to find slacks that fit. That's when the name 
Loubella pops to mind. Over the years, I have had several pairs of Loubella 
slacks because they come with an elastic waistband, are made in a variety of 
colors, do not wrinkle and seem to be made of iron. 
</P>
<P>
 One pair of black Loubella slacks has lasted me nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Loubella is a local manufacturer whose only outlet store, S & Y Apparel in 
North Hollywood, features prices that are 30% to 50% below retail. 
</P>
<P>
 The name is derived from Lou and Bella Levy, the founders who pioneered 
all-American, classic designs in women's sportswear at middle-of-the-road 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Their son Jeb now runs the company and four times a year he changes the 
colors: spring, summer, fall and winter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The slacks come in three styles: full elastic band with straight trousers; an 
elastic band in the back with a pleated front; and a side-pocket jeans style 
for those who have maintained small waists and hips. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabrics are a linen and polyester blend, a rayon and polyester blend and, 
my favorite, a 100% polyester gabardine -- one of the nicest I've seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Slacks are $27.95 (retail $42 to $48), blouses are $34 (retail $52 to $58) and 
jackets are $35 to $45 (retail $64 to $120). 
</P>
<P>
 In the store are this year's color choices for the spring and summer lines, 
including coral, citrus, sapphire, mauve, berry, turquoise, yellow, cream, 
peach, pale blue and the standard black, white and navy.  
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, you'll find long-sleeve blouses to match, so it's easy to put 
together a classic outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss your favorite jacket over your shoulders, and you're set for almost any 
Southern California event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's a shortage of jackets for summer, but when the fall merchandise 
arrives, you'll find tailored jackets in the season's colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hana Brige& Y's jewel of a manager, will determine your sizes within minutes, 
and from then on it's a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll remember your choice of styles and textures and your sizes, so later 
when you decide you must have an additional outfit or two in other colors,

3-HOUR TOUR: COLLECTION OF TIMELESS TREASURES; RENOWNED NORTON SIMON MUSEUM IN 
PASADENA INCLUDES PRIZED ITEMS FROM THE RENAISSANCE TO THE 20TH CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Norton Simon Museum is readily considered by art mavens to hold the finest 
art collection amassed in the second half of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Norton Simon Museum is certainly one of the great collections of our 
age," Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York, told The Times last June upon the death of the Pasadena museum's founder, 
Norton Simon, a businessman turned art collector. 
</P>
<P>
 John Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, has called Simon 
"the best collector of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 European art from the Renaissance through the 20th Century constitutes the 
majority of the collection's 12,000 works. Paintings by Raphael, Botticelli, 
Rubens and Rembrandt are among the 1,000 works consistently on view, as well as 
Manet, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Cezanne in the 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th-Century section has works by Picasso, Matisse and German 
Expressionists such as Kandinsky and Klee. 
</P>
<P>
 A gallery devoted to Asian sculpture from India and Southeast Asia includes 
some pieces that are more than 2,000 years old. In contrast, the work of modern 
and contemporary Western sculptors stands in the attractive outdoor sculpture 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum was founded in 1924 as the Pasadena Art Institute. The present 
building opened to the public in 1969 as the Pasadena Art Museum. In 1974, 
Norton Simon took over the museum's collection and opened the Norton Simon 
Museum in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon: Your tour begins outside the entrance, where you will be greeted by 
Rodin's sculpture "Burghers of Calais" (1884-1888). With its classical and 
modern aspects, it stands here as a monument to art history and as an usher to 
the range of art within the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter, pay for admission, and go to the right, to the north wing. Turn right 
again to encounter a long hallway displaying Giovanni Francesco Romanelli's 
"Dido and Aeneas Tapestry Cartoons." These large, elaborate images from the 
17th Century tell the story of the two lovers from Virgil's "Aeneid." 
</P>
<P>
 12:15 p.m.: Beyond Romanelli's work is the gallery of Italian and Flemish 
Renaissance art. Among the masterpieces is Lucas Cranach the Elder's 
oil-on-panel "Adam and Eve," circa 1530. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 p.m.: Pass by Romanelli's work again, on your away to the other side of 
the north wing. Stop to take in the incredible edibles in the large painting 
"Still Life with Fruit and Vegetables," by Flemish artist Frans Snyders 
(1579-1675).  
</P>
<P>
 On this side of the north wing, you'll see primarily 17th- and 18th-Century 
painting. Works vary, from the heroic, emotional portrait "Saint Ignatius of 
Loyola" (circa 1620-22) by Rubens to the light-hearted "The Happy Lovers" (or 
The Bird Cage) and "Music," both circa 1760-65 by Fragonard. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the Simon collection, the breathtaking "Still Life With Lemons, 
Oranges and a Rose" (1633), by Spanish artist Francisco de Zurbaran, is in this 
area. This painting is his only signed and dated still life -- he's best-known 
for his numerous paintings of saints. 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 p.m.: Step outside into the sculpture garden. Stroll among such works as 
Rodin's 1905 "Walking Man," and the 1950s sculptures of Henry Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: Return inside and walk back toward the entrance. Before entering the 
museum's central area, turn into a small gallery containing 20th-Century 
sculpture. The work of Moore (1898-1986), Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957), 
Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988), Jacques Lipchitz (1891-1973) and others are all 
abstract, conveying a sense of excitement and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceed through the central area to the museum's south wing, where you will be 
treated to an excellent selection of Realist, Impressionist, Post-Impressionist 
and Cubist paintings. Among the gems are Van Gogh's 1885 "Head of a Peasant 
Woman in a White Bonnet" and his 1888 "Portrait of the Artist's Mother"; 
Cezanne's "Tulips in a Vase" (circa 1890-92); Rousseau's 1910 "Exotic 
Landscape"; and Diego Rivera's 1941 "The Flower Vendor." 
</P>
<P>
 Cubism is adequately represented here with paintings by Liubov Popova, 
Picasso, Braque and Gris. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 p.m.: Beyond the Realist paintings of Corot, Courbet and others is the 
dimly lit, rather dramatic-looking gallery of ancient stone and bronze 
sculpture from India and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 p.m.: Make your way down the spiral staircase to the lower level to 
sample the museum's impressive collection of dancers by Degas (1834-1917), 
which appear in paintings, pastels, charcoal drawings and bronze sculptures. 
Nearby is a small but robust group of paintings, "Encountering the Dutch 
Likeness: Portraiture in 17th-Century Holland." It includes a self-portrait by 
Rembrandt. 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: Follow the strains of Indian music to the special exhibit, "A Tale of 
Three Muses: Music, Poetry and Art in India and Nepal." 
</P>
<P>
 On view through July 31, this show presents 44 small paintings known as 
ragamalas , from the Indian language for garlands of musical modes. This genre 
of painting originated in the early 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 2:15 p.m.: Return to the main aisle of the lower level to find another special 
exhibit, "Kandinsky." Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), a member of the German 
Expressionist "Blue Rider" group, was one of four members to be known here in 
Los Angeles as the "Blue Four." In 1924, Emmy (Galka) Scheyer had come to the 
United States to promote the work of Kandinsky and the three other artists: 
Klee, Alexei Jawlensky and Lyonel Feininger. More than 450 works of art and 800 
documents are now in the museum's Blue Four-Galka Scheyer Collection. It closes 
Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Move on to "The World of Picasso," a print show which presents some of his 
favorite subjects -- portraits, nudes, still lifes, artist and model scenes, 
tributes to Old Masters, animals and bullfights. Prints span the early 1900s to 
the late 1960s. Ends Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>

Bookshop. Where and When

CLUB SCENE; LOCALS CALL THE JUNGLE A HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nestled in a Granada Hills shopping center next to Ralphs grocery store is The 
Jungle, a neighborhood bar that features live rock and blues beginning at 8:30 
p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. Regulars say you can stop in, grab a beer, talk 
to friends, play a little pool, then conveniently walk home.  
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: On this Tuesday night, every seat at the bar is taken by 9:30, and 
college kids begin to fill the tables near the stage to hear Cactus Groove, a 
local band that plays on the last Tuesday of every month. Two pool tables see 
constant action all night, as does the foosball game next to the DJ booth. Two 
pinball machines sit by the entrance and the medium-size dance floor receives 
little attention from the college crowd, who are content to just sit with 
friends and simply bob their heads to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The regulars are strictly blue-collar, mostly construction workers 
and truck drivers in their late 20s and early 30s, who hit the bar to relax 
before heading home. Newcomers are spotted easily yet welcomed with friendly 
conversation. Anything goes for the dress code. The older regulars have that "I 
just got off work and I need a drink" look of tank tops with sunburned 
shoulders, T-shirts and jeans. The younger crowd has the casual, "I just came 
from a midterm" ensemble of jeans, big shirts and comfortable shoes. By 1:30 
a.m. the crowd starts to thin. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Live bands provide rock Tuesdays through Saturdays and blues on 
Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "Proximity," said Dina Manios of Northridge. "It's right in the 
neighborhood. The bartenders are friendly, the drinks are inexpensive, and I 
know if it's a Friday and there's nothing to do, I can come here alone and have 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "It needs a larger women's bathroom," says Nichele Schroeder of 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could stay open longer," adds Wayne Catting in town from Ontario, Canada. 
"And it could use more Canadian beer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jungle, 17044 Chatsworth St., Granada Hills, is open from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
Cover charge ranges from $2 to $3 depending on the band. Call (818) 832-4978.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SAVORY AND SURPRISING; DON'T BE DISTRACTED BY THE CONFUSED 
DECOR OF LA FONTANA. THE FOCUS IS ON AN ARRAY OF OUTSTANDING ITALIAN DISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life! 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Now, I'm going to sing," intoned the barrel-chested waiter, standing over the 
next table. And with that, he strutted out into the middle of the restaurant's 
terra-cotta tile floor and burst into a throaty, a cappella version of "Lonely 
Is the Heart Without Love." 
</P>
<P>
 We happen to be at La Fontana, where such events are commonplace and still met 
with hearty applause (as opposed to the incredulous stares this behavior would 
most likely elicit in one of our hipper spots). Despite a name that in Southern 
California is identified more with Spanish, La Fontana bills itself as an 
Italian kitchen. One would never guess from a cursory look at this place. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a huge, airy restaurant with a truly oddball decor. Under the black, 
exposed-duct industrial ceiling, the spacious dining room is dominated by an 
open, wrought-iron gazebo that encloses a spurting fountain. Casablanca-style 
twirling fans hang from above, and a ballroom-style swag curtain runs around 
the perimeter of the restaurant's panoramic, floor-to-ceiling glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The profusion of potted plants add to the Casablanca look. But that image is 
confounded by the pink marble dining tables, the type that would fit in 
swimmingly on a Roman terrace. Come at lunch, and a pianist rummages through a 
repertory of throwback tunes like "The Way We Were" and, yes, even the film 
classic "Casablanca's" "When Time Goes By." Come for dinner, when the place is 
less crowded, and the room feels like an outdoor courtyard restaurant in 
small-town Mexico. The entertainment, I can attest, will be anyone's best 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprises don't end there; the good food turns out to be the real surprise 
at La Fontana. A glance at the huge menu and the unfocused decor might lead you 
to suspect the kitchen may be equally confused. That doesn't happen to be the 
case. A basket of steaming, pizza-dough bread, cut into triangles and brushed 
with a delicious herb garlic topping, should put those fears to rest. I 
couldn't stop eating this bread, even though I knew it would interfere with my 
work. It's that good. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the pizzas don't have the crispness of the house bread, perhaps because 
the crust is too thick, and the toppings tend to soak in a bit. Five-cheese 
pizza is a ponderous version topped with a veritable sea of white cheeses; 
Romano, fontina, mozzarella, goat cheese and ricotta. BBQ chicken pizza fares 
somewhat better, with a saucy, racy topping spangled with chicken, cilantro, 
red onion and mozzarella cheese that is quite tasty. There just needs to be 
less of it. 
</P>
<P>
 La Fontana is one of the few Italian restaurants, though, that doesn't overdo 
it with pastas. In most local Italian restaurants, pastas are overcooked and 
almost always served with too much sauce, prompting Italian visitors to lament 
the state of pasta in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 These pastas are nicely al dente and plated with a perfect amount of sauce. I 
actually had to request extra sauce for the restaurant's best dish, spaghetti 
casalinga, because I couldn't quite taste the pureed olives listed as an 
ingredient. When it came back, I had a great plate of chewy noodles sauced with 
diced tomato, basil, garlic, red chili -- and yes, pureed olives -- with a 
light virgin olive oil drizzled on top. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, in truth, dozens of good things to choose from a menu of more than 
75 dishes. Linguini Bolognese, penne del fattore (with smoked bacon in a pink 
sauce) and farfalle (bow tie pasta) with fresh mozzarella are three more pastas 
to try, and that is just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers such as steamed clams come in a large bowl, drenched with white 
wine, lemon, butter and minced garlic. The minestrone soup is hearty, full of 
beans, Swiss chard and pasta. My favorite salad is called, aptly, Marco Pollo 
chicken salad, intelligently dressed with a well-balanced sesame vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollo al forno, the traditional roast chicken, is textbook here, crisp-skinned 
and golden. It's been brushed with herbs before serving, and comes with a swirl 
of angel hair pasta and assorted vegetables. Osso buco is hearty veal shank 
with its marrow cooked in a rich tomato sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 After all this, the server will appear with a tray of assorted cheesecakes, 
baba au rhum, chocolate-covered cakes cut into squares, tiramisu , and the 
house-baked blueberry tart. Grab the last, definitely the best dessert. Where 
and When 
</P>
<P>
 Location: La Fontana, 933 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested Dishes: steamed clams, $8.25; Marco Pollo chicken salad, $8.50; 
spaghetti casalinga, $8.50; pollo al forno, $8.50; osso buco, $12.95.

 WORLD MEMORIES: Whether it was a chance encounter with a U.S. soccer star or 
the time your child waited hours for an autograph, anyone with anecdotes about 
Orange County's World Cup experience is asked to write the Mission Viejo Soccer 
Foundation, which supported the U.S. team that trained there. (P.O. Box 
6080-163, Mission Viejo, CA 92690). . . . "We're putting together a scrapbook 
starting from day one," says spokeswoman Karen Irvine. "We want people to share 
their memories with us." 
</P>
<P>
 SMOOTHER WORLD: County soccer fans headed for the Rose Bowl when the U.S. team 
plays can take a rally bus sponsored by the Mission Viejo foundation. Round 
trip to the June 22, June 26 and July 3 contests will each cost $17 per person. 
. . . "You don't want to hassle the parking at the Rose Bowl," says the 
foundation's Bill Irvine. "This will be a lot more relaxing and fun." Buses 
leave three hours before game time from the parking lot of Fred Newhart 
Elementary School at 25001 Oso Viejo Road.

 A PENNEY PLUS: Cindy Grimsley of Garden Grove had taken her daughter Kayla to 
a JC Penney store to have her picture taken when she saw the ad for the 
modeling contest. She knew Kayla was cute, but how about this: Kayla -- she 
just turned 4 -- has already won a $1,000 college scholarship and a $25,000 
contract to model for Wilhelmina in New York. They're the biggies -- Kim 
Alexis, Jessica Lange, Kevin Costner modeled there. "Our whole family is 
ecstatic," says mom Cindy.

 IBM COMPATIBLE? Mary Ellen Pascucci was delighted when she persuaded Taco Bell 
Corp. to donate four classy IBM computers to her children's Fred Moiola School 
in Fountain Valley. She thought they'd go to students and teachers. But school 
district officials grabbed them up for themselves, saying they didn't fit with 
Moiola's "technology plan." . . . Pascucci, a computer consultant, says she's 
disheartened: "If I knew we would end up with this mess, I wouldn't have 
solicited the donation." The district is trying to work something out.

SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE AND HER FRIEND ARE BURIED; MOURNING: SEPARATE SERVICES ARE 
HELD. EX-FOOTBALL STAR ATTENDS NICOLE SIMPSON'S WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

 Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, slain side by side in a brutal 
attack that has grabbed the attention of the world, were buried in separate 
funerals Thursday, with O.J. Simpson, a suspect in the killings, attending the 
service for his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's children, 6-year-old Justin and 9-year-old Sydney, arrived and left 
by their father's side. When an attacker killed their mother outside their 
Brentwood home Sunday, the children were asleep inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westlake Village, mourners gathered to grieve for Goldman, 25, a waiter and 
friend of Nicole Simpson whose body was found a few feet from hers just after 
midnight Sunday. Goldman's sister, who wept as she eulogized him Thursday, 
spoke to his memory, saying: "I don't know if I ever told you how proud I am of 
the man you have become." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the funerals were under way, investigators continued probing the 
killings and interviewed a new witness, who said she saw a car that resembled 
one owned by Simpson parked across the street from the residence of his ex-wife 
Sunday about the time of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, a young woman who said she jogs in the area every night, said she 
could not be sure whether anyone was in the car when she jogged past, but her 
description of the vehicle generally matches the car that police seized from 
Simpson's home two days ago. The woman -- who met with a homicide detective in 
a church parking lot to avoid the crush of media following the case -- said she 
was familiar with the cars in the area and noticed this one because it was 
parked in an unusual location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a light-colored Ford Bronco or Blazer-type car," the woman, who asked 
not to be identified, said in an interview with The Times. She added that she 
did not see any activity outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not released the exact time of death, but sources have placed it 
roughly between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. The woman spotted the car between 9:45 p.m. 
and 10:10 p.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, officers seized a white Ford Bronco from Simpson's home. Police 
sources say blood samples were recovered from the upholstery in that vehicle. 
They are testing those samples to determine whether the blood might have come 
from either of the victims or from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Other blood samples taken from the scene of the crime match O.J. Simpson's 
blood type, sources close to the case have said. Such a match does not prove 
that Simpson was at the crime scene because many people share blood types. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are combing clothing, shoes and other items seized from 
Simpson's home to determine whether any of them contain bloodstains and to see 
whether the treads on any of his shoes match tracks found at the crime scene, 
sources said. In Chicago, police roamed a field near the hotel where Simpson 
briefly stayed Monday, trolling with metal detectors as they searched for a 
possible weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody expects this case is a slam-dunk and no homicide case is a 
slam-dunk," said Police Chief Willie L. Williams in an interview from 
Philadelphia, where he is testifying in a trial. "We would be beyond the 
greatest police department in the world if we could close a homicide case in 
four days." 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators continued their review of the physical evidence and their 
interviews with possible witnesses, families of the two victims gathered 
separately for funerals 20 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 close friends and family members made their way to Nicole Simpson's 
funeral at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church on Sunset Boulevard in Brentwood 
Thursday morning, under sunny skies and the buzz of media helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 A phalanx of reporters and camera people flanked narrow Saltair Avenue, on the 
western side of the church grounds, straining for a glimpse of a familiar face 
in a passing car or a stray quote from a mourner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-suited men and women in sleek, short-skirted black suits and high heels 
arrived looking solemn behind sunglasses. A line of luxury cars and trendy 
trucks snaked up to the iron gate entrance to the parking lot that bristled 
with private security. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of gatekeeper was performed by Al Cowlings, a former football player 
who played with Simpson at USC and for the Buffalo Bills. Cowlings waved 
through familiar cars, briefly questioned some arrivals, and greeted most 
guests with warm hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A white hearse carrying the light wood casket of Nicole Simpson, covered with 
a spray of white roses, arrived shortly after 11 a.m., followed by limousines 
ferrying family members. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson emerged from one and lingered briefly with other family members 
outside the side entrance. On both sides, he held the hands of his small 
children -- his daughter in a patchwork print dress and his son in pants and 
jacket and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Former football players, Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner and former baseball 
player Steve Garvey were among those attending the Mass, which was celebrated 
by the church's Msgr. Lawrence O'Leary. Simpson's lawyers also were in 
attendance. Reporters were kept out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," said Garvey after the service in the church, a mixture of 
traditional and contemporary. "Msgr. O'Leary gave probably the most poignant 
and moving homily I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latecomers to the service -- who were forced to wait outside the 
church -- was comedian Byron Allen, who said he last saw O.J. and Nicole 
Simpson together five or six weeks ago at the House of Blues. "They were happy, 
hanging out, having a good time," said Allen. "They sat down at my table for 
about 10 minutes, had a bite of my salad. . . . I figured they were working it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen peered at the parked hearse. "It's devastating," he said. "It's really 
hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hourlong service, family and friends paused outside the side 
entrance, surrounding O.J. Simpson, who was dressed in a black suit and wearing 
sunglasses. Guests embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, said later that Nicole Simpson's mother 
had expressed a wish to him at the service. "Mrs. Brown told me: 'Please take 
good care of him (Simpson). The children need their father.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At a tiny Westlake Village chapel, about 400 of Goldman's friends and 
relatives overflowed the pews. Some stood in the chapel's aisle while others 
huddled by the doorway and listened to loudspeakers placed outside. Kim 
Goldman, 22, wept as she said farewell to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in my worst nightmare did I imagine that I would be here in front of our 
family and friends saying how much I'll miss you," she said. "I admire 
everything about you. I don't know if I ever told you how proud I am of the man 
you have become." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Gary Johnson led the brief morning service, focusing on the need for 
faith in the face of such a violent and sudden tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all shaken by the injustice of the taking of Ron's life," Johnson 
said. "The world may impose upon us violence, but we must respond with a loving 
embrace." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson talked about the trauma of Goldman's death, and described two ways 
that people cope with the brevity of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some think that since life is so short, we should enjoy it as much as 
possible," he said. "But others say that since life is so short, we should 
dedicate it to a sacred and worthy goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, according to his friends, thrived on the excitement of Los Angeles 
nightlife, but also spent much of his time working with children. Two of his 
goals were to open a trendy Brentwood bar and to work as a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron lived life to its fullest," said Mike Pincus, a longtime friend. "He took 
everything life had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 After the chapel service, hundreds crossed the lawn at Pierce Bros. Valley 
Oaks Memorial Park to attend the burial. The crowd of friends, most in their 
20s, ignored the dozens of television cameras set up across the street as they 
huddled around the grave site. They stood silently as Goldman's stepbrother and 
close friends walked the casket from the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members and friends sobbed as the final prayers were read in Hebrew, 
and the casket was lowered into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't possibly give justice in a service to someone's whole life," said 
Frank Enderle, one of Goldman's friends. "It's just too hard to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 The burials were haunted by the possibility of exhumations, as Shapiro had 
said that he wanted a leading national pathologist to conduct his own autopsies 
to check the work of the Los Angeles County coroner. But Shapiro -- who 
Thursday identified that pathologist as Dr. Michael Baden of New York -- said 
he had at least temporarily dropped those plans out of deference to the 
victims' families and instead was asking for the cooperation of the county 
coroner's office in supplying his pathologist with information related to the 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the dramatic effect on the family, I have decided not to encroach 
upon the family with this subject during this period of grief," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, police are nearly ready to forward their investigation 
to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, but prosecutors and 
police are discussing whether to arrest Simpson and then file charges against 
him or to submit the evidence to a grand jury and seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Submitting the case to a grand jury might delay an arrest by several days, but 
it would eliminate the need for a preliminary hearing. Unlike grand jury 
sessions, preliminary hearings are held in public, a spectacle that sources say 
prosecutors are eager to avoid.

 HELP!: Computers, of course, can be pretty scary. First, how do they work? 
Second, how do you find your way onto the Internet and, finally, what the heck 
is the Internet anyway? Well, it's a network of more than 15,000 computer 
networks, and it's very hot. . . . In the Valley, there's Baud Town, where you 
make friends without ever leaving home. All this and more is explained in a 
special report in today's Valley Life! page 10.

 NEW STATION: Israel has made it to the Valley. On radio, that is. Blazer 
Communications in Studio City has begun operating a new station -- FM 100 -- 
that features the latest news and music from the Holy Land. . . . But to hear 
it, listeners must purchase a decoder box and pay a monthly fee. Owner Phil 
Blazer anticipates an eager audience because "the Jewish community is so 
culturally oriented and news-hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 ON EDGE: Tensions involving North Korea (A1) have heightened anxiety for 
members of the local Korean-American community. . . . According to Ho Ki, a 
Korea Times reporter who covers the Valley, some Koreans here are canceling 
trips to South Korea and advising relatives to be prepared for war.

 HAPPY CAMPERS: They're building more than classrooms at quake-damaged Cal 
State Northridge these days. Like self-esteem. That's the goal behind next 
week's ninth annual Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp. . . . For co-director Nick 
Breit, the thrill is seeing kids' faces "when they do something they've been 
told they never could do."

 LAST RITES: Ronald Lyle Goldman hasn't attracted as much media attention as 
Nicole Brown Simpson, O. J. Simpson's slain ex-wife. But memories of Goldman's 
friendly ways captured the hearts of about 400 mourners in Westlake Village 
(A1). . . . It was in character for the former Oak Park man to deliver 
prescription glasses left at the restaurant where he worked, his father said, 
and that act of kindness may have led him to his death. "The world may impose 
upon us violence," Rabbi Gary Johnson eulogized, "but we must respond with a 
loving embrace."

 LAST ROAR: They're Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, the only African team ever to 
make it to World Cup quarterfinals. And 4:30 Saturday afternoon will be the 
last chance to see them practice at Oxnard College. . . . It may be your only 
shot to see any World Cup team practice. The Indomitable Lions are the only 
World Cup team brave enough to open their practice to the public, officials 
believe. Security is tight, though. Expect metal detectors. And bring a photo 
ID. 
</P>
<P>
 POWER STROKE: Many girls competing in tennis tournaments lend themselves an 
extra hand to strengthen their backhand. It's become common practice among 
teen-age competitors, ever since Chris Evert made it popular. . . . But Monique 
Allegre, a powerful 16-year-old from Camarillo High School, has dropped the 
two-handed stroke so it won't slow her down (C12). And at this weekend's junior 
sectional championships, the 11th-seeded player in Southern California will try 
to break into the Top 10.

 JUNETEENTH: Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 
1863. But news traveled slow during the Civil War. And slaves in Texas weren't 
informed of their freedom until June 19, 1865, about 2 1/2 years later. For 
generations, African Americans in Texas have celebrated that moment of freedom. 
And "Juneteenth" celebrations have spread. On Saturday, the county's 
African-American Chamber of Commerce sponsors a daylong celebration at Oxnard 
Community Center Park.

GNATCATCHER GIVEN TEMPORARY HAVEN ON THREATENED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California gnatcatcher was placed temporarily back on the federal 
threatened species list Thursday by the same judge who ordered the bird removed 
from the list two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial ruling May 2, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin had 
ordered the gnatcatcher removed from the list, saying that the government had 
failed to make available to the public all the data it relied upon when it 
declared the gnatcatcher threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt had responded almost immediately 
by making the information public and petitioning the judge to, in effect, put a 
"stay" on his decision while federal authorities provide evidence to prove that 
the listing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decision reversing himself Thursday, Sporkin wrote that what "should 
have been done initially . . . is being done now," referring to Babbitt's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the judge's ruling, the federal government will have 100 days in 
which to accept and evaluate public comment on newly available scientific data 
before making a final decision on the gnatcatcher's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt called the decision "a clear victory for cooperative conservation 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that the court recognized our good-faith efforts to make all 
biological data available for public review," Babbitt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California, which, along with the Orange County Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, had filed the original challenge to the listing, said he was 
disappointed by Thursday's decision.

 The Greek Parliament voted Thursday to place former conservative prime 
minister Constantine Mitsotakis on trial for his alleged role in a major 
phone-tapping scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-seat body voted 163-6 to lift Mitsotakis' parliamentary immunity and 
ordered him to be tried on charges in connection with a scheme to wiretap 
dozens of political opponents and journalists from 1988 to 1991.

WEEKEND WORK THREAT MAY EASE SENATE LOGJAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress has two chambers, a House and a Senate, for "the convenience of 
visitors," Will Rogers once remarked. "If there is nothing funny happening in 
one, there is sure to be in the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the U.S. Capitol this week found that the Senate -- tied up for 
days as Democrats and Republicans squabbled over rival proposals for hearings 
on the Whitewater controversy -- was providing all the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 After five days of threats and counterthreats, the dispute finally appeared to 
be on the verge of unraveling Thursday in the face of what, for many senators, 
was the most serious threat of all: a rare weekend session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Break out the cots!" thundered Majority Whip Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) as the 
debate droned on. "If it takes all day Friday, all night Friday, all day 
Saturday . . , we will stay here until it (pending legislation) is finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that their efforts to investigate Whitewater were creating the 
appearance of gridlock, weary Republicans privately began debating whether to 
accept a watered-down Democratic proposal for limited hearings that they 
initially dismissed as a "Whitewater whitewash." But it was clear that the 
marathon confrontation would leave deep political scars. 
</P>
<P>
 During five days of dilatory debate over the timing and scope of the hearings 
next month, Democrats accused Republicans of trying to use Whitewater to 
embarrass President Clinton. Republicans accused Democrats of orchestrating a 
cover-up by confining the scope of the hearings to matters not directly related 
to Clinton's financial ties to the Whitewater Development Corp. and Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan, a failed Little Rock thrift, when he was governor of 
Arkansas in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate hardened into a fierce test of wills that stopped the Senate in its 
tracks after Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) forced the Democrats' 
Whitewater proposal through on a straight party-line vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Passed 56 to 43 last Tuesday, it authorized the Senate Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Committee to begin hearings no later than July 29 on three narrow 
areas already investigated by Whitewater special prosecutor Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
These include the suicide last summer of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent 
Foster, the handling of Foster's Whitewater-related papers and contacts between 
White House aides and Treasury Department officials investigating the 
Whitewater corporation's ties to Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were angry that the hearings would not look deeper into Whitewater 
and would remain solidly under the Democrats' control. Led by Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) they began offering amendment after amendment to an airport 
construction bill to expand the scope of the hearings. But each time they did 
so, an equally furious Mitchell countered with a nullifying amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers frayed, patience ran out and the embarrassment level on both sides 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The first crack came when House GOP leaders agreed late Wednesday to accept 
the Democratic formulation for Whitewater hearings on their side of the Capitol 
dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at a GOP caucus Thursday afternoon, minority senators agreed to offer a 
concession of their own: They would stop delaying other legislation if the 
Democrats would broaden the hearings to include all Whitewater-related 
developments since Clinton became President.

2 CONFESS TO KILLING ANTI-MOB LAWMAKER

 Two small-time drug dealers confessed Thursday to killing a French lawmaker 
who crusaded against organized crime and its ties to local politics on the 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were among about 30 people rounded up Wednesday in the latest sweep 
by police in Toulon, near Marseilles, since Yann Piat was killed Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's slaying threw a spotlight on links between the mob, politics and 
business on the Riviera, raising the specter of the sort of corruption that has 
long plagued Italy.

RESIDENTS PLEAD TO KEEP CITY'S POLICE FORCE; PORT HUENEME: SPEAKERS ASK COUNCIL 
TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO AVOID CONTRACTING WITH OXNARD OR SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One week after a property tax measure aimed at preserving the Port Hueneme 
Police Department failed to get a two-thirds majority of the vote, residents 
urged the City Council to do whatever is necessary to save the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 During a council meeting Wednesday, all 13 residents who spoke on the issue 
said the city needs its own department and should not contract with Oxnard 
police or the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tragic mistake having the Sheriff's Department here," said 
Valerie Valencia, a manager for a gas station on Ventura Road. "The Port 
Hueneme police are like a family. Their services are very quick and they are 
very caring." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the speakers at Wednesday's meeting said they would not support a 
possible tax to raise the $500,000 a year needed to keep the department intact. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, City Manager Richard Velthoen told the council that to 
keep the department the city must either adopt a utility tax or make cuts 
somewhere else.  
</P>
<P>
 A utility tax would be applied on services for water, electricity, gas and 
cable television. City officials have yet to decide the rate of a possible 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen strongly opposed cutting other city services or taking money from the 
city's General Fund to keep the department running. He told the council those 
options would cause more problems in the long run because the city is already 
struggling along on a tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the General Fund resources are used, your city will deteriorate," Velthoen 
told the council. "Over time, that would be like a cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's public hearing, the council postponed a decision on the 
issue until its July 6 meeting because Councilmen Ken Hess and Dorill Wright 
were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen said the city's staff cannot move ahead on drafting a utility tax 
proposal unless the council decides the city should pursue that option. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need their direction," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, which has a utility tax, charges its residents 5% on cable, 
telephone, electricity and gas services, bringing the city more than $5 million 
a year, said Ventura city official Kaye Mirabella. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June 7 election, 64.6% of Port Hueneme voters turned down a proposed 
tax to keep the department. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 10-year Port Hueneme resident Esther Feldman told the council 
that the city already has too many taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I oppose any additional taxes," Feldman said. "I am a senior citizen and live 
on a fixed income. I don't know how I would be able to pay more taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has four assessment districts, taxing residents for 
maintaining lighting, parkways and medians, Hueneme Beach and the city's public 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment districts cover 55% of the $1.4 million cost to the city of 
those public facilities. The balance is paid from the city's General Fund, said 
Tom Figg, director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the benefits the city would lose by contracting with the Sheriff's 
Department is having a local police station that is open 24 hours a day. 
</P>

 If the city contracts with the Sheriff's Department, the Port Hueneme police 
office would be closed after 5 p.m. and residents would have to go to Ventura.

BASIC CABLE FEES CUT IN OXNARD, PORT HUENEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Basic cable television rates for about 40,000 residents in Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme will be reduced by about $1 a month, announced the area's cable 
provider, Jones Intercable Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which company officials say is a response to recent changes in 
federal rules, comes days before Oxnard's Telecommunications Task Force is 
scheduled to present the city with a evaluation of Jones' services. 
</P>
<P>
 After an eight-month review, the task force criticized the performance of 
Jones Intercable last April, saying the company had broken its promise to 
create community programming and modernize technology to broadcast city events. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' 15-year franchise agreement to provide cable service to Oxnard is 
nearing its end, and the company will probably face stiff competition from 
other cable firms when it tries to renew the deal in 1997, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable provider could soon also face a new adversary: GTE Corp. The 
Stamford, Conn.-based company announced in May that it plans to build a 
fiber-optic network to provide 83,000 households in Ventura County with video 
programming through the telephone. Other county cable companies that would face 
competition from GTE -- their first competition ever -- include Comcast Cable 
and Ventura County Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones on Wednesday announced that its limited basic service of 25 channels, 
including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, has been reduced from $13.89 to $12.72 per 
month. The company's Tier I upgrade, which adds C-Span, The Weather Channel, 
VH-1, ESPN and other channels, has been reduced from $6.11 to $5.91. However, 
its Tier II upgrade, which adds CNN, MTV, the Discovery Channel and others, has 
been raised to $7.01 from $6.67. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Communications Commission officials revised some of the industry 
pricing regulations in the Cable Act of 1992 last February after the original 
attempt to cut cable rates backfired, leading to increases for millions of 
subscribers.  
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Joe Lopez, chairman of Oxnard's Telecommunications Task Force, said 
Jones' decision to reduce prices was driven by possible competition as much as 
the FCC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the FCC regulations were a factor, but it's surely a business 
decision as much as anything else," Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Naber, Jones' business manager, rejected that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the competition comes in, the rate structure will change," Naber said. 
"Right now, it is illegal for GTE to do that. We don't know what will happen if 
and when they enter the market."  
</P>
<P>
 GTE has yet to receive federal approval for the new service, which could start 
as early as next March. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, whose members include Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, City Clerk 
Daniel Martinez, and City Atty. Gary Gillig, will present City Manager Tom 
Frutchey with its report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and other task force members have criticized Jones Intercable for 
failing to hire a full-time employee to coordinate local community access 
programming, as was written in the contract; charging for video workshops when 
the original agreement says they are to be free; and failing to upgrade the 
cameras and video equipment in the City Council chambers since 1982, which 
according to Lopez subjects city resident to shoddy telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Naber said the company and the city interpret their 1982 agreement 
differently: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not necessarily a programmer, we're a conduit. That's not the cable 
company's role." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' prices are comparable with the rates of other local cable providers. 
Century Cable of Ventura charges $26.95 for what it calls its basic package of 
29 channels, which includes MTV, VH-1, C-Span and ESPN. Avenue Cable of Ventura 
charges $16 for its limited basic service, which includes TNT, KABC, and WTBS 
among its 21 channels. Officials from both companies said their rates were 
unaffected by the FCC revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable of Oxnard is a subsidiary of the Englewood, Colorado-based 
Jones International, Ltd. It is the seventh-largest cable television provider 
in the United States with more than 1.3 million customers.

BOY EXPECTED TO SURVIVE SHOTGUN BLAST; VENTURA: CHILD WAS SHOT BY ACCIDENT BY 
HIS STEPBROTHER. POLICE WILL DECIDE IF CRIMINAL CHARGES SHOULD BE BROUGHT 
AGAINST MOTHER AND STEPFATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 3-year-old Ventura boy is expected to survive a shotgun wound accidentally 
inflicted by his stepbrother, hospital officials said Thursday, as police 
continued a criminal investigation into the responsibility of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cook was wounded when 6-year-old Kevin Cook loaded a shotgun he found in 
the family's motel room Wednesday and fired it, police said. David was in 
critical condition Thursday at Ventura County Medical Center but is expected to 
recover, a nursing supervisor said.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 law makes it illegal to store firearms where they are accessible to 
children, said Detective Gary McCaskill of the Ventura Police Department. 
Police will decide in the next few days whether criminal charges should be 
brought against David's mother and stepfather under that statute, McCaskill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the injured boy's stepfather, Joe Richey, said Thursday the weapon didn't 
belong to him. Instead, he said, the gun belonged to Kelly Flowers, a man who 
Richey says he befriended a few weeks ago and invited to live with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to get rid of it four or five days ago," said a shaken Richey, 
speaking from a tiny kitchen in the family's shabby two-room residence at the 
Silver Sands Motel on Main Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richey, 31, was not home when David was shot and didn't learn of the accident 
until late Wednesday he said. When he found out, Richey said, he "went looking" 
for Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been unable to locate Flowers, but said the man is no longer welcome in 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Richey said he learned about a week ago that Flowers had brought the shotgun 
into the house and stashed it behind the television. The shotgun had three or 
four cartridges taped to the side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the guy they ought to charge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCaskill said the law allows charges to be brought against whomever has 
control of the firearm. Police have not yet determined a number of factors, 
including where the shotgun was stored and to whom it is registered. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is evidence showing that David's guardians kept the weapon where it 
could easily be obtained by children, police may recommend that the district 
attorney's office file charges, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first time such charges have been brought in Ventura, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tragedy because it could have been avoided," McCaskill said. "Guns 
need to be completely secured in a locked cabinet where children do not have 
access to keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the incident occurred about 5 p.m. Wednesday as the children's 
mother lay sleeping in the same room where they were playing. Keith found the 
shotgun and pulled the trigger, hitting David at close range in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Richey said Thursday she awoke to the blast and her children's screams. 
At first, she said, she thought Keith was the only one injured because his 
mouth was bleeding, cut by the gun's recoil. She was helping him to the kitchen 
when she realized that David lay crumpled and bleeding on a heap of clothing in 
the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 He was crying, but she couldn't hear him over the hysterical shouts of her 
four other children. Besides Keith and David, Sharon Richey is mother to 
Denenie Cook, 9; Shari Cook, 5; and Summer Richey, 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Richey is the father of Keith, Shari and Summer, said the couple, who 
recently married. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about what took place in the room were unclear on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Richey claims that Flowers and another family friend, Patty Fairweather, 
were supposed to be baby-sitting while Sharon Richey slept. Instead, both were 
inside an adjoining kitchen with the door closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fairweather said she was out shopping when the shooting occurred. And 
Flowers could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaskill said investigators have not yet determined whether the children were 
unattended at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, however, seemed healthy, well-fed and clothed, said a neighbor, 
who asked to remain anonymous. The boys often rode a noisy plastic golf cart 
around the asphalt parking lot and played with make-believe swords, the 
neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were regular kids," the neighbor said. "They were energetic, that's 
for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the couple's children were taken into protective custody following the 
shooting. David will also be placed into protective custody, once he is 
released from the hospital, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held Monday to determine whether the Richeys can reclaim 
their children, Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my kids back," he said, his eyes welling up. "I'm a good parent."

THOUSANDS WELCOME SUMMER VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Huddled together in a classroom stripped of decoration, the sixth-graders at 
Township School eyed the wall clock ticking off the seconds until summer 
vacation began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five. Four. Three. Two. One!" they shouted in unison before letting out 
whoops of delight and turning to hug each other before streaming off the Simi 
Valley elementary campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to miss this place," said 12-year-old Mary Abler, who was planning 
an end-of-school pizza party for her friends. "But it'll be nice to get out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of students across Ventura County, Thursday was a time for mixed 
emotions, tearful goodbys and very little class work. For youngsters in certain 
grades, the day held even more significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergartners, for instance, looked forward to using the bigger playground 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is so small," complained 6-year-old Jane Ann Hill, referring to 
Township's fenced-in yard for kindergartners. "The big one has monkey bars -- a 
really short one and a really long one." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-graders, meanwhile, realized they would soon hold seniority on campus. 
And sixth-graders spoke anxiously of starting junior high in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, all the eighth-graders are going to pick on us," fretted 
12-year-old Bryan Brown, a student at Park Oaks elementary in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 At elementary schools in Thousand Oaks and at all schools in Oak Park and Simi 
Valley, the final bell rang about noon. Classes end today in Moorpark and at 
intermediate and high schools in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 With textbooks already packed away and report cards written, campuses took on 
a carnival-like atmosphere. Students milled about signing yearbooks, munching 
sweets and playing outdoor games. 
</P>
<P>
 At Park Oaks School in Thousand Oaks, parents helped organize a field day with 
events such as a water balloon toss and three-legged races. Sixth-graders were 
treated to a fiesta in the cafeteria, which was festooned with sombreros, 
blankets and pinatas. And kindergartners walked to a nearby pizza parlor, where 
they rolled dough and decorated individual pies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything we can to send these kids off on a positive note," said Park 
Oaks Principal Rachelle Morga. 
</P>
<P>
 Corralling students for a relay game, teacher Sue Peelle said trying to 
maintain order on the final day of school was a near-impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already been hit with one water balloon," she said, laughing. "They've 
been waiting all year for this and this is their chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so excited. The rules are just out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Peelle said teachers would also be celebrating when the final bell rang. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, school officials said January's earthquake -- which caused 
damage at a number of campuses -- and a fatal stabbing on the campus of Valley 
View Junior High had made it a trying year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone's looking forward to going home and regrouping," said Lynn 
Friendman, principal of Big Springs School. "I think everybody's going to 
breathe a sigh of relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said they thought the earthquake had brought their classes 
closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 As tears streamed down her face, Township sixth-grader Sandra Silva gave a 
goodby hug to her teacher, Ingrid Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not just a teacher, she's a friend," Sandra said. "We'll all miss her." 
</P>
<P>
 For Berman, Thursday brought an end to her first teaching assignment. Four 
months ago she stepped in to take over the class following a string of 
substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got here, these kids had been through a lot," she said. "But it 
was neat and we learned together." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-graders spent part of the day debating the pros and cons of moving on to 
intermediate school. Better food, more teachers and lockers were considered 
pluses. But students also worried about harder homework, stricter rules and 
bullying eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait, said Lindsay Zane, a Park Oaks sixth-grader. "But I'm going to 
miss my teachers here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thursday marked the end of the spring semester, hundreds of students 
will take only a short break before resuming class. In Thousand Oaks, for 
instance, 450 elementary students have registered for summer school along with 
875 students in the seventh through 12th grades. In the Oak Park district, 
about 400 students plan to attend summer classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they looked forward to spending a long, languorous summer 
at neighborhood pools or on trips with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy we can go to Magic Mountain and do stuff, but we're sad we're not 
going to see people," said 12-year-old Melanie Jones from Park Oaks.

CLASSES END WITH BITTERSWEET GOODBYS; EDUCATION: MOST YOUNGSTERS LOOK FORWARD 
TO SUMMER, BUT LEAVING FRIENDS AND ANTICIPATING BUCKLING DOWN IN THE FALL MAKE 
FOR MIXED EMOTIONS.

 As the last day of school drew to a close Thursday, Adrian Smith cleared the 
worn textbooks from his desk at Ventura's Portola School, packed his notebooks 
in a satchel and folded his hands, waiting for that final bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to leave," the fifth-grader said gravely. "It wasn't so 
pleasant with all the work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other students around Ventura County shared Adrian's sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of classes Thursday marked the beginning of summer for most of the 
117,000 public school students in Ventura County. Except for those on 
year-round schedules, all county schools let out sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Portola School, most children bolted from their classrooms when the final 
bell rang at 11:30 a.m., in keeping with the busting-loose tradition of the 
last day of school. A few dawdled long enough to give a last hug to a teacher 
or say another goodby to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about as crazy as the first day," said Portola School kindergarten 
teacher Judi Branstetter. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some students and their parents, the end of the school year evokes 
mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rae Stevens, whose 6-year-old son, Tyler, was in Branstetter's class, fought 
back tears before the bell Thursday as she glanced around the classroom of 33 
squirming kindergartners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it's sad," Stevens said. "Maybe because they're getting older. It's such 
a sweet age. Maybe because he's my oldest and he's not a baby anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Such end-of-the-year melancholy is common among parents of kindergartners, 
Branstetter said. "They know it's a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the children also sensed that their completion of kindergarten 
marked a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students were divided over whether entering first grade -- becoming "a 
grader," as they called it -- was cause for joy or dread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not excited," 6-year-old Thomas Wissinger said, "because then I'll have 
to do really hard homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' classmate Taryn Liess is happy about moving up to first grade. Asked 
why, Taryn thought for a moment, tilted her head and rested her chin on her 
palm. Then she looked up and replied: "Because you get smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth- and sixth-grade students across the county, meanwhile, are leaving the 
secure confines of their elementary schools to enter middle school or junior 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 At Portola, fifth-graders said goodby not only to their teachers and their 
school, but to some of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Portola students go on to Anacapa Middle School, but some -- such as 
11-year-old Josh Olds -- are sent to Balboa Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to Anacapa and I'm going to Balboa," Josh said, referring to 
his fifth-grade friends, "I'm going to be all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Other fifth-grade students said their chief worry about going to middle school 
is being bullied by older children in the seventh and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom says it's going to be an adventure," said 10-year-old Heather 
Carpenter, who will enter the sixth grade at Anacapa in the fall. "But I still 
don't know. It's like going from being at the top of the school to being at the 
bottom again." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather said she has reason to be particularly concerned: At four feet, four 
inches tall, she was the shortest person in her fifth-grade class. "I already 
have to look up to most people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Portola students confessed to anxiety about leaving the 
classroom where they had grown comfortable, their teachers viewed the last day 
of school more philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a really terrific class," fifth-grade teacher Leslie Nichols 
said. Nevertheless, she said, "I see life as a process." 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the year "is the end of the process. It's time for them to go on. 
It's time for me to regenerate to be ready to start the process again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not sadness or relief," she said. "It's the end."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; INSURER HONORS BUS FIRM'S SAFETY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 1 million accident-free miles logged by drivers for Fillmore Area 
Transit have been rewarded by the company's insurance carrier at a small 
ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 The private bus company received a Gold Safety award from the New York-based 
Lancer Insurance Co. for avoiding fender-benders and more serious accidents for 
the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of the fact that we have a good safety record," said Jeri 
Morris, president of the eight-bus transit company. "It takes a lot of time and 
effort to keep our employees up to date on regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Phil White said his key to safe driving is to always pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be aware of what's around you and always be aware of what's ahead 
of you," said White, a retired driver for a parcel delivery company who has 
worked part time for Fillmore Area Transit for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tex Jennings, a FAT driver since 1987, said he has avoided accidents for 
almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to work here seven years ago, my DMV rap sheet had nothing to 
report," said Jennings, who logged hundreds of miles a week when he worked as a 
traveling salesman in his younger days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of near-misses, so I consider myself lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Area Transit operates eight buses five days a week along three 
different routes. More than 50,000 riders a year board the buses, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can take the central city commuter, which travels throughout 
Fillmore several times each day. Another bus shuttles people to Piru and back, 
and a third route travels to Santa Paula and Ventura. JEFF McDONALD

 Should the World Cup matches be postponed?We ask because we fear there's a 
scandal brewing. Paul Zwart of Pasadena has unearthed shocking evidence that 
Striker, the mascot for the World Cup matches, bears a striking resemblance to 
Auggie Doggie, the famous TV sidekick of Quick Draw McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments Zwart: "'Whatzit,' Atlanta's 1996 Olympic mascot, may be major league 
lame. But at least it's 100% original." 
</P>
<P>
 The low-scoring World Cup holds little interest for many Americans, according 
to recent polls. But perhaps their boredom will be relieved by a good mascot 
dispute, especially if it develops into what is becoming America's true 
national sport -- legal action.

 Sin City vs. Smog City: A while back, Las Vegas Sun columnist Don Digilio 
complained that too many Angelenos were moving to his city and suggested that 
the Vegas Chamber of Commerce halt the trend by saying bad things about life 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in L.A., always willing to help out, responded by listing several 
negative aspects of Vegas in a subsequent column. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Digilio do? Instead of thanking us, he comes back with an article 
in which he rips L.A., topping off his broadside with this comment: "Roseanne 
and Tom Arnold both live there." 
</P>
<P>
 Look here, Digilio. We can put up with comments about earthquakes and smog and 
crime. But linking L.A. with Roseanne and Tom Arnold -- now that is a cheap 
shot.

 Smile, happy talkers: Local TV anchors often attract negative comments -- 
perhaps even more than the city of Las Vegas -- so it's refreshing to see the 
news readers get some praise in Alex Abella's sardonic L.A. crime novel, "The 
Killing of the Saints." The kind words come during a courtroom arraignment 
scene: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen,' said (Judge) Chambers. "I'm only allowing one news 
crew in here, and that's these people from -- what channel are you from?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen, Your Honor, KCOP," said the reporter in a high-pitched voice.  
</P>
<P>
 "Good. I like Hal Fishman."  
</P>
<P>
 . . . The KCOP news crew sat in the jury box, pleased to watch their 
competition smashed, even if the judge had pegged them with the wrong anchor.  
</P>
<P>
 (Sure, Fishman's on Channel 5. But it's not like the judge accused him of 
being on Eyewitness News, or something.) miscelLAny:

 An exhibit in the Petersen Auto Museum on Wilshire Boulevard states that the

 Last Tuesday's election drew a record low in voter participation throughout 
the state. Less than 31% of Los Angeles County's registered voters showed up at 
the polls, according to the county registrar-recorder's office. Among the 
reasons cited for the poor turnout are public distaste for dirty campaigning, 
limited media coverage, uninspiring candidates and a general inability of 
electoral organizations to rile up the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to increase voter participation? 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Acebo, campaign manager for Supervisor-elect Zev Yaroslavsky: 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnout is always a question of interest and my belief is that it's a matter 
of finding every way possible to spark interest in the electoral process. We 
should make it as easy as possible for people to vote. There have been a number 
of ways suggested, beginning with implementing a strong voter registration 
effort that was finally passed in Congress. . . . We should explore 
(increasing) the number of days that people can go to the polls (for one 
election) and it's worth discussing every effort that's legal -- that would be 
absent of fraud -- to encourage people to go to the polls. On-site voter 
registration also may be one way of increasing voter registration." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatriz Valdez, county clerk: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just getting worse all the time. I don't know if there's anything this 
office can do. We send out announcements. It's just appalling. . . . It's 
definitely a problem when you get 70% of the people basically saying the other 
30% can decide for me. . . . We send a sample ballot to every single voter. We 
spend $13 million at every major election. We have to prepare for everyone 
going to the polls (which means) each voter's participation is already being 
paid for. . . . We have over 3.5 million registered voters. . . . If only 30% 
vote, then we have made an effort and paid for 70% that don't take advantage of 
that. Thirteen million dollars are spent on an election over and above what all 
the campaigns spend to go and try to get people to vote. There are so many 
issues; there are so many measures. I would think that everyone could pick one 
contest to make their voice heard at least on one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Rundle, vice president of Glendale/Burbank League of Women Voters: "One 
thing (the League of Women Voters has) supported was the motor voter deal 
(where people are automatically registered when they apply for driver's 
licenses). But that has not gotten implemented in California yet. We'd like to 
get that implemented.  
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing is that we feel pretty strongly that the materials that people 
get should be simple, complete and easy to read. Mostly it's a matter of people 
being informed and knowing how it is of concern that more people don't vote. . 
. . There's another program that's called Kids Voting: The idea is that parents 
and families work with young children and eventually go with them to the voting 
precincts."  
</P>
<P>
 Jon Spiro, history teacher at El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills: 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is nothing can be done to increase it. You would think that 
improved education would lead to a higher voting rate. But even educated people 
now feel that the country is so large and the government is so far removed from 
their everyday life that their one single vote will make absolutely no 
difference whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I feel that way, too, but I vote in every election because of some 
lingering guilty feeling that it's one's duty to represent oneself in a 
democracy, but I'm never under any illusion that my vote will ever do anything. 
I always say to myself, 'If you don't vote, you don't have the right to 
complain about the way things are.' "

<P>
 The Oxnard Elementary School District will officially name its newest school 
after Robert J. Frank, an instructor who taught in the district for 30 years, 
during a dedication ceremony Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank was recognized for his extensive after-hours work with students as a 
science teacher.Frank died in 1983, three years after his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He impressed us because of his dedication to the kids," said James J. Suter, 
chairman of the Oxnard school board. Suter, who worked with Frank for 30 years, 
said Frank drew praise not only for his efforts in the classroom but also for 
helping children with "a lot of after-school activities like forming a rocket 
club and coaching basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony, scheduled to begin at 2 p.m., will feature 
Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) and Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez as speakers. 
The Army will have a color guard ceremony, and students from Haydock 
Intermediate School will sing patriotic songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Robert J. Frank Intermediate School, 701 N. Juanita Ave., is designed 
to handle 1,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the first students to use the new school are those who attended 
Haydock, which is scheduled to close July 28 for renovations. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN NEARLY DROWNS AFTER JUMP OFF PIER 
</P>

<P>
 An impulsive act of derring-do almost turned to tragedy when a 25-year-old 
Ventura man jumped off the Ventura Pier and nearly drowned in the turbulent 
current, authorities said Thursday . 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Lusk, a Ventura resident and Oxnard oil field worker, jumped off the 
pier with a friend, Shon Smith, 27, about 10 p.m. Wednesday at the pier's 
midway point.The two men decided on a whim to leap off the wooden structure to 
see if they could make it back to the beach, Lusk said in an interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While Smith made it to shore, Lusk was caught in the tidal currents and had to 
cling to the pier's pilings for safety for about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was essentially caught," Lusk said Thursday. "Every time I would try to 
swim in, the tide kept pushing me back." 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Lusk reached a point of exhaustion, another man, identified by 
Ventura police as Charles Griddlestone, 19, spotted Lusk, and swam out from the 
beach to help the beleaguered swimmer back to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Griddlestone of Ventura could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lusk was taken to Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, where he was treated 
for hypothermia and abrasions and released. 
</P>
<P>
 A relieved Lusk said he was grateful for Griddlestone's assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in trouble. More than once I remember going under and then, out of 
nowhere, this guy saves me," Lusk said. "I'd really like to thank him." J.E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; INNS CRITICIZE PLAN TO RAISE BED TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to increase Ojai's bed tax to offset the rising cost of law 
enforcement has drawn criticism from hotel and motel owners who said they want 
to see a portion of the money spent on marketing Ojai to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a 9% increase in the cost of policing, city staff members have proposed 
increasing the current 8% transient-occupancy tax, or bed tax, to 10%, which 
would generate an estimated additional $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will take final action on the proposal at its June 28 budget 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chamber of Commerce and some local hotel and motel owners have said an 
increase would eliminate Ojai's competitive edge over other tourist towns like 
Santa Barbara and Carmel, which both have 10% bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to raise the cost of something when it's not selling," 
said Nadine Turner, who works for a firm that manages the Best Western Casa 
Ojai Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance a potential loss in clientele as a result of the tax increase, city 
staff and hotel owners have suggested that some of the money generated by the 
levy be spent on advertising the town to boost tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 But some City Council members told the audience of about a dozen local 
merchants and residents at Tuesday's meeting that tourists won't come to Ojai 
unless the small town's security and quality of life are preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to have the money to provide the services," said Councilwoman 
Nina Shelley. "If we don't provide the services, the tourists aren't going to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James Loebl agreed, adding that the best advertisement would be 
keeping a dump out of neighboring Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to be engaged in a lawsuit in the near future," Loebl said. "If we 
lose that lawsuit, there will be no such thing as marketing these hotels and 
this community." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD/PORT HUENEME; WATER DISTRICT LOWERS ITS 
PUMPING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Customers of the United Water Conservation District will pay $1 less per 
acre-foot in pumping charges beginning July 1, water district officials said 
this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The water district's board of directors voted to lower the pump charge from $4 
per acre-foot to $3 an acre-foot, said Frank Royer, assistant general manager 
of the United Water Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 An acre-foot is roughly the amount of water a family of four uses in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be able to do this at a time when all the other rates are going 
up," Royer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district two years ago raised the rate from $2.50 to $4 per acre-foot in 
anticipation of increased operating costs, including a state plan to divert 
money from special districts to fund public education, Royer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials pared the district's operating expenses and decided not to fill 
up to three vacant positions of the 40-employee agency, prompting the rate 
reduction, which will be in effect at least through June, 1995, Royer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is responsible for gathering runoff water in winter months and 
using it to refill underground aquifers in the Santa Clara River Valley and the 
Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 United has about 1,000 customers, including hundreds of farmers and the cities 
of Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Wong, the utilities director for the city of Oxnard, said the price cut 
was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly pleased to hear that," said Wong, who said Oxnard buys about 
6,000 acre-feet of water each year from the United Water Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're holding the (Oxnard water) rate status quo for the coming fiscal year, 
and to me, that translates to a rate reduction," he said. JEFF McDONALD

 A fire that ravaged one Ventura home and destroyed a motor home was brought 
under control before it could do significant damage to another residence, fire 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blaze at 60 James Drive is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 When engines were called to the scene at 8:57 p.m. Wednesday, a garage, motor 
home and two houses were on fire, a fire spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters put out the blaze at 64 James Drive, saving the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The home at 60 James had about $150,000 in property loss and $75,000 in damage 
to contents, including the motor home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only injury was to a man who jumped in to help put out the blaze. Derick 
Henderson received slight flash burns on his shoulder, but was treated at the 
scene by firefighters, authorities said. KAY SAILLANT

 A father and son were assaulted by a band of gang members outside a Ventura 
elementary school auditorium as youngsters inside were taking part in a 
graduation ceremony, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip G. Guinn, 40, and his 14-year-old son, Joseph, were attacked minutes 
after the elder Guinn stepped out of the auditorium to smoke a cigarette, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father suffered a minor stab wound to his arm and was struck several 
times. He was treated at Community Memorial Hospital and released, police said. 
His son was knocked to the ground and kicked several times, but received no 
treatment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday when Guinn noticed five youths 
standing next to his parked truck. He recognized them as members of a group 
that had confronted him verbally earlier in the week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group flashed gang signs and challenged Guinn to a fight. His 
son got involved in the confrontation when he walked outside to check on his 
father, authorities said.

 The suspects fled before police arrived and no arrests have been made. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; ASSESSMENT HIKE TO ASSIST ARCADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Needing to raise money for maintenance of Ojai's 77-year-old arcade, the Ojai 
City Council voted this week to increase its assessment on shop owners in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new budget, property owners will pay a rate of .2221 per assessment 
unit, which will generate $78,375 for cleaning and some repairs of the arcade. 
Units vary depending on size and location of an owner's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new assessment, which will become effective July 1, property owners 
will pay about 13% more to the city annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But some property owners who own stores not actually on the arcade objected to 
having to pay more for the upkeep of a structure that does not directly benefit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem is the arcade (property owners) are having trouble coming 
up with the money," said Barbara Bowman, who owns three shops across the street 
from the arcade. "There must be an equitable (decision)." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members contend that the historic structure benefits the 
entire downtown area, attracting tourists who do not limit their spending to 
stores just in the arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every picture, every brochure put out about this town shows the tower and the 
arcade," City Councilman Robert McKinney said. "I think it is naive to say that 
these businesses along Ojai Avenue and Matilija (Street) do not benefit from 
the arcade and should not fund it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent about $1.8 million in 1989 to retrofit the aging and crumbling 
arcade, a masonry structure that was built in 1917. At that time, the city 
outlined a five-year maintenance plan for the arcade that would address 
problems such as cracks and structural repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 City Public Works Director W. Stan Moore said the arcade received about $6,200 
in crack damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake in addition to long-term wear and 
tear. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; APPOINTMENT URGED FOR COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that a special election will cost cash-strapped Moorpark $15,000, 
Councilman Scott Montgomery has suggested that his colleagues declare their 
intentions to appoint someone to his post if he wins a seat on the County Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 November's election includes races for two City Council members' seats, and 
Montgomery suggested that the third-highest vote-getter in that race be 
appointed to his seat if he beats Judy Mikels for the 4th District 
supervisorial seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bernardo Perez, who along with Councilman John Wozniak is up for 
reelection in November, said Montgomery's suggestion is a bit premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a quick and easy way to fill the position, but it just seems a bit 
unsettling to me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think people would rather have a special election." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, who repeatedly prefaced his statements with "if I get elected," 
asked the council to consider his idea at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extraordinary expense," he said. "If the council were willing to 
declare their intentions beforehand, people would understand that the 
third-place finisher could get a seat." 
</P>
<P>
 No date was set, but the council agreed to consider the proposal later. SCOTT

 A proposal to build 216 houses and two golf courses on 655 acres in northwest 
Moorpark can undergo an environmental review, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-based Bollinger Development will submit its plan to build the luxury 
residences -- expected to cost $800,000 to $1.2 million each -- to an 
independent environmental consultant who will determine the project's impact on 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bollinger has offered one golf course for public use. In exchange, the city 
would pay for some road, sewer and street-light construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair if they expect us to defray some of that cost in exchange for a 
golf course," Councilman Bernardo Perez said. "Why should we be giving the 
development anything? It's their obligation to complete the infrastructure, not 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The developer has estimated that the golf course could earn the city as much 
as $1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said it was still too early in the process to make a final judgment on 
the development. He said he had other concerns that will probably be addressed 
in the environmental review, which is not due for several months, he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DEATH PENALTY WON'T BE SOUGHT IN KILLING

 Ventura County prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Timothy 
Chrestman, a 19-year-old Port Hueneme man charged with killing a Simi Valley 
man and his dog in the mountains above Ojai, the district attorney's office 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman is charged with shooting 24-year-old Andy Lee Anderson and his dog, 
Sheila, on March 4 to steal the victim's pickup truck, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley, who is prosecuting Chrestman, would not 
say why the death penalty is not being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said prosecutors are not minimizing Anderson's death by their decision. 
"I think . . . he's a cold-blooded killer," Frawley said of Chrestman. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said the decision not to seek the death penalty was made by Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury after an investigation into Chrestman's background. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's attorneys, Deputy Public Defenders Howard J. Asher and Steven P. 
Lipson, could not be reached. They met with prosecutors for hours before the 
penalty decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman gave police half a dozen accounts of the March slaying before 
finally saying that he accidentally shot Anderson as he was about to clean his 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Superior Court on 
Tuesday. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN IS ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING, CAR THEFT 
</P>

<P>
 Deputies have arrested a Moorpark man on suspicion of kidnaping another man at 
knifepoint and beating him with a baseball bat during a carjacking, Ventura 
County sheriff's deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Aguilar, 27, was arrested Thursday morning on suspicion of armed 
robbery, kidnaping, assault, car theft and drug intoxication after witnesses 
identified him as the suspect, Sgt. Keith Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, Aguilar walked up to Carlos Torres, 33, of 
Moorpark about 10:40 p.m. Wednesday, as Torres was getting into his car on 
Walnut Canyon Road in Moorpark and asked for a ride. When Torres refused, 
Aguilar pulled a knife, shoved it against Torres' side and demanded, "Get in 
the car. Take me to Simi," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres drove him to the Tapo Canyon Road exit of the Simi Valley Freeway, 
where Aguilar ordered him to stay in the car, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting another man there, Aguilar got back into the car and Torres 
followed his orders to drive back to Moorpark, the report said. When they 
stopped at the Virginia Colony housing tract, the two struggled inside the car 
and Aguilar told Torres that he would kill him, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aguilar took the keys and got out, Torres jumped out and ran for help, 
but Aguilar chased him and hit him in the back with a baseball bat, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Torres ran to a nearby house for help, Aguilar drove away in the car, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres suffered minor injuries. His car was found about half a block from the 
house where Aguilar had been staying, deputies said. The incident is still 
under investigation. MACK REED

RIG FLIPS, BACKS UP TRAFFIC AT RUSH HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A produce truck flipped over on the Moorpark Freeway early Thursday, forcing 
the closure of the northbound lanes for two hours and snarling rush-hour 
traffic on the nearby Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8:30 a.m. accident on a bridge over Paige Lane caused a chain-reaction 
crash involving three other vehicles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the accident caused a mile-long traffic pileup on the northbound side 
of the freeway, prompting some frustrated drivers to turn around by cutting 
across the unguarded median to the southbound lanes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic also backed up for more than a mile in each direction on the nearby 
Ventura Freeway, and was heavy on Erbes Road, which runs parallel to the 
Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation crews have been repaving on- and 
off-ramps of the Moorpark Freeway for the past month and were working at the 
Janss Road exit when the accident occurred just a few yards away, said Caltrans 
engineer Raul Amavisca. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside lane of the freeway was closed because of the construction work, 
forcing traffic to merge into the middle and inside lanes near the Paige Lane 
bridge, Amavisca said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the produce truck, Dan Flack, 42, was traveling about 45 to 50 
m.p.h. when he attempted to switch lanes, said CHP Officer Dustin B. Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Flack, however, misjudged the distance between his truck and the car in front 
of him and swerved at the last minute to avoid hitting the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck then rammed into a guard rail, careened across the freeway on two 
wheels, struck two cars and then turned over on its side, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cars hit by Flack's truck collided with a third car -- a stretch 
limousine -- but caused only minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the passengers in any of the vehicles required medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was very fortunate," Ferguson said. "This could have been avoided if 
there had been a lot more distance between (Flack's truck) and the cars in 
front of him." 
</P>
<P>
 A shaken Flack, standing nearby, said he had slammed on his brakes, "but they 
went all the way to the floor and I just kept rolling. . . . I took off toward 
the guard rail hoping to slow down, and I bounced back into traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was grateful no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed," he said. "My heart is sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Flack, who works for Berry Man Inc. in Santa Barbara, said that he was on his 
way from the Los Angeles produce market to Moorpark with a load of peaches, 
lettuce, bell peppers and other perishables when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said there have been no other major 
accidents along the Moorpark Freeway since Caltrans began working on the ramps 
on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland said he was also unaware of any other 
accidents during this period. 
</P>
<P>
 The $283,000 freeway repair project is expected to be completed by the end of 
this month.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: WRIGHT BREAKS WITH TRADITION IN GIVING DOUBLE ENDORSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 for whatever it's worth -- to only a single candidate in a race. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), who is herself running for 
lieutenant governor, clearly did not feel bound by such constraints in a recent 
Republican primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Wright endorsed Richard Sybert, a Calabasas resident and former 
senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, in the 24th Congressional District contest to 
nominate an opponent to Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). Sybert 
used Wright's support to help establish his initial bona fides.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rich came to me before he even formally announced," Wright recalled this 
week. "I thought he was well qualified." And, she said, it helped that he was 
willing to commit substantial personal funds to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two weeks before the June 7 primary, Wright received a call from Newbury 
Park businessman Sang Korman, who Wright had endorsed in the 1992 GOP contest 
in the same district. Korman, who filed to run months after Sybert, had done no 
active campaigning to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really admire him for the reason that he came to this country without a 
dime in his pocket," Wright said of Korman's immigrant tale. "He feels he was 
successful because of this country and he wanted to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though she felt that Korman "didn't have a chance," Wright agreed to 
endorse him as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Korman capitalized by sending a letter to voters during the last week of the 
campaign touting Wright's fulsome praise: "I am convinced Sang Korman will 
become a great congressman for the 24th Congressional District. I am delighted 
to endorse Sang Korman for Congress and urge you to vote him." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if some voters felt misled by Wright's unconventional multiple 
endorsement? 
</P>
<P>
 "They could," Wright acknowledged. "But you have to understand you have some 
loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who won the primary with 47% of the vote, said he learned of Wright's 
endorsement of Korman when he saw his opponent's mailing. Still, he sought to 
be philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a little odd," he said. "But that's her choice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 STEALTH CAMPAIGN: Korman, the Korean-American businessman and Newbury Park 
resident who has run for the Republican nomination for Congress four times 
since 1988, was traveling in Asia on business throughout much of the primary 
campaign. But he returned shortly before the election and decided to wage a 
last-minute, low-key campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Korman, who had previously spent more than $750,000 of his own money on his 
unsuccessful campaigns, sent out five pieces of mail to Republican voters in 
the 24th District. He did no fund-raising or door-to-door campaigning, made no 
public appearances and gave no interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 He won 5,981 votes, or 15.5%, and finished third in a five-person field. He 
won 13,884 votes, or 23.7%, and placed second among nine candidates after 
campaigning vigorously in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lavoie, Korman's friend and former campaign manager, decided shortly 
before the election to attempt to capitalize on his residual name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought he was going to have an impact," said Lavoie, who did the 
mailings. "I thought he'd do better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Korman left for Korea after the primary and could not be reached. Asked 
whether this would be Korman's final congressional bid, Lavoie replied, "I hope 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ENDORSEMENT ABSENCE: Vanquished primary candidates usually fall into line 
behind their party's nominee, putting aside the rhetorical slings and arrows of 
the prceding campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not so with the runner-up to Richard Sybert in the Republican contest 
in the highly competitive 24th District congressional race. Robert K. Hammer, a 
Newbury Park investment banker and first-time candidate, pointedly vowed to 
withhold his backing. He won 17% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer had questioned his opponent's commitment to the area that he seeks to 
represent because Sybert moved into the district last fall to run there. 
Sybert, who grew up in Southern California, in turn, cited Hammer's failure to 
vote in a number of elections. The two locked horns on other issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I will give the devil his due and the 15 minutes of fame he will 
demand, the man fresh from Sacramento will receive no endorsement from this 
camp; nor, given the way that campaign was run, can he legitimately expect 
one," Hammer said in a note to this reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Sybert did not see things quite the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's obviously just sour grapes," Sybert said. "I'm sorry he feels that 
way. That is not proper behavior and I hope, after he calms down, that he will 
come to the same conclusion." 
</P>
<P>

 ISRAEL OVERSIGHT: Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) says he was 
surprised last week when news accounts of his annual financial disclosure 
report failed to mention a trip to Israel that he took with his wife last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the House clerk's office had neglected to include an 
amendment McKeon made to his initial report correcting the inadvertent omission 
of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an oversight," said Janice Glossen, senior reports examiner in 
the clerk's office of records and registration. "The report should have been 
part of the public record." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon made the one-week, introductory trip to Israel, his first, as part of a 
14-member freshmen group that was sponsored by the American Israel Education 
Foundation, an arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

FAMILY LODGES CLAIM AGAINST COUNTY OVER MISPLACED BRAIN; VENTURA: THE PARENTS 
OF JAMIE BURTON ARE SEEKING $250,000. THEY CONTEND THE CORONER'S OFFICE WAS 
NEGLIGENT IN HANDLING THE ORGAN AFTER HER 1990 DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a Ventura girl who died four years ago has filed a $250,000 
claim against Ventura County, claiming the coroner's office misplaced the 
girl's brain for months after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the claim filed earlier this month, David and Jo Burton said the Ventura 
County coroner's office failed to forward 17-year-old Jamie Burton's brain to a 
medical laboratory at UCLA for testing until four months after she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not legally responsible for transporting the brain tissue to UCLA, 
the Burtons said, coroner's officials said they would ensure that the brain was 
safely delivered to the university laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie, who suffered from a mild form of retardation and intermittent seizures, 
died in August, 1990. The cause of death was listed as positional asphyxiation 
due to a seizure, the claim said. 
</P>
<P>
 After her death, the coroner's office agreed to send the brain to UCLA for a 
series of tests to determine if the girl died not from a seizure but from an 
illness stemming from an unrelated childhood immunization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several months passed with no word of the research," the Burtons wrote in 
their letter to the county.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were informed that the brain had been misplaced," the letter continues. 
"Eventually found, our family arranged for the transport (of the brain) and 
paid for said transport." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burtons, who declined to comment on the claim Thursday, said in their 
letter that Ventura County is liable "due to the negligent management of the 
initial transport of Jamie's brain to UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the claim is a copy of a letter written by then-Coroner F. Warren 
Lovell, who apologized to the Burtons for his office's apparent oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Risk Manager Robi G. Klein said the claim has not been reviewed 
by his staff and that he was not prepared Thursday to make a recommendation on 
whether the Board of Supervisors should approve or deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel James L. McBride said Thursday that he also has not seen the 
claim and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burtons said research subsequently performed on the brain tissue suggests 
that Jamie did in fact die as a result of the childhood immunization. 
</P>
<P>
 They later applied for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program, but a claim to that organization was denied last year, 
the Burtons wrote in the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 If the claim is denied by supervisors when it reaches their agenda, the 
Burtons could file a lawsuit seeking damages.

SIMI VALLEY BUS RIDERS MAY FACE FARE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley bus riders soon may be paying higher fares to ride fewer buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Simi Valley Transit is carrying more riders than ever in its 
22-year history, fare revenue has dropped as much as 5% on some routes, while 
costs have jumped nearly 6%. The increased cost of providing service has 
prompted city staff members to recommend fare hikes and service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to stop and ask ourselves how much we want to subsidize the buses," 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "Raising fares may be the only alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run Simi Valley's buses at their current level of service for 
another fiscal year is estimated at $1.6 million, $83,000 more than the cost 
for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents took nearly 400,000 trips on the city's four bus lines in fiscal 
1993-94, an increase of 22,000 riders over the previous year. Regular fares are 
75 cents, while the rate for senior citizens is 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But fare discounts and rising maintenance costs have increased the cost of 
providing service on Simi Valley Transit, the second-largest bus service in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 To earn its general fund subsidy, the bus system's fares must account for 20% 
of the cost of the service, according to a formula developed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special budget meeting Wednesday, Diane Jones, environmental services 
director, told the City Council that fares this fiscal year have covered only 
18.5% of the cost of bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city maintains the current level of service without increasing fares 
next fiscal year, the fare box revenue will cover less than 17% of the cost of 
service, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to hold a public hearing on the matter in mid-August. A 
date as not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going the have to take a really close look at some of the 
routes and figure out if there's anything we can do without," Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. "And we may have to bite the bullet and go to a higher rate." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the council rejected a plan to hike fares for the first time in 
five years, after residents protested that they could not afford to pay more to 
ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council lowered fares on mid-day buses, hoping to lure enough new 
riders to offset the decrease in fares. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., regular 
fares are 50 cents and the fare for seniors is 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-day ridership increased after the council's action, but not enough to make 
up for the lost fares and higher maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance fees are spent mostly on repairing the city's aging fleet of 
buses, some of which are 10 years old, Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is delaying the purchase of new buses until staff members complete a 
study of alternative fuel models to comply with federal air regulations and 
help cut down on smog in the city, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost of bus service, staff members are recommending that the 
city drop the reduced fares and cut early morning and Saturday service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Matthew Ayers considered the effects of a rate increase or a 
service cut as he waited at the bus stop Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents buy me a bus pass, so I'm not too worried about a fare increase," 
Matthew said. "But I take the bus to school every day, so I wouldn't want to 
see any service cut."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HOW NOT TO MAKE THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Academic counselors at Brea Olinda High School came up with a new grading 
system several years ago that was creative, to say the least. Students got the 
normal A, B, C, D or F; but for a favored group, a C or a D could be changed 
magically to a P, as in "Pass." Presto, a student's grade-point average went 
up. Shazam, colleges received a better picture of the applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they were not told of the practice. It turns out that counselors 
acted on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students got other help as well. Need a few more credits to meet the 
240-credit minimum for graduation? No problem. That three-credit English course 
became six credits, thanks to a friendly counselor, and the minimum was met. 
Grades were changed for about 55 seniors in a graduating class of 306; about 40 
received double credit in some classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials report that the counselors did draw the line at changing a failing 
grade to a pass. That's encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher said he and his colleagues were enraged when they learned of the 
practice, which appears to have been going on for four to 10 years. They should 
be. This is academic fraud and it demeans the educational process. Clearly, the 
Brea Olinda Unified School District failed to set fixed standards for all 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 High school academic counselors are supposed to offer guidance to students 
about course work and possible college careers. They are not supposed to decide 
grades, let alone improve them on their own or improve a student's chances of 
being accepted by a college. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent of the Brea Olinda district said that the actions were a 
violation of state law and that corrective steps now had been taken. He called 
the actions "a judgment error." We prefer the term outrageous . 
</P>
<P>
 Besides English and math, responsibility and honesty are appropriate lessons 
for high school students. It's unfair to those who work hard if others' grades 
are improved by fiat. Students deserve to be told where they stand. Giving 
false marks to a select few hurts all involved -- students, teachers and 
colleges.

BUSINESS RETENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading "Wilson Seeks Breaks for Taco Bell, Other Firms" (June 14), it 
became apparent to me that our so-called "state leaders" would rather protect 
white-collar paper- pushing management jobs (for an industry that hires mostly 
low-paid unskilled workers) rather than high-paid, skilled workers in the 
manufacturing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, I lost my good-paying machinist job. 
</P>
<P>
 My current job (part time, low pay) is with an outfit that services air 
pollution control equipment. Some of our business is dismantling and cleaning 
equipment owned by manufacturing companies that are leaving the state or the 
country. Tax credits should be allowed as an incentive for companies to 
purchase and maintain better pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes like "The company (Taco Bell) represents the sort of clean, 
profitable industry state leaders want to retain" is disturbing to me. 
</P>
<P>
 My income is now 80% less than it was three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With good-paying jobs scarce these days, I am no longer able to afford to eat 
at Taco Bell or any other restaurant as I could in the past.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: PUBLIC-SALARY DISCLOSURE WOULD PAY OFF IN THE END; 
GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE-SECTOR EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL IF THEY ARE BEING 
PAID FAIRLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP KNYPSTRA, Philip Knypstra of Anaheim is a business professor at El 
Camino College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pay, pensions and benefits are the major cost components of government. 
However, when you analyze and compare these cost components, as I have, you 
will find there is no rational basis for the huge disparity that exists in 
Orange County among the various government entities: cities, county, school 
districts, sanitation districts, water districts and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of doing government salary surveys, I have now reached this final 
conclusion: How much you make as a government employee has more to do with the 
political clout of your union than anything else. As for fairness and equity in 
pay, comparability with the private sector and availability of qualified 
applicants, forget it. These don't mean much anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, it is now becoming more difficult to figure out how much 
government employees really make. In the old days, it was easy to calculate and 
compare government pay, pensions and benefits. Not anymore! 
</P>
<P>
 Today, union contracts (usually called a Memorandum of Understanding or MOU) 
are hundreds of pages long and filled with a maze of provisions that are 
mind-boggling. For example, to calculate gross pay, you must carefully analyze 
and evaluate the entire MOU and consider: base pay, overtime pay, special 
assignment pay, educational incentive pay, upgrade pay, call-out pay, standby 
pay, sick leave pay, bilingual pay, shift-differential pay, longevity pay and 
other goodies often disguised in the MOU. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't understand something in the MOU, finding one person who really 
understands the entire MOU is next to impossible. Even the bureaucrats who are 
supposed to know don't know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, at least for taxpayers, all this excessive complexity increases 
the cost of government. Often additional full-time staff must be hired to 
assist with personnel and budgets matters related to the interpretation and 
management of the MOU itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Why management negotiators allowed this bureaucratic monster to grow to such 
an extreme over the years is beyond me. Then again, if you think about it, it 
does offer them job security, doesn't it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, base pay was a valid benchmark and a fair representation of what 
government employees were paid. But, believe me, that's not true anymore. 
Nonetheless, management and union negotiators continue to emphasize this 
overrated benchmark even though they know it significantly understates 
compensation for most government employees, particularly fire and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's time for the people to wake up and demand full disclosure on 
government salaries. Employees in the private sector have a right to compare 
their standard of living with that of government employees. Likewise, 
government employees have a right to compare their standard of living with that 
of other government employees. Making this comparison, however, is impossible 
to do at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we need full disclosure on government salaries. But don't count on 
the government bureaucrats to volunteer this information -- they won't. 
Undoubtedly, they will tell you it's too costly to do, but that is a lie. They 
already have the information; so make them disclose it. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to do this is to get your governing board or City Council to adopt a 
resolution requiring full disclosure of total compensation. I'm fighting for 
one in the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 I want the city to resolve that each year by March 31, the city manager shall 
make available to the public a list of full-time employees enumerating total 
compensation by department and job title for the preceding calendar year. No 
employee would be identified by name.  
</P>
<P>
 By now, I know what some of you are thinking. I'm just some radical who hates 
all government employees. Well, you're dead wrong. I am a government employee.

U.S. OPEN; WATSON? NICKLAUS? SURPRISE!; GOLF: NAMES FROM THE PAST TURN BACK THE 
CLOCK TO TOP THE LEADER BOARD AT OAKMONT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Golf. . . . It's not the game that Jack built, although he has been around so 
long it might seem that way. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sweltering Thursday at Oakmont Country Club, Jack Nicklaus set out, club 
in hand, searching for another bit of golf history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus is a four-time winner of the U.S. Open, which no one has won more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 Could there be a fifth? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, anything's possible at the U.S. Open, where in the first round, nine 
golfers beat par, 132 didn't, 18 were still on the course when play was 
suspended because of lightning in the area, and 54-year-old Jack Nicklaus shot 
69 and stood only one shot off the first-round lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, had it not been for the magic of another revived relic, 44-year-old 
Tom Watson, Nicklaus would have had the day just about to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson shot 68, putting himself a stroke ahead of Nicklaus, three-time 
champion Hale Irwin, Ernie Els of South Africa and Frank Nobilo of New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, Watson, Nicklaus and Irwin have eight U.S. Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Open is familiar ground for Watson, who has played it 22 other times. He 
won in 1982 at Pebble Beach and could have won in 1983 at Oakmont and again in 
1987 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, but finished second both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's round featured four birdies, a bogey at No. 8 when his three-iron 
shot sailed over the green into the back bunker, and three dramatic saves for 
par that made his day. 
</P>
<P>
 The most special was Watson's par on 12. His drive lodged against a sprinkler 
head in the fairway, 250 yards from the green. After taking a drop, he pushed 
his second shot into the right rough, knocked a sand wedge short of the green, 
then pitched a sand wedge to six feet and rolled in the putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
 When he had said Wednesday that 95% of the field didn't have a chance, Watson 
declined to identify in which percentage he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 He changed his mind Thursday, saying that he's in the 5% that can win it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nicklaus can do it, then Watson can do it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason why not," Watson added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicklaus' effort had surprise going for it. Who could have seen it coming? 
Certainly not Nicklaus, who was as stunned as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not surprised," Nicklaus said. "I suppose I am amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife told me this morning, 'You are 22! You are 22!' I said, 'I accept 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His 69 was a little hard to accept, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus, who won the Open in 1962, 1967, 1972 and 1980, hasn't finished 
higher than 33rd in the last seven Opens. He hasn't won a regular tour event 
since the 1986 Masters, hasn't made the cut in the six tournaments he has 
played on the regular tour and until Thursday had not shot a round under 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just played poorly," Nicklaus said. "It is hard to concentrate when 
you are hitting where I have been hitting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime I have been able to find my golf ball, I have been able to 
concentrate and I found my golf ball today." 
</P>
<P>
 At No. 18, Nicklaus found it at the bottom of the hole after rolling in a 
40-foot putt on a green with so many undulations they serve as speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery cheered as the ball disappeared at the end of its long journey and 
Nicklaus closed his eyes, raised his arms, then covered his head with his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining his strategy on the putt, he said, "All I was trying to do was 
figure out some way to get it close enough to make a second putt and the ball 
went in." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the only time the ball acted unpredictably. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, who is four shots back at 72, eagled the 315-yard 17th after he 
drove the green. Then on No. 18, he three-putted from 12 feet for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer, 64, playing in his last U.S. Open, shot 77, four strokes better 
than 28-year-old John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobilo, who has never played in the U.S. Open, eagled No. 10.  
</P>
<P>
 There were seven eagles, but for a lot of people, there were times when the 
ball just wouldn't go in. 
</P>
<P>
 Els rimmed an eight-footer at 18 that would have given him the lead, but the 
24-year-old South African wasn't too worried about what the missed putt meant. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is reconsidering his plan of avoiding pressure by downplaying his 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think things might change in the next three days," he said. "I might 
have to think that I am up there now." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange made a double bogey on 18, which dropped him to 70, two shots 
behind Watson and tied with Jumbo Ozaki, Kirk Triplett and Scott Verplank. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange had all kinds of trouble at 18. He hit his driver into the right rough 
and his second shot left, the ball rolling to the edge of a bunker. With a bad 
lie, Strange hit his third shot short, chipped to 10 feet and two-putted. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the kind of round that encouraged Strange, a two-time Open 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully I can sleep on that, instead of the last hole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson could sleep, secure in the knowledge that his game is better than it 
has been in some time. In 11 PGA Tour events, he has three top-10 finishes. 
More important, he is playing a course well suited to him, one on which he 
doesn't have to shoot 22 under par to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing well," he said. "There's no reason why I can't continue to 
play well. It's not a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he lost two major titles, the 1978 PGA and the 1983 U.S. Open, on the 
back nine at Oakmont, it wouldn't be surprising if Watson said he thought this 
place owed him one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't, not really," he said. "I think I've made too much out of it. I'm 
very happy I've played at Oakmont, played very well on a very difficult golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will be the time Watson wins at Oakmont."

 The High Desert Mavericks of the Class-A California League chart their success 
at home according to what food is served in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, the Mavericks had a 3-0 record when hot dogs were the 
fare. When the menu was varied, they lost five of the next six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Mavericks had a 2-0 home record with hamburgers on the menu. 
However, when hot dogs were combined with hamburgers, the Mavericks lost a game 
in extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Mavericks: Chicken sandwiches have been the big winner -- victories in 
five of six games in April.

 Trivia time: Who is the oldest player to win the U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Slop specialist: John Kruk of the Philadelphia Phillies, on his teammate, 
soft-throwing pitcher Doug Jones, who was acquired in a trade with Houston for 
Mitch Williams: "He throws slop. He throws that slop when he's behind in the 
count and he throws that slop when he's ahead in the count." 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders: From David Letterman: "New York is in the grips of championship 
fever. The Knicks are playing for the NBA title, the Rangers are playing for 
(and have won) the Stanley Cup, and the Mets are playing for . . . why are the 
Mets playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stay away: Tom Watson understands why a huge pit of sand between the third and 
fourth holes at Oakmont Country Club, site of the U.S. Open, is dubbed the 
Church Pews. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pray that you can get out of that thing," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church Pews, a 100- by 40-yard bunker, contain eight grass-covered finger 
mounds. Hitting into the Church Pews means a certain bogey and perhaps worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Come again?Doug Kelly of Sacramento heard Chicago broadcaster Harry Caray 
describing a collision on the basepaths involving Cub shortstop Rey Sanchez:  
</P>
<P>
 "Sanchez is hurt -- but he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasonable: Gil LeBreton, in the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram: "Celebrities used to 
go to boxing matches. Now they're Knicks' fans. This may or may not be 
coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardship case: Chris Webber of the Golden State Warriors, the NBA rookie of 
the year, has some lofty goals for the future, such as being mayor of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably have to wait until I'm in my 40s," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be or . . . : The middle name of John Paxson of the Chicago Bulls? MacBeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1954, Rocky Marciano scored a 15-round unanimous 
decision over Ezzard Charles to retain the world heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Hale Irwin was 45 when he won the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah 
Country Club near Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Charles Smith of the New York Knicks, on the Houston Rockets' 
Vernon Maxwell: "When Vernon gets all riled up, you see his eyes get all big, 
and that's the time to pressure him because you know he's going to do something 
crazy." MAL FLORENCE

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: NOT EXCITED ABOUT SOCCER? WHY NOT SAMPLE SOME GOLF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're not a soccer fan, there isn't much to get excited about in the 
sports world these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA finals are giving new meaning to the term ugly basketball. Baseball 
appears to be on the brink of a strike. Wimbledon begins Monday, but tennis has 
been dropping in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does one go for a silver lining? How about golf? 
</P>
<P>
 If anything ranks up there with playing golf at 7:30 a.m., it's watching golf 
at 7:30, which viewers were able to do Thursday and can do again today, thanks 
to ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN carries today's second round of the U.S. Open at Oakmont, Pa., with ABC 
showing the final two rounds. ABC's coverage begins at 10:30 a.m. Saturday and 
10 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This U.S. Open, the 29th for ABC, will be the network's last before NBC takes 
over next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the Open "was a big blow, a huge blow," said course reporter Bob 
Rosburg, who is the senior member of the ABC crew. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosburg and his colleagues aren't thinking about next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have the greatest job of all time," Rosburg said. "I get to go to the 
greatest courses in the world and watch the best players." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosburg, 65, in his 20th year with ABC, lives in La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco native helped Stanford win its first of three national golf 
championship in 1946, won the PGA Championship in 1959 and came close to 
winning the U.S. Open three times, finishing second twice and third once. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the 1972 Bob Hope Desert Classic by one stroke over Lanny Wadkins 11 
years after his previous victory -- in the 1961 Bing Crosby pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked who would win on the Oakmont Country Club's narrow fairways and fast 
greens, Rosburg said, "I'd rather pick horses than golfers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Musburger anchors the Open coverage. Commentators include Steve Melnyk, 
the winner of the 1969 U.S. Amateur at Oakmont, Jack Nicklaus, when available, 
and Peter Allis, the renowned voice of BBC golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Other on-course reporters besides Rosburg are Jerry Pate, Judy Rankin and Mark 
Rolfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McKay is busy this weekend serving as host of ABC's World Cup coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA, on the rise in recent years, is suddenly going the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 4 of the NBA finals Wednesday night got a 12.9 national Nielsen rating. A 
year ago, Game 4 got a 19.8. In 1992, Game 4 got a 16.0. 
</P>
<P>
 The average through the first four games is 12.2, compared to 17.1 last year 
and 14.2 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers seem to be sending a message to the NBA: Get rid of the thuggery. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals got a 5.2 rating on ESPN, the 
cable network's highest rating for a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's tennis' problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people are saying it's the money-grubbing players. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC tennis commentator Bud Collins was recently quoted in TV Guide as saying, 
"You almost have to hold a seance to get them to communicate," and he noted 
that even upbeat partner Dick Enberg calls tennis players "the worst athletes 
to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin, who will be a part of NBC's team at Wimbledon, said of the 
players, "They're more interested in getting the prize check than in doing 
extra things for the fans and sponsors who pay those checks." 
</P>
<P>
 HBO commentator Billie Jean King, during a conference call this week, talked 
about all the bad press tennis has been getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will serve as a wake-up call and in the end be good for the 
sport," she said. "I think the top players need to band together, be more 
accessible to the media and promote their sport." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give credit to XTRA's Rick Schwartz for making sort of a one-man stand at the 
all-sports radio station this week, refusing to take calls from people 
speculating on the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until he is charged, O.J. is nothing more than a superstar who has lost his 
ex-wife and the mother of his children," Schwartz said, telling his 
morning-show partners, Mike Berger and Jeff Prescott, that if they were going 
to treat it any differently they could do the show without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big news story, so we have to report the facts, but for us to deal in 
speculation is not right, and I'm sticking to that," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, Sacramento station KHTK (formerly KRAK), 
during a talk show with Michael Rainey and former Ram Jack Youngblood, offered 
a T-shirt as a prize for the listener who came up with the "best motive" for 
the murder of Simpson's former wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA seems to be easing up on its desire to replace Chris Roberts as the voice 
of the UCLA Bruins. As reported here last week, the station would like to find 
someone to do the nighttime talk show and also the play-by-play on UCLA 
football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 What the station is looking for is a wise-cracking talk-show host with a style 
that appeals to the 18-34 set and who is also a play-by-play announcer with a 
professional style that will appeal to UCLA officials and alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if such a person exists, he must also be willing to work inexpensively, 
since XTRA is notorious for meager salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a person is not found, Roberts probably will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds are with Roberts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What has become of Jim Healy? The daily inquiries are still coming in, but 
there's little to report. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy has been off the air since Capital Cities took control of KMPC and 
changed the station's format, and there is no word about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy has been spending a lot of time at his second home in Coeur d'Alene, 
Ida. TV-Radio Notes

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: READY OR NOT, HERE COME THE TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASCAR, which already conducts the most successful motor racing series in the 
world with Winston Cup stock cars, is preparing to launch a new series for 
full-size pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperTruck series, as NASCAR officials have labeled their new venture, has 
a West Coast off-road race leaning to it, much as stock car racing originally 
grew out of back roads of the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Southern California race truck builder-owners -- Dick Landfield of San 
Bernardino, Jim Venable of San Jacinto, Jim Smith of Buena Park and Frank 
(Scoop) Vessels of Bonsall -- first presented the idea to NASCAR officials, who 
responded with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill France Jr., president of NASCAR, said: "We feel that the time is right 
for a touring truck racing series. Trucks are extremely popular in America, and 
sales figures show that one truck is sold for every two cars. I think this is a 
natural." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck chassis and engines will be similar to those built for Winston Cup 
cars, but instead of passenger car bodies, the body styles will be of popular 
Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge trucks seen in off-road and stadium races. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans will get their first look at the series in four exhibition races this 
summer, starting on July 30 at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield. Another will 
be held on Sept. 10 at Saugus Speedway in conjunction with a NASCAR Featherlite 
Southwest Tour championship race. Others will be on Aug. 19 at Portland 
Speedway and on Sept. 24 at Tucson Raceway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR officials said that between 20 and 25 trucks were already under 
construction to compete in a full schedule in 1995. Among other tracks under 
consideration are Phoenix, Richmond, Va., and Martinsville, Va., all oval 
tracks used in stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Childress, owner of the Chevrolet driven by six-time Winston Cup 
champion Dale Earnhardt, is among those building a truck for the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the decision to sanction the pickup truck series is definitely a real 
step forward for motorsports," Childress said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfield, who owns automobile and truck dealerships in Southern California, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential could be on a par with anything in motorsports in a very short 
time," Landfield said. "As an automobile dealer, I know how popular trucks are. 
There is nothing more American than a V8 pickup truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Landfield drove a Ford pickup for 18 years in off-road racing before helping 
form the Ford Rough Riders team that competes in off-road racing. Dave Ashley, 
one of Landfield's desert drivers, is scheduled to drive in the SuperTruck 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Venable, who was instrumental in launching the career of Indy car driver Robby 
Gordon in desert trucks, has already named Rob MacCachren and Gary Collins as 
his drivers. MacCachren is driving in SCORE desert races and the Mickey 
Thompson stadium series; Collins is on the Winston West circuit, winning the 
season opener at Mesa Marin in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Vessels, who has been racing since he first competed in the 1971 Baja 1,000, 
plans to drive his own truck although he has never raced anything but off-road 
before. When he is not racing, Vessels operates San Luis Rey Downs, a 
3,000-acre land management project that includes a golf and tennis resort and a 
thoroughbred training center and breeding farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have zero experience on an oval," Vessels said, "but I'm going to get some 
help from Gary Collins, who is going to have the tough task of teaching me how 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he should put a cactus in Turn 1, a big rock in Turn 2 and a 
sandpit in Turn 3, just to make me feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Truck racing has been tried in the past, in the All-Pro series on the East 
Coast and on road courses by the Sports Car Club of America, but neither 
venture lasted. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCCA Racetruck Challenge ran from 1987 through '91 and featured Japanese 
manufacturers as well as American. Jeff Krosnoff of Flintridge, driving a 
Nissan, edged Bobby Archer's Jeep by .001 of a second -- five inches -- to win 
a 1988 race at Riverside International Raceway in one of the closest finishes 
in the track's history. Max Jones of Long Beach, in a Nissan, and Steve Saleen 
of Anaheim, in a Ford Ranger, were among the major series winners. 
</P>
<P>
 According to later SCCA media guides, the series was canceled because of "the 
generally poor economic climate of the early '90s (that) dropped the number of 
entrants." Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Mike Chase and Ron Hornaday Jr. will continue their NASCAR 
Winston West battle Saturday night in the Channellock Tools 250 at Mesa Marin 
Raceway in Bakersfield. Chase became the series' first two-time winner last 
week in Yakima, Wash., when he squeezed past Hornaday with three laps 
remaining. Two weeks earlier, at Saugus, Hornaday barely held off Chase to 
score his first series victory. . . . Street stocks will race tonight at 
Ventura Raceway. . . . Winston Racing Series sportsman cars will be featured 
Saturday night at Cajon Raceway. . . . Dwarf cars and street stocks share the 
billing Saturday at Kern County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- Rip Williams, Sprint Car Racing Assn. points leader, and Ron 
Shuman, former four-time California Racing Assn. champion, head the entries for 
an SCRA main event Saturday night at Santa Maria Speedway. Coincidentally, both 
favorites drive for women car owners, Williams for Jan Gaffney and Shuman for 
Ann Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- U.S. Auto Club full and three-quarter midgets will make their only 
Saugus Speedway appearance of the year Saturday night. Also on the program will 
be vintage cars of the Western Racing Assn. and a 30-lap NASCAR Grand American 
modified division main event. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Four American riders -- defending world champion Sam 
Ermolenko, Greg Hancock, Josh Larsen and Billy Hamill -- were among nine 
speedway racers who survived the Overseas Final last week at Coventry, England, 
to advance to the world championship semifinals on July 10. Larsen will ride 
his semi at Bradford, England. The other three will race in Prague, 
Czechoslovakia. Among the nonqualifiers were 1992 world champion Gary Havelock 
of England and Americans Mike Faria and Dukie Ermolenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Perris Speedway, which was operating Thursday nights, has canceled the 
remainder of its season for lack of spectators, according to track operator 
Brian Church. The Southland's other three tracks remain in operation -- Orange 
County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa on Friday nights, Speedway USA in Victorville 
on Saturday nights and Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 SPORTS CARS -- Nissan, which has already scored IMSA GTS wins in the Daytona 
24 Hour and Sebring 12 hour races, will tackle the 24 Hours of Le Mans this 
weekend with an all-Southern California team of Steve Millen, Johnny O'Connell 
and John Morton. Millen was Le Mans rookie of the year in 1990. The car, a 
300ZX Turbo, was prepared by Cunningham Racing of El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- In a move to pare the horsepower superiority of Roger Penske's 
Mercedes-Benz engine that dominated the Indy 500, the U.S. Auto Club lowered 
the allowable inches of boost, or manifold pressure, from 55 to 52 for next 
year's race. The stock block Menard and Buick engines will continue to be 
allowed 55 inches. Conventional racing engines, such as Ford Cosworth, Ilmor 
and Honda, receive only 45 inches of boost. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Mike F. Egan's Splinter Road exhibit of Harley-Davidson and 
American Indian board track motorcycle racing from the early 1900s will remain 
on display through June 26 at the Union Oil Museum in Santa Paula.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; EUSEBIO'S HOMERS TOO MUCH FOR GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Eusebio, not your usual power threat, hit two two-run home runs Thursday 
to help the Houston Astros defeat the San Francisco Giants, 6-3, at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Eusebio, who had hit only one major league home run and only 13 homers in a 
seven-year minor league career, connected off starter Mark Portugal (5-6) in 
the seventh inning and reliever Rod Beck in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Giants' ninth defeat in their last 10 games at Candlestick Park. 
They have lost seven of their last eight overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Caminiti added a solo homer, his 13th, which ties his production in each 
of the last three seasons. The Astros hit six homers and 14 doubles in winning 
three games in the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big series for us," Caminiti said. "Every day somebody different 
contributes. Today it was Tony." 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Kile (5-2) pitched seven strong innings, yielding six hits and two 
runs. He also doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been this kind of season for the Giants: 
</P>
<P>
 When Portugal doubled, he felt soreness in his groin rounding first and left 
the game after working seven innings and trailing, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt something pulling when I turned," Portugal said. "It was pretty 
tight by the time I got to second. We'll have to evaluate it Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 And this . 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Mike Jackson also sustained an injury. He worked a scoreless eighth 
inning but was put on the 15-day disabled list because of elbow tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just feels extremely sore," said Jackson, who has a 3-2 record and a 1.13 
earned-run average in 33 games. Right-hander Rich Monteleone will come off the 
disabled list and take Jackson's spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, St. Louis 5 -- Jeff King's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the 
10th inning drove home the go-ahead run and lifted the Pirates at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals tied a major league record with seven double plays, a feat last 
accomplished by Atlanta on June 27, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Pena (3-2), who gave up Gerald Perry's pinch-hit homer that tied the 
score in the ninth inning, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 11, Colorado 8 -- Charlie O'Brien's two-run homer broke an 8-8 tie 
during a five-run eighth inning that carried the Braves at Atlanta in a game in 
which they overcame 5-1 and 8-5 deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Pecota had three hits, including a homer, scored twice and drove in two 
runs as the Braves beat the Rockies for the 19th time in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory went to reliever Mike Stanton (2-1) who pitched the eighth inning. 
Greg McMichael pitched the ninth for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 7, Chicago 1 -- Andy Ashby pitched a five-hitter and gave up an 
unearned run at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby (3-5) has three complete-game victories and a no-decision in his last 
four starts after losing his first five decisions. He has lowered his ERA to 
2.67, fifth best in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Bip Roberts extended his hitting streak to 19 games, the longest in the league 
this season, with an RBI single in the seventh inning. Derek Bell had 
run-scoring singles in the sixth and eighth, and Ausmus capped a four-run 
eighth with a three-run homer, his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, New York 2 -- Rookie Kurt Miller yielded four hits in Miami in only 
his second major league start. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller (1-1) gave up a two-run homer by Joe Orsulak in the first inning and 
then sailed. He had retired 17 in a row when he hit Fernando Vina with two out 
in the ninth inning, then issued his only walk, to Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb Nen then struck out Jeff Kent to pick up his fourth save.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS TAKE IT TO LIMIT AGAIN AND BEAT RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has become a habit in Cleveland, winning at Jacobs Field. No deficit seems 
too large to the Indians right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game is special to us," Carlos Baerga said Thursday night after he 
scored the winning run on Albert Belle's two-run, two-out single in the ninth 
inning that beat the Boston Red Sox, 7-6, and stretched Cleveland's lead in the 
American League Central to 1 1/2 games over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Indians' 15th consecutive victory at Jacobs Field, the longest home 
winning streak in the majors since Boston won a record 24 in a row at Fenway 
Park in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, whose 20-7 home record is the best in the majors, have won eight 
games at Jacobs Field in their final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it Thursday by scoring three times against Jeff Russell (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down, we come back," Baerga said. "One day it's Jim Thome, one day it's 
Albert, one day it's Eddie Murray." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox lost their eighth consecutive game, despite two home runs from Tom 
Brunansky and one from Scott Cooper. Brunansky had been traded back to Boston 
from Milwaukee earlier in the day and was playing only because Mike Greenwell 
didn't get back from a union meeting in Chicago on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was a big letdown on my part," Russell said. "It's important for me 
to slam the door shut -- not just for me but for the team to have confidence in 
me. We're going through a pretty tough spot right now. We stuck it out through 
the last part of the game, and then I can't close it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians haven't lost at Jacobs Field since May 1 and have won six in a row 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Baltimore 1 -- Jimmy Key won his career-high ninth consecutive 
decision and Pat Kelly homered and drove in three runs for the Yankees at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs also homered for the Yankees, his ninth of the season. He has hit 
more than eight only once in a 14-year career, in 1987, when he hit 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (10-1) yielded one run and eight hits in 7 2/3 innings. Unbeaten since 
April 9, he has three of the Yankees' five victories in June and is 5-0 after 
New York losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Seattle 1 -- Wally Joyner celebrated his 32nd birthday with 
three hits and three RBIs in a victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Magnante relieved starter Tom Gordon and got the victory with three 
innings of four-hit relief. Jeff Montgomery got the final four outs for his 
10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's Quinn Mack, younger brother of Minnesota's Shane Mack, made his 
major league debut and led off the game with a double. He also singled and hit 
another double. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Detroit 4 -- Matt Mieske homered with one out in the ninth inning 
to give the Brewers the victory at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieske also homered in the seventh inning against starter Tim Belcher to tie 
the score, 4-4. With the count 1-and-2, he hit a fastball off Buddy Groom for 
the first multi-homer game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Felix hit his 10th homer, fifth in seven games. It was the 22nd 
consecutive game in which the Tigers have hit a homer, three short of the major 
league record set by the 1941 New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Texas 4 -- Ruben Sierra's run-scoring single with two out in the 
ninth inning gave the Athletics a victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out, Stan Javier and Brent Gates hit infield singles off John 
Dettmer, making his major league debut. Jay Howell relieved and gave up 
Sierra's grounder to right. Oakland added a run when Gates scored from third on 
a wild pitch.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SOLIS IS LEADER, AND WORKING TO REMAIN ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comfortably in front of Chris Antley and Gary Stevens and seemingly on his way 
to a second consecutive riding title at Hollywood Park, Alex Solis isn't ready 
to start taking it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of his game at 30, Solis will continue to practice on his mechanical 
horse at home and on the one in the jockeys' room. He'll also keep watching 
tapes of both himself and other riders and continue to be active in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Solis, who also is often seen jogging around the track before the 
races, isn't afraid of work, and his effort and dedication are certainly paying 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Thursday, he has 54 victories in the first 38 days of the meeting, 14 
more than Antley and 15 more than Stevens. He already has had two five-winner 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agent (Harry Hacek, whom Solis hired late last year) has done a tremendous 
job," Solis said Thursday. "All I have to worry about is riding races and 
improving myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really love riding horses. I enjoy it so much, I would do it for free and I 
mean that. Every day, I'm still trying to improve. Right now, everything has 
come together and I'm so grateful. It feels great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked very hard and I'm proud of myself. I kept trying and trying and 
pushed myself to the limit and more. I have to thank God and my wife (Sheila) 
and kids (Alex Jr., Andrew, Tiffany and Austin) for their support. I couldn't 
find a better woman than (Sheila). She's always been supportive through my ups 
and downs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been riding at major tracks for nine years, Solis still gives 
his VCR quite a workout as he tries to increase his knowledge of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to learn, this is the place," Solis said. "I'll watch things like 
Patrick (Valenzuela) and Martin (Pedroza) and how they get a horse out of the 
gate. Or I'll watch Eddie (Delahoussaye) to see how he relaxes a horse and gets 
it to come from behind. You can never learn too much. When I watch the tapes at 
home, my kids will ask me what I'm doing. I tell them, 'My homework.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm on the mechanical horse, I try to picture in my mind how I want to 
ride a certain horse or I'll remember a particular ride by another jockey and 
I'll try to picture what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, who went to jockey school in Panama City before going to Florida in 
1982, also is an admirer of Laffit Pincay and gives major credit to him and 
former jockey Fernando Toro for his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Fernando, and he told me he could help me in a lot of areas," 
Solis said. "He told me to relax a little bit on horses, that they're bred to 
run and to let them do their own thing. Laffit is so dedicated, and he's told 
me I was too uptight. He has so much experience and when he says anything, I 
understand what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Without question, tonight's $84,200 Harry Henson, named for Hollywood Park's 
longtime track announcer, is the most competitive stakes race of the Hollywood 
Park meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight 3-year-olds scheduled to run, five are coming into the 7 
1/2-furlong event off victories. And the field has combined for 24 victories in 
45 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Argolid, a one-time Triple Crown prospect who has been sidelined because of a 
foot injury, will make his first start since finishing third in the Louisiana 
Derby on March 19. Trained by Bob Baffert, the 3-year-old Saros gelding is the 
3-1 favorite and will be ridden by Pat Valenzuela. Argolid won by four lengths 
at Hollywood Park in his debut on Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual Style, the 7-2 second choice, is certainly the most accomplished 
entrant under the lights. He won his first start by 10 lengths on a Friday 
night last June 18, then came back on Nov. 26 to win the Hollywood Prevue 
Breeders' Cup by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by First Cabin Stables and now trained by Ron Penton, the 3-year-old 
Something Lucky colt finished third on June 1 in his first race in more than 
five months and should improve off the effort. He drew the outside post and 
will be ridden by Chris Antley as he goes for his seventh victory in 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field is composed of Little Lite Bud, who has five victories 
in 12 starts; Teasing Sea, who has won two in a row; Beautiful Crown; Honest 
Happiness, perfect in two races; Fu Man Slew, who has won three of four, and 
Pollock's Luck. Dream Trapp and Earth Colony were scratched Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vince DeGregory, who has been an agent for Bill Shoemaker, Angel Cordero, 
Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay, among others, will find mounts for Goncalino 
Almeida, replacing Chuck Marikian, who has decided to return to training. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, continuing to be bothered by sinusitis, was off his mounts 
again Thursday and won't ride tonight. "He was going to see Dr. (Peter) Gabor 
(on Thursday)," agent Terry Lipham said. "This is really frustrating because he 
worked horses Wednesday morning and he played golf on Tuesday with no problem. 
He was in good shape. Then, Wednesday before the races, he felt faint and his 
blood pressure dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis has been especially effective on Saturdays, winning 17 times on 47 
mounts.

BERGANIO WEATHERS 1ST ROUND; GOLF: SYLMAR RESIDENT SHOOTS 73 IN HEAT AND 
HUMIDITY AT THE U.S. OPEN, TRAILS LEADER TOM WATSON BY FIVE STROKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the morning weather was oppressively hot and humid, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 David Berganio Jr. of Sylmar was one of the first players to tee off Thursday 
in the opening round of the 94th U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, 
Pa. He should consider himself lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling record 95-degree temperatures and humidity to match, the field 
slogged its way around the tight 6,946-yard, par-71 layout.  
</P>
<P>
 Berganio teed off at 8:10 a.m. EDT, in the eighth of 53 threesomes, and shot a 
respectable 73. Today, however, he will tee off exactly 4 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it'll be much cooler in the afternoon," he deadpanned. "It was 
plenty hot when I played, don't let anybody fool you. It was hot all day." 
</P>
<P>
 His game was torrid, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio was even par for 15 holes before he hit a shot that failed to hold 
the rock-hard green at No. 16, resulting in a bogey.  
</P>
<P>
 He three-putted No. 18 for a bogey to finish two over par. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it really, really solid," he said. "I never missed a shot -- all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, 25, was an NCAA Division I All-American last year at Arizona. He 
turned professional late last summer and has played this season on the Asian 
and Nike tours. 
</P>
<P>
 He is five shots behind surprise leader Tom Watson, who fired a first-round 68 
to grab a one-shot lead over Jack Nicklaus and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio played the front nine at even-par 36 and sank a 10-footer on the 10th 
hole to save par while being featured during ESPN's live television coverage. 
However, he slipped to a two-over 37 on the back side. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, playing in his second U.S. Open and first as a pro, bested some 
prominent players, including Payne Stewart (74), Nick Price (76), Master's 
champion Jose-Maria Olazabal (76), former Open champions Larry Nelson (75) and 
Andy North (78), as well as John Daly (81) and Johnny Miller (81). 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Faldo, Tom Kite, Fulton Allem, John Cook and Chip Beck were included in a 
logjam of 14 players tied with Berganio when play was suspended because of 
lightning storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio also finished atop the leader board among area players. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy Waldorf of Valencia, a former Taft High and UCLA standout, shot 74. Two 
more former UCLA players with ties to the region failed to make a move on the 
leaders. Steve Pate, who lives in Agoura Hills, also shot 74 while Corey Pavin, 
an Oxnard native, struggled to a 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, brash and confident as ever, isn't exactly in awe of the competition 
and isn't going to lose sleep about what score it will take to make the 36-hole 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, he felt he shortchanged himself by not finishing strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not even worrying about (the cut)," he said. "I'm gonna shoot some low 
numbers and pass some more guys (today)."

TRACK AND FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; AS SEASON RACED ALONG, PALMDALE'S ARCE RAN 
FASTER AND FASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Arce's streak of personal bests came to a close in the Golden West 
Invitational, but that did little to tarnish a superb season for the Palmdale 
High junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he finished a disappointing seventh in the 3,200 meters in the Golden 
West meet in Sacramento on Saturday, few athletes peaked as perfectly for the 
state championships as Arce, and none of the state's top runners slashed more 
time off their personal bests over the last month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce entered the Southern Section Division I championships on May 21 with a 
personal best of 9 minutes 25.68 seconds in the 3,200 meters, but ran 9:13.30 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed that with a second-place time of 9:09.21 in the Southern Section 
Masters Meet and placed second in the state championships in 9:03.19. 
</P>
<P>
 His hot streak came to a screeching halt, however, when he ran 9:27.59 in the 
Golden West meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat -- it was 95 degrees in Sacramento -- hampered everyone's performance, 
but Arce did not use that as an excuse. As he put it, "I peaked at state and 
that was it. There was nothing else left in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, a native of Mexico City, attributes his fast finish to two factors that 
made him intensify his training regimen earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he felt insulted when he was overlooked for the more prestigious night 
portion of the Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia High in April. He had yet to run 
under 9:40 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, although he won the daytime portion of the meet in a then-personal 
best of 9:25.68, 15 runners posted faster times in the night portion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't real panicky, but I was a little concerned about where I was at," 
Arce admitted. "There were several guys in (the night meet) who ran times that 
were way out of my reach at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce intensified his training sessions and began to reap the rewards when he 
ran a "comfortable" 9:26.08 in his heat of the Southern Section Division I 
preliminaries in May. His string of personal bests followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the season, I just wanted to make it to state," Arce 
said. "But after the Southern Section championships, I wanted to finish in the 
top 10. . . . After (the Masters Meet) I was shooting for the top five."

<P>
 Trivia question: What local junior college coach placed third in the boys' 
440-yard dash in the 1962 state high school championships? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High flyer: When Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High cleared 7 feet 2 inches to 
win the high jump in the Golden West Invitational, it was the 20th meet of his 
career in which he has jumped 7 feet or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin-bound Fischer cleared 7 feet or higher in 11 meets as a junior 
and nine this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer has cleared 7-2 or higher in six meets this year, the most since 1984, 
when Dothel Edwards of Cedar Shoals, Ga., cleared 7-2 or higher 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add high jump: Fischer's victory in the Golden West Invitational made him the 
fourth high jumper from the region to accomplish that feat since the meet's 
inception in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Randy Walker of Cleveland, who cleared 6-4 1/2 in 1961, Dwight 
Stones of Glendale (6-8 in '71) and Jeff Nadeau of Monroe (6-10 in '93). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Faulty seeding: Jason Medearis of Hart ranked third on the yearly national 
high school list in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles before the Golden West 
Invitational, but organizers erred when he was assigned lane two. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis had run a personal best of 36.80 seconds to place second in the 
Masters Meet on May 27. However, Golden West officials listed his best as 37.42 
-- his time in the Arcadia Invitational -- which meant he was seeded sixth in 
the nine-runner field instead of second. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in the inner lanes of the track is considered a disadvantage for 
sprinters and hurdlers because of the tighter turns. Hart Coach Larry David 
said that contributed to Medearis' sixth-place finish in 38.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't make up ground in the final straightaway like he usually does," 
David said. "I think he saw all those guys ahead of him coming off the turn and 
felt a little discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graduation trip: The Golden West Invitational was the final competition of 
Dolores Tuimoloau's high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau -- who won the shotput with a mark of 47-1 1/4 -- and two of her 
cousins will leave on a three-week Hawaiian vacation today. Tuimoloau will skip 
the USA Track & Field Junior championships at Florida State on June 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau boosted the region record to 49-2 in the shotput this year and 
became Channel Islands' first state champion. She moved to fourth on the 
all-time region list in the discus with a Ventura County record of 145-0. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Looking forward: A lot can happen between now and September, but the Thousand 
Oaks High boys' cross-country team might be stronger this fall than in 1993. 
Last fall, the Lancers were undefeated, ranked third in the nation and romped 
to victories in the State and Southern Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Del Campo and Chadd Aldrich, who finished fourth and 14th in the state 
championships, graduated Thursday, but Jeff Fischer (third), Kevin Marsden 
(fifth), Keith O'Doherty (18th), Todd Disney (30th) and Josh Carolan (58th) are 
expected to return. 
</P>
<P>
 All had track seasons in which they lowered their personal bests by 
substantial margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer ran 4:16.69 in the 1,600 and 9:10.42 in the 3,200, 16 and 20 seconds 
seconds faster than his bests in those events at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden timed 1:57.15 in the 800 and 4:17.67 in the 1,600. His pre-1994 bests 
were 1:59.68 and 4:22.53. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty ran 9:30.25 in the 3,200 with Disney at 9:37.42 and Carolan at 
10:10.37. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Tom McMurray, the men's coach at Glendale College, ran 48.3 
seconds as a senior at Verdugo Hills High to finish third behind Manuel Diaz 
(48.1) of Keppel and Joe Johnson (48.2) of Oakland McClymonds in the 1962 state 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Smith, a promising junior from Lemoore, finished fourth in 48.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, track coach at Santa Monica College, ran a then world record of 19.83 
in the 200 meters at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

U.S. OPEN NOTES; TWENTY-ONE YEARS LATER, OAKMONT GETS REVENGE

<P>
 On his way to an 81, Johnny Miller shot a 43 on the front nine, including a 
start of double bogey, par, double bogey, bogey, bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a long way from the final-round 63 that Miller produced to win the 1973 
U.S. Open at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Miller reached 63 Thursday with his tee shot on the 14th hole, 
which he bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller refused to come to the interview room afterward, but had a brief 
comment for pool reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (U.S. Golf Assn.) is loving it," he said. "No one is creaming the 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Patton, who got into the tournament as an alternate, got out of it after 
eight holes because of heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt dizzy and sick at my stomach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patton, he has been on a diet and lost about 40 pounds. He said 
he weighed 352 at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton said he has been spurred to lose weight after reading a story about him 
titled, "A Giant Disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton added: "That really hurt. I've wanted to prove that even if I can't 
play golf, I can do something. I've wanted to make him eat his words." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Worst score of the day? It went to Gil Morgan, who shot a quadruple-bogey nine 
on No. 4. Tim Simpson and Ian Woosnam shot eights on the same hole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olin Browne, 25, of Jupiter, Fla., playing in his first U.S. Open, shot a 33 
on his front nine but finished with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Browne figured out a good way to approach Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hit the best shot you can and hold on for dear life," he said.

BOOK REVIEW / ESSAYS; MAKING A CASE FOR THE MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT; 
BULLETPROOF DIVA BY LISA JONES ; DOUBLEDAY $25.95, 350 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not a completely new idea; any graduates of that last great cultural 
rebellion, back in the late 1960s, will remember the concept, which was 
immortalized (or co-opted, depending on how you felt about the production) by 
the musical "Hair." 
</P>
<P>
 But writer Lisa Jones, who was too young to participate the last time around, 
sees our crowning glory as a metaphor identity: I curl, therefore I am. Hair, 
particularly Afro-American hair, is an emblem of an individual's spiritual 
life, of enslaved history, strident revolt, or, with any luck, an unfettered 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 This book of essays -- most of them taken from the Village Voice, where Jones 
writes the "Skin Trade" column, along with a few longer, original pieces -- is 
about figuring out life, especially when the pieces of one's puzzle are cut in 
an unusual style. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' father is black (and seems, from vague hints dropped, to be playwright 
Amiri Baraka, ne Leroi Jones); her mother is Jewish, and expectations are 
appropriately jumbled: Mom cooks collard greens better than the black women in 
the family who are supposed to own that franchise; Lisa knows only a single 
Jewish aunt because all the other relatives have refused to acknowledge her 
family; she is not one, not the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish law would consider her a Jew, because children inherit their mother's 
religion, but Jones places herself black, with a twist, and is fascinated by 
all the possible permutations she encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Looking for Mariah," she has a very good time investigating the lineage of 
our latest pop queen, who has no interest, it turns out, in living up to her 
incorrect image as a white girl who can sing. Her father was black and 
Venezuelan; her mother, white. There was choice involved, as there was for 
Jones, who chose the opposite path. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has a robust, staccato style, as evidenced in her essay "Hair Always and 
Forever," in which she investigates the history of Charlene's hair salon in 
Brooklyn, where a woman can get her hair done 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not reportage, but stream-of-consciousness image bites. Not just 
information about how places and people look but about how Jones feels about 
how they look. 
</P>
<P>
 She is obsessed with herself -- as perhaps any good essayist/memoirist should 
be -- as a symbol of something larger, of a yearning among the disenfranchised 
to claim a chunk of the social universe. And she makes a persuasive case that 
the percentage of the population that feels left out is larger and more 
diverse, and infinitely more energetic, than one might believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral majority may be nothing more than a massive public relations coup. 
</P>
<P>
 What else to say? Filmmaker Spike Lee, with whom Jones has collaborated on 
books about the making of three of his films, says in a promotional blurb, "It 
has been a pleasure to watch the growth and maturity of Lisa Jones' writings." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans should find more pleasure to come. Jones sometimes writes as though the 
English language were her opponent in a wrestling match, forcing it to the mat 
just to prove that she can. Her points are strong, and well taken, and she 
could stand to make them in less florid a style without their losing any 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Style cartwheels are always fun for the writer, but part of what makes them 
fun for the reader is if they're clean and effortless. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience doesn't need to know just how hard it is for a writer to get her 
linguistic legs pointing heavenward, and then land without skinning her knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's suggesting that Jones abandon her flamboyance; it's just that 
sometimes it seems that the words are running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Bulletproof Diva" is a bracing race through American culture; a call, 
if not to arms, then to hair, for people who are trying to find their place -- 
to define it, instead of buying into the stale definitions of generations past.

TIME FOR SOCIETY TO MOTHER MOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for Shari Roan's "The Fourth Trimester" (May 24). Roan clarifies the 
distorted assumption that women recover from childbirth in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Our culture has lost the time-honored traditions of "mothering the mother." 
Consequently, we have seen a rise in postpartum mood disorders and family 
crises due to childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 As a response to this, Jewish Family Services has a support group, "New Moms," 
which brings mothers together to nurture each other and provides information 
and referrals to address symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety.

THIS MARRIAGE ADVICE IS FOR HUSBANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Can This Marriage Be Saved?" (" 'What About Me?' Asks Husband," May 30): I 
could not believe your article. Brenda is working, taking care of their child 
and responsible for cleaning, cooking, etc.And still she has to cater to Rick's 
selfishness and explain to him why she's so tired. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rick would open his eyes and look around, maybe he would see that the 
dishes are piled up, laundry needs to be done and dinner cooked. Apparently he 
is '90s enough to agree to his wife working outside the home but not enough to 
help around the house. If Rick were as busy as Brenda, I don't think he'd have 
as much time to whine about not getting attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The advice given was for Brenda. Don't you think she has enough to do already?

COURTS CLOGGED BY INVITATION TO SUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Abcarian's column June 1 ("Why Pick on Larry Parker?") highlights 
AB-3659 now making its way through the California State Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 This bill would help curtail wholesale solicitation of lawsuits by television 
attorneys such as Larry Parker and others of his ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian seems to think there is really nothing wrong with these TV 
commercials -- unless you can "show" her "the little guy or gal who has been 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in addition to the damage done to our many reputable attorneys (why do 
you think lawyers have acquired such a bad name the past few years?), these TV 
invitations to sue someone have clogged up our courts to the point where 
legitimate lawsuits are delayed interminably, judges' and jurors' time is 
ill-spent, and our insurance rates continue to skyrocket. 
</P>

<P>
 Why pick on Larry Parker? I'll tell you why. Because his loathsome commercials 
are an exhortation to the worst instincts in society -- the "let's steal from 
the system" mentality that is bankrupting our public and private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Our courts are clogged and our insurance rates astronomical in no small 
measure because Robin Abcarian's "little guy and gal" are suing everyone in 
sight on the most specious if not thoroughly fraudulent grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that guy in the commercial who sits grinning on his motorcycle, telling 
us, "Larry Parker got me $2.5 million . . . and, man, am I enjoying it." What 
happened to him that was worth more than he likely would have made in three 
lifetimes and left him whole enough to enjoy it?  
</P>
<P>
 And guess who's paying for it all. You asked who was being hurt? Take a look 
at your own insurance and tax bills, Robin. And find someone more worthy to 
bleed for.

 We found the Los Angeles Times' note accompanying Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" 
last week (which concerned John Boswell's book, "Same Sex Unions in Premodern 
Europe") to be highly misleading in implying that the same-sex union ceremony 
uncovered by Professor Boswell was primarily a phenomenon of the Eastern 
Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early Christian era, there was no clear division between the Eastern 
and Roman branches of the Christian Church. Professor Boswell shows that the 
same-sex ceremony was practiced throughout Europe and, in fact, he found the 
largest number of early manuscript copies in Italy -- with no less than eight 
copies in the Vatican itself.

POLICE UNION GETS AN INSIDER'S EDGE; OUSTED RIORDAN ADVISER PLANS STRATEGY IN 
CONTRACT BATTLE AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In one day, Geoffrey L. Garfield went from loyal aide to Mayor Richard Riordan 
to a thorn in the mayor's side. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after leaving his City Hall job in February, Garfield took up 
battle with his former boss as a political strategist for the Police Protective 
League, which is locked in a contract battle with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As the police union's hired gun, Garfield is the man who brought carjacking 
billboards to neighborhood streets, who encouraged angry officers with picket 
signs to converge on City Hall, and who announced a campaign to embarrass city 
leaders by disclosing personal information about them. 
</P>
<P>
 One City Hall insider characterized Garfield as a mercenary who is loyal to 
whoever is paying his check. But Garfield, who boasts of bringing New York 
City-style politics to Los Angeles, says he has to believe in the fight he is 
waging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of political consultant I am is a cross between an assassin and a 
Secret Service agent," Garfield said. "Sometimes you fire the bullet and 
sometimes you take the bullet, but in either case you have to believe in your 
heart what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 His defection to the police union has turned him into a persona non grata in 
some quarters of City Hall. He is the subject of fierce private attacks by 
officials. The city attorney's office has even condemned him in a legal 
memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garfield says he has no personal grudge against Riordan or others he 
wrestles with in the public arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "In politics, an elected official is first a symbol and secondly a 
personality," Garfield said. "When you target the symbol, it's business. I have 
never targeted the mayor personally. I actually like the mayor. He's a 
self-made millionaire and I want to be just like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan says he does not take his former aide's attacks personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been given a job to do by his employer," Riordan said in a recent 
interview. "And while I have to disagree with the job that's being done -- I 
think it's destructive of the city and against the best interests of the Police 
Department -- I don't think you can blame Geoffrey Garfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials are less charitable. They accuse Garfield of playing 
games with the city's public safety in order to add another political victory 
to his resume.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the antipathy seems to bother Garfield, a hard-nosed political 
strategist with a flair for colorful sound bites. He loves a good fight, and 
finds himself today in one of the most intense battles of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers who head the union say Garfield is so aggressive that he 
sometimes has to be restrained. "Geoffrey is very tough," union President Danny 
Staggs said. "He can, if need be, go for the throat. At times, we've had to say 
to him, 'We don't have to go that far.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield says he feels a special advantage in this fight because he knows both 
sides well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He first worked for the police union as a consultant in 1992. He later joined 
Riordan's fledgling Administration as assistant deputy mayor for public safety. 
While Garfield was in that job, Riordan praised him for being the first member 
of the mayor's staff to respond to the city's emergency operations center after 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Garfield was forced out during an office shake-up, he quickly 
rejoined the police union. And to the shock of some Riordan staffers, Garfield 
began taking on the mayor's office with a vengeance by directing more of the 
union's attacks at Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield says his stint in the mayor's office familiarized him with Riordan 
and introduced him to the mayor's advisers -- including William Violante, the 
former police union president who hired Garfield and is now a Riordan deputy 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the mayor's overall philosophy and I believe I know the 
strategic abilities of his brain trust," Garfield said. "It's like an enormous 
chess game and I like to think I have a good reading on how they are going to 
react to our moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Garfield's most controversial creations so far have been the billboards 
that went up in March, showing a gunman pointing a pistol at a woman's face. 
The ads sparked an outcry. Garfield has urged critics to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they were in poor taste at all, but they weren't put up to be 
liked or disliked," he said. "They were put up to get people's attention. You 
tell me -- did they work?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield said he views the billboards as a mixture of strategy and psychology. 
The gunman was shrouded in black, he said, to denote evil. The woman is a 
blonde, for good. The race of the gunman is unclear, a nod to ethnic 
sensitivity. And the pistol pointed ominously at the victim, Garfield said, is 
a phallic symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock advertising is something Garfield studied at Baruch College's Graduate 
School of Political Management. He has fine-tuned his campaign skills in big 
cities across the country -- an anti-casino gambling referendum in Detroit, a 
stadium initiative in San Jose, a police reform referendum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In working to defeat the police reform initiative, he produced a television 
commercial that showed footage of trucker Reginald O. Denny being beaten and 
suggested that political interference prevented officers from responding. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads were met with a cascade of complaints from television stations who 
were expected to run them and from proponents of the police reform ballot 
measure. Eventually, Garfield toned down the commercials by deleting the riot 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Garfield's critics say he is treating the contract dispute as just 
another campaign to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "What everybody has to understand, including Garfield, is that this is not a 
political game," Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. "Very important issues are 
on the line -- things like public safety, employee morale and how you turn Los 
Angeles around. This is not just another political campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield says he fully understands the importance of the controversy -- but 
disagrees with the city's position. And there is nothing wrong, Garfield says, 
with having a little fun in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't have fun in what I'm doing, I don't do it," he said. "If a job 
gets monotonous, boring or routine, then it isn't for me. This job, this whole 
controversy, is none of the above." Profile: Geoffrey L. Garfield

SCHOOL YEARBOOK CONTROVERSY BECOMES DEVILISH; JOURNALISM: ARTWORK, INCLUDING 
THE WORD SATAN, AND AN ALLEGED RACIAL SLUR PROMPT PROTESTS AS SOME DEMAND THEIR 
MONEY BACK. 'WE WERE DUPED,' FACULTY ADVISER SAYS.

 Talk about the yearbook from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers of Santa Monica High School's "Nautilus," released last week, were 
jolted when they turned the cover upside down: The word Satan can be seen 
within the fanciful orange and black lettering of the yearbook name. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all. There are the mushrooms -- references to drugs, some say -- 
within the surreal drawing on the cover that the student artist said was a 
rendering of a scene from a Super Mario Bros. video graphic. There is the nude 
drawing of school mascot Vicky Viking -- her left hand casually draped over her 
lap. And on the inside pages a printer's error rendered the word "Homecoming" 
as "Homecomnig," which some are calling a clipped form of a racial slur (the 
homecoming king and queen were African American). 
</P>
<P>
 Now parents are outraged and some students are demanding their $35 back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was naive," said yearbook adviser Carol Jago. "I didn't turn the book 
upside down. I looked for weapons, beer cans, raised middle fingers -- the 
things I've been looking for in yearbooks for the last 17 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were duped," she added, explaining that nothing seemed amiss when it was 
reviewed before the press run. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say the student artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Enyart, 17, who drew much of the cover, said it was just a surreal 
commentary on the strange times we live in. The controversy, he added, is 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cover, and a lot of the art in the yearbook, had nothing to do with 
drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of what the artists drew was intended as political statements, they 
said. "Like the guy on the cover with the tassel round his neck. Everybody got 
upset because they saw the pentagram. But I also drew a Star of David, a 
Christian cross, and the male and female symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Satan" lettering was unintentional, said artist David Bergman, 19, who 
drew the stylish "Nautilus" title. He said he was not aware of the Satan 
reference until after the yearbook came out and a student editor pointed it out 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I'm not satanic, it kind of bothers me that if someone is satanic 
it's regarded as something illegal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The printer's error drew the most outrage from students.  
</P>
<P>
 Yearbook printer Jostens, based in Visalia, sent a letter of apology to the 
school for the transposition of the letters. A spokesman for the printer could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were sure it was not caused by a typographical error. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too blatant," said Lee Richerson, 16. There are no African Americans 
on the yearbook staff, he noted, "and given that the (homecoming) king and 
queen were black, it's just an example of blatant disrespect." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Roxie Patton said she was offended by the homecoming photo. She said 
students and parents should have been notified sooner, to quash the rumor mill. 
"If a letter of apology came from the printer, it should have been distributed 
to the entire community." she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jago said the controversy surrounding the yearbook has drawn attention to the 
lack of diversity on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Sylvia Rousseau met with Jago and the yearbook staff Thursday to 
discuss the controversy. It was not known whether the student artists would be 
reprimanded. Rousseau could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Before production began on the yearbook last fall, Jago said she told the 
staff to be creative, but not at the cost of controversy. Nicky Tarvin, a 
student editor, added that she asked the artists "to be honest with me, and 
tell me what things mean, so that if it was inappropriate, we could take it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some on the staff are chagrined at the controversy. "I think there was a total 
lack of responsibility on the part of Mrs. Jago, and the yearbook editors," 
said Michael Tarle, 17, the photo editor. "I think we should have known what is 
appropriate. The editors are ultimately responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the staff said it was the artists who should have used better 
judgment. Some parents are calling on school officials to more closely oversee 
the yearbook's preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like all that satanic stuff and the drug references," said Linda 
Stamer, whose two children attend the school.  
</P>
<P>
 But many students took the whole affair in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are reading too much into the art," said Zion Lee, 17. 
"Besides, it's a bad yearbook."

NO PLAN TO DROP RENT CONTROL, TOP OFFICIAL SAYS; ECONOMY: HOUSING DEPARTMENT 
CHIEF RESPONDS TO ASSISTANT WHO SAID RESTRICTIONS MAY BE UNNECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the Los Angeles Housing Department said Thursday that rent control 
continues to provide economic benefits to tenants and "there are no plans afoot 
to eliminate" it. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Gary Squier was responding to published comments of a top 
assistant, Barbara Zeidman, that the controls may be unnecessary in today's 
depressed real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said preliminary findings in the Housing Department's study of rent 
control show that an average tenant in a rent-controlled building paid $8 a 
month less last year than a tenant in a similar apartment that was not 
regulated. The differential was $20 a month in 1987. "But it's still 
significant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline is traceable to rents that have dropped during the recession in 
uncontrolled apartments -- those built after the rent control law took effect 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Renters who have been in their current apartments since 1978 enjoy the highest 
benefits because their rents went up only gradually during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those long-term renters are people on fixed incomes who would have 
difficulty adjusting to the sharp increases in free-market rents that many 
economists expect once the recession ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said his department is two months away from concluding its rent control 
study and presenting a range of options to the Rent Adjustment Commission and 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to consider the full range of options by law," he said. "Is it (rent 
control) still working? Does it provide a benefit? Should it be changed? How 
should it be changed? . . . We'll present options. . . . The policy is in their 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 But Squier said he believes rent control "still is providing a benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman had said in a recent interview that she "would like to decrease" rent 
controls while increasing eviction protections for tenants. The Los Angeles 
rent control law limits rent increases to 3% to 8% a year -- depending on the 
rate of inflation. This year the allowable rate is 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "That right now does not seem to have a lot of value," Zeidman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeidman could not be reached for further comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier interview, she said the controls are not appreciably helping 
many renters because a high vacancy rate has caused rents to decline in 
uncontrolled apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, the controls "may be creating damage" to the city's aging 
housing stock by making it harder for some landlords to maintain their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords complain that the law hurts them financially because it limits their 
ability to pass along the costs of capital improvements -- such as new roofs or 
earthquake damage repairs -- to tenants.

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; BUMPER CARS; TRAFFIC: TWO CONTESTS ARE AT RUSH HOUR, A 
THIRD NEARLY COINCIDES WITH DODGER GAME. OFFICIALS WARN FANS TO LEAVE EARLY. 
</P>

 First the earthquake. Now the soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in Los Angeles has not been kind to commuters this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not enough that up to 90,000 soccer fans will converge bumper-to-bumper 
on the freeways, snarling traffic as they wend their way to eight World Cup 
games, starting Saturday. For two games, soccer aficionados will be vying with 
the city's commuters, trying to reach the Rose Bowl during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 For another game, on July 3, soccer fans will swarm Pasadena while baseball 
enthusiasts flock to Dodger Stadium. Game times: 1:30 and 1:05 p.m., 
respectively -- a scheduling coincidence that caught some World Cup and other 
officials unaware. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game at the Rose Bowl, Saturday's 4:30 p.m. contest between Colombia 
and Romania, will be preceded by ceremonies that begin at 3:45 p.m. Sunday's 
Sweden-Cameroon game starts at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans attending those and other World Cup games should plan to leave for the 
Rose Bowl several hours before the opening kick because travel, parking and 
security screening will be time-consuming, transportation officials advise. 
Car-pool or use a park-and-ride service from one of three auxiliary lots, they 
urge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we say come early, we really do mean you ," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. 
Mary Schander. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two weekday World Cup games pose particular concern to transportation 
officials: Wednesday, June 22, and Wednesday, July 13, when the games will 
begin at 4:30 p.m. -- smack in the middle of rush hour. On those days, traffic 
volume on Pasadena's freeways is expected to double, said Steve Leung, Caltrans 
chief of traffic management. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also anticipate potential problems on Sunday, July 3, when the 
Dodgers and the World Cup begin games within 25 minutes of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 For drivers not going to the games, officials strongly recommend staying off 
the Pasadena, Ventura and Foothill freeways in the Pasadena area. Take surface 
streets instead. Work late or quit early. But don't try the major Pasadena 
thoroughfares two hours before or one hour after World Cup games, Schander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are your regular commuting routes, you might want to catch up on 
your backlog at work," she said. "People can control their frustration level if 
they think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, 90,000 soccer fans packed the Rose Bowl for an exhibition 
game between the United States and Mexico. It was a dress rehearsal plagued 
with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many drivers planned as they would for most games, hoping to arrive just 
before the opening kick. But because of traffic snarls, some fans waited for 
three hours or longer, attempting to reach the stadium in cars or on foot. 
Vehicles overheated. Scores of frustrated drivers simply pulled over and parked 
on freeway shoulders, abandoning their cars.  
</P>
<P>
 This time around, officials are trying to spread the word that spectators 
should arrive at least two hours early if they wish to see the entire game. And 
no one will be admitted into the Rose Bowl area on game days unless they have a 
special pass. (The closed area includes residential streets south of Washington 
Boulevard, west of Lincoln Avenue, and north of Orange Grove Boulevard.)  
</P>
<P>
 Another key difference will be the additional parking, said Sue Carpenter, a 
spokeswoman for the World Cup. Extra parking will be available at three 
auxiliary lots near the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parking is the issue," Schander said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a mega-crowd of 90,000, the Rose Bowl has limited parking. At the stadium, 
there are about 19,000 parking spots; of those, 16,000 will be open to the 
general public on the Brookside Golf Course, at the northern end. (The parking 
fee is $10 each for the first five games, $20 for the rest). Another 2,000 
spaces are reserved for limousines and 800 for charter buses, at the southern 
end, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxis and other vehicles will not be allowed to drop off or pick up 
passengers. And street parking will be banned on residential streets near the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The spaces at the Rose Bowl are expected to go fast. So World Cup officials 
have arranged for additional parking at three lots. Shuttle buses will run 
every 10 minutes to the Rose Bowl. The buses will travel in special lanes -- 
bypassing much of the congested traffic. Officials say the shuttle service will 
bring spectators to the Rose Bowl gates in less than 20 minutes. (The fee for 
parking is $15 and buses will begin operating three hours before each match. 
The shuttle bus is free for those who park in the lots.) 
</P>
<P>
 The three lots are: Ralph M. Parsons Co., 100 W. Walnut St. (at Fair Oaks 
Avenue), which can accommodate 2,000 vehicles; Pasadena City College, 1570 E. 
Colorado Blvd. (at Hill Avenue), 2,500 parking spaces; and Glendale Community 
College, 1500 N. Verdugo Road, Glendale, 1,100 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking areas will open about five hours before each game; the stadium 
gates will open three hours before each event. Because traffic is expected to 
be heavy, Schander urged spectators to arrive well in advance and "make a day 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Security checkpoints are also expected to slow the flow of fans into the 
stadium. Soccer fans will not be allowed to bring these items into the stadium: 
alcoholic beverages, drugs, weapons, poles, cans, coolers, picnic baskets, 
thermoses, cups, containers, strollers, banners, signs, video cameras, 
recorders, horns, bottles, umbrellas, balls, firecrackers, flares and Frisbees. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how to get to the Rose Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
 * From the San Fernando Valley: Take the Foothill Freeway east to Berkshire 
Avenue/Oak Grove Drive, Arroyo Boulevard/Windsor Avenue or Lincoln 
Avenue/Washington Boulevard. Then follow directions of the traffic control 
officers to the Rose Bowl general parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 * From the west: Take Ventura Freeway to the northbound Glendale Freeway to 
the Foothill Freeway. Exit at Berkshire Avenue/Oak Grove Drive, Arroyo 
Boulevard/Windsor Avenue or Lincoln Avenue/Washington Boulevard. Then follow 
directions from officers. 
</P>
<P>
 *From the east: Take the Foothill Freeway west to the Lincoln Avenue or Arroyo 
Boulevard/Windsor Avenue off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 * From the south: Take the Pasadena Freeway to the Golden State Freeway, 
continue north to the Glendale Freeway north to the Foothill Freeway east to 
the Berkshire Avenue/Oak Grove Drive off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE TO PARK: C6

 As the 1994 edition of the planet's most popular sporting event kicks off 
today in Chicago and Dallas, about 100,000 tickets remain for matches up to and 
including the championship final at the Rose Bowl July 17, World Cup '94 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual availability of over-the-counter tickets at this late date, 
particularly for the finals, may reflect a lingering apathy to the 
international soccer tournament among native-born Americans, who are serving as 
first-time hosts. But some also cite the high price of the tickets, several 
lackluster early-round matchups and the organizing committee's apparent 
inefficiency and Byzantine ticket sales system. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials, who have been hit with thousands of complaints regarding 
ticketing snafus, insist that their operation is proceeding smoothly and that 
by game time virtually all seats across the nation will be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase remaining seats for the final game directly from the tournament's 
organizers, World Cup '94, fans must also buy tickets for semifinal and 
third-place games at the Rose Bowl. The packages of three tickets go for $1,250 
to $2,500 -- about three times the face value of individual tickets to the 
three games that had been offered by the Century City-based organizers in 
limited supplies last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "$1,750? Who the hell is going to pay that in Los Angeles when we are 
recovering from earthquakes, riots and a bad economy?" said Fred Ross, co-owner 
of Front Row Center Tickets in Westwood. "They're engaged in legalized 
scalping." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, those springing for the "Premier Ticket" packages are supplied no 
information on the specific location of their seats until the tickets arrive at 
their homes by overnight mail. Last week, a class-action lawsuit was filed in 
Chicago on behalf of irate ticket-holders who claim that after paying for 
top-end tickets, they received seats at the far corners of Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials said Thursday that there were still several hundred 
tickets remaining at Ticketmaster outlets for most early-round games at nine 
venues across the nation, including Saturday's opening game at the Rose Bowl 
between Romania and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger face-value supplies are available for six games, including Sunday's 
Cameroon-Sweden contest at the Rose Bowl, the Russia-Cameroon game in Palo Alto 
June 28 and two early-round games in Dallas and Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, ticket brokers and individual speculators are reporting a 
relatively soft market for seats for many of the 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't exactly say there's a glut of tickets, but there are definitely 
some extra seats," said Ken Solby, owner of Designer Tickets & Tours, a Sherman 
Oaks broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Torrico, a San Fernando Valley travel agent, said his firm alone has 50 
tickets left for Sunday's Cameroon-Sweden game that were ordered last year 
before it was known what the team matchups would be. With sales slow, Torrico 
has gone so far as to call the Swedish Consulate for advice, but he has still 
been unable to locate takers. "We've been selling those tickets with only a $5 
profit, which is unbelievable," he said. "But there's just no interest." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials had previously announced sellouts of all but 14 of the 52 
games. But ticketing director Marla P. Messing said that several hundred 
tickets have became available through organizers for most of the contests at 
the Rose Bowl and other sites in recent days because of "checks that bounced . 
. . and tickets returned at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 "In a 99,000-seat stadium, that's not very many," Messing said of the Rose 
Bowl, whose soccer capacity is actually 91,794.  
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, World Cup games are sold out, but they've never had as many 
tickets -- 3.5 million -- as we've had this year," Messing said. "The record 
holder until now was Italy in 1990, I believe, and I believe they had a million 
fewer tickets to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to Ticketmaster Thursday showed $75 tickets were available for 
Saturday's Colombia-Romania contest at the Rose Bowl. For Sunday's game, $45 
and $65 seats were for sale at face value (plus Ticketmaster's service charges 
of $3.50 and up per ticket). 
</P>
<P>
 A few early contests, most notably Italy versus Ireland at Giants Stadium in 
New Jersey, are particularly hot tickets, with widespread scalping anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Messing refused to specify the number of tickets still available from the 
organizing committee for the finals in Pasadena. But she acknowledged that 
there are more Premier packages still unsold than the several hundred tickets 
now available for most early-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different market," Messing said. "You're talking the difference 
between a $40 ticket and $2,500 -- but we're confident they'll all sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Messing said the price for the Premier tickets is higher than the face value 
for the individual tickets offered last year because of amenities included 
along with the tickets. However, she could not cite specifics and three 
separate World Cup '94 ticket sales agents, when asked for details about the 
Premier packages, said no amenities are included. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a World Cup order form, the "Gold Final Week Package" provides 
sideline section seats at a cost of $2,500 for the three games. For $1,750, one 
receives corner section seats and for $1,250, seats behind the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, World Cup ticket agents, who handle most requests by phone and fax, 
say they cannot provide purchasers with the specific rows and sections for the 
seats -- even to those who show up in person at the Century Park East offices 
of World Cup '94.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a pig in a poke," said one World Cup sales agent, who asked to 
remain anonymous. "You pay your money and get what you are given. A lot of 
people have been unhappy with what they were given. There's no fraud; it's just 
inefficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, thousands of ticket-holders have complained about problems 
ranging from seating locations to tickets that never arrived at their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be issues," Messing said. "With a 99% success rate, which 
is phenomenal, there are still 35,000 tickets that are potentially 
problematic." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chicago lawsuit, an angry fan is charging consumer fraud, deceptive 
practices and breach of contract after paying for seats between the end lines 
and receiving ones behind the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, a Cook County Circuit judge declined to order that tickets to the 
match be redistributed. But Judge Lester Foreman did direct World Cup officials 
to provide financial documents to an attorney representing plaintiff Anton 
Naunheimer in relation to the damages portion of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Messing said that seating complaints have arisen because "all people want to 
sit at midfield and it's impossible for everyone . . . to sit in the same 2,000 
to 2,500 seats." 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament's best seats have been reserved for corporate sponsors and 
international soccer officials because "we have contract obligations," she 
added. "We have sponsors who have spent millions of dollars and they require a 
certain level of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 At area ticket broker agencies, prices for first-weekend contests have dipped 
to as low as $25 for Sweden-Cameroon. As interest builds, demand could escalate 
exponentially, said manager Steven Tick of Murray's Tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly hard to predict," Tick said. "If the Americans go far, I'd 
expect the interest of Americans to perk." 
</P>
<P>
 "And if the Mexican team is in the finals in Los Angeles," echoed Ross of 
Front Row, "you won't be able to touch a ticket for less than $1,000."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
CONVICTIONS OF 4 LAWYERS UPHELD IN INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco has upheld the convictions of four 
Southern California lawyers on fraud charges for taking part in a ring that 
cheated insurance companies out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the charges this week of lawyers 
who took part in the ring, which was known as "the Alliance" and operated in 
Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties from 1984 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged ringleader, Los Angeles attorney Lynn Stites, was convicted in a 
separate trial last year after avoiding arrest for two years. He was sentenced 
to 12 1/2 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $50 million. His appeal is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The four whose appeals were rejected this week are Monty Mason II, Richard 
Noyer and Lewis Koss, all of the Los Angeles area, and Leonardo Radomile of La 
Jolla. Eight other lawyers and six non-lawyers have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 As described by the federal appellate court, the Alliance extracted legal fees 
out of insurance companies by manufacturing and prolonging claims against 
policyholders, mostly based on failed investments. All four were convicted of 
racketeering and mail fraud, and were given prison sentences ranging from 37 to 
46 months by U.S. District Judge Clarence Newcomer.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; POLICE BEEF UP 
PATROLS FOR GRADUATION PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Graduation partytime started in Venice Thursday night and police were planning 
to be out in force in the community where a racially motivated gang shooting 
left two people dead and four wounded last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "The area is saturated (with police) and will be until at least the end of the 
week," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ted Matthews of the Pacific Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers flooded the area six days ago after three shootings that day. The 
most serious shooting left two Dorsey High School students dead and two 
wounded. The killers are still at large, Matthews said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the violence, patrol officers at Pacific Station were placed on 10-hour 
shifts, Matthews said. The officers on extended shifts are being joined by a 
squad from the Metropolitan Division, he said, and gang investigators are being 
based in the area. The department's Mobile Field Force also has been deployed, 
Matthews said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12 to 14 patrol officers normally in the field for the morning watch, or 
"graveyard shift," is up to between 75 and 100 now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very, very quiet," Matthews said. Although there have been a few 
reports of shots fired, no one has been wounded since the officers were added, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the recent round of shootings in Venice are part of a gang war 
that erupted about a year ago between once-friendly gangs. Since then, 17 
people have died in gang-related shootings.VENICE (CA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA SETTLES FOR 
2ND BILLING IN CUP SIGN BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena officials, upset this week because "Los Angeles" was affixed to a 
World Cup sign in front of the Rose Bowl with no mention of Pasadena, said 
Thursday they had reached a settlement with event organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 A second sign, which will recognize Pasadena, is being designed and should be 
in place before the first of eight soccer games at the stadium kicks off 
Saturday, said Pasadena spokeswoman Ann Erdman. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials were furious earlier this week after they found out that 
Los Angeles was getting top billing at Pasadena's stadium. They began 
investigating whether they had legal recourse to have the letters removed. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials rejected Pasadena's plea to remove the offending letter, 
noting that Los Angeles is recognized as the official venue of the games -- 
even though they are at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 City and World Cup officials reached a tentative agreement after a meeting 
Wednesday, but tournament officials must still approve the final design and 
placement of the sign, Erdman said. "It's definitely being fast-tracked all the 
way around," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; MAN GUILTY 
OF SMUGGLING ENDANGERED TARANTULAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury deliberated only half an hour Thursday before convicting a Long Beach 
man of trading in protected wildlife for smuggling 600 Mexican red-kneed 
tarantulas from Mexico to the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Earl Cook, 46, will be sentenced on the five counts July 25.He faces 
up to 25 years in prison, Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman said, 
declining to specify how much time he would recommend. Hochman had argued that 
Cook was a "wildlife predator" who posed a greater danger to the tarantulas 
than their natural enemies -- grasshopper mice or tarantula hawks.  
</P>
<P>
 The species is considered so endangered that Mexico has never issued a permit 
allowing the spiders to be taken out of the country, Hochman said. However, 
they are not sufficiently near extinction to require steps to breed them back 
from disappearing altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 Cook's attorney, Sean Kennedy, had argued that his client did not know that 
the species was protected. But Hochman said Cook had been a reptile and spider 
dealer for 35 years. In 1986, Cook was charged in a civil case with Endangered 
Act violations, and as part of the case settlement, signed papers stating he 
was familiar with its provisions.  
</P>
<P>
 Hochman said Cook went to the forests around Colima and bought tarantulas from 
locals, paying $3 each. He put them in cups, brought them in suitcases across 
the border and sold them for up to $50 each. They are worth up to $300 apiece.

GROUPS AWARDED OLYMPIC SURPLUS GRANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The foundation charged with disseminating Southern California's share of the 
1984 Olympics surplus has awarded $386,190 in new grants to 20 youth sports 
organizations, bringing to $27.6 million the amount distributed in the decade 
since the Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest new grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, 
$69,000, was given to Little League Baseball Inc. for construction of a

</P>
<P>
 Also, $52,167 went to California Handicapped Skiers to enhance its programs at 
Big Bear Lake for 675 physically and mentally disabled individuals, $50,000 to 
Cerritos College for resurfacing its stadium track, $45,500 to the 
Constitutional Rights Foundations for a sports law program, and $43,980 to the 
Venice chapter of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN WHO 
SET MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN AFIRE GETS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cocaine addict who set the mother of his two young children on fire has been 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Candace Beason imposed the sentence Wednesday on Johnny 
Mack Finney, 38.He was on probation for attacking his ex-wife when he set fire 
to Janice Johnson, his live-in companion and mother of his two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney poured a soda bottle filled with gasoline on the woman, then flicked a 
cigarette lighter while her 15-year-old son looked on in horror. Johnson 
suffered third-degree burns from her chest to her head. One ear was burned off 
in the Aug. 1, 1993, attack at their suburban Val Verde home. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney held the victim down by sitting on her legs while her body was afire, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jon Jonas said. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend who heard her screams smothered the flames by wrapping himself around 
Johnson. Finney, an admitted cocaine addict, apologized when he was convicted 
June 1 of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily 
injury, and corporal battery on a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco argued that Finney was drunk and unable to 
think clearly. But the prosecutor said Finney had passed a fellow inmate a 
playing card with the note: "I set (her) on fire. She deserved it."

NOT QUITE HOOKED; STUDENTS ON SHARK STUDY EXPEDITION QUICKLY LOSE APPETITE FOR 
KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Finally, a contest that school kids could sink their teeth into. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Write an essay about sharks, junior high students were told. If you're a 
winner, you'll get to go to sea on a real-life shark-hunting expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Visions of the movie "Jaws" were swimming through youngsters' heads at three 
Los Angeles-area inner-city schools as they rushed excitedly to encyclopedias 
and science books and then took pen in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were visions of something altogether different swimming through 
their stomachs when it came time for winners to claim the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uhhhhgghh!" moaned seasick 14-year-old Adriana Angel, her head resting on a 
table aboard a boat rolling in ocean swells 11 miles off San Pedro. "I didn't 
know it was going to be like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Marisol Gutierrez, also 14, clutched a deck railing. "I've never been on the 
ocean before. My stomach feels kind of queasy -- it's going up and down," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were among seven students from Stephens Middle School in Long Beach 
aboard an 80-foot boat named Mako on Wednesday. Like eight other winners from 
Hollenbeck and Berendo middle schools in Los Angeles who set sail Thursday, 
they were there to help catch sharks for a research project conducted by the 
state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The essay contest was devised by department Director Boyd Gibbons to lure 
youngsters into careers in marine biology. Sharks caught on poles by the 
teen-agers and on a 91-hook line stretching a mile behind the boat would be 
tagged and then released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to learn more about the behavior and distribution of mako and 
blue sharks," Gibbons explained. "This isn't pretend research. This is real." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty essays were judged by Fish and Game marine biologists Juan Hernandez 
and Paul Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old winner Nicole Elliott wrote that the shark's appetite for 
humans has been exaggerated: "They mainly eat seals that are injured. That's 
good because we don't want dead seals hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Greg Wilterink, 13, started his essay by describing how a fisherman is 
gobbled up by a great white shark after he accidentally cuts himself and then 
slips, knocks himself out and tumbles into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just made that part up," Greg explained. "I figured just putting in the 
facts about sharks would be boring." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers had taken motion-sickness tablets before shoving off. But Greg 
was one of the few who felt like fishing when the boat stopped in the middle of 
the Catalina Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the state's shark study began 11 years ago, about 4,400 small sharks 
have been tagged, marine biologist Melodie Palmer said. About 3% of them have 
been caught later by fishermen who reported the tag numbers to Fish and Game 
officials in exchange for a small reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Most seem to stay in local waters, but one blue shark was hooked by Japanese 
fishermen 3,200 miles away -- 2 1/2 years after it was tagged near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one would be hooked this day, though. And Greg was the only student 
watching the action when a yellow plastic strip was attached to it with a 
stick-like dart. 
</P>
<P>
 The outing also failed to hook the Stephens students on careers in marine 
biology.  
</P>
<P>
 Ashen-faced Ronald Sararana, 14, shook his head "no" when asked if ocean work 
was in his future, moments before Hernandez led him back into the Mako's cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Said classmate Limpee Chheang, 14: "I'd rather be on land."

HATE MESSAGES LEFT IN HISTORIC HOME; VANDALISM: INTRUDERS SPRAY-PAINT EPITHETS 
IN A HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE'S MANSION IN THE WEST ADAMS DISTRICT.

<P>
 Bob Bowerman and Penn Barrosse spent Thursday trying to calculate the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchup, spaghetti sauce, mustard and almost any other liquids that burglars 
could find in the refrigerator were splattered through the gay couple's 
21-room, three-story mansion in the historic West Adams district. 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling, though, were the hate messages and other epithets 
spray-painted in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is yellow spray-paint on the furniture, woodwork, mirrors, paintings," 
said Bowerman, 37, an executive at Playboy Entertainment. "There is also what 
looks like a tag -- RF -- on a large curio cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowerman and Barrosse, 40, a PacBell technician, have lived in the 
neighborhood for 10 years. They have spent more than $1 million refurnishing 
and restoring the home, built by an organizer of the old Los Angeles Angels, 
who played in the Pacific Coast League, Bowerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house has been nominated for the National Register of Historic Places, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars who broke into the house and tripped an alarm about noon Wednesday 
sprayed paint over restored mahogany and oak woodwork and damaged an original 
chandelier, Bowerman said. The alarm company called police, but officers 
reported a false alarm after finding no signs of forced entry, Bowerman said.

 Barrosse went to the house at 1:30 p.m., reset the alarm and left, apparently 
locking in the burglars, Bowerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one could have entered again without setting off the alarm," Bowerman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Barrosse returned at 4:30 p.m., he heard footsteps upstairs, but he was 
knocked unconscious when he slipped on spaghetti sauce on the stairs and fell, 
Bowerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrosse's return apparently frightened the burglars, who left without taking 
television sets, a compact disc player, a compact stereo and jewelry that had 
been "assembled and was ready to be taken out the back door," Bowerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowerman said he considers the burglary and vandalism a hate crime directed at 
him and Barrosse because of their sexual orientation. He said a teen-ager 
attempted to break into the house two weeks ago, but he and Barrosse were able 
to capture him and hold him for police.

AROUND TOWN: CLASS ACTS: STUDENTS HONE THEIR TALENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Class is in session. Frolicking about are a girl in a red yarn wig and shoes 
that look like giant strawberries, a barelegged boy in white lab coat and pith 
helmet, an Elvis impersonator in a leopard skin. 
</P>
<P>
 We're at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, where instructor 
Stefan Haves is putting students through a warm-up for a production of "Cirque 
de Spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one stop on a tour for prospective students and their parents, some of 
whom must decide whether to sign up for July 10 auditions, the last for fall 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guide, docent Deanne Levitt, mother of theater arts student Valerie, 
acknowledges that Arts High takes a little getting used to. Where's the 
football field? The cheerleaders? 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way around this small slice of Cal State L.A.'s campus east of 
Downtown, she tells of one parent who left a tour midway, announcing huffily 
that she'd "seen quite enough." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, "The purple hair and nose rings really turned me off," Levitt 
admits. She was dead set against Valerie transferring from tony Marlborough 
School for girls. Now, she's a major fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Free expression is coveted here, and a furor erupted recently when dance 
department chairman Don Bondi, a founding faculty member, was removed and 
assigned to a desk job at another school. 
</P>
<P>
 His offense: Booing a student Mexican-heritage production in which Gov. Pete 
Wilson was portrayed as a Mexican-baiting bigot. The incident ignited angry 
debate over where artistic freedom ends and racism begins and whether political 
correctness conflicts with the idea of art as a unifying force. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, following a high-profile protest in Bondi's behalf by a 
multiracial, multiethnic group of students -- and a threatened ACLU lawsuit 
alleging that his First Amendment rights had been violated -- he was 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts High is not the kind of place where one would expect students to cave in 
meekly. Principal Bo Vitolo describes her students as "alive, energetic, 
outspoken, mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Our tour begins in Jerry Freedman's 11th-grade history class. "You're 
artists," he's telling students. "Did you know that artists were part of the 
Cold War?" A lively discussion of artistic propaganda -- from murals to "Rambo" 
-- ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in student leadership class, parents hear what the kids really think 
about their school. They say they like the big doses of responsibility -- and 
how "everyone speaks their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But, says senior class secretary Erin Shelton, 18, she misses "the whole 
spirit behind football games and dances." 
</P>
<P>
 In a mirrored hall, dancer-choreographer Rudy Perez is scrutinizing lifts and 
dips. No, no, he says: "I want to see something I haven't seen before, and I've 
been around a long time. . . . It's not 1950." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Fifth Dimension singer Patricia Bass Blodgett's gospel class is seeing 
a video of its recent concert. The concert was so stirring that one student, 
leaping to her feet, broke another's toe. 
</P>
<P>
 But, then, enthusiasm appears to be contagious in this eclectic student body 
of 485. The school is tuition-free, admission highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the July auditions, hopefuls will show their stuff -- playing a solo, 
maybe, or presenting an art portfolio or a pair of monologues. (Rules specify 
"No Shakespeare.") 
</P>
<P>
 One in four will get in. Girls now outnumber boys, two to one, and hearts leap 
when a male appears -- but, Vitolo says, standards are not bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the school, now 9 years old and California's first public high 
school for the arts, reflects both outreach to the inner city and cutbacks in 
arts at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It tends to attract those who march to different drummers. And, says Vitolo, a 
former professional dancer, "Sometimes the talent just blows me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Academics fill the mornings; arts classes, taught by pros, the afternoons. 
Nights or weekends, one might catch rehearsals of Gilbert and Sullivan or 
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Chekhov or Oscar Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
 One alum dances with the Alvin Ailey Co. Another understudied the lead in 
"Phantom of the Opera" in San Francisco. But, Vitolo knows, not all who 
graduate will "pursue their dreams." The reality is that talent abounds; 
support for the arts does not. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a tough day -- and lately she's had a few -- she may ask 
herself: "What would my soul like today?" Then she'll take in a concert, ballet 
or recital. Without leaving campus. A Legacy of Compassion 
</P>
<P>
 As a student at Harvard School (now Harvard-Westlake), Justin Rascoff was 
among its biggest boosters. "He just loved that place," his father recalls. "He 
immersed himself and absorbed everything the school had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 4, 1991 -- three days before he was to graduate -- Justin, 18, died in 
a fiery explosion after losing control of his Toyota convertible on the 134 
freeway and plunging down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on his way home to Beverly Hills from Glendale, where he'd been helping 
put out a spoof of the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, Joseph and Jane, sued Toyota, alleging design flaws caused the 
1991 Celica to oversteer and its gas tank to rupture when the car smashed 
sideways into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota, admitting no fault, recently settled out of court for $500,000. 
Attorney Craig Winterman says his client settled to avoid the expense of a 
trial and after considering the jury sympathy factor in these cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rascoffs have given the money to Harvard-Westlake for the David Justin 
Rascoff Memorial Fund for Faculty Sabbaticals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "exactly what Justin would have wished," says Rascoff, an entertainment 
business manager whose company, RZO, has among its clients the Rolling Stones 
and the Elvis Presley estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, Rascoff says, his son said it was too bad his teachers had to take 
summer jobs to make ends meet, rather than pursuing some special dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, established by the family at the time of Justin's death, had reached 
$127,000 through contributions big and small. The $500,000 ensures that in 
perpetuity at least one faculty member each year will be able to spend a summer 
"as Justin would have wished," headmaster Thomas Hudnut says. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sabbaticals have already been granted. English teacher Philip Holmes 
went to Greece, history department chairman David Waterhouse visited baseball 
fields and Civil War battlefields, and this year history teacher John Corsello 
will go to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin's family also planted a daisy garden on campus. Inscribed on a plaque 
there are words from an editorial Justin wrote, asking that everyone take time 
to smell the daisies. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin, who had been accepted at Princeton University, is remembered by Hudnut 
as "smart and tireless. He made things happen. He threw off sparks. He was a 
great kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Battling through their grief, Rascoff says, he and his wife "decided to start 
our lives again." Their son Spencer graduated from Harvard-Westlake last year 
and is at Harvard University. Sixteen months ago, the Rascoffs, then both 48, 
became parents of twins -- a girl and a boy.

 Among David Letterman's Top 10 advantages of being executed on Donahue: 
</P>
<P>
 * Might get to check out one last big-busted stripper before you die. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tough questions from audience good warm-up for Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The show's makeup and hair people send you off looking damn good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike Oprah, you don't have to worry about Phil stealing your last meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * The kids who picked on you in high school will be really jealous when they 
see you on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get last-minute endorsement cash by announcing that after you die, you're 
going to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 * You don't have to watch second half of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First Family watch: Letterman, on Hillary Clinton's failed attempt to join the 
Marines: "They said, 'You can't come in -- you're too bossy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Argus Hamilton, on the Japanese royals' visit: "Empress Michiko and Hillary 
really hit it off. They had a long talk, and the empress has since announced 
that from now on she wants to be known as Michiko Rodham Akihito."  
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on the special prosecutor questioning the Clintons about Whitewater: 
"We missed a great opportunity here. As long as they had them under oath, we 
should've asked if they knew anything about health care, foreign policy or the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short takes: Leno, on 100,000 southern U.S. teen-agers turning in pledge cards 
promising to remain virgins until they marry: "Today in L.A., organizers said 
they almost convinced one teen-ager to at least try to hold out until the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Bruce Bellingham, on David Hasselhoff saying that people who criticize 
his "Baywatch" TV show do so out of ignorance: "He may be right. A new study 
shows that each time you watch the show, you lose 12 points off your IQ." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial World magazine says money manager George Soros rakes in Wall 
Street's highest salary: $1.3 billion. Comedy writer Bob Mills reports that 
Soros insists that he keeps the job "only because of its great dental plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for Woodstock '94 will soon go on sale, at $135 a pop. Mills says that 
fans still camped in the area to clean up after the original Woodstock won't be 
required to pay again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Joel Rapp of L.A. says he sneaked off to see a "The Flintstones" 
matinee the other day and found himself in the ticket line behind a father and 
his young daughter: 
</P>
<P>
 In front of them was a very obese woman. As I pondered how she would fit into 
a theater seat, the woman's beeper went off.  
</P>
<P>
 The little girl's eyes widened at the sound. She clutched her father's hand 
and whispered fearfully: "Look out daddy, she's going to back up!"

DANA PARSONS: HELPFUL HINTS FOR RUNNING BROWN'S CAMPAIGN IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you the kind of person who enjoys a challenge? Are you undaunted by 
seemingly hopeless tasks? Do you handle rejection well? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, report immediately to the Kathleen Brown for Governor headquarters and 
sign up to head her campaign in Orange County. No one has been named yet, and 
can you blame them? 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the toughest sales job since the American Motors Co. introduced 
the Gremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing would be nothing more than idle sport if the stakes weren't so 
high. If Brown becomes the next governor of California, she will be thrust 
immediately into contention for national office somewhere down the road. But if 
she is slaughtered in Orange County, chances are she will not be the next 
governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The task at hand: How to avoid being slaughtered in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, well, let's see now. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the baggage problem. Kathleen is the unfortunate victim of being 
Jerry's sister in a county where he was about as unpopular as a politician 
could be. She must hope that local memories are short, for in the 1982 U.S. 
Senate campaign, Jerry Brown got a dismal 31% of the Orange County vote, 
compared to his 45% statewide. A guy named Pete Wilson beat Brown that year by 
230,000 votes in Orange County and went off to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to beat a dead horse, but Jerry Brown got 40,000 fewer votes in Orange 
County that November day in 1982 than did Tom Bradley, the Democratic mayor of 
Los Angeles, for Pete's sake, who was running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Kathleen is not Jerry. How many times she can say that could be key 
to her hopes. Come to think of it, that could be her local campaign slogan: 
"I'm Not Jerry!" 
</P>
<P>
 The "Jerry Connection" is not just ancient history. It matters in Orange 
County because of the death penalty issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a county where Republicans favor the death penalty by about 90-10 and even 
Democrats polled a few years ago were 70-30, Kathleen Brown opposes it. That 
coincides rather unfortunately with then-Gov. Jerry Brown's naming of Rose Bird 
as the state's chief justice, for it was Bird whom the voters later ousted 
largely because of perceived leniency in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Kathleen separate herself from Jerry when people keep bringing up the 
death penalty? 
</P>
<P>
 Believe me, I'm not volunteering for the job, but I would suggest a 
two-pronged attack. 
</P>
<P>
 First, forget about ducking it, especially with Orange County audiences. That 
will be impossible. When pressed about the death penalty, she should be direct 
and impassioned in her opposition, explaining either in moral or legalistic 
terms where she stands. She should show people she's as tough as that wiry 
ex-Marine running against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Second and more important, she should pledge not to appoint anyone to the 
state Supreme Court who opposes the death penalty. That would undercut any Rose 
Bird fears with the electorate and allow Brown to say she respects the public's 
overwhelming support on the issue, while not compromising her own beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 On balance, people would admire her forthrightness on the issue. It may help 
relegate the death penalty to where it belongs: non-issue status. 
</P>
<P>
 One stumbling block out of the way, and one to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other troublesome issue here is immigration. As with the death penalty, 
she should be steely and straightforward in an effort to elevate the debate 
instead of lowering it. She should stake out a position and vigorously defend 
it, even in the face of hostile audiences. She should remember that even when 
you're losing points on substance, there are style points to be won. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown is looking for Orange County inspiration, she can call Dianne 
Feinstein. In 1990, Wilson clobbered Feinstein in Orange County, beating her by 
more than 200,000 votes en route to a narrow statewide win. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, however, Feinstein returned and came within about 100,000 votes of 
Orange County's own John Seymour and won their U.S. Senate race. Feinstein had 
advantages with the national ticket that Brown doesn't, but Feinstein greatly 
increased her raw vote totals in Orange County between 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens in Orange County is critical for Kathleen Brown's future in 
politics. Whoever manages Brown's campaign here has 4 1/2 months to make an 
impression for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for whoever gets the job is that they don't have to win Orange 
County for Brown. They just have to convince enough people that she's somewhere 
in the vicinity of their wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, convince them she's not Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, anyone?

HOPING TO GRADUATE OFF WELFARE; EDUCATION: SINGLE PARENTS REJOICE AT THE 
PROSPECT OF GETTING JOBS AFTER COMPLETING GAIN PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noreen Garcia says she never enjoyed getting welfare and has worked on and off 
for a decade while she raised her daughter alone, resorting to government help 
only when she lost a job or a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very embarrassing. People stare at you when you cash your check or go in 
a store with food stamps," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't understand not all of us want to be on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday the 29-year-old Sylmar woman rejoiced at receiving the 
equivalent of a high-school diploma at Los Angeles Mission College, holding up 
her certificate with a prizefighter's gesture of triumph and speaking of plans 
to become a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was among 140 welfare recipients, mostly single mothers, who graduated 
Thursday from a government-funded program aimed at moving them from public 
assistance to private payrolls. Called Greater Avenues for Independence, or 
GAIN, the statewide program subsidizes books, transportation and child care so 
welfare mothers -- and a few fathers -- can return to school, brush up 
vocational skills and eventually find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely recognized program is part of a national rebellion against 
long-term public aid and among the models embraced by the Clinton 
Administration, which this week unveiled a welfare-reform plan that would 
require recipients to find work within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Clinton plan have been quick to question whether welfare 
recipients can become financially independent with such a deadline, especially 
when the costs of child and health care plague even middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, even those GAIN participants who have found work have 
tended to remain on welfare rolls because they cannot afford medical care for 
their families on their earnings alone, said Pat Knauss, a county GAIN 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 About 97,700 parents receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) 
have enrolled in GAIN since it began nearly six years ago, and about 25,000 of 
them have gone to work, Knauss said. Most participants are randomly selected by 
computer, although some volunteer. Currently, 35,000 of the county's 315,000 
AFDC parents are involved in some phase of the $65-million program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Thursday's graduates at Mission College, 40 completed training in 
restaurant management, nursing or clerical work, and have been placed in jobs, 
said Eloise Cantrell, dean of the Vocational Program. The remaining 100 
completed GAIN's first phase in basic literacy and are expected to continue 
either college or vocational courses, Cantrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Thursday's "culmination exercises" donned no caps or gowns but 
there were plenty of miniskirts and tattoos, and graduates' children sat on 
their laps. 
</P>
<P>
 The hopeful mood was enhanced by City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who spoke 
movingly of his own family's intermittent reliance on welfare and held himself 
up as an example of success despite humble, even rocky, beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can be a councilman and overcome the challenges we had as a family, on 
welfare and as a teen-age father, then you can do the same," Alarcon said. He 
went on to recall how his grandfather had been a janitor at San Fernando Junior 
High School in the 1950s -- and then how someone recently sought his 
recommendation for a principal at the same school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Wow, have we come a long way,' " the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 His sympathetic listeners included Maria Velarde, a 36-year-old mother of four 
who hopes to become a certified chef and open her own restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Velarde said she has been on and off welfare since she became pregnant with 
her oldest child 19 years ago and spoke proudly of a daughter who just 
graduated from high school at age 16. After Velarde enrolled in GAIN classes, 
the two sometimes studied side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Are you doing your homework, Mom?' and I said, 'Yes. What about 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Velarde recently landed a job in Olive View Medical Center's kitchen. "Three 
more weeks and I'm off welfare," she said, with more than a little 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Logan, 42, of Tujunga, one of a handful of fathers at Thursday's 
ceremony, said he hopes to someday own his own business. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan said he raised his two children, now 22 and 17, alone after his wife 
left them many years ago. He applied for welfare only within the last year, 
after he lost one of a long line of restaurant jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I ever had to use the system and it worked. I was 
shocked," said Logan, his teen-age son Shea at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Luna was too shy to attend the ceremony, where she was scheduled to 
appear as one of nine student speakers, so a friend read her prepared remarks: 
</P>
<P>
 "I come to Mission College so I can get a better life for myself and my son. I 
also work after school so I can give my son the things he wants. Sometimes it's 
hard for me because I only see him in the mornings. I come to school from 8 
a.m. to 1 p.m., then I go to work from 2 until 9:30 p.m. When I get off work, 
my son is already asleep. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm on welfare but I barely make ends meet," Luna wrote. "That's why I 
got a job -- to be able to give my son the best I can. I hope one day he will 
be proud of me, not embarrassed or ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, the aspiring nurse, also had her child's future in mind when she 
enrolled in GAIN. She said she dropped out of the seventh grade because of 
family problems that included alcohol, abuse and welfare. She got pregnant at 
age 19 with Monica, now 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's kind of like a cycle," mused Garcia. "But it's not going to 
happen to my daughter."

SELLERS JAILED FOLLOWING TARDY COURT SHOWING; CELEBRITY: DAUGHTER OF LATE COMIC 
ACTOR HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY FROM A STRING OF VALLEY 
ROBBERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The party's over, at least until Tuesday, for Victoria Sellers, the 
nightclub-hopping, celebrity progeny and longtime gal pal of alleged Hollywood 
Madam Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 An irate Van Nuys Municipal Court judge, observing that "Miss Sellers has 
about as much interest in complying with the orders of this court as does a 
cat," ordered her jailed Thursday without bail after Sellers failed to show up 
this week for police booking on a charge of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael S. Luros said the arrangements had been made for a quiet, 
dignified booking this week for the 29-year-old daughter of the late comic 
actor Peter Sellers and his third wife, actress Britt Eckland, to spare her 
"embarrassment in public." Even given such a break, Sellers "walked in when the 
mood suited her," Luros said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will teach me to be nice," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch outside 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge last Friday gave Sellers until 5 p.m. Tuesday to surrender to the 
investigating officer to be photographed and fingerprinted, or to return to 
court. However, she did not appear for booking and did not show up in court 
until 5:15 -- after court was closed and far too late, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' lawyer, Barry F. Hammond, blamed his client's tardiness on a 
communications problem. "At the present time, her life is in a state of flux," 
Hammond said. He said that since Sellers last appeared in court a week 
previously, she had moved, had no phone, changed lawyers and her pager broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, Sellers, a sometime actress who posed nude for the 
April, 1986, issue of Playboy, was chumming around with Fleiss, living in 
Fleiss' Benedict Canyon house and hosting at the trendy On the Roxx night club 
on the Sunset Strip. She became a minor celebrity when she accompanied Fleiss 
to her court arraignment last August on charges that Fleiss operated a 
prostitution business that catered to movie moguls and stars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Sellers has been cited for possessing marijuana and a former 
boyfriend tried to shoot her, police said. One of the bodyguards she hired in 
March to protect her has become her new boyfriend, police and prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the single felony charge of receiving stolen property was filed against 
her last month, Sellers was sharing a house in Northridge with the 
bodyguard-boyfriend, Oscar Andres Lopez, 18; another bodyguard, Anthony Zapata, 
20; and child talent agent Don Gibble, 24, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Zapata have been charged with armed robbery, assault with a deadly 
weapon and attempted murder in connection with a string of nine robberies 
across the San Fernando Valley in April. They are being held on $1 million bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibble has been charged with receiving stolen property and conspiracy to 
commit robbery. He is accused of possessing credit cards, a driver's license 
and a wallet taken during the holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is also charged with murdering a Taft High School student who was 
stabbed to death in 1992. That case is being handled in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers was charged when police found some of the stolen gold and gemstone 
necklaces, rings and bracelets in her dresser drawers and under her bed, along 
with police reports describing the robberies, said Detective Jim Gerardi of the 
North Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sellers failed to show up for fingerprinting or appear in court by 5 p.m. 
Tuesday, Luros issued a bench warrant for her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Six deputies spent Wednesday night and early Thursday morning looking for 
Sellers, before she arrived in court with her lawyer at 8 a.m. She was promptly 
taken into custody, although she still was spared the indignity of appearing in 
public in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Luros said that running in wealthy circles does not necessarily make Sellers a 
good bail risk, noting she is a transient who gave the court an outdated 
address, "has worn out her welcome with virtually every friend she has" and 
appears in court "when the mood suits her." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer said Sellers had no access to her parents' money, drives an old car 
and is virtually broke. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerardi said two expensive cars owned by Sellers were used in the 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Hammond called it "an abuse of the court system" to 
jail Sellers, saying she has never been in custody before and is scared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She shouldn't be incarcerated or be held criminally liable simply because she 
has bad taste in friends," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the first time a friend and housemate has gotten Sellers in trouble. 
She was indicted in 1986, along with another boyfriend, Hollywood talent agent 
Reed Wallace, the alleged mastermind of a violent cocaine ring. Federal charges 
against her were dropped when she agreed to testify for the prosecution about 
the ring's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Luros set a bail hearing Tuesday, and scheduled a preliminary hearing the 
following week. Meanwhile, Sellers, who was born in London, is being held at 
the Sybil Brand Institute, the county women's jail.

POLICE SWEEPS OF 'GHOST TOWNS' PROPOSED; CRIME: CITY-INSTALLED BARRICADES ARE 
ALSO CONSIDERED TO KEEP VANDALS AND SQUATTERS OUT OF QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police sweeps of quake-damaged "ghost towns," with workers following to seal 
the structures and bill owners for the costs, is one option under consideration 
by members of a special task force, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual measure, one of several representing a tougher offensive against 
crime and blight brought on by earthquake damage in neighborhoods concentrated 
in the San Fernando Valley, will be discussed at a Los Angeles City Hall 
meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Squatters, vandals and prostitutes have plagued some areas, and city officials 
said Thursday that a program of barricading the buildings could be justified by 
the threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous part is (squatters) build a fire to keep warm and the 
building goes up in flames and the whole neighborhood is in danger," said 
Andres Santamaria, a senior engineer for the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In those areas dubbed ghost towns, nearby residents, merchants and community 
representatives reacted Thursday with alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 For many who feel threatened, the city is not moving fast enough to deal with 
the vacant buildings and the squatters, drug users and others who are spreading 
blight to adjacent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless something is done in Sherman Oaks and other communities, they are 
going to deteriorate quickly," said Richard Close, president of the homeowners 
association in Sherman Oaks, where the city identified one of seven Valley 
ghost towns among a cluster of vacant apartment buildings along Kester Avenue 
and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting levels of graffiti, residential break-ins and homeless people roaming 
through Sherman Oaks have combined to raise the anxiety levels of homeowners, 
Close said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the critical issue is, if 70% of a neighborhood is gone because of 
yellow and red tags (from earthquake damage), how do you keep the other 30% 
from moving out?" Close said. "These people are scared." 
</P>
<P>
 In the area around Natick Avenue, a small Sherman Oaks street east of Kester 
Avenue and south of Camarillo Street, city officials have identified 11 vacant 
condo or apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so depressing," said Joe Glantz, 72, who has lived on the street for 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz pointed to a two-story dwelling with a caved-in roof that sagged 
mercilessly onto what was once the front lawn. "Look at here, they've torn down 
half of the stuff that's collapsed and they haven't taken it away yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Arthur, 45, has other worries. His 15-year-old daughter and her mother 
live at the end of the street. One night a few weeks ago, as Arthur walked the 
dog, a carload full of young men threw eggs at him and yelled as they drove by. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to come in knowing people have left stuff behind," Arthur 
said. "The people left behind are unprotected." 
</P>
<P>
 Tara, Arthur's daughter, looked up and down the quiet street as her father 
retold his story. "It's kind of scary when you look around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, a board member for the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, worries 
about the trespassers who are taking over the vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are crime elements in the buildings, sooner or later they will look 
to prey on neighboring businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northridge along the 17900 block of Schoenborn Street, a byway lined with 
ramshackle buildings across the athletic field from Northridge Middle School, 
Hazel Flagg, 59, said Thursday she is planning to move elsewhere in Northridge 
to get away from another ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagg's apartment building, at the end of the block, is neat and well-kept. 
But all along the rest of the street, the hip-high, wheat-colored grass marks 
the ailing buildings that were abandoned after the quake. Piles of refuse line 
the back alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the feeling of insecurity here," Flagg said. "Even though there was 
crime before, it seems to be greater now. And the way the area looks is a 
disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the options likely to be discussed at the City Hall meeting, officials 
say, are the increased use of police, additional fencing and even private 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the security measures are only intended to protect the buildings on a 
short-term basis until landlords and city housing officials can find funding to 
rebuild and reopen the buildings, most of which are in the hardest hit areas of 
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters' rejection of a $2-billion earthquake repair bond issue earlier this 
month has lead to the cancellation of a state program to loan apartment owners 
money to repair damaged buildings. Local housing officials said that without 
the $576-million program, they feared that many of the city's 20,000 vacant 
apartment units would not be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 On a long-term basis, the city officials are considering establishing 
"recovery areas," similar to redevelopment areas, which use property taxes to 
back bond measures that provide loans to business and apartment owners. A 
report on the proposal is expected by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency is meeting with council members who 
represent the hardest-hit areas to propose boundaries for the recovery areas. 
The areas would include 10 ghost town areas identified by housing officials in 
the Valley and Hollywood as well as commercial shopping districts hard hit by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials believe they can start to attack the problem with $20 
million in discretionary funds from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to be used for loans, fencing, lighting and security. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials believe that will not be enough and an ad-hoc earthquake 
recovery committee instructed its staff to press the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to help pay for security measures, even though FEMA officials 
have indicated that the problem does not qualify for disaster funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just trying to find a short-term fix until we can get some sort of 
commitment either from FEMA or Housing and Urban Development to allow us the 
use of some funds," said Pat Bonino, a chief analyst for the city 
administrative officer's department.

KILLER'S DEATH BRINGS SORROWFUL SAGA TO A CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Evil is never pure. So when Roland Norman Comtois died on Death Row, he was 
buried quietly by his family, who remembered him not as the child killer and 
drug addict he surely was, but as a loving father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the world will remember Comtois, if at all, as the cruel drifter 
who abducted two Chatsworth teen-agers back in 1987, killing one and leaving 
her friend for dead in an abandoned station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Comtois was sentenced to die in the gas chamber for the crimes, but died 
instead in a Marin County hospital bed on May 6 from an infection following 
surgeries for chronic heart and bowel problems. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am kind of relieved that he won't be back out on the streets," said Allen 
Masuhara, father of Wendy Masuhara, who was 14 when Comtois killed her with a 
bullet in the back of the head. "I guess I felt a kind of closure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Masuhara and a 13-year-old friend were walking down a Chatsworth street 
on Sept. 19, 1987, when Comtois and a female accomplice lured them into his 
mobile home, claiming engine trouble. Holding them at gunpoint, Comtois bound 
and gagged the two girls. 
</P>
<P>
 He sexually assaulted the 13-year-old and then injected her with what he said 
was a syringe full of cocaine. He then drove the girls to a remote part of 
Woolsey Canyon and put them in a broken-down station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 With the two friends in the front seat, Comtois slipped in behind them and 
shot Masuhara in the back of the head. She fell dead into her friend's lap. But 
just as Comtois fired on the 13-year-old, she turned her head slightly and 
raised her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The move saved her life: the bullet was deflected off her hand and lodged in 
her neck. Left for dead, the dazed and bleeding girl eventually staggered to 
the road and was spotted by a passing motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified against Comtois at his 1990 trial. 
</P>
<P>
 His accomplice, Marsha Lynn Ramos, was sentenced to life in prison. Comtois 
was condemned to death. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one associated with the trial expected the sentence to be carried out. 
Comtois had lived a hard life that included drugs. And he had been shot by 
police as he tried to escape arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 During his trial, Comtois, a man who looked like a down-and-out Santa Claus 
with a voice like breaking glass, hobbled in and out of the courtroom. In 
prison, he was plagued with health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saved the taxpayers a lot of money," said retired Los Angeles County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold Lynn, who prosecuted the case. "He spent a lifetime 
abusing himself with cocaine and other drugs. Longevity is not in the future 
for that sort of person." 
</P>
<P>
 James Gregory, who defended Comtois and remained in contact with him at San 
Quentin, said the man he fondly called "Ray" was a "very old 65 when he died." 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day I feel sorry for the man," said Gregory, who attended Comtois' 
small family funeral. "I found some good in him. He was very sorry for what 
happened. . . . That man was very dear to me, as funny as that may sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as evil is never pure, tragedy is rarely absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to deal with the loss of a daughter, the Masuharas established a 
scholarship fund at Chatsworth High School -- which Wendy would have attended 
had she lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Four girls have won the scholarship since it was established and some of them 
occasionally write to the Masuharas about what they are doing in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sort of live through the successes of these girls," Allen Masuhara said. 
"We can't bring her back, but at least we can do something. My memories of my 
daughter will always be with me."

 Remember Koko? And that musician guy with the curly hair who was always 
playing on synthesizers? How about the pirouetting around the fountain? 
</P>
<P>
 That was television's "Fame" of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 But today in the '90s, the "Fame" style education is more than just a way to 
see your name in lights -- it's an innovative means of keeping kids off the 
streets by teaching them dance, drama, vocals and behind-the-scenes production. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 25, from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., the Positive Results Corp. and 
American Red Cross in Van Nuys are sponsoring auditions for their "Off the 
Streets" program, which will later be turned into a documentary.  
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters ages 10 through 18 accepted into the program will attend performing 
arts classes Mondays through Fridays from 5:30 p.m. until 9 p.m  
</P>
<P>
 Those auditioning will be expected to discuss why they want to be involved in 
Off the Streets and what they are willing to give back to other children once 
they graduate from the two-month program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the audition, call Nakaze (Nikee) Harris at (818)

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DELAYS SWEETEN TRIUMPH FOR 2,750 GRADUATES

 For most high school students, graduation is a proud occasion, a chance to 
bask in the spotlight and flashbulbs of family and friends and mark the 
successful completion of 12 years of school. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of the 2,750 students graduating this month from Los Angeles 
Unified School District adult schools, the occasion symbolizes a second, third 
or even fourth chance to triumph over hardship and failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed my high school prom and my high school graduation," said Miscelle 
Garlick, 31, who ran away from home and dropped out of Canoga Park High School 
when she was 16 years old. "I knew I couldn't get my prom back, but I knew I 
could get the graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in high heels and a shiny blue cap and gown, with her mother, 
stepfather and two children in the audience, Garlick walked down the aisle at 
Canoga Park High School on Wednesday slowly, careful not to trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the 47 students who received their high school diplomas from the 
El Camino-Canoga Park Community Adult School this week, Garlick occasionally 
choked back tears as she stood before the packed auditorium, flipping her 
tassle across her mortarboard to the clicking of cameras and cheers. She said 
the ceremony marked a giant step forward after years of physical abuse, 
alcoholism and low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles they overcame may have been different, but for many of the high 
school graduates and more than 60 students who received eighth-grade 
certificates at the ceremony, the emotions were undeniably similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me 47 years to walk down this aisle," 64-year-old Lois See, the 
oldest member and president of the Class of 1994, told her classmates. "I made 
it and I'm proud." 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of four and a waitress at a Woodland Hills barbecue restaurant for 25 
years, See dropped out of Hamilton High School in Los Angeles during her senior 
year because she was pregnant with her first child. Nearly two years ago, after 
severe periods of depression, she decided to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt bad that I didn't get my high school diploma," See said. "I 
didn't think I could do it." SUSAN BYRNES

 They are an unlikely pair -- an 8-year-old African-American boy with cerebral 
palsy and a 68-year-old white woman who wants to be his legal mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has raised the boy since just after his birth and they are close. 
</P>
<P>
 And, now, one of the things that brings Robbie Wasdon and Anita Boyance 
closest together has been taken from them -- Boyance's 1985 bronze Toyota 
minivan. 
</P>
<P>
 The van was stolen Wednesday in front of Boyance's Reseda apartment complex in 
the 19300 block of Wyandotte Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need that van," said Boyance, Wasdon's legal guardian. "Because if 
he doesn't have this vehicle, he really can't go anyplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for Robbie almost since he was born addicted to drugs, Boyance bought 
the van a year ago to help the boy get to school, doctor appointments and 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 A widow living on Social Security, she lived with relatives for seven months 
and sold some of her antiques to scrounge up $6,500 for the van. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the van, which was uninsured, Boyance fears that Robbie's condition 
will force him to stay shut inside their apartment for the summer. Born with 
respiratory problems, the boy is unable to venture outside an air-conditioned 
or smog-free environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves being outdoors and we have to go pretty far to get clean air," said 
Boyance, who has no other form of transportation. "I could take him to the 
beach, where he loves the sea air. And it (the van) had air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyance also fears the loss of the van will hamper them financially. Moving 
twice since the Northridge earthquake, she has drained her savings and relied 
on the van to sell collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has not lost hope. Robbie, she said, has taught her to have faith. The 
two met three weeks after his birth through one of Boyance's eight children, a 
foster mother. Boyance fell in love immediately with Wasdon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched him go through withdrawals," Boyance recalled. "His father was out 
of the picture. His mother was out of the picture. He couldn't eat and couldn't 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming Wasdon's legal guardian near his fourth birthday, Boyance feels 
lucky to be caring for him. "He's such a joy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest joy she could receive right now, she said, is to have the 
thieves return her van, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please return it," Boyance said. "We need it so bad." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; 2 MEN SUSPECTED IN SERIES OF MUGGINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two young men, described as being clean-cut and in their 20s, are suspected of 
being involved in a series of muggings in the last two weeks in the Tarzana 
area, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported that the two men carried a .45-caliber handgun and drove a 
pale yellow Cadillac, said Senior Lead Officer Ken Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest in the series of three muggings occurred Thursday morning in the 
4800 block of Brewster Avenue, where a female real estate agent was waiting for 
her clients outside a house. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred in the 4000 block of Reseda Boulevard, when the suspects 
allegedly stole a woman's purse containing more than $3,000. The second took 
place last Friday about 4 p.m. and involved a female county prosecutor who was 
jogging near Braemar Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox suggested that residents refrain from jogging or walking alone until the 
suspects are arrested. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MAN HELD IN SLAYING OF EX-ROOMMATE

<P>
 A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of shooting to death a former 
roommate as he waited for a ride to work, Burbank police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Andrade Rodriguez, 22, of North Hollywood told police that he shot his 
former roommate Wednesday morning and led detectives to the stolen .45-caliber 
pistol used in the killing, Sgt. Scott Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been booked on suspicion of murder and is being held without bail at 
the Los Angeles County Jail. Arraignment for Rodriguez is set today in Burbank 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and the victim, Carlos Alfredo Aguilar, 32, of Sun Valley had an 
ongoing dispute that police said centered on a broken relationship. Rodriguez 
apparently thought that his girlfriend broke up with him after being encouraged 
do so by Aguilar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing record checks and located a threatening phone call report where 
the ex-girlfriend said he (Rodriguez) made threatening phone calls," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, police said, Aguilar intervened between the couple and warned 
Rodriguez to stop making threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men and their girlfriends lived together for awhile in the 1700 block 
of Grismer Avenue, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, Aguilar returned to his old neighborhood to catch a ride to 
work with two co-workers from Lavi Industries in Valencia, where he was a metal 
polisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar was having car problems recently and did not trust the vehicle to make 
the commute, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez pulled up to Aguilar's car, exchanged a few words with him, then 
shot Aguilar once in the upper torso, police said. Aguilar died soon afterward.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROPOSED LABORER BAN AWAITS ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale city attorney's office is preparing to submit an ordinance 
banning curbside job solicitation in the city to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Scott Howard said he will not present the ordinance for council 
review until after civil rights groups decide whether they will appeal a recent 
court decision upholding a similar law. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appellate court in April upheld an Agoura Hills measure that prohibits 
day laborers from soliciting work from passing motorists. The American Civil 
Liberties Union has said it may appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said how he advises the council to proceed on the issue will depend on 
whether the ACLU files an appeal. It's important that the city have the Agoura 
Hills law to lean on in case civil rights groups decide to legally challenge 
any similar law Glendale might enact, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a law similar to Agoura 
Hills' last month, criminalizing curbside job solicitation in unincorporated 
areas of the county. The ordinance, scheduled to go into effect in July, makes 
curbside job-seeking a misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail and/or a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU attorney Robin Toma said such laws stomp on the constitutional rights of 
day laborers -- a majority of whom are Latino males. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale council members asked the city attorney to draft the ordinance after 
complaints from business owners on San Fernando Road near a Home Depot store 
escalated. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 125 day laborers crowd streets around the store. Some urinate in 
bushes planted near public sidewalks, while others litter and run out into the 
street looking for work, business owners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance is based on safety issues and health concerns 
surrounding day laborers, Howard said. It is unsafe for the laborers to run 
into the street to solicit work and for motorists traveling down San Fernando 
Road, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would prohibit people from soliciting work or goods from public 
sidewalks, streets, driveways and parking lots throughout the city during 
particular times of the day. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 The state's third-largest loan-servicing firm will move its headquarters to 
Glendale late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial Thrift & Loan Assn. will leave its Burbank location in August to move 
into the 17,265-square-foot sixth floor of an office building at 700 N. Central 
Ave. in Glendale's central business district. 
</P>
<P>
 A savings branch operated by the thrift will also occupy 6,257 square feet of 
the eight-story building's ground floor.  
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old firm's lease at its new location begins Sept. 1. The company 
-- which reported assets of $500 million in May -- leased the site for $7 
million over a 12-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm decided to move to Glendale from its location at 300 E. Magnolia 
Blvd. because it plans to expand its operations by one-third, said Gary Brent, 
senior vice president of savings and administrative services. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 Warner Bros. unveiled a glossy 150,000-square-foot office building Thursday 
that will house between 400 and 500 employees of several divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triangle Building, at Olive and Pass avenues in Burbank, will contain such 
departments as consumer products, domestic television distribution, domestic 
television marketing and advertising, and international television and 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank city officials and Warner Bros. Chairmen Robert A. Daly and Terry 
Semel appeared at a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday for the Spanish 
colonial-style building, which will house divisions moving from the Warner 
Bros. lot and the Tower Office Center at 3900 W. Alameda Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the walls of the five-story, pink-and-green edifice are large billboards 
of the Warner Bros. movies "Maverick" and "Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees are starting to move in and should be finished by July 1, said Dan 
Garcia, company vice president of real estate and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought was that our company was growing and absorbing a significant 
amount of leasehold space," Garcia said. "We owned the property (at Olive and 
Pass) and thought it was appropriate to develop this corner of our property." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia declined to reveal how much the multimillion-dollar project cost.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; AIRPORT, RESIDENTS AT IMPASSE OVER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Studio City residents found themselves at an impasse this week when they 
invited a Burbank Airport official to their residents association meeting to 
discuss concerns about aircraft noise over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to believe that the airport authority could work with the 
community and at the present time is choosing not to do so," said Scott 
Lorimer, secretary of the Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Tom Greer, the airport's executive director, called the Tuesday 
night meeting "one of the more difficult meetings I've been to." 
</P>
<P>
 "People were cordial, at least the moderator was, but I had a distinct feeling 
that whatever information they had already been told was beyond repudiation," 
Greer said. "And they were not interested in hearing the facts as I presented 
them because they just didn't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring homeowners associations have been battling both Burbank and Van 
Nuys airports for years over the issue of aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Studio City association joined the Encino and Valley 
Village residents associations in distributing thousands of flyers encouraging 
people to lodge complaints with the airports when they are disturbed by 
aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living south of Burbank Airport want the airport to have more planes 
take off in an easterly direction from the airport's east-west runway. 
Presently, most airplanes take off in a southerly direction from the airport's 
north-south runway. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Greer said the airport authority can do little about aircraft 
noise because pilots are authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to 
use the runways in whatever manner they see fit. Air traffic controllers can 
only deny clearance or delay an aircraft because of other air traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official, pilots tend to favor the southerly takeoff because 
the north-south runway is 1,000 feet longer than the east-west runway, the 
north-south strip aids acceleration because it slopes downward, and FAA 
restrictions prohibit large commercial airliners from using the east-west 
runway because of the proximity of the airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorimer countered that smaller aircraft could use the east-west runway 
safely, and that the airport could encourage them to use that strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support (the airport's) need to expand," Lorimer said. "We just want to 
find some sort of solution that will help alleviate some of the noise that 
comes directly over residential areas to the south and to get the airport to 
come up with a policy that will help share noise with surrounding communities."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; BUSINESS GROUP GETS PEP TALK ON RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Innovative thinking and self-responsibility are the key to rebuilding Sherman 
Oaks, a motivational speaker told a business group Thursday during a Greater 
Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shapiro, a Beverly Hills-based management consultant, tossed out ideas 
including re-creating Sherman Oaks through rezoning, making the town a mecca 
for small professional businesses and creating public-private revitalization 
programs.  
</P>
<P>
 The speaker also offered more traditional ideas such as tapping little-known 
federal funding programs and trying to bring new growth industries into town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become accustomed to asking, 'When are they going to help us out?' 
'They' meaning the government, other chamber members or our customers," Shapiro 
said. "We have gotten to the point where 'they' have become us. There is no 
cavalry that comes in and saves us. You get on those horses and lasso in the 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, who is widely known as a motivational speaker, said that he does not 
mean for business leaders to take his ideas as prescriptions, but rather as 
potential solutions to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant held out as an example Community Build, a private recovery 
effort created by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) to bring economic and 
human development projects into South Central Los Angeles after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waters said that she would like (President) Clinton to write a $15-billion 
check to help the community, but she knew he is never going to write that 
check," Shapiro said. "Instead, she created new concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro tailored his speech for his audience at Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio 
City -- something that he said he tries to do with all of his speeches.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, he suggested inviting government agencies to locate their offices 
in Sherman Oaks as a means of revitalization. But in a nod to the area's recent 
successful efforts to get a parole office relocated out of Sherman Oaks, he 
said that the community had to decide which uses were appropriate.  
</P>
<P>
 The motivational speaker said he waived his usual fee -- $2,500 to $10,000 -- 
to contribute to the renewal of the hard-hit community.  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro's comments appeared to be well-received. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to talk to people about self-responsibility -- that's lacking 
in most people I know," said Stephen W. Smith, an office-equipment salesman for 
the Minolta Corp. "For me, it reinforces the need to go after the things you 
want, rather than waiting for it to come to you. You can't hear that enough."

BURBANK ORDERS SEISMIC TESTS FOR MAIN TERMINAL AT AIRPORT; SAFETY: A STRUCTURAL 
ANALYSIS IS PLANNED TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAW. BUT THE BUILDING IS ALREADY SET 
FOR DEMOLITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Airport must comply with local seismic-safety law and conduct a 
structural analysis of its main terminal, despite assurances that it will tear 
down the building for a new facility in the near future, building officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the airport declined to carry out the detailed engineering analysis 
required by a Burbank city ordinance, saying the terminal "is probably 
substantially in compliance already" with earthquake building codes. A thorough 
study would be a "needless expenditure of public funds" for a structure slated 
for demolition soon, airport officials said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Cheng of the city building division said Thursday that the airport 
must heed the ordinance and examine the terminal, which escaped damage in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng said his office would work cooperatively with airport staff to complete 
an analysis within 30 to 60 days and then take the next step -- either 
retrofitting or demolition -- as promptly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said they are awaiting formal communication from the city 
before deciding what to do. Spokesman Victor J. Gill stressed that the 
airport's own studies in past years have found the main building, Terminal A, 
to be safe because of constant modifications and strengthening measures since 
it opened in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "You literally have backup system after backup system in terms of lateral 
reinforcement," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unreinforced masonry covered by the 1990 ordinance involves only a few 
brick columns, which survived intact in the January temblor, he said. Only 
Terminal B and the parking structure suffered about $350,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The main terminal is among a handful of sites not in conformity with the 
ordinance, which mandates analyses and corrections for unreinforced masonry 
structures built before 1933 -- about 40 to 50 buildings in all, Cheng said. 
Owners of buildings not in compliance, including Burbank Airport, should 
receive reminder letters next week, Cheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city first notified the airport of the statute in March, 1991. 
Retrofitting or demolition of the terminal was to be completed by March, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written reply, airport director Thomas E. Greer informed building 
officials that the facility was already scheduled to be torn down to make way 
for a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given our announced plans to demolish the current terminal we feel it is 
inappropriate to incur any costs on (analyzing) this facility," Greer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng said the promise of demolition and an inspection by the city satisfied 
his office at the time that there was no need for the airport to mount the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We inspected the building. The masonry portion is a small portion, and we 
found it was pretty strong at that point," Cheng said. "That's why we did not 
follow through at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 However, delays in constructing the new 670,000-square-foot terminal have 
pushed back demolition of the current building. Plans call for the new facility 
to open in 1998, but that now seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is to be a delay in demolition, the airport should therefore go ahead 
and conduct a structural analysis, Cheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gill estimated that a retrofit program, which would entail bolting the columns 
to the roof and floor, would cost millions of dollars -- an unnecessary expense 
given the improved strength of the building over the years and its performance 
during the Northridge shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Garcin, president of the airport commission, said he would approve 
retrofitting if it is the only option besides premature demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have withstood some pretty major quakes," he said. "I would retrofit but 
would be grumbling all the way to the architect's office and the city to 
dispute it. I wouldn't do it willingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the airport served about 4 million passengers, about 11,000 a day.

 A judge assigned to the case of three teen-agers charged with a shooting near 
Westlake High School already has made up his mind that the defendants are 
guilty, an attorney charged Thursday, causing a preliminary hearing to be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John E. Meyers filed papers in court that accused acting 
Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III of bias toward the three defendants and 
asked that someone else be appointed to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's prejudiced, he's biased, he's unfair," Meyers said outside court. "He's 
probably one of the worst judges I have seen on the bench in a long while." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis declined Thursday to respond to Meyers' accusations.  
</P>
<P>
 The allegations came as Curtis was about to hear testimony on whether the 
defendants should stand trial for a Feb. 4 melee at North Ranch Park in 
Thousand Oaks. Two Westlake High football players were shot in the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 In late April, Curtis listened during a two-day hearing as police officers 
described how they came to arrest defendants William Huang, John Yi and 
Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet in the high-profile case. Meyers represents 
Huang. 
</P>
<P>
 After the officers' testimony, Curtis ordered each of the 16-year-olds to be 
tried as adults. Among other reasons, he cited the seriousness and the 
sophistication of the crime in which they are charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said Curtis demonstrated his bias against the defendants during the 
hearing in which he ordered them to into adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 During that juvenile court hearing, according to Meyers, Curtis described the 
defendants' alleged conduct as "reprehensible." The judge also set bail at 
$50,000 for each of the boys, an amount that Meyers and other defense attorneys 
believed to be excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 And Curtis was abrupt with defense attorneys during a conference in his 
chambers, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's arrogant, he's harsh and seems to be unfair in his rulings," the 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson set a June 27 hearing to 
decide the bias issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to disqualify Curtis from the case on grounds that he has 
demonstrated a bias against the defendants is rare, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not the first unusual development in the case: One of the alleged 
masterminds behind the brawl -- James Lee, 16, of Thousand Oaks -- has been a 
fugitive since April 27, when he failed to appear for arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl began after Westlake High football player Curtis Simmons and Lee 
agreed to meet at North Ranch Park for a fistfight to settle a mutual dislike 
for one another, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons showed up at the park with dozens of backers, including many of his 
teammates, investigators said. Lee arrived at the park with five carloads of 
Asian youths, including the other three defendants, investigators have 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's supporters emerged from their vehicles, announcing: "We're the Asian 
Mafia," and then attacked Simmons and others with baseball bats, sticks and 
gunfire, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities fear Lee has fled to his homeland of Taiwan. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John A. Vanarelli refused comment Thursday on Lee's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the other three defendants wound up in Curtis' courtroom Thursday 
after Meyers used a legal challenge to disqualify Acting Superior Court Judge 
Bruce A. Clark from hearing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clark and Curtis are Municipal Court judges who have been assigned to the 
more prestigious Superior Court bench to help out with a burgeoning caseload, 
court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said he would prefer to appear before a judge elected or appointed to 
the Superior Court instead of one who is only filling in temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sonethanouphet of Brea in Orange County and Huang of Rowland 
Heights in Los Angeles County remained in juvenile hall in lieu of their bails 
of $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi of Thousand Oaks is free on the same bail amount pending trial.

MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC TO OPEN IN WEST VALLEY; HEALTH: COUNTY WILL CLOSE VAN NUYS 
OFFICE TO PAY FOR NEW CANOGA PARK CENTER, WHICH WILL RIGHT A GEOGRAPHICAL 
IMBALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in five years, residents of the west San Fernando Valley 
will not have to travel across town to get free or low-cost mental health 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is opening an outpatient mental health clinic in Canoga 
Park in July, helping right a geographical imbalance that occurred in 1989 when 
the cash-strapped county closed six clinics, including the only one west of 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the new clinic, the county will shut down one of five mental health 
centers in the east Valley, at 8101 Sepulveda Blvd. in Van Nuys, and move the 
staff to the West Valley site. Four other mental health centers in the East 
Valley -- in Van Nuys, North Hollywood, San Fernando and Lake View Terrace -- 
will remain open after the county launches the clinic at 7621 Canoga Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service delivery in the Valley has been extremely lopsided until now," said 
Glenn Cotham, president of the Van Nuys chapter of the Alliance for the 
Mentally Ill, a private nonprofit advocacy group. "We're very elated. This is 
just what we want."  
</P>
<P>
 "The move is really good for clients," said Judy Cooperberg, a spokeswoman for 
the Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County, another private nonprofit 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials tried two years ago to open a clinic in the West Valley near 
a church, but dropped the plan following strong opposition from Reseda 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Little neighborhood opposition has arisen to the current plan, county 
officials said, but they acknowledged that the decision is not widely known. 
The Canoga Park neighborhood is largely industrial and commercial, although 
there is an apartment building behind the clinic, separated by a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the apartment building inquired about the clinic several months 
ago, but their concerns were allayed after meeting with county officials, said 
Kathleen Snook, chief deputy director of the county Mental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people a day are expected to visit the clinic for treatment of 
depression, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, said Dr. Ron Klein, 
director of the soon-to-close Van Nuys clinic. The West Valley clinic will be 
open Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who also will head the new clinic, said neighbors have nothing to fear 
from the center's clients. For instance, no drug addicts will be treated there, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had not one complaint about our staff or clients in the 10 years I've 
been here in Van Nuys," Klein said. "We're not seeing a terribly violent 
population." 
</P>
<P>
 The move is opposed by the landlord of the Van Nuys clinic, who has offered 
the county a discount to remain where it is. Eli Landman, co-owner of the 
Sepulveda Boulevard building, has offered to reduce the rent by $8,200, to 
$19,500 a month -- the same rate the county is to pay for the smaller Canoga 
Park facility. Landman has also offered to repair the plumbing and make other 
improvements to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials said they will stick with the Canoga Park site because it 
is a newer building in a better location.

MASKED GUNMEN HOLD UP BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four men -- three of them armed and wearing nylon stocking masks -- held up a 
Bank of America branch in a takeover robbery that took less than one minute to 
complete, federal authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bandit walked into Bank of America in the 8400 block of Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, on the pretense of opening a 
checking account, said John Hoos, a spokesman for the FBI's Los Angeles bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bandit followed him into the bank and both of them jumped over the 
counter, as two more accomplices entered from behind to watch the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two men behind the bank counter ordered employees onto the floor, 
and another man holding a large handgun shouted orders to employees and 
patrons, Hoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth man urged the men behind the counter to "hurry up" with the 
robbery, Hoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they were in and out in less than a minute," Hoos said. "These types 
of robberies go down very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were described as being in their late teens to mid-20s, Hoos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The holdup was the 284th bank robbery this year in the seven-county region 
covered by the Los Angeles FBI office. Nearly a third of them have been 
takeover robberies, Hoos said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STRUGGLING HEALTH CLINIC GETS MORE FEDERAL 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 A public medical clinic struggling to cover expenses has received an 
additional $50,000 in federal funds to continue serving low- and 
moderate-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Samuel Dixon Family Health Care Center, which marked its first anniversary 
at its San Martinez Road site Thursday, was awarded the Community Development 
Block grant earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was issued by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which 
allocates the Community Development Block funds in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is a relatively small one in the medical field, but because the 
center has a total annual budget of only about $300,000, it is expected to have 
a sizable impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the only community-based clinic in the Santa Clarita Valley reaching 
people without insurance," said Peggy Freeman, executive director for the 
center. "Without the Community Development Block grant, we would not be able to 
provide health care for the valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The center offers general medical care, pediatrics, women's care, mental 
health and health education services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bare bones over here at this little clinic, but what we do in terms of 
medical service is phenomenal," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds were the second federal block grant the center has received this 
fiscal year, for a total of $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional funds reflect the center's growing workload. Some 3,134 patient 
visits were recorded in 1993, up from 2,313 in 1992 and only 835 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing number of visits helped spur the move from its earlier location, 
in a rented community room adjacent to a church, to a new site across from Val 
Verde Park.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; METROLINK OFFERING FREE RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two free round trips will be offered to Metrolink riders on the revamped Santa 
Clarita line beginning Monday to promote improvements made along the 78-mile 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip from Lancaster to Los Angeles is expected to take 1 hour 51 minutes 
when the new line opens Monday, according to a Metrolink statement.That's about 
25% faster than when the service began after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is mailing coupons good for the free rides to more than 180,000 
residents in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. The coupons can be 
redeemed with Metrolink employees who will be at stations along the line before 
noon Monday through June 24. The free trips must be taken by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who do not receive the coupon in the mail may obtain one through 
Metrolink employees at the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 All trips include a free transfer to connecting transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink extended the line from Santa Clarita to the Antelope Valley to 
provide emergency service after the Jan. 17 earthquake by using an older rail 
route containing numerous curves that slowed the trains. A $50-million Federal 
Emergency Management Agency grant allowed Metrolink to build straighter tracks 
using more modern materials. 
</P>

371-LINK.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FUNDING NEAR FOR EAST NEWHALL SHERIFF'S 
STATION; BUDGET: THE CITY COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS $148,000 FOR A SUBSTATION. 
FINAL APPROVAL IS EXPECTED JUNE 28. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 East Newhall residents, who have long complained about increasing crime and 
the scarcity of police services in their area, will probably get a sheriff's 
substation soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved funding for the station, which will 
handle smaller incidents and coordinate local community policing efforts, said 
Michael Quinn, captain of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last couple of years we have been told that the people in the east 
Newhall area feel that they need more attention," he said. "We have seen a rise 
in peddlers in the area, some gang activity (and) some drug activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents there don't have cars, making it difficult to get to the main 
sheriff's station about four miles away, Quinn said. Access to Spanish-speaking 
personnel has also been a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council allocated $148,000 to fund the salary and benefits for a 
deputy at the station, plus patrol car costs, record-keeping and supplies. The 
funding is contained in a draft of the city's 1994-1995 budget approved 
Tuesday. The budget is scheduled to receive final approval June 28, and 
officials say it's unlikely that revisions will be made to the law enforcement 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Martin, owner of an auto parts store for the past 25 years in what is now 
a deteriorating business district, said many residents are afraid to go outside 
at night in east Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he said, a gang of youths smashed windows and burglarized stores for 
months in the area before sheriff's officials finally arrested them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would have been no such thing 10 years ago," Martin said. "And (the 
youths) are all local people. At least the names I heard are local people." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said sheriff's patrol cars in the neighborhood respond quickly to 
emergencies such as burglar alarms, but "the radio cars aren't the same as 
someone you can stand on the street corner and talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 A bilingual staff of one deputy, a community service officer and a handful of 
volunteers would be assigned to the substation if funding is approved, Quinn 
said. It would probably be open five days a week, including at least one 
weekend day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community service officer and the volunteers would work in the station, 
and the deputy would use that as a base," he said. The deputy would, he 
continued, "hopefully spend most of his time doing Neighborhood Watch, business 
patrols (and) minor investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also allows for adding another deputy to the current four-member 
Career Offenders Burglary Robbery Apprehension (COBRA) team, which investigates 
gang crimes in all parts of the city. Sgt. Lee White, head of the COBRA team, 
said this would allow him to put anti-gang deputies on the street two nights a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, I haven't had them out there probably more than an average of once or 
twice a month," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is trying to lease an abandoned furniture store near the intersection 
of Lyons Avenue and San Fernando Road for the substation. The building would 
eventually also house a community center, featuring such youth activities as a 
boxing program, a Head Start program and the Santa Clarita Valley Boys & Girls 
Club, said City Manager George Caravalho. 
</P>
<P>
 He said if the furniture store is leased, the substation could open within 30 
to 60 days. The building would then undergo further renovations for the 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Caravalho said if the city is not successful in obtaining the furniture store, 
the opening of the substation and community center could be delayed for several 
months.

DAVIS SPEAKS HIS MIND AFTER SPARKING ANGELS; BASEBALL: HE HITS TWO HOME RUNS IN 
A 6-5 VICTORY OVER THE WHITE SOX BEFORE BLASTING MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Chili Davis quietly has been seething, trying to control his frustrations, but 
Thursday night after the Angels' 6-5, 10-inning victory over the Chicago White 
Sox, he decided it was time to let everyone know what was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can say what they want, but what we're doing right now is rebuilding 
and trying to save money," he said. "I know it'll upset some people, but that's 
a fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miracles happen, things happen, guys bond together, but you've got to be 
realistic. We're a couple of hitters and pitchers away. We're probably going to 
have to sacrifice this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pretend to know what's going on upstairs, but strange things have 
happened in the past. I've seen guys leave here that I never thought would 
leave here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given away more talent than we've gotten back." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who hit two home runs Thursday, including the game-winner in the 10th 
against Kirk McCaskill, has been so frustrated in recent days that he says he 
contemplated retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a quitter," Davis said, "but Ryno (Ryne Sandberg) had me wondering. 
There's been a lot of things going on that I don't agree with, and I was 
wondering. I was down, not suicidal down, but I was getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what might happen if we strike, I might not come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who is having perhaps the finest season of his career, batting .339 
with 13 homers and 49 runs batted in, conceded that his frustration peaked when 
the Angels traded Dwight Smith on Tuesday to the Baltimore Orioles for a minor 
league prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 He perceived the trade simply to trim Smith's $700,000 salary from the 
payroll, particularly since the Angels didn't obtain a player in return who 
will help them in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was probably the best pinch-hitter we had," said Davis, bidding for his 
first All-Star selection since 1988. "I hated to see him go, especially when we 
didn't get anything that's going to help us the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Said shortstop Gary DiSarcina: "Who knows what the real reason was for us to 
get rid of him. I know Jim Edmonds flat-out won the job, but I thought (Smith) 
was a great asset for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (28-39), who have won only five of their last 18 games, still are 
only 4 1/2 games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers in the American 
League West. Certainly, with no one even playing at .500, the division race is 
wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Davis says, it was a similar situation last year when the Angels were 
only two games out of first place at the All-Star break with a 43-43 record. 
The Angels failed to make an acquisition, and two weeks later, they were out of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing well last year," he said. "We didn't make that move, and look 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to win so badly, particularly the Langstons and the Finleys. 
I've had my opportunity to be on a World Series team, and those guys are so 
eager to be on a winning ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, you can't buy a brand-new Mercedes for $5,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel management vehemently denies that the club simply is satisfied with 
another rebuilding year. General Manager Bill Bavasi said the other day that 
the Smith trade was no reflection of a change of sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the case at all," Bavasi said. "Absolutely not. Are the players 
reading into it that way? I don't know, I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, considering the plight of the AL West, it may indeed be possible to 
rebuild and win the division at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching of reliever Joe Grahe helped the Angels beat the White Sox. The 
Angels scored two runs in the eighth inning to tie the score, and Grahe pitched 
the final 2 2/3 innings for his first victory.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; GOAL IS TO GAIN FOOTHOLD HERE; VIEWPOINT: 
INTEREST IN SOCCER DEPENDS ON WHETHER AMERICAN SPORTS FANS CAN BE WEANED FROM 
THEIR OBSESSION WITH STATISTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The world's most popular sport is holding its world championship in one of the 
world's most sports-mad nations -- which, unfortunately, has not cared much for 
the sport in the past. By the time the champion is decided, 52 games will have 
been played, watched by nearly 4 million spectators in nine cities and by 
billions on television. The final alone will draw a television audience of 2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this guarantees what some fans hope for: that soccer will join the 
list of national American sports. Whether it does depends on many factors, 
primarily whether soccer can overcome its defensive orientation and whether 
American audiences can be brought to like a game not susceptible to statistical 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, purists claim to relish 1-0 games; for non-purists, they tend to 
be boring. In soccer, few Americans are purists, yet low-scoring games have 
multiplied. The massed defenses, the offside rule, the emphasis on avoiding a 
loss at all costs have made high-scoring games (say, more than three goals a 
game) increasingly rare, and even three-goal games are infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last World Cup, the Irish team that reached the quarterfinals by 
scoring only two goals is an extreme example of this style. FIFA's rules 
changes -- granting an additional point for victories, not permitting the 
goalkeeper to handle the ball if it is passed back to him by his own side, and 
ejecting players who trip an opponent breaking clear -- have not been in effect 
long enough to permit a conclusive judgment. They have surely opened up the 
game; whether they lead to more goals will be tested during the championship 
which, at least after the group of 16 is reached, will pit quite evenly matched 
teams against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 More scoring certainly will help the American spectator. But the question 
remains whether he can be weaned from the obsession with statistics. The major 
American sports involve a series of discrete plays that in turn can be broken 
into their components and given a statistic. Though the three hours of a 
typical baseball game rarely have more than 30 minutes of real action, the 
spectators are kept busy working out batting, fielding and earned-run averages, 
to name a few. Similarly, in football, which has twice as much action as 
baseball, spectators can concentrate on pass completions, sacks, tackles and a 
bewildering variety of different set plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, with its marvelous fluidity and its ever-changing patterns, must be 
enjoyed for its crescendos, not its segments. We hope the television broadcasts 
show some of this rather than concentrate only on the man with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the American spectator will see a rich smorgasbord of styles and 
tactical concepts. The European teams whose players are drawn from very 
competitive national leagues represent the school of hard knocks. They play on 
the whole a tough defensive game with priority given to thwarting the opponent. 
The Germans try to overcome the defensive walls by total football, with all 
players except the goalie going on offense -- or on defense if required. With 
this style, Germany has reached the finals in four of the last five World Cups. 
It could do so again, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth, lacks 
effective strikers (it had to call one back from semi-retirement) and, in the 
games Kissinger saw, looked steady rather than brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, champion with a marvelous team in 1982 and just as defensive, plays a 
more intricate game -- partly because its players rarely can be induced to 
undergo the regimen of the Germans. They relate their play to time and try to 
wreck their opponent's style. Favoring short passes, they can be beautiful to 
watch when they are on and maddening when they lose interest. A young team, it 
could go far or flame out early. 
</P>
<P>
 Another traditional powerhouse is the Netherlands, which had been improving 
from game to game. But it has lost Ruud Gullit, at one time the world's best 
footballer, who walked off the team in a dispute with the coach. His absence 
might well damage the team's beautiful if somewhat stereotyped passing game and 
could ruin the chances for the Dutch.  
</P>
<P>
 Europe has supplied an unprecedented number of teams that rarely reach the 
final Cup competition. Norway has not been in a World Cup since 1938. Its 
mixture of amateurs and professionals has to substitute a tough defense for the 
skills of the full-time pros. But it has beaten good teams and recently tied 
England on its home ground, which is not easy. It still would be amazing if it 
could go beyond the round of 16. Switzerland might not reach even that. Ireland 
will go as far as its rugged defense will take it, which should not be beyond 
the quarterfinals. That it is tough was shown by its recent defeat of Germany 
in Hanover -- the first Irish defeat of Germany since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin American teams emerge from a less-brutal competition in their native 
leagues. They are therefore more prone to take chances. This makes them more 
fun to watch but also causes them to be much more vulnerable to counterattacks. 
Of these, Brazil is always the most fun. Its acrobatic players, its 
good-natured fans with their samba drums turn games into riotous fiestas. Alas, 
in all recent World Cups, Brazil was vanquished by sudden thrusts from an 
outplayed opponent. Nothing would popularize American soccer more than a 
Brazilian victory in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina has been in the finals of three of the last four World Cups and won 
twice. Its style is less playful than Brazil's but more deadly. It prefers the 
open Latin American style but is capable of playing a ruthless, brutal defense. 
It was a deadly defense and an otherwise mediocre goalkeeper who was a genius 
in penalty shootouts that got Argentina to the final last time. But it is to be 
hoped that we see the Argentina of 1978 and 1986, not the Argentina of 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 The sleeper team of South America is Colombia. Kissinger saw it, on 
television, beat Argentina, 5-0, in the qualification round. The offensive 
wizardry of the Colombians was astounding. If they can play at this tempo twice 
a week, they could go at least to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The last South American team is Bolivia. It qualified by dominating its 
opponents on its home ground of La Paz, which has an altitude of 12,000 feet. 
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the World Cup will be played at sea level. 
</P>
<P>
 Without doubt, the teams that will be most fun to watch together with the 
Brazilians are the two African teams, Nigeria and Cameroon. In 1990, Cameroon 
was within a hair of beating England with its free-wheeling style. We were 
looking forward to Cameroon's impact on the methodical Germans in the semifinal 
match. Alas, it lost concentration, was tied near the end and lost in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't seen Nigeria, South Korea, Morocco and Saudi Arabia even on TV. We 
will comment as the Cup progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the United States. In the Cup without having to qualify because it is 
the host country, the United States has some strong players and an experienced 
though enigmatic coach in Bora Milutinovic. But it does not have any players of 
the very first rank and it lacks, fatally, we are afraid, the underpinnings of 
a professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless the United States looked steady when it beat Mexico, 1-0, in its 
last tuneup before the Cup. Its nicely set up goal was a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the 91,123 spectators in the Rose Bowl were passionate fans of 
Mexico. Their dejection was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 No host nation of the World Cup has failed to make it into the second round. 
It will be an achievement to be proud of if the United States does.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SOCCER LAUNCHES CRUSADE IN AMERICA;

 Soccer is not war, but it was the catalyst for one. Soccer is not life and 
death, but some distraught fans have tragically failed to make the distinction. 
Soccer might not even be worth missing dinner for, but tell that to a waiter in 
a Latin American or European restaurant who should be serving it instead of 
camping in front of the television in the kitchen to watch a game in the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Never heard of it? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Harris and Gallup polls, almost seven of every 10 persons in the 
United States pleaded ignorance when asked their opinion as recently as last 
month of the world's most popular sporting event, and some of those who had 
heard of it probably thought it had something to do with sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sport's missionaries are here to enlighten us, bringing the World Cup 
tournament to nine of the country's largest metropolitan areas in their most 
determined effort yet to claim another dark continent in the name of soccer. To 
further their cause, they have brought along some most appealing foot soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts today in two cities. In the opener, defending champion Germany meets 
Bolivia at Chicago's Soldier Field, followed shortly thereafter by a game 
between Spain and South Korea at Dallas' Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly traditional rivals, these four countries have virtually nothing in 
common except their zeal for soccer, a passion shared by so much of the Earth's 
population that Welsh author Pete Davies refers to it as "Planet Football." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the 31-day, 52-game, 24-team tournament has concluded, estimates 
are that a composite television audience of 32 billion will have followed the 
bouncing ball. Two billion people -- more than one in every three of the 5.6 
billion people in the world -- are expected to watch the championship game at 
the Rose Bowl on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the fuss? 
</P>
<P>
 If soccer is the simplest game, as it was described when the first formal 
rules were established in 1863 in England, why is it so dadgum difficult to 
score? And considering there is so little scoring, why does the game set the 
hearts of so many people to racing? 
</P>
<P>
 Putting "Planet Football" on the couch, perhaps a psychologist would conclude 
that the answer to the first question would lead to an answer to the other, 
that people form an almost symbiotic relationship with the sport's participants 
because it is such a challenge for them to achieve a goal. Like life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, perhaps people like the sport because they grew up watching it 
while sitting on the knees of their grandfathers and fathers, know its history 
and its heroes, understand not only the rules but the nuances and find it an 
exciting escape from life's challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, fans in at least 190 countries spend countless hours 
during seemingly endless soccer seasons watching their favorite professional 
teams. But no games are as compelling as those played every four years in the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 For this World Cup, the 15th since the tournament originated in 1930, 141 
countries selected "Dream Teams" from among their best players for regional 
qualifications that began with a 2-1 victory by Puerto Rico over the Dominican 
Republic on March 21, 1992. Some 491 games later, the final 24 -- including 
automatic qualifiers Germany, as the defending champion, and the United States, 
as the host -- were set to play for the sport's holiest Grail, the 14-inch, 
11-pound, solid-gold World Cup trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are six groups of four teams, and each will play the other three in its 
group to determine which 16 -- the first two in each group and the four best 
third-place teams -- advance to the second round. At that point, it becomes a 
single-elimination tournament. If the regulation 90 minutes produces a tie, a 
30-minute overtime, and, if necessary, a shootout, will determine the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the scarcity of goals allows the skill-impaired to remain within 
striking distance in many games, one usually does not need the fingers on both 
hands to count the legitimate contenders. Only six teams have won the World 
Cup, and they have combined for 167 victories in the tournament. The 52 other 
teams that have played in it have combined for 197. 
</P>
<P>
 Two past champions, Uruguay and England, did not qualify this year, but the 
other four -- Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Germany -- again are among the 
favorites. Brazil, according to oddsmakers, is the favorite. But it is a gamble 
indeed to bet against Germany, which has been in four of the last five 
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams argue that this is their time, and some, such as Colombia, 
Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, perhaps even Nigeria, make 
convincing cases. As for the rest, well, they can dream. And do. Even the 
Bulgarian coach felt compelled this week to warn his players against 
overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no chance of the U.S. team bowing to that particular affliction. 
Although the United States played in the first two World Cups in 1930 and '34, 
this will be only its third since. After 1950, when it upset England, 1-0, in 
one of the most startling results in the tournament's history, it wandered for 
40 years before qualifying again in 1990. The young Americans did not belong in 
Italy, losing three games by a combined score of 8-2, and went home after the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 So the older and wiser Americans have a modest goal this time. They want to 
advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Much will be determined by their opening game Saturday at Pontiac, Mich., 
against Switzerland. The Swiss are superior on paper, but maybe they will be 
taking this game lightly, and maybe they are in no condition to play inside the 
world's largest sauna, the Silverdome, in the World Cup's first indoor game, 
and maybe the game will be as cuckoo as the clocks they make. It is not for 
nothing that the U.S. coach, Serbian Bora Milutinovic, is known as the miracle 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Americans win at Pontiac and manage to tie in one of their first-round 
games at the Rose Bowl, Wednesday against Colombia and June 26 against Romania, 
they should reach the second round. The sport's enthusiasts hope that would be 
the spark necessary to ignite soccer interest among sports fans in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is not likely to ever reach the manic levels it does in some 
countries. A dispute between Honduras and El Salvador erupted into war in 1969 
after a controversial soccer game between the countries' teams, and not a World 
Cup goes by that there are not news stories about fans who have committed 
suicide or murder out of aggravation over their team's results. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer officials in the United States and worldwide would like to see the 
sport become popular enough here that a viable professional league could be 
established. 
</P>
<P>
 They are willing to make some concessions to American tastes. Rules have been 
changed to encourage more offense, and in this World Cup, for the first time, 
replays inside the stadium will be allowed and players will be required to wear 
their names on the backs of their jerseys.  
</P>
<P>
 With several players, those who appreciate athleticism in its highest form, no 
matter what the sport, will surely want to become acquainted. There is 
Colombia's Carlos Valderrama, easily identified by his fright-wig shock of 
orange hair; his cartwheeling teammate, Faustino Asprilla; Brazil's Romario, 
with his "Foot of God;" Romania's Gheorghe Hagi, the "Maradona of the 
Carpathians;" Mexico's Jorge Campos, the goalkeeper with the amazing 
Technicolor dream coats; and Italy's Roberto Baggio, perhaps the world's best 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Is any of this likely to transform Joe Fan from yawning over the sport to 
fawning? Probably not. But the World Cup would be considered a success for now 
if, on the next occasion when he is polled, he thinks of bicycle kicks and 
banana balls instead of keels and spinnakers.

</P>
<P>
 -- Nobody's sleeping in La Paz tonight, let me tell ya. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It'll be Bolivia vs. Germany here on a toasty Morocco vs. Saudi Arabia kind 
of morning in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hot, hot, hot. Game-time temperatures expected in the 451-degree Fahrenheit 
range, partly cloudy, slight chance of cremation by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hot, hot, hot. Ernie Banks just went outside, came back in and said: "Man, 
let's not even play one today." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Capt. Rodham Clinton will present arms with the color guard, then report 
back to her local Marine Corps Reserve unit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bolivian anthem to be sung by Bolivia Newton-John.

<P>
 -- If the Bolivians get the Germans down, 3-1, they'll choke. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soldier Field will be completely sold out. (Assuming that World Cup 
officials sent out the right tickets.)

Cameroon-Sweden or four for Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wind is expected to curve corner kicks north to northwest at approximately 
10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sneaking out of work is the real worry today for average Chicagoans who 
can't afford to knock off whenever they please, like Jordan and Sandberg. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

Pontiac Silverdome is growing longer and greener by the minute. Complete film 
coverage tonight at 5, 6 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Team USA will open play Saturday in Detroit at the World Cup Poulan

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 -- The U.S.-Switzerland game will be televised at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time, 
pretty much when most of us prefer to watch our soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put down that doughnut or you could miss the only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I asked Swiss officials how they felt about indoor grass. They said: "We 
don't care, one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Bora Milutinovic says all systems are go, although he has absolutely 
no idea what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mexico can't wait to get past Norway, Ireland and Italy in hopes of another 
shot at much-feared soccer power United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I asked Swiss officials if the United States could defeat Mexico again. 
They said: "We don't care, one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go with South Korea 1, Spain 0 in tonight's game in Dallas. But it could be 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That man shouting, "You're running the wrong way!" from the stands? Look 
closely. It'll be Leon Lett. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It should be that rarest of football games from Dallas, one with no TV 
angles of cheerleaders from the boots up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If this thing works out, "Friday Night Soccer" could be part of the new 
fall lineup on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remember, any re-use or re-broadcast of this soccer game without the 
expressed written permission of FIFA is strictly prohibited.

HORRY VOWS TO PLAY; WILL GUARDS SHOW UP?; NBA FINALS: ROCKETS' SMITH AND 
MAXWELL NEED TO RESPOND TO KNICK COUNTERPARTS IN PIVOTAL GAME 5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a full moon in the Houston Rockets' locker room at Madison Square 
Garden late Wednesday night, a sighting of no astronomical significance but of 
great consequence to these NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Horry, Houston's starting small forward, was lying on his stomach on 
the training table, getting ice bags on his injured lower back, shorts down, 
the, southern part of the tailbone in full view. The New York Knicks haven't 
exposed the Rockets' erratic backcourt that much, and he would have been 
embarrassed by the predicament had the pain not been so acute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought something was broken," Horry said. "It felt like someone was 
cutting across my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Horry was in a much better position. He not only was sitting up, but 
he participated in the Rockets' light practice at the Downtown Athletic Club, 
home of the Heisman Trophy, and declared himself 98% healthy and 100% ready to 
play his usual role tonight in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays taken earlier in the day of his pelvis, tailbone and right wrist showed 
nothing broken after the flagrant foul by Anthony Mason in the third quarter of 
Game 4, when Horry was driving to the basket, got hit high, went almost 
vertical and hit the ground hard. His left hand, slightly injured along with 
his right wrist as he tried to break the fall, and lower back were still sore 
at practice, but the prognosis was better than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how you break your tailbone," said team physician Walter Lowe. "He's 
very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 So are the Rockets. If Horry had been unable to play, they would have faced a 
huge drop-off in the 2-2 series with Matt Bullard, seldom-used Chris Jent or 
under-sized Mario Elie against 6-foot-10 Charles Smith. They would have lost 
their third-leading scorer in the playoffs and their second-leading shot 
blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Rockets must treat another injury, Kenny Smith's broken shot. 
Actually, it's more than that. Smith's whole game needs treatment, considering 
the way he has been dominated by counterpart Derek Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has made five of 19 shots and is coming off his worst showing. He had 
two fouls before Game 4 was 4 1/2 minutes old, came out and made spot 
appearances the rest of the way. He played one minute with the outcome on the 
line in the fourth quarter, finished with 19 minutes, and now has played four 
fewer in the series than backup Sam Cassell. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said he will stick with Smith in the starting lineup -- 
for now. Vernon Maxwell, the shooting guard who is shooting 36.1%, has tried to 
light a fire under his backcourt mate by getting in his face at every possible 
moment, telling him to stay aggressive. Go out and play like a lunatic for a 
stretch of Game 5, Maxwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sort of like me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets' three-guard rotation could use something because it is shooting 
34.9%, topped by the 37.9% of Cassell.  
</P>
<P>
 "Me and him, we've been through so much together," Maxwell said of Smith. 
"It's like, 'You know if we lose this series, Kenny, it's going to be me and 
you.' Everyone's going to blame the guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like he's a little down because he is not playing well. He just has to 
be aggressive. When he is, he's one of the better point guards in the league. 
When he isn't, he's average. I'm going to stay on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith insists he is not down, only a bit demoralized that he is struggling at 
the same time Harper is playing so well, shooting 51% overall -- 51.9% on 
three-pointers -- and averaging 17 points. 
</P>

 "I've got to get on the floor," Smith said. "I'm not good enough to do any 
good in 19 minutes. I don't think anyone is good enough to do it in that amount

 "There's no set time frame I need. But if you look at the stats (tonight) and

FEHR SAYS STRIKE IS PROBABLE; BASEBALL: NEGOTIATOR FOR PLAYERS SAYS HE BELIEVES 
MANY OWNERS WOULD WELCOME A WORK STOPPAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Major League Players Assn.'s executive board delayed a decision on whether 
to strike, but Executive Director Don Fehr said Thursday he is skeptical that 
the baseball season will be completed without a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not confident we can do that, because history suggests it doesn't work 
that way," Fehr said. "The owners never take the players seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This atmosphere reminds me much more of 1981 than it does any year I've ever 
been involved, and in 1981, the owners couldn't wait for the players to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to the rhetoric that is coming out of the negotiations, there seems 
to be a rather large number of owners who would welcome a strike. That's just 
bizarre. I can't define it any more than that. I hope I'm wrong, but that's 
what it seems." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr met for three hours at an airport hotel with 55 players representing all 
28 teams, including 15 Angels, who are in town to play the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of the session discussing the 28-page proposal the owners gave 
the union Tuesday. The owners, contending they need to eliminate the disparity 
between large- and small-market teams, would give players a 50-50 split of 
revenue in exchange for the union agreeing to a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never seen a cap talked up by anyone that would do anything but lower 
players' salaries," Fehr said. "There is little in the NBA or NFL which would 
suggest we ought to follow that motto. One group who has the most experience 
with it -- the so-called tremendous shining example -- is basketball. And the 
basketball players can't wait to get rid of the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially what it's done is line owners' pockets at the expense of (the 
players') fair-market value." 
</P>
<P>
 Said pitcher Mark Langston, Angel player-representative: "The salary cap is 
not going to work at all. I'm very discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Fehr's primary complaint about the proposal is that it took 18 months to 
prepare, and one day after it was presented to the union, the owners' 
negotiator, Richard Ravitch, predicted a player strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Larry Andersen, the Philadelphia Phillies' player-representative: "The 
day after they hand us a proposal, Dick Ravitch says we're going to go on 
strike, so what does that tell you about the proposal? We didn't even meet 
until today, and already he knows we're going on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr and the executive council plan to submit a counterproposal to the owners 
by the end of this month. If there is no progress in negotiations, several 
players said that a strike date could be set at any time, and certainly by July 
11, when they will reconvene in Pittsburgh during the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some guys who talked about doing it now, but it could happen 
tomorrow," White Sox catcher Mike LaValliere said. "We're united on this 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Andersen: "The unfortunate part of this whole thing is that people are 
going to sit back and say, 'These guys are a bunch of greedy jerks.' I wish 
they knew the whole story."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; THE VICE SQUAD; COLOMBIAN TEAM FIGHTING 
COUNTRY'S NEGATIVE IMAGE BY SERVING AS CULTURAL AMBASSADORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Valderrama was dancing, throwing the defenders of Bayern Munich off 
guard, rolling pinpoint passes onto the feet of his forwards. The television 
cameras feasted on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Valderrama, two-time South American player of the year, is the best of what 
Colombia's national coach, Francisco Maturana, calls "the party" of Colombian 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Maturana, who has coached Colombia's international team since 1987, has made 
Colombian soccer true to its national spirit and in so doing has put together a 
successful and wildly admired team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always like that. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 15 years ago, the stars of Colombia's teams were mostly 
foreigners. Colombian players were uninterested in their international team and 
the results were predictable: Until 1990, Colombia hadn't been to the World Cup 
since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Maturana has taken Colombia to the World Cup for the second consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maturana, a former soccer star and dentist, faces an even more complex 
challenge: the specter of drugs and drug money that haunts the game in 
Colombia, which is the world's largest supplier of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colombia was nowhere on the soccer map, drug profits played an important 
role in attracting talent and raising the standards of Colombia's teams. In the 
early 1980s, professional soccer players made $900 to $1,800 a month. Today, 
they make more than $3,000 a month, and the perks for being a star have 
multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Escobar, a ruthless cocaine baron until his death in a shootout with 
police last year, was a big-time contributor to Medellin's professional team, 
Atletico Nacional. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the head of the rival Cali cocaine cartel, 
patronized the Cali team, America, and his brother, Miguel, was listed as the 
team's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence, meanwhile, stalked soccer. Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, a justice minister 
who accused most of Colombia's professional teams of having links to drug 
trafficking, was killed by drug traffickers in 1984. Colombian soccer 
executives were assassinated by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rene Higuita, one of the world's top goalkeepers, lost his place in the 
World Cup because of his friendship with drug traffickers. Higuita pioneered a 
new, madcap style of goalkeeping, charging brazenly 20 yards out of the net. A 
keeper-sweeper, he would take on opposing players, take penalty shots and even 
score goals. 
</P>
<P>
 His recklessness, however, carried over to real life. When Higuita's friend, 
Escobar, kidnaped the 13-year-old daughter of another cocaine figure, Higuita 
agreed to intercede. He freed the girl, then accepted $50,000 in gratitude 
money. That violated a law that prohibits mediating in or concealing a 
kidnaping. After seven months in jail, Higuita is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the members of Colombia's current team have been linked to 
drug activities, they say they are determined to counteract the negative image 
of their country. The team reflects Colombia's regional cultures, and players 
see a national mission in substituting the public perception of drugs and 
violence with the beauty of their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The more defensive players are from the Andean region, where obedience and 
discipline take precedence over dazzle. These include Luis Fernando Herrera, a 
man steeped in the Roman Catholic faith and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, a smiling, relaxed player, stresses the exhilaration of playing. His 
3-year-old son was kidnaped in Medellin and then recovered only days after 
Colombia's 5-0 victory over Argentina in the World Cup qualifying round. Yet, 
he insists, "Soccer is joy and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The forwards are mostly from the Pacific region and the Caribbean coast, home 
of Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, of all-night salsa 
parties and rum. 
</P>
<P>
 Faustino Asprilla is one of the world's quickest and most acrobatic players. 
He can curl balls into the net from difficult angles -- or get involved in six 
automobile crashes in a single month, as he did in 1992. He punctuates every 
goal with a dizzying cartwheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer players play like they live," Maturana said. "Imagine Brazilian soccer 
and you think of a game like the Brazilian character, lively and free. Germans 
are precise. We Colombians are uncomplicated, hard workers and tricksters, 
organizing ourselves to give flight to fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Cordoba, the 24-year-old keeper who replaced Higuita, is a serious and 
charismatic former advertising design student.  
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia's team reflects the idiosyncrasies of its people and what they want 
to show at an international level, sport and the good things about their 
country," Cordoba said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba is cautious, far less likely to commit the kind of error that Higuita 
made in 1990 when he ventured too far from the net, leaving the goal open for 
Cameroon's Roger Milla, whose goal resulted in Colombia's elimination from the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the nation's perfect ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to improve Colombia's image in the world like our bullfighter, Cesar 
Rincon, does in Spain, or our bicycling champions do in  
</P>
<P>
 France and Italy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Colombians agree. On a recent Sunday, people of all ages clogged a street 
in Bogota's old Spanish neighborhood with a pick-up game, set against the 
backdrop of the Andes and a broken brick wall plastered with torn political 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia is having a difficult time with all the violence," said Erik Kowall, 
a 23-year-old graphic-design student who had joined in the game. "We are seen 
as bad people abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image is far from reality. If our team does well, that will emphasize the 
good about our country. It will help change the world's vision of us."

 Germany vs. Bolivia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 11:55 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: On each third of the field, Germany is dominant. It has two 
superb strikers in Juergen Klinsmann and Rudi Voeller, a creative midfielder in 
Andreas Moeller and a sweeper, Lothar Matthaeus, who, in the mold of Franz 
Beckenbauer, is a coach on the field. The team captain was the playmaker when 
the Germans won in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia has only two players who are considered capable of competing at the 
Germans' level, and one of them, attacking midfielder Marco Antonio Etcheverry, 
suffered a severe knee injury in November. He is expected to play on a limited 
basis. That leaves midfielder Erwin Sanchez, nicknamed "Platini" after the 
former French star, to lead the Bolivians against the world champions. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The equalizer could be the heat and humidity, both forecast to be 
extremely high. That figures to favor Bolivia, which prefers a slow tempo that 
features long, methodical possessions. Under normal circumstances, the Germans 
would pounce with their high-pressure, physically superior defense and push 
forward with a quick, efficient transition game. But the conditions might force 
German Coach Berti Vogts to alter his strategy, particularly considering that 
his team, with an average age of 28 1/2, is one of the oldest in the 
tournament. Six players are over 30, including Matthaeus, 33, and Voeller, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Germany might be old, but that also means it is experienced. Eleven 
of its 22 players, including seven of its projected starters, are veterans of 
the 1990 World Cup. They will have no difficulty altering their game plan, 
which will call on them to press early, take the lead and play defensively for 
the remainder of the afternoon to conserve energy. Like a vintage Mercedes, 
they do not have to impress anyone. Germany, 2-0. RANDY HARVEYBOLIVIA

 GROUP C at Cotton Bowl, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 Spain vs. South Korea 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:35 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN2; ESPN, 10:25 p.m. PDT, delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This could be just the kind of game to keep the American 
public from catching soccer fever, especially in Texas. Neither team is known 
for its scoring, but aficionados will have plenty to savor. The play from 
midfield back might prove to be the difference. If nothing else, the game will 
provide a contrast in styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain has players from the high-powered Spanish League, including nine from FC 
Barcelona, which finished second to AC Milan in the European Champions Cup this 
spring. They know each other well and play the game at its highest level. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, on the other hand, has little international experience and a 
knack for losing leads. Its team is made up of players from the lightly 
regarded Korean professional league. Although it is fast and intense, it 
struggled to advance out of Asian qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a good team, the toughest opponents we have in the first stage," 
said Spanish Coach Javier Clemente, obviously forgetting that his team must 
face defending champion Germany in the first round. "They have speed, pressing 
abilities and are extremely fit physically. We know what we have to do. Doing 
it is another matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Much has been made of Dallas being the weak link of the nine U.S. 
cities staging World Cup games. And Big D is getting a little defensive. The 
lead editorial in Thursday's Dallas Morning News offered a number of reasons 
why the city has been unable to sell out its six games at the Cotton Bowl and 
urged readers to buy tickets. But blaming Nigerians and Bulgarians, whose teams 
are scheduled to play in Dallas, instead of Texans might be taking it a bit 
far. Nonetheless, today's match is as important to civic pride as to the teams 
that are participating. A good showing could reverse Dallas' blase attitude 
toward the monthlong event. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: "There is great pressure to win the first game," South Korea Coach 
Kim Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? South Korea, after all, has not won a World Cup match in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always an equal chance, always a little luck," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, with its wealth of talent, has not been a World Cup smash either, but 
even without its goalkeeper it should control the ball to stop the Koreans' 
chaotic attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, 1-0. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 The English are in a quandary over the World Cup. The nation that likes to 
think it invented soccer failed to qualify for the finals, a humiliation that 
still rankles. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the English are rooting for the Republic of Ireland, which has an English 
coach, Jack Charlton, and whose players almost all play for British club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Press has made much of the fact that a minority of Americans know 
what the World Cup is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Jones, in Thursday's edition of the Independent, quoted an American 
sportswriter friend: "Let's face it, the only reason that the World Cup is 
being held in the United States is because the organizers see $$$$$$. After 
seeing the Olympics make money in Los Angeles they figured they were on to a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent's summary: "The only sensible conclusion is that the United 
States doesn't need football any more than football needs the United States."

 A survey of coaches of 24 World Cup teams and about 50 players by Italy's 
largest sports daily, Gazzetta dello Sport, predicted Brazil as the winner of 
the 1994 event, following a possible final with defending champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy would finish in the top four, along with Colombia. Brazilian forward 
Romario and Italy's Roberto Baggio would be the outstanding players, the survey 
showed.

 The U.S. team practiced in the heat and humidity of suburban Detroit on 
Thursday, but the players appeared to handle the conditions coolly. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic moved practice back more than an hour, placing the 
players on the field at Oakland University at midday, under a blazing sun and 
stifling humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Milutinovic was trying to prepare his team for the rigors of 
Saturday's opening game in the Silverdome at nearby Pontiac. Last summer, 
Germany played England in the Silverdome under sweltering conditions. The 
77,000-seat indoor stadium is not air-conditioned.

 U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna practiced lightly but did not take part in any 
of the scrimmages. Reyna suffered a strained right hamstring in practice last 
week and is still not fully recovered. He said that if the game had been played 
Thursday he could not have started. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Roy Wegerle showed no effect of his knee injury, but he said he has 
been told he will not start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending how we play against Switzerland, I think there's a good chance that 
he'll start against Colombia," assistant coach Steve Sampson said. JULIE CART

 Argentina's plans to give Diego Maradona practice handling a man-to-man marker 
nearly backfired when he took a shoe full of cleats on the left ankle in 
Wellesley, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a nasty fright. If it had been serious it would have been a 
catastrophe," Maradona said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's Claudia Caniggia, who aggravated a sore big toe in practice 
Wednesday, is doubtful for the opening game against Greece on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentines are undecided on their goaltender, with Sergio Goycochea, their 
hero in the 1990 World Cup, in a tough fight for the job with Luis Islas.

 Soccer has at least one thing in common with American sports: woofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium opens against Morocco on Sunday in Orlando, and Belgium-based Nacer 
Abdellah, who plays for Morocco, had plenty to say about the Belgians, telling 
one reporter that Croatian-born striker Josip Weber can be intimidated with 
kicks to the shins and comments about the war in the former Yugoslavia, and 
another that Belgian defender Michel De Wolf is slower than his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this won't get them going, then they wouldn't be real sportsmen," 
Belgium's coach, Paul Van Himst, said, holding a fax of a newspaper story.

 Colombia's ambassador to the United States complained to a Chicago newspaper 
that it misrepresented the Colombian team by linking its World Cup "heroes" 
with drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chicago Tribune earlier this month, columnist Mike Conklin asked why 
U.S. security officials did not investigate the criminal background of the 
Colombian team, alleging 70% of the country's soccer clubs were financed by 
drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Gabriel Silva, in a published letter, said he strongly rejected 
these "careless" statements and "insulting remarks." 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of our players come from poor backgrounds and have reached 
this plateau after overcoming huge odds," Silva wrote.

 The Bonn daily, Die Welt, ran an article on its opinion page by Ulrich Dost 
under the headline "Soccer with Popcorn," which said in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "America and European football, as they call soccer, have never understood 
each other despite many contacts. . . . The North Americans are so much in love 
with their favorite sports -- baseball, football and basketball -- that they 
take soccer for a girl's sport at the most. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung had four special pages on the World Cup in its 
sports section, which included an article by Kurt Kister headlined "Soccer's 
Belated Invasion of America." He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Has America woken up, has it become a soccer nation just in time for June 17? 
Not really. . . . The nation will not fall for the frenzy because the game that 
fascinates the rest of the world has never settled in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can dare to predict two things, though: Most probably the World Cup will 
run in almost perfect organization in sold-out stadiums, and the Americans will 
like it a few days into it -- that means if the U.S. team doesn't go down too 
quickly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the U.S. team suffers the same fate as four years ago -- three 
defeats in the first round -- the rest of the soccer-playing world doesn't have 
to worry about this World Cup. There is probably no one in the world who can 
organize big events of all kinds as well as the Americans. . . . Only an 
earthquake could still disturb the program of this World Cup."

 Belgium's leading French language daily, Le Soir, Thursday published a 32-page 
World Cup preview supplement, including an article on the status of soccer in 
the United States, which featured a full-page photo of Chelsea Clinton kicking 
a soccer ball, under the headline: "The Sport of Girls and English Snobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The secondary head on the same story read: "Americans are pulling out the 
stops for the World Cup, but soccer remains a long way from the collective 
conscience of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Other stories in the supplement dwell on the Orlando area, where the Belgian 
team will play its first two games, describing it as "a region entirely 
dedicated to the memory of Walt Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the sports pages, coverage seems to concentrate on the heat and how the 
players accustomed to playing in chilly Northern Europe will cope with the 
tropical climate. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, however, the Belgian press concluded that the conditions provided 
for their team have been excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "By all evidence, our best footballers . . . are residing in a superb hotel 
complex nestled into a bit of countryside in a place that is a quasi-paradise," 
according to Le Soir.

 The Kings have signed free-agent forward Rob Brown, free-agent defenseman 
Michel Petit and 1992 draft choice Jeff Shevalier, General Manager Sam McMaster 
announced. 
</P>
<P>

International Hockey League last season, getting 155 points, including 42 
goals, in 79 games for Kalamazoo.A 5-foot-11, 185-pound right wing, Brown is a

 David Cone, whose 10-2 record is second-best to Jimmy Key's 10-1 in the 
American League, says he wouldn't be surprised to be traded if the Kansas City 
Royals fail to contend this September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ruling out any possibilities," Cone told The Olathe (Kan.)Daily News 
in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander signed a three-year $18-million free-agent contract before 
the 1993 season and is one reason the Royals, a small-market club, have a 
$40-million payroll -- fifth-highest among major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can happen. I certainly could be traded to dump the next year's 
salary," said Cone, whose concern was fueled in part by remarks by Mike Herman, 
the president of the Royals who had said he didn't see how the team could 
afford Cone's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Herk Robinson declined comment other than to say Cone isn't on 
the trading block and wasn't expected to be.

 The Boston Red Sox put right-handed pitcher Danny Darwin (7-5, 6.30 ERA) on

or three days because of a sprained lower back.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BARNES COMES TO BULLPEN FROM INDIANS

<P>
 The Dodgers, trying to improve their bullpen, acquired left-hander Brian 
Barnes from the Cleveland Indians for minor league third baseman Eddie 
Lantigua, who was playing for Class-A Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, 27, who also pitched for the Montreal Expos, will be with the team for 
tonight's game.To make room for Barnes on the roster, the Dodgers optioned 
left-hander Al Osuna to triple-A Albuquerque. They also designated pitcher John 
DeSilva for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes was 0-1 with a 5.40 earned-run average in six games with the Indians. 
More recently, he appeared in 13 games with the Indians' triple-A team at 
Charlotte, N.C., and had an 0-1 record with one save and a 3.93 ERA, but 23 
strikeouts in 18 1/3 innings. Barnes, who began his professional career as a 
starter in the Montreal organization in 1989, had his best season in 1992, when 
he was 6-6 with a 2.97 ERA in 21 games with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna struggled with consistency, yielding runs in four of 15 appearances. His 
record was 2-0 with a 6.23 ERA. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PLAYERS' EYES OPENED AT UNION MEETING

 The Angels were hoping to embrace the baseball owners' new labor proposal 
Thursday, wanting to hear Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League 
Players Assn., tell them a work stoppage can be averted. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Angels' 15-player entourage departed the meeting believing that 
it's inevitable a strike will be staged after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a house you look at from the outside," second baseman Harold 
Reynolds said, "and you say, 'Hey, that looks pretty good.' Then you go inside, 
start inspecting a little closer and say, 'Oh-oh.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happened today. We got our eyes opened. The salary cap has 
totally destroyed two sports (pro football and pro basketball), and it's not 
going to ruin ours." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' 15-player contingent was nearly four times larger than any team 
represented at the players association meeting. The only team that had more 
than three players was the Chicago White Sox, who had four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utilityman Mark Dalesandro had more than 150 friends and relatives attending 
Thursday's game at Comiskey Park, three miles away from where he was born and 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dalesandro did not play, his night was highlighted by his 20-year-old 
sister, Rosemarie, singing the national anthem. She is performing in a play, 
"Tony and Tina's Wedding," and sang in a wedding dress along with two cast 
members. BOB NIGHTENGALE

THE SCENE: ROLL PLAYING; WITH WHEELS COME FREEDOM, SO TEENS DON'T NEED TO STAY 
AT HOME FOR THE DRAMA OF SOAP OPERAS. THEY'RE ALREADY ROLLING IN IT AT THE 
FOUNTAIN VALLEY SKATING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Friday night couldn't have rolled around any faster for Pacifica High freshman 
Kelly Boyd. The Garden Grove teen usually visits the Fountain Valley Skating 
Center on Saturdays but made an exception last weekend for him . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to see someone. This guy. I heard he would come here tonight," 
Kelly, 15, confides. That explains the continually shifting eyes. Her vision 
was locked on search mode. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't even know me, but. . ." Kelly's conversation halts. She's spotted 
someone zipping by, but it proves to be a false alarm. It's two-thirds into the 
second two-hour session of the evening. Time's running out. Dad will be by soon 
to pick up Kelly and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 So unfolds one of dozens of dramas at the roller-skating rink this evening. 
It's about the same price as a movie ($4.50 a session, $1.50 for skate rentals) 
and, considering some of the sequels out, twice as riveting. Besides, if you're 
under 21, where else can you go to groove to music? 
</P>
<P>
 Packed with a couple of hundred teens on wheels, with a nonstop parade of 
parents dropping off more kids outside, roller-skating rinks are the weekend 
hot spots for teens to see and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's case is typical, says Santiago High junior Michele McElroy of Garden 
Grove. She says she's heard it all working behind the snack bar at the rink six 
days a week for the past three years ("I'm trying to pay off a car").  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's checking out everyone else. They're talking about everybody," 
says Michele, 17. "It's kind of cool working here because you hear all the 
gossip. It is such a soap opera here."  
</P>
<P>
 As the Wheels Turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday and Saturday nights are Michele's busiest and favorite shifts. She can 
point out who's who just as easily as she can the newcomers. Roller rinks, 
apparently, attract as loyal a following as, say, bars or nightclubs do for the 
older set. Indeed, even if there were any clubs for teens, many say they'd 
still go roller-skating. 
</P>
<P>
 There are hard-core regulars who go every weekend -- like Michele's brother 
Mike, 14. Others make it two or three times a month. But "once you come here 
you come all the time," Michele notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just really easy to fit in here. Everyone's open and friendly."  
</P>
<P>
 She then reveals the other truth: "Kids get away with a lot of stuff here. 
It's like, your parents aren't here watching you, so you can skate fast, meet 
guys or girls and not get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Skating fast and slow dancing with someone cute seems so innocent compared 
with some of the alternatives out there, like high school kegger parties. Even 
cruising can be dangerous because of drunk drivers. Then again, so is 
roller-skating, if you're a klutz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stuff gets started in here," admits Mike, a freshman at Santiago High in 
Garden Grove. "But it's not very often. It feels sort of safer in here. I mean, 
it's better than being out on the streets."  
</P>
<P>
 The security team makes sure the crowd keeps cool, as does the crew of 
referees in black and white shirts. To their credit, they seem to know the 
difference between a group of young guests knocking each other down for kicks 
and those who have other intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't Sunday school, after all. Normal conflicts arise, especially when 
some groups try to flex their presence. It's typical to find cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few are caught up in thrift-shop fashion and seek out other eclectic 
skaters. There are the girls who come more ready for the runway than the roller 
way, perfectly primped and stylin' in trendy clothes (if only those rentals 
weren't so brown and ugly). Some of the guys show up in packs, dressed alike in 
hip-hop wear including wide-leg jeans that hide their skates.  
</P>
<P>
 Couples hold hands when they skate, when they sit, when they snack -- only 
letting go when they make out. Singles, on the other hand, band in throngs. 
Girls over here, boys over there -- much like a school dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Old friends, like Santiago seniors Tiffany Nguyen and Kimberly Tran, visit the 
rink a couple of times a month to get together, "mess around and dance" the 
17-year-olds say in unison. Kimberly doesn't get to see Tiffany much since 
Tiffany got a boyfriend. Tonight's girls' night out. "We came for the action!" 
Tiffany yells out. On the agenda? Finding Kimberly a beau. 
</P>
<P>
 There are friends who all have the same-colored skates. And there are those 
who've moved on to in-line models. 
</P>
<P>
 But popularity isn't just rated on fashion sense or whether someone owns or 
rents skates. Skill and technique matter too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Mike and his friend Fountain Valley freshman Dave Navarro, 14, 
are the self-appointed hosts. Mike's been coming every Friday and Saturday for 
the past five years, and he doesn't plan to change his weekend gig just because 
he's in high school now. Nor does Dave, who met Mike and most of his closest 
friends since beginning to frequent the rink two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They say their realm of friends is larger than the average high schooler 
because of the rink. They know teens from other schools and cities: Huntington 
Beach, Santa Ana, Westminster and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my good friends I know from skating," Mike notes. "They're the ones I 
talk to on the phone. . .unless I need help on homework. Then I call someone 
from (my) school." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave agrees. But he's less reluctant to call the rink his total world. 
"Skating is, well, half my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's, like, normal just to come here," Mike adds. "It's a habit. Everybody 
who comes here can't wait till Friday."

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; EVERYTHING A GIRL WANTS IN A GAME -- AND LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news: There is finally a CD-ROM adventure game expressly for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii High: The Mystery of the Tiki," from the Sanctuary Woods company, 
breaks the stereotypes all too familiar to anyone who has browsed the computer 
software shops in search of alternatives to the space epics and martial arts 
sagas aimed at boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii High" follows the adventures of Jennifer, who recently moved to Hawaii 
from New York City, and her Hawaiian friend Maleah as they investigate the 
mystery of a stolen sacred Tiki god carving. Along the way, the two girls have 
to solve various puzzles to make progress in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayelet Sela, who produced a soon-to-air National Public Radio documentary on 
the female approach to computer game play, applauds the efforts of Sanctuary 
Woods in releasing the game into a marketplace that is, according to surveys on 
kids and computer games, at least 85% male. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are almost all the characters in the games male," Sela said, 
speaking from her home in New York, "the game content makes it clear that the 
game player is also assumed to be male. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of rescuing of princesses." 
</P>
<P>
 But what most interests Sela is what specifically makes a computer game 
attractive and appropriate for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there is definitely a difference in the way females play a game," she 
said. "You can't just take a character named Joe and name him Mary and think 
that it's now a great game for girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Sela said serious research into gender differences in computer game play has 
not been done, but after untold hours of observing kids at computers for her 
documentary, she can make some educated guesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole set of games in which you need to spend maybe 40 hours to 
get to the end," she said. "A woman will generally sit down and play a game 
until she's bored. She doesn't have to work all the way to the end to get 
satisfaction out of game play. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man will sit there and keep on working at the game, no matter how 
repetitive it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some games, including the celebrated "Myst," that both men and women 
seem to equally enjoy, but often in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myst" is one of those games that requires many, many hours of play to unfold 
its mysteries. "But it's a beautiful game," Sela said. "As soon as you sit down 
at it, you see the wonderful graphics and hear interesting music and sounds. A 
woman will appreciate that, but after three hours she'll say, 'This is great, 
now let's go to dinner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii High," no matter how good its intentions, is a dreadful game. (This is 
my opinion -- Sela declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 The graphics are neither beautiful nor engaging and the action is stiff and 
achingly slow, often resembling a bad puppet show or the worst in Saturday 
morning cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii High" does not make good use of the vast possibilities of the CD-ROM 
medium and even its female-oriented content, touted by Sanctuary Woods, is a 
bit askew. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jennifer goes to the school library, for example, just about all she 
finds of interest are video clips promoting other Sanctuary Woods games. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the game play in "Hawaii High" is muddled and confusing, and the 
narrative thread is never clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The kindest thing that can be said is that future female-oriented CD-ROMs have 
nowhere to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii High" has a retail list price of $39.95, and it's playable on both 
Macintosh and Windows platforms.  
</P>
<P>
 Sela's documentary, "Video and Computer Games; Ice Age or New Age For Women," 
will air on NPR's "Horizons" series later this month. Check your local public 
broadcasting station for time and date.

 If you could invite three famous people, dead or alive, to dinner, who would 
they be and why? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the responses to that question published by the Wildcat, the 
student newspaper at Brea Olinda High School: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jimi Hendrix, so he can teach me some licks.Albert Einstein, so he can teach 
me the theory of relativity, and Bill Clinton, so I can teach him how to run 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dan Quayle, so I can teach him how to spell potato; Hillary Clinton, because 
everybody says she's so smart, and Bill Clinton, so I can tell him how smart 
he's not. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leslie Nielsen because he can keep a straight face while saying something 
funny; Tom Jones, because he's just a happening guy, and Bruce Lee, because 
he's a martial arts stud.

INK: ACTRESS TILLY LETS VOICE BE HEARD -- AS A NOVELIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She played a free spirit in "The Big Chill" and earned an Oscar nomination for 
her beatific title role in "Agnes of God."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, Meg Tilly has turned novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical reaction to Tilly's "Singing Songs," newly published by Dutton, 
confirms the actress's literary voice is being heard. Novelist Tom De Haven, 
reviewing the book in Entertainment Weekly, hammered her tale of an abused, but 
resilient, child as "oppressively ugly." But Publishers Weekly calls the book 
"an impressive first novel," and writer Donna Rifkind, in the New York Times 
Book Review, applauded Tilly for achieving "the remarkable coherence and 
clarity" of her young narrator's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator is Anna, whose innocence and independence recall Tilly's two most 
famous roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm an expert on writing novels because I've only written one," 
Tilly said recently as she embarked on a 10-city book tour (which will bring 
her to Book Soup in Los Angeles on June 27). "All I know is that this thing 
grabbed me. It's like when I'm acting and a character gets hold of me. Anna got 
hold of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna, who protects herself and her siblings in a dysfunctional family adrift 
in the Northwest, came to Tilly as she tried to write a short film she intended 
to direct. The episode at the heart of her script led her to envision another 
scene, and then more, until Tilly saw she could weave them all into a novel of 
short chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilly, a single mother of three, said it was easy to slip into a child's point 
of view as she wrote her novel at home in rural British Columbia. "I borrowed 
from my kids. I borrowed from characters that I played. I borrowed from 
myself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists has bought the film rights and Tilly has prepared the 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never imagined myself as a writer," she said. "I always thought that 
writers are the intelligent people. I never pictured myself having a voice, and 
I must tell you that I'm so amazed that I have a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Other Brando Book: The battling Brandos will reach bookstores in October. 
In this corner, the actor's autobiography, "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," 
to be published by Random House . . . in that corner, Peter Manso's 
unauthorized biography, "Brando," from Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
 Manso phoned the other day to take issue with our previously quoted remark of 
Random House Publisher Harold Evans, who had referred to the timing of Manso's 
book as a "spoiling operation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent seven years writing my book," Manso said. "Where does Random House 
get off calling it a spoiling operation? They're the ones in a spoiling 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Manso, the author of "Mailer: His Life & Times," contends that Brando agreed 
to write his autobiography only after learning how deep the biographer was 
digging. "I've spoken to everyone from (director) Elia Kazan to Marlon's 
personal assistant to his eldest sister, who gave me a week and a half of her 
time.

 "It's a very sad story. The hardest part was packaging the pain, his 
unrelieved descent into darkness, his spending most of his time alone in the 
bedroom atop Mulholland Drive. . . . I have no doubt that his book is geared 
specifically to bury me." 
</P>
<P>
 The word is that Manso turned in a manuscript of about 1,200 pages that 
Hyperion plans to trim into a 700-page book.

 On the Racks: The July / August issue of the new Family Life preps parents for 
summer days with a revealing report about which sunscreens for kids work best, 
as well as vacation-minded looks at "The Joys of Hiking," zoos and roadside 
attractions. Also, Contributing Editor Robert Coles considers the Pledge of 
Alliance and its meaning to children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the magazine racks is an unexpected interview with Richard M. Nixon, 
given shortly before his death in April, in which the former President tenderly 
recalls his late wife, Pat, and their life outside the political arena. It 
appears in the July issue of Good Housekeeping.

JAZZ NOTES: RATING THE PLAYBOY JAZZ FESTIVAL LINEUP; JOSHUA REDMAN, LIONEL 
HAMPTON AND THE COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA TOP THE 'A' LIST OF PERFORMERS SCHEDULED

<P>
 It's mid-June in Southern California and there are two things you can count 
on: dreary overcast skies and the return of the Playboy Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's lineup for the two-day event at the Hollywood Bowl features a 
world-class selection of jazz artists. Saturday's program, which is completely 
sold out, is highlighted by the appearance of the young firebrand Joshua Redman 
and the indefatigable Lionel Hampton. Sunday's affair is sparked by drummer 
Elvin Jones, the Count Basie orchestra and the fireworks of Tito Puente's 
Golden Latin All-Stars. Some tickets remain for this program. In addition, Bill 
Cosby will be hand both days to introduce the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as with last, we've rated each day's lineup for the festival. Here 
are our rankings -- take them along with you and see how they match up with 
your own assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's show, which kicks off at 2:30 p.m., runs like this, in order of 
appearance: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Roosevelt High School Band: The youngsters get a top rung for effort, if 
not performance. Letter grade: A. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flora Purim and Airto: These chieftains of Brazilian music -- Airto is 
arguably the music world's grandmaster percussionist and Flora's voice ranges 
from as light as the wake from a dove's wings in flight to ardent and demanding 
-- will offer a rousing opening to the festival. B. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ramsey Lewis: The pianist, though he once worked with Max Roach's 
no-nonsense quintet, is nonetheless a journeyman purveyor of frothy, 
funk-oriented jazz that rings tunefully in the ear. B-. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cassandra Wilson: Eclectic at the core, the singer with the voice like 
magenta mist has chosen to focus on pop-based material, which she handles with 
delicacy and feeling on her latest "Blue Light 'Til Dawn" album. B+. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joshua Redman: Heart and plenty of deep-down savvy informs the sizzling, 
inventive offerings of this tenor saxophonist, who, at 25, has made plenty of 
noise in the jazz world. Bass ace Christian McBride, drummer Brian Blade and 
pianist Brad Mehldau only sweeten the sounds. A. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earl Klugh: Row upon row of round, glossy tones emanate from the strings of 
this acoustic guitarist. These notes demand nothing more from listeners than 
that they be enjoyed -- as pleasurably, and without thought, as one might sip 
iced tea. C+. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spyro Gyra: This band is still one of the patron saints of pop/jazz, as the 
musicians play with clarity and precision, but scant aesthetic spark. C. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wynton Marsalis: What do we make of this trumpeter, the spokesperson of his 
generation who has embraced Miles Davis-ish post-bop, Louis Armstrong-ish early 
jazz and now Clary Terry-ish Ellingtonia, yet still lacks his own voice? B-. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family Laws with Hubert, Ronnie, Eloise & Debra Laws: The talented family 
rarely gets together, and chances are stuff with a spiffy back-beat will be the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 B. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lionel Hampton & the Golden Men of Jazz, with drummer Louie Bellson, pianist 
Junior Mance, trombonist Al Grey, trumpeters Harry "Sweets" Edison and Pete 
Candoli, saxmen Jack Kelson and Benny Golson. How can you knock "Gates," as the 
85-year-old vibist is affectionately known? He's a double amazement, not that 
he can play, but that he can still play with fire. A-. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall Rating: B. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the grades for Sunday's performers, in the order of their appearance. 
The show runs from 2 to 10:30 p.m.: 
</P>
<P>
 * Russell Malone: This guitarist, with his alternately incandescent and 
lambent sound, whirls with class between the worlds of mainstream and more 
pop-oriented jazz. B+. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcus Roberts' trio: The pianist offers elegant, though occasionally stiff, 
examinations of pieces by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington, 
usually prefaced with keen, dead-pan intros. B. 
</P>
<P>
 * Count Basie Orchestra, directed by Frank Foster: The ensemble's standard for 
nonpareil swinging, set by its dear, departed leader, has never waned. A-. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elvin Jones: His arms held high above his drum kit, then sweeping down like 
a falcon taking prey, Jones knows how to make a joyful noise out of his wood, 
metal and skin assemblages. Saxman Greg Tardy, trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis and 
pianist Willie Pickens are added pluses. B+. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joe Williams: A master crooner with a penchant for blues and ballads, 
Williams works with his old cronies, the Count Basie band, with Norman Simmons 
in the piano chair. B+. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pete Fountain: New Orleans jazz with a vengeance from the veteran 
clarinetist. B. 
</P>
<P>
 * King Sunny Ade and The New African Beats: These sounds by the 
multi-instrumentalist from the largest continent will no doubt have people 
dancing in the aisles, but as for jazz content, well . . . C. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Sanborn: He keeps saying he's not a jazz player, but the dynamo 
altoist with the blues whammy, nasally tone and facile technicality comes darn 
close sometimes. B-. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tito Puente's Golden Latin All-Stars, with conga drummer Mongo Santamaria, 
flutist Dave Valentin, trumpeter Charlie Sepulveda, pianist Hilton Ruiz and 
others: The timbalero and his buddies will probably incite an effusive response 
from the audience. B. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall rating: B. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie's Back: Freddie Hubbard, long suffering from medical problems and 
erratic in performance, seems to be finally up and around and was in good form 
Wednesday night at Catalina Bar & Grill, sending forth cascades of shiny tones. 
His band, with Javon Jackson on tenor and John Beasley, piano, works through 
Sunday. . . . Arriving at Catalina on Tuesday is trumpet maestro Tom Harrell, 
fronting an all-star New York-based quintet. The pensive, startling Harrell 
brings along Don Braden (tenor sax), Donald Brown (piano), Larry Grenadier 
(bass) and Billy Hart (drums) for what should be spectacular excursions into 
the realm of modern mainstream jazz.

GNATCATCHER IS AGAIN LISTED AS THREATENED BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California gnatcatcher was temporarily placed back on the federal 
threatened species list Thursday by the same judge who ordered the bird removed 
from the list two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial ruling on May 2, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin 
ordered the gnatcatcher stricken from the list, saying the government had 
failed to make public all the data it relied upon in declaring the gnatcatcher 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt responded almost immediately by 
making the information available and petitioning the judge to, in effect, put a 
stay on his own decision while federal authorities provide evidence to prove 
the listing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporkin, in the decision reversing himself Thursday, wrote that what "should 
have been done initially . . . is being done now," referring to Babbitt's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the decision, issued in Washington, the federal government has 100 days 
in which to evaluate public comment on the newly available scientific data 
before making a final decision on the gnatcatcher's status. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome could influence future development in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt hailed the decision as "a clear victory for cooperative conservation 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that the court recognized our good-faith efforts to make all 
biological data available for public review," Babbitt wrote, "and that is the 
spirit under which we want to see the law work now and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California, which, along with the Orange County Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, had filed the original challenge to the listing, expressed 
disappointment at Thursday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows the secretary to continue to enforce an illegally adopted 
decision," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides had been at odds since the rare songbird had been listed as 
threatened in March, 1993, an action that effectively halted all development 
plans in areas where the birds nest, including some of the most desirable 
ocean- and canyon-view land in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter belief that the listing was needed, builders have emphasized their 
support for the Natural Communities Conservation Plan, a state plan under which 
developers voluntarily preserve crucial habitat in exchange for permission to 
develop on land considered less essential to various species, including the 
gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Thursday's decision, some developers and members of the building 
industry said they still support that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will stay the course and work on the overall conservation plan no matter 
what," said Christine Diemer, executive director of the Building Industry Assn. 
of Southern California's Orange County region. 
</P>
<P>
 Laer Pearce, executive director of the Coalition for Habitat Conservation, 
said, "We're still putting our full weight behind the conservation plan. No one 
is rushing out there to do any (major development)." The coalition represents 
10 major landowners including Orange County's Irvine Co. and Santa Margarita 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Diemer and Pearce, however, were unhappy with what they characterized as 
the short public review period before Babbitt makes his final decision on the 
gnatcatcher listing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little unfair to compress it so much for us when the (government) took 
years to review the data," Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, meanwhile, regarded Thursday's decision as a clear victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," said Patrick Mitchell, a spokesman for 
the Orange County chapter of Earth First!, a group of environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joel Reynolds, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council: 
"It's great news. It is absolutely the right decision based on science. The 
survival of the ecosystem depends on what Judge Sporkin did today."

N. KOREA, IN ABRUPT SHIFT, OFFERS PLAN TO RESTART U.S. TALKS; DIPLOMACY: 
PYONGYANG DELIVERS COMPROMISE THROUGH EX-PRESIDENT CARTER. REGIME WOULD FREEZE 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, ALLOW INSPECTORS TO STAY. CLINTON IS HOPEFUL BUT CAUTIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 North Korea abruptly offered a compromise Thursday in its dispute with the 
United States over its nuclear facilities and President Clinton said it might 
prove acceptable -- raising the possibility of a breakthrough in what has been 
an escalating confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Korean proposal, delivered through former President Jimmy Carter, 
asks for a resumption of broad, high-level political and economic talks with 
the United States in return for Pyongyang freezing its nuclear program and 
allowing international inspectors to stay in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who spoke to reporters late Thursday after meeting with his top 
national security advisers, said Washington would seek to confirm details of 
the offer through diplomatic channels in the next few days and might accept it 
if it proves genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If today's developments mean that North Korea is genuinely and verifiably 
prepared to freeze its nuclear program while talks go on . . . , then we would 
be willing to resume high-level talks," the President said. "We will just have 
to see," he added later. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials made it clear that the United States also would insist on 
conditions of its own, including that Pyongyang stop reprocessing its spent 
fuel rods and refueling its current reactor and that it cooperate fully with 
international inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton and his advisers discussed options for strengthening 
U.S. military capability in and around South Korea but reached no final 
decisions. They said that possibilities included sending radar-evading Stealth 
bombers to South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether the two sides would be able to agree on 
specifics of a compromise. Despite the initial euphoria over the North Korean 
proposal, the offer essentially would return the situation to where it was last 
spring, before Pyongyang blocked inspections of its nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials suggested that Pyongyang's gesture Thursday might provide a 
face-saving way for both sides to ease tensions and possibly avert a fight over 
imposition of U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea, now being considered 
by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political affairs, said 
the Clinton Administration would begin pursuing the North Korean proposal 
through U.N. diplomatic channels in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can it -- will it -- take the steam out of sanctions?" Clinton asked 
rhetorically, referring to the U.S. proposal for an economic embargo. "It 
depends on the facts . . . ," he said. "And that is what we will attempt to 
determine over the next several hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's unexpected appearance before reporters Thursday reflected the belief 
of his senior foreign policy advisers that he should explain the situation on 
the Korean peninsula and the nation's stake in it to the American public. 
Advisers had grown increasingly concerned that reports on the international 
showdown over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program had alarmed 
Americans without clearly informing them of the nature of the threat and how 
the Administration was responding. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that, as a result, the President would make more 
public appearances to enunciate his foreign policy in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest developments began in an initial meeting between Carter and North 
Korean leader Kim Il Sung. The former President is visiting Pyongyang 
ostensibly as a private citizen, at the request of the North Korean government. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after the session, Carter called the White House to outline what 
he had been told and described the basic elements of the proposal in an 
interview on Cable News Network, which had been permitted to follow the former 
President into North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who on Wednesday had been urging the imposition of a series of 
gradual sanctions on Pyongyang, huddled with top foreign policy advisers 
Thursday as White House officials tried to fend off questions about how the 
Administration would respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the evening, Gallucci delivered the Administration's formal reply, 
clearly hoping to strike a balance between being responsive to the North Korean 
proposal and being prudent -- even wary -- about how genuine it might be. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Washington still intends to push its sanctions proposal at 
the United Nations, at least until it is certain of the details of the North 
Korean offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding U.S. military capability in the region, Clinton said the United 
States "will do whatever is necessary" to reinforce security for 37,000 
American troops helping South Korea protect its border with the North. 
</P>
<P>
 As described by Carter in his television appearance, the North Korean offer 
contains these major elements: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pyongyang wants the United States to resume plans for a third round of 
high-level talks with North Korean officials on a broad range of political and 
economic issues, including substantial aid and closer diplomatic ties -- 
possibly ending in full-fledged recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 * It wants stronger U.S. pressure in negotiations with South Korea on 
achieving a "denuclearized Korean peninsula" -- a stated goal of both sides 
that the North Koreans say the South has not pursued genuinely. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea wants help in replacing its two old-style graphite-moderated 
nuclear reactors -- which routinely produce material that can be converted into 
weapons-grade plutonium -- with light-water reactors that are not associated 
with such byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 * In return, Pyongyang would abandon its earlier plans to expel two inspectors 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which it announced earlier this 
week, and will freeze construction on a second reactor that could be used to 
reprocess spent nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were some reports that North Korea's Kim had asked for direct 
contact with Clinton but U.S. officials suggested that no such session would be 
possible until further progress is made on broader talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had offered Pyongyang virtually everything on its list 
before the North Koreans began rejecting the atomic agency's inspection 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was to have another round of talks with Kim today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Russia, apparently miffed because it did not believe it had been 
consulted adequately by the Administration on the proposed sanctions, said it 
would refuse to support the measure in the Security Council, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who complained about the United States 
to reporters, did not say whether Moscow would veto the sanctions resolution. 
He said he hopes to discuss the proposal soon with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers John M. Broder in Washington, Sam Jameson in Tokyo and 
Richard Boudreaux in Moscow contributed to this report.

SANTA ANA'S HAVING A BALL -- OR FUTBOL -- WITH WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benito Guadalupe has positioned five televisions in his house, two equipped 
with cable to capture World Cup reruns and one outfitted to plug into the 
cigarette lighter in his car -- just in case he's in transit during a perfect 
soccer moment.  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Vargas is happily cashing in, selling World Cup shin guards, flags, 
stickers and posters to the fans who are flocking to his 17th Street store, one 
of the few official World Cup shops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same story down the street at Las Palmas Mexican restaurant, where 
Uruguayan-born owner Raul Muniz says he is fielding 150 calls daily about the 
games he is showing on his big-screen television. And at Teresa's Jewelers on 
4th Street, patrons are busily filling out entry forms for a chance at free 
World Cup watches if they correctly guess today's opening-day scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all our customers are talking about," Saldivar said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the games get underway today in Chicago and Dallas, Santa Ana is Soccer 
Central. That should come as no surprise in a city that boasts 14 of the 
county's 19 Latino Soccer leagues, which have 19,000 players, most of them 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 For hard-core soccer fans, the World Cup -- which comes to Pasadena's Rose 
Bowl Saturday -- is more than just a chance to watch great athletes compete. 
For the region's tens of thousands of residents who were weaned on the sport 
and have long mourned this country's seeming lack of interest, the games are a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the redemption of soccer in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had this opportunity. The American people aren't big lovers of 
futbol , but we're hoping the World Cup will change things for us, that people 
will start to notice us," said Javier Hernandez, 35, who heads a soccer team of 
restaurant workers called Tierra Caliente after their hometown in the Mexican 
state of Guererro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could really use some help," said Hernandez, as he pondered the worn turf 
and weak lighting at Santa Anita Park Wednesday night before his team took the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who came to watch the local teams compete rattled off the names of 
favorite World Cup players and made their allegiances clear: 
</P>
<P>
 "For Mexico, of course, because we are of Mexican origin," said Delica 
Hernandez, 15, of Orange, raising her arms in a show of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Calderon, 23, of Santa Ana, who heads a team called Teloloapan named 
after that Guererro city of 70,000, said his team's game this Sunday has been 
canceled. Instead, the players will cram into Calderon's Santa Ana living room 
to root for the Mexican national team as they play Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud of Mexico, very proud. But if we lose, we'll lose playing well," 
said Calderon. "There's a lot of excitement. I think it will make soccer much 
more popular. Maybe we'll get better soccer programs in the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "These teams take kids out of gangs. Soccer gives them discipline, it gives 
them something to do on the weekends. It can turn them into stars for our 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Other fans, such as Benito Guadalupe, are more focused on the present. The 
27-year-old Guerrero native has been busy positioning the televisions around 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana house he shares with six family members, there is now one 
20-inch screen in the living room, with cable, an identical set-up in one 
bedroom, and two other strategically placed sets.  
</P>
<P>
 The fifth set in his car is a safety net, he explained. When the United States 
played Mexico in a Rose Bowl practice game recently, Guadalupe had a minor car 
accident and got home with only 20 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's against the law to watch TV while you're driving. You could have 
an accident," said Guadalupe, who paints logos on shirts for a living. "But 
this is just in case." 
</P>
<P>
 For Oscar Vargas, a Costa Rica native and longtime soccer lover who opened his 
Soccer Star store on 17th Street in October with his nephew, the World Cup in 
the United States is "like a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 "The soccer community is hoping for a miracle. If the World Cup does really 
well, then people think a flame will be started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The store started out selling $10,000 in goods a month, and is now doing about 
$25,000 a month in sales, said his nephew, Carlos Vargas, 27. They also sold 
about $60,000 in tickets to the recent U.S.-Mexico practice game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia and Mexico are really hot, especially replica jerseys and flags to 
take to the stadium," Carlos Vargas said. "Every day we do better than the last 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the World Cup games will be held in Orange County, but the Colombian 
team is practicing at Cal State Fullerton, and the Romanian team is training at 
UC Irvine. The U.S. team is based in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's soccer enthusiasts are hoping the enthusiasm for the sport will 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 Latino soccer league presidents have been meeting over the past few 
months with Sergio Velasquez, publisher of the Spanish-language newspaper 
Miniondas, based in Santa Ana. Their goal: to carry the momentum of the World 
Cup, and seek corporate endorsements and more city support for the young soccer 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup could open a door for us, in a very big way," said Humberto 
Lopez of Costa Mesa, president of the Restaurant and Hotel Workers Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us know how to play really well, but we don't have the resources," 
added Santiago Garcia, 23, of Orange, who took up the game at 10 in Mexico City 
and now plays on a semiprofessional team that's part of the Orange County 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need role models, someone to come and say, 'You're good,' and give us a 
hand."

SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE AND HER FRIEND ARE BURIED; MOURNING: SEPARATE SERVICES ARE 
HELD. EX-FOOTBALL STAR ATTENDS NICOLE SIMPSON'S FUNERAL WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

 Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, slain side by side in a brutal 
attack that has grabbed the attention of the world, were buried in separate 
funerals Thursday, with O.J. Simpson, a suspect in the killings, attending the 
service for his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's children, 6-year-old Justin and 9-year-old Sydney, accompanied him 
to their mother's funeral in Brentwood and to her burial service in Lake 
Forest. They were sleeping Sunday night when an attacker killed her outside 
their Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westlake Village, mourners gathered to grieve for Goldman, 25, a waiter and 
friend of Nicole Simpson whose body was found a few feet from hers just after 
midnight Sunday. Goldman's sister, who wept as she eulogized him Thursday, 
spoke in memory of him, saying: "I don't know if I ever told you how proud I am 
of the man you have become." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles police released documents detailing a 1989 beating by Simpson of 
his wife. The documents, which include the original police reports of the 
incident, said officers found Nicole Simpson cowering in the bushes, bruised 
and bloodied and afraid for her life. Prosecutors involved in that case said 
Simpson, who did not serve jail time, got off too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detectives interviewed a new witness about her observations on the night of 
the killings. In an interview with The Times, that witness said that while she 
was jogging Sunday night, she spotted a car that closely resembles one owned by 
O.J. Simpson parked across the street from Nicole Simpson's house. She could 
not tell whether anyone was inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles, police studied clothing, shoes and other items belonging to 
Simpson -- whom police sources have identified as the prime suspect -- 
searching for bloodstains or other clues. Meanwhile, in Chicago, another group 
of officers hunted for a possible murder weapon in a field near a hotel where 
Simpson spent a few hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two nationally acclaimed experts, a pathologist and a forensic scientist 
hired by Simpson's lawyer, left for Los Angeles to assist in Simpson's defense 
in the event that he is charged with the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators continued their review of the physical evidence and their 
interviews with possible witnesses, families of each victim gathered 20 miles 
apart for the funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 close friends and family members made their way to Nicole Simpson's 
funeral at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church on Sunset Boulevard in Brentwood 
on Thursday morning, under sunny skies and the buzz of media helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 A phalanx of reporters and camera people flanked narrow Saltair Avenue, on the 
western side of the church grounds, straining for a glimpse of a familiar face 
in a passing car or a stray quote from a mourner. 
</P>
<P>
 Men in dark suits and women in sleek, short-skirted black suits and high heels 
arrived looking solemn behind sunglasses. A line of luxury cars and trendy 
trucks snaked up to the iron gate entrance to the parking lot that bristled 
with private security. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of gatekeeper was performed by Al Cowlings, a former football player 
with Simpson at USC and with the Buffalo Bills. Cowlings waved through familiar 
cars, briefly questioned some arrivals, and greeted most guests with warm hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A white hearse carrying the light wood casket of Nicole Simpson, covered with 
a spray of white roses, arrived shortly after 11 a.m., followed by limousines 
ferrying family members. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson emerged from one and lingered briefly with other family members 
outside the side entrance. He held the hands of his two small children -- his 
daughter in a patchwork print dress and his son in pants and jacket and tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Former football players, Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner and former baseball 
player Steve Garvey were among those attending the Mass, celebrated by the 
church's Msgr. Lawrence O'Leary. Simpson's lawyers also were in attendance. 
Reporters were kept out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," said Garvey after the service in the church, a mixture of 
traditional and contemporary. "Msgr. O'Leary gave probably the most poignant 
and moving homily I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latecomers to the service -- who were forced to wait outside the 
church -- was comedian Byron Allen, who said he last saw O.J. and Nicole 
Simpson together five or six weeks ago at the House of Blues on Sunset 
Boulevard. "They were happy, hanging out, having a good time," Allen said. 
"They sat down at my table for about 10 minutes, had a bite of my salad. . . . 
I figured they were working it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen peered at the parked hearse. "It's devastating," he said. "It's really 
hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hourlong service, family and friends paused outside the side 
entrance, surrounding O.J. Simpson, who was dressed in a black suit and wearing 
sunglasses. Guests embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, said later that Nicole Simpson's mother 
had expressed a wish to him at the service. "Mrs. Brown told me: 'Please take 
good care of him (Simpson). The children need their father.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A mile-long funeral procession headed south to Orange County about 2 p.m. for 
burial services at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest. The site was not far from 
Dana Point, where Nicole Simpson graduated from high school in 1976 and where 
her parents still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was so tight at the service that even the Rev. Bruce Lavery, who 
would officiate, was made to show identification to sheriff's deputies who kept 
guard at the iron gate in front of the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, holding the hand of his son and followed by about 50 relatives and 
friends, walked slowly after the pallbearers onto a green baize carpet and 
under a light gray canopy that had been set up beside the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said Simpson looked "very solemn and hurt" during the service, where he 
was seated with Nicole Simpson's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no estrangement at all," Lavery said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, many mourners lingered, with many exchanging tearful 
embraces and hugging the Simpson children before walking back toward their 
limousines. Just before leaving, several women approached the wooden casket and 
kissed it before turning away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was buried next to her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, including Simpson, was invited to the Monarch Bay home of Nicole's 
parents after the service, Lavery said.  
</P>
<P>
 Friends who could not get into the service gathered in front of the cemetery 
gate and greeted one another with hugs and smiles. Some had attended Rancho 
Alamitos High School in Garden Grove with Nicole and had fondly remembered her 
family. Many reminisced about the Browns' family pool with its high diving 
board, and how the family loved horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really sad to have a school reunion this way," one woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Daly, 42, of Newport Beach, carried a single red rose surrounded by a 
sprig of baby's breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the greatest," said Daly, a family friend. "But I'm not just here for 
Nicole. I'm here for the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chandler, a former teammate on Simpson's USC and Buffalo Bills football 
teams, said the ceremony "was very nice. There was a lot of love and support 
from everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters, photographers and Lake Forest residents whose homes border the 
cemetery peered over back walls and fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Valdivia, 36, who attended Dana Hills High School with Nicole Simpson 
and her sister Denise, had hoped to attend both her memorial service and the 
interment in Lake Forest, but was turned away by security guards. He settled 
for a glimpse of the scene from 200 yards away, borrowing binoculars from 
resident Debbie Sims to gaze over her back-yard wall at the service for the 
young woman he had known. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the type of person who walks into your life and becomes a presence 
there," said Valdivia, who had taken two classes with Nicole and described her 
as a casual friend. "She was very down to earth, very levelheaded and 
wholehearted. There was no phoniness about her at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at a tiny Westlake Village chapel, about 400 of Goldman's friends 
and relatives attended services. Some stood in the chapel's aisle while others 
huddled by the doorway and listened to loudspeakers placed outside. Kim 
Goldman, 22, wept as she said farewell to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in my worst nightmare did I imagine that I would be here in front of our 
family and friends saying how much I'll miss you," she said. "I admire 
everything about you. I don't know if I ever told you how proud I am of the man 
you have become." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, according to his friends, thrived on the excitement of Los Angeles' 
night life, but also spent much of his time working with children. Two of his 
goals were to open a trendy Brentwood bar and work as a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron lived life to its fullest," said Mike Pincus, a longtime friend. "He took 
everything life had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 After the chapel service, hundreds crossed the lawn at Pierce Bros. Valley 
Oaks Memorial Park to attend the burial. The crowd of friends, most in their 
20s, ignored the dozens of television cameras set up across the street as they 
huddled around the grave site. They stood silently as Goldman's stepbrother and 
close friends walked the casket from the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members and friends sobbed as the final prayers were read in Hebrew, 
and the casket was lowered into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't possibly give justice in a service to someone's whole life," said 
Frank Enderle, one of Goldman's friends. "It's just too hard to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 The burials were haunted by the possibility of exhumations, as Shapiro had 
said he wanted a leading national pathologist to conduct his own autopsies to 
check the work of the Los Angeles County coroner's office. But Shapiro -- who 
Thursday identified that pathologist as Dr. Michael Baden of New York -- said 
he had at least temporarily dropped those plans out of deference to the 
victims' families and instead was asking for the cooperation of the county 
coroner's office in supplying his pathologist with information related to the 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the dramatic effect on the family, I have decided not to encroach 
upon the family with this subject during this period of grief," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden is a former chief pathologist for New York City and works for the New 
York State Police as a forensic scientist. Shapiro also is bringing in Henry 
Lee, a nationally known forensic scientist who was retained by lawyers in the 
William Kennedy Smith rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the funerals were under way, investigators continued probing the 
killings and interviewed a new witness, who said she saw a car that resembled 
one owned by Simpson parked across the street from the residence of his ex-wife 
Sunday about the time of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, a young woman who said she jogs in the area every night, said she 
could not be sure whether anyone was in the car when she jogged past, but her 
description of the vehicle generally matches the car that police seized from 
Simpson's home two days ago. The woman -- who met with a homicide detective in 
a church parking lot to avoid the crush of media following the case -- said she 
was familiar with the cars in the area and noticed this one because it was 
parked in an unusual location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a light-colored Ford Bronco or Blazer-type car," the woman, who asked 
not to be identified, said in an interview with The Times. She added that she 
did not see any activity outside the house, nor did she hear anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not released the exact time of death, but sources have placed it 
between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. The woman spotted the car between 9:45 p.m. and 
10:10 p.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, officers seized a white Ford Bronco from Simpson's home. Police 
sources say blood samples were recovered from the upholstery in that vehicle. 
They are testing those samples to determine whether the blood might have come 
from either of the victims or from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Other blood samples taken from the scene match O.J. Simpson's blood type, 
sources close to the case have said. Such a match does not necessarily prove 
that Simpson was at the crime scene because many people share blood types. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are combing clothing, shoes and other items seized from 
Simpson's home to determine whether any of them contain bloodstains and to see 
whether the treads on any of his shoes match tracks found at the crime scene, 
sources said. At least some of that clothing was taken from a washing machine 
at Simpson's home, sources said, adding that detectives are trying to determine 
whether he was trying to wash out bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, meanwhile, police roamed a field near the hotel where Simpson 
briefly stayed Monday, trolling with metal detectors as they searched for a 
possible weapon. Asked about their activities, officers at the scene would only 
say that they were following up on leads provided to them by Chicago police. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, police are nearly ready to forward their investigation 
to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, but prosecutors and 
police are discussing whether to arrest Simpson and then file charges against 
him or to submit the evidence to a grand jury and seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Submitting the case to a grand jury might delay an arrest, but it would 
eliminate the need for a preliminary hearing. Unlike grand jury sessions, 
preliminary hearings are held in public, a spectacle that sources say 
prosecutors are eager to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 While sources said the case is proceeding quickly, Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams -- interviewed from Philadelphia, where he is testifying in a trial -- 
cautioned that it could still take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody expects this case is a slam-dunk, and no homicide case is a 
slam-dunk," Williams said. "We would be beyond the greatest police department 
in the world if we could close a homicide case in four days."

AUDITOR TO PROBE GRADE SWITCHING AT O.C. SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and MIMI KO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea Olinda High School officials acknowledged Thursday that academic 
counselors altered about 360 student grades last fall -- a procedure they now 
concede is illegal -- and hired an auditor to investigate the widening scandal 
at one of the county's most prominent high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As the scope of the grade switching attributed to several former counselors 
emerged Thursday, it was also revealed that Principal John Johnson has been 
aware of the proceeding since last fall, when the school's former registrar 
reported it to him. But Brea Olinda Unified School District Supt. Edgar Z. Seal 
and school board members said they knew nothing of the effort to boost 
students' grade-point averages until the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators reacted with alarm to news that the counselors had changed 1992-93 
letter grades to simple "pass" notations on student records, a practice they 
said damages the reputations of counselors and the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 'Oh my God!" exclaimed California Teachers Assn. President Del Weber when he 
heard the news. "For somebody sitting in an office to change a grade, who's 
never taught the kid in that class, is absolutely unconscionable. . . . It 
destroys the credibility of the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Fred Johnson, head counselor at La Quinta High School in Westminster: 
"Changing transcripts is one of those sacrosanct things. You just don't touch 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a longtime Brea Olinda English teacher said she has filed an 
official complaint with the state's Commission on Teacher Credentialing against 
Brea Olinda Principal Johnson and former counselor Geraldine Gordon, who she 
feels are responsible for the grade switching. 
</P>
<P>
 In her June 8 complaint, Janet Kolb said she learned of the grade switching 
from another teacher in May. She alleges that former registrar Joanne Rizuto 
told her that grades in math, foreign languages and English were changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am appalled and heartsick," said Kolb, who has taught at Brea Olinda for 27 
years. "I (filed the complaint) after much soul-searching and anxiety, not 
because I wanted to, but because I had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Credentialing commission officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Gordon, who now heads the college and career center 
in the Capistrano Unified School District, denied being involved in the 
switching of students' grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember at all OKing P grades for academic classes. That was not 
anything I approved," Gordon said. "I'm not trying to pass the buck, but the 
registrar was leaving and I was leaving and if something crossed my desk I 
could have passed it on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry that they're in such a mess," Gordon said of her former employer. 
"I love Brea. It is such an incredible school. They have done so much good for 
so many people. They've always had the best interests of students at heart. I 
was always proud to be there -- and I'm still proud to be from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who acknowledged learning about the grade switching last October, 
said he immediately changed all inappropriate "pass" notations back to letter 
grades on official transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just know that there were some mistakes made and we've corrected them. And 
everything is where it should be," he said, declining to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizuto, who became Brea Olinda's registrar last summer, said in an interview 
Thursday that she immediately noticed problems with student transcripts, such 
as incorrect course titles and students taking the same courses twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Rizuto said that last September, after returning from time off for foot 
surgery, she found that hundreds of grades from the previous year had been 
switched from letter grades to "pass." Rizuto said she had repeated discussions 
with Johnson, who ordered the letter grades reinstated.  
</P>
<P>
 Rizuto eventually resigned in May, both because she was upset over the 
handling of the grade switching and for financial reasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grade switching came to school board members' attention last month, when 
the local teachers' union filed a grievance. It became public Monday, when it 
was openly discussed by the school board for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal, who said the grade switching "probably was a combination of all of the 
counselors trying to see what they could do to help students get into college," 
admitted that the actions were illegal and unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't change grades," he said. "That's why we changed them all back. Every 
one of those grades had to be changed back so those transcripts are in their 
original shape." 
</P>
<P>
 No disciplinary action against school administrators is planned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School trustees reacted cautiously, saying they would wait for the auditor's 
report on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 'We're going to evaluate what happened and put policies and procedures into 
place so it won't happen again," Trustee Lynn Daucher said. "We're going to ask 
lots of questions. We're going to make sure that no students get hurt, because 
it wasn't their fault." Added Trustee Barbara Paxton: "We're not going to sweep 
this under the rug by any stretch, but I'm not going to point fingers or name 
names." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Seal, the district first initiated a pass/fail option in 1985 to 
encourage students to take advanced mathematics courses without fear of hurting 
their grade-point averages. Officially, students must select the pass/fail 
option within the first six weeks of enrollment in a class and must receive 
permission from their teachers, parents and counselors to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of evolved over a period of time," said Seal, who is retiring this 
month after 37 years in education and 12 heading the Brea Olinda district. "It 
spun out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 After a faculty meeting on Thursday, administrators decided to permit the 
pass/fail option only on elective courses in the future. The district also 
hired a registrar from another local school to audit Brea Olinda's grade books 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Education Code, teachers have the sole authority to 
determine grades. Under the law, administrators or school board officials are 
allowed to change a grade only in case of "fraud, bad faith or incompetency," 
and teachers must be given a chance to respond to the recommended change. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, the teachers' union president, and several local superintendents said 
they had never before heard of such widespread grade-changing. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous individual cases where an administrator changed a student's grade 
-- often for political reasons or to help qualify the student for athletic 
competition -- teachers' unions have filed suit and often prevail in court, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers are the ones responsible for giving grades, counselors work with 
students and advise students and are student advocates," said Jackie Allen, 
president of the American School Counselor Assn. "To my knowledge, it is not a 
practice that counselors without teacher permission do anything in terms of 
grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Several school counselors around the county said the grade changes may reflect 
the pressure counselors are under to help students present the best possible 
portfolios for college applications, pressure that is especially severe at 
competitive schools like Brea Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 students graduate from Brea Olinda each year, and 70% of them go 
directly to college. The school consistently posts high scores on standardized 
tests and has one of the lowest dropout rates in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Brea Olinda was named a Blue Ribbon school, the nation's highest 
academic honor for a school. Several months ago, students were featured on 
nationally televised Pacific Bell advertisements touting the school's 
high-technology opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said the school's prominence increases a fierce need to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really surprise me that it happened," said one 17-year-old, who 
will be a senior in the fall. "Here (at Brea Olinda), it's really important to 
be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who said she ranks near the top of her class, alleged that a 
counselor told her that if she asked for a P instead of a letter grade in one 
course, she could earn her class's top ranking.  
</P>
<P>
 Parent-Teacher-Student Organization President Kris M. St. Clair also 
criticized the grade changing but said she retains confidence in the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry that all this happened and I'm very happy that our school 
board has acted to take corrective measures," she said. "Definitely, the 
students should receive the grades that they have earned. I think all parents 
basically feel that way."

FRANKLIN D. MURPHY DIES; L.A. CIVIC, BUSINESS LEADER; LEGACY: EX-UCLA 
CHANCELLOR, TIMES MIRROR CEO WAS A RENAISSANCE MAN WITH A GIFT FOR BRINGING 
PEOPLE TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Franklin D. Murphy, the doctor, educator, administrator and business executive 
who helped lift Los Angeles onto the cultural, artistic and educational world 
stage through his uncanny ability to weave together people, projects and the 
means to pay for them, died Thursday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who came to Los Angeles in 1960 as chancellor of UCLA and immediately 
declared himself "deeply involved" in his new community, had suffered from 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading UCLA through the turbulent 1960s, Murphy forced the decentralization 
of the University of California and made the Westwood campus an equal partner 
to Berkeley. He went on to be chairman and chief executive officer of Times 
Mirror Co., parent of the Los Angeles Times, from 1968 through 1980, a period 
in which earnings and revenue quadrupled. He served with distinction on the 
boards of four multinational commercial powers -- BankAmerica Corp., Ford Motor 
Co., Hallmark Cards Inc. and Norton Simon Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the quintessential Renaissance man by his contemporaries, Murphy 
indefatigably pursued a parallel career promoting his twin passions of art and 
rare books. Unusual for a man of comparatively modest means, he simultaneously 
became a major player in international philanthropy. Murphy was board chairman 
of the National Gallery of Art, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, which he helped to create, and was an influential 
trustee of the J. Paul Getty Trust. He also chaired the President's Biomedical 
Research Panel, the American Council on Education and the Council on Higher 
Education in the American Republics. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw Los Angeles as "well on its way to manifest destiny as one of the great 
and vital cities of the world" and set out to make sure it got there. Through 
his administrative efforts in offices and board rooms or behind the scenes, the 
pragmatic Missourian prodded his adopted community toward greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did for the city the same thing he did for UCLA," said Robert H. Ahmanson, 
president of the Ahmanson Foundation on whose board Murphy served for many 
years. "He raised it from second-rate to first-rate, and that is the goal he 
always worked toward." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what Murphy did for both the university and the city, said Charles E. 
Young, who followed Murphy as UCLA chancellor, was simply to instill a sense of 
self-worth, energizing both to raise funds, recruit leaders and build new 
centers of learning and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 25 to 30 years," said Young, "Franklin Murphy is probably the 
most seminal person across the board in terms of the growth and development of 
the Los Angeles community into a world leader." 
</P>
<P>
 How Murphy accomplished that, his contemporaries observe, was to know 
seemingly everything and everybody, know what needed to be done and then 
gracefully blend components to further his humanistic vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a rare gift of knowing who should know whom and getting them 
together," said Robert Skotheim, president of the Huntington Library, who 
regularly sought Murphy's advice about personnel and acquisitions. "The 
strategy or the purpose for that was unquestionably his intellectual curiosity 
about how things work and his motivation to be an actor. Despite the fact that 
the world would have regarded him as an academic administrator until his 50s, 
he had a very great activist impulse to cause things to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times you find Franklin's invisible hand in the process," Skotheim 
said. "He was just unique in being involved as a mastermind, a planner, a 
helper behind the scenes. I can't think of anybody who did not have great 
personal wealth who has had a comparable philanthropic impact on educational 
and cultural institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 That hand of the veteran board member, for instance, was credited for moving 
Rusty Powell from head of the Los Angeles County Art Museum to direct the 
National Gallery of Art; for guiding Harold Williams from Norton Simon Inc. to 
the UCLA Graduate School of Business and, after a stint chairing the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, to head the prestigious J. Paul Getty Trust; for 
mentoring and leading his own assistant, Young, to replace him at UCLA and 
Robert F. Erburu ultimately to follow him at Times Mirror, and for persuading 
Ahmanson to dispense gifts from the foundation of his wealthy late uncle, 
Howard F. Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a part of his genius. He knew the right man for the right place," 
said Ahmanson, whose family foundation hands out more than $20 million a year 
for education, art, medical and other human services in Southern California. 
"In 1968 when Howard died, we were in need of a chairman, and Franklin was the 
one who said, 'You should do it.' I hadn't even considered it, and it has been 
the best thing that ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In another example of Murphy's fortuitous matchmaking, he decided that 
prestigious Notre Dame University's new library needed microfilm copies of the 
unique Ambrosian Collection of early Italian manuscripts housed in Milan, 
Italy. Murphy found the necessary million dollars of foundation money and got 
the manuscripts copied, recalled Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus 
of Notre Dame, with amusement and admiration for his old friend and 
contemporary educator. 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplishment did more than further Murphy's own interest in preserving 
early Italian printing. When the Milan library closed for several years for 
major renovation, Hesburgh said, Notre Dame became the world's only source of 
the precious material, and, incidentally, helped Interpol unmask a counterfeit 
manuscript offered to Sotheby's for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franklin ought to get credit for that," said Hesburgh, who also joined the 
Council on Higher Education in the American Republics only because Murphy 
convinced reluctant South American educators that Catholic countries needed at 
least one Catholic leader in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, Murphy also helped the Ahmanson Foundation establish the 
Ahmanson-Murphy Aldine Collection of about 800 volumes of precious 15th- and 
16th-Century books at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance scholars from around the world are sharing Aldine papers this week 
in Italy at the International Conference in Honor of Dr. Franklin Murphy. More 
than 50 participants, who were unaware of his death, sent a letter that arrived 
in Murphy's office Thursday, stating: "All of us regret your absence from this 
event in your honor, and we send you warmest greetings and all our very best 
wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy created what was ultimately named the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture 
Garden at UCLA, because he noticed a flat, barren area of campus and through 
his connections learned that a collector of contemporary sculpture might donate 
the works to a worthy recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't take him long to put two or three people together to achieve a gift 
to UCLA of 50 to 70 sculptures. And his attitude was that these pieces should 
go out into the landscape environment to be a central hub where students could 
meditate," said Lee Walcott, managing director of the Ahmanson Foundation. 
"Today it's a wonderful, tranquil spot on campus. . . . It is a wonderful 
living tribute to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Immersed in promoting art and rare books and education, the doctor's son never 
forgot his own medical training. Murphy himself proved to be the right man in 
the right place, said A.W. Clausen, former president and chief executive 
officer of BankAmerica Corp. and president of the World Bank, when Bank of 
America board Chairman Chauncey Medberry collapsed at a shareholders' meeting 
in San Francisco. Board member Murphy was quickly out of his chair, Clausen 
said, loosening Medberry's collar and pounding on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues attribute Murphy's ability to accomplish so much to such qualities 
as his extraordinary intellect, knowledge, judgment, instantaneous 
decision-making, taste, sensitivity, availability, enthusiasm, vision and 
outstanding people skills, adding up to a special wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Chandler, who succeeded Murphy as chairman of the board of Times Mirror, 
said Murphy's greatest contribution "has been that he has recognized and 
developed the talents of the people who operate this company and its major 
divisions." He said Murphy recognized that it was best "to encourage them, to 
provide counsel to them, but not interfere with their day-to-day operations. 
That I define as superb wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his own respected eye for art, Murphy typically left acquisitions of 
paintings and other objects to curators. "In all the museums that I have been 
involved with," he told a British art magazine in 1991, "one thing that I have 
always fought for is that the final decision be with the professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing how an educator interested in art became so valuable to business, 
Clausen noted: "The most serious problem in most business is people." Because 
he was so adept at evaluating and dealing with people, Clausen said, Murphy 
became one of the bank's all-time best directors and a valuable adviser to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had an enormous amount of good common sense. He had his feet very firmly 
on the ground. He was very practical and pragmatic on business issues, 
government issues, or even social issues," said Clausen, "and that meant he was 
very wise." 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason he was asked to do so many things was he was not egocentric," said 
Roger Heyns, who was chancellor at UC Berkeley during the turbulent 1960s when 
Murphy was chancellor at UCLA. "He was there for the activity or event and that 
made people trust him. And he was a peppy person. Conversation with him was fun 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Clausen said Murphy was also totally devoid of arrogance or braggadocio and 
had an inoffensive manner in stating his own (usually right) ideas and 
deflecting wrong ones, adding with a chuckle: "There was no barbed wire or 
rusty glass in his comments." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin David Murphy was born in Kansas City, Mo., the son of a physician, 
Dr. Franklin E. Murphy, and a concert pianist, Cordelia Brown Murphy. A 
straight-A student who quarterbacked his high school football team, Murphy 
attributed his love of books to his bibliophile father and his love of art to 
an aunt who was a painter in Paris at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Kansas in 1936, where he 
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, spent a year on an exchange fellowship at the 
University of Goettingen in Germany and earned his M.D. at the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of World War II, Murphy joined the Army and worked on research 
into malaria and other tropical diseases, earning the rank of captain and a 
citation and commendation ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his native Kansas City to set up a medical practice, he taught 
part-time at the nearby University of Kansas School of Medicine. He became dean 
of the school in 1948, when he was only 32, and was soon named by the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce as one of America's 10 outstanding young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Murphy was named chancellor of the university. He was so 
popular that when he agreed to leave for Westwood in 1960, students burned the 
Kansas governor in effigy for allegedly driving Murphy out, chanting, "We want 
Murphy!" 
</P>
<P>
 In his inaugural address at UCLA, Murphy promised to lead the school to "major 
scholarly distinction in worldwide terms." To achieve less, he said, "would 
represent unimaginable lack of vision and inexcusable timidity." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, UCLA added about 40 new buildings, increased its student 
body from 20,000 to 30,000, and weathered one of the most politically 
tumultuous periods for all universities. Although UCLA never saw the student 
unrest over Vietnam that erupted at Berkeley, Murphy still had to contend with 
the developing free speech movement. He did it by drawing students into an 
"advising process" while making clear that he would make the final policy 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 When 150 students staged a sit-in outside his office in 1967 to protest his 
refusal to halt on-campus job interviews by Dow Chemical Co., manufacturer of 
napalm, Murphy said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe the technique of the dialogue has failed. There has been a 
momentary break as a result of the passions brought about by the war, but we 
will not have chronic disorder on this campus. The faculty will not tolerate it 
and most of the students won't either." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy himself had championed freedom of speech as a student at the University 
of Kansas, arranging for controversial speakers, including a sociologist who 
discussed trial marriage -- much to the consternation of Murphy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 While calming and building UCLA, Murphy reached into the community to help 
create Los Angeles County's Museum of Art and Music Center and into the nation 
to help the Kress Foundation place art in the National Gallery and elsewhere. 
He earned such respect in artistic circles that Paul Mellon personally asked 
him to join the National Gallery board and tapped Murphy as his successor as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his two decades at the University of Kansas and UCLA and more than 
two decades at Times Mirror (12 years as chairman and chief executive officer, 
six as chairman of the board's executive committee and several as director 
emeritus), Murphy plied his matchmaking talents in a variety of other 
organizations not previously mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 He served on the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the 
Study Committee on Federal Aid to Public Health of the Commission on 
Intergovernmental Relations, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Educational 
Exchange, the State Universities Assn., the Foreign Intelligence Advisory 
Board, the Federal Commission on Government Security, the U.S. Advisory 
Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs to the Department 
of State, the Peace Corps National Advisory Council, and the Special Medical 
Advisory Group of the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked on the board of consultants of the National War College and the 
board of visitors to the U.S. Air Force's Air University, the Medical Advisory 
Commission of the American Legion, the Council on Medical Education and 
Hospitals of the AMA, the American Council on Education's Committees on 
Institutional Research Policy and on Problems and Policies, the Woodrow Wilson 
National Fellowship Foundation, the Presidential Task Forces on both the Arts 
and the Humanities and on Private Sector Initiatives, the Urban Institute, the 
board of governors of the American Red Cross and the national council of the 
Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as a trustee of the California Museum of Science and Industry, 
the Institute of International Education, the University of Pennsylvania, the 
Salk Institute, the Eisenhower Exchange Scholarship Program and the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts garnered Murphy 17 honorary doctorates; awards from Italy, the 
Netherlands, Japan, Germany, France and Spain; such varied honors as the 
Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, the UCLA Medal, and the Andrew W. Mellon Medal 
of the National Gallery of Art, and designation as a fellow in the American 
Assn. for the Advance of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and 
the Royal Society of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franklin," a Times colleague once said to him, "you are a walking 
interlocking directorate." 
</P>
<P>
 "That," said Murphy with a twinkle in his eye, "is how I get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Franklin Murphy is irreplaceable," said Erburu, the chairman, president and 
chief executive officer of Times Mirror Co. "We will miss him terribly." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, the former Judith Joyce 
Harris of Beverly Hills; four children, Joyce Dickey, Martha Crockwell, Carolyn 
Speer, and Dr. Franklin Lee Murphy, and one sister, Cordelia M. Ennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the UCLA Research 
Library Special Collections Department for the Ahmanson-Murphy Aldine 
Collection.

KOREANS IN JAPAN TARGETS OF HOSTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was riding the morning train to school when the middle-aged Japanese man 
came up behind her and slashed her traditional Korean uniform. She kept her 
mouth shut because she was afraid he would attack her more if she screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 11th-grader could not hide her terror as she described her experience 
on national television Wednesday. "I was so scared," she recalled. "I couldn't 
say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, also interviewed, declared in anguish, "I'm worried that the next 
time it will be a threat to my daughter's life." 
</P>
<P>
 As tensions escalate over the international standoff with North Korea over 
inspection of its nuclear facilities, the fallout is affecting a vulnerable 
target in Japan: the 700,000 Koreans here, especially the estimated 200,000 
supporters of the Communist regime of Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Pyongyang Koreans have been thrust into the spotlight over claims they 
supply as much as $600 million in money and materiel that may have helped North 
Korea's nuclear program. Japanese police are bearing down on them as possible 
terrorist agents; some Japanese worry they may carry out Kim's threatened 
"declaration of war" in Japan should the U.N. Security Council later this month 
approve sanctions, which Tokyo has pledged to support. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear and distrust of Koreans here has been heightened by sensational 
reports of 600 North Korean spies in Japan, of mysterious radio waves broadcast 
to Japan from Pyongyang every night to transmit marching orders, of secret 
money flows and of elaborate espionage rings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some Japanese are using the crisis to give vent to anti-Korean 
feelings through a growing number of hate crimes and protests. More than 
isolated events, the harassment, Koreans say, underscores the entrenched 
animosity they have experienced since their people began migrating -- or were 
conscripted -- for work after Japan colonized Korea in 1910. Most Koreans 
arrived here between 1920 and 1944 and their offspring have stayed through 
postwar repatriation waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1988 Seoul Olympics, their image and status in Japan have improved 
considerably, Korean officials say. Korean traditions -- from language study to 
dining on their spicy foods, such as pickled vegetables known as kimchi -- are 
gaining wider acceptance in Japan. But Koreans say they still suffer 
discrimination in jobs and housing, education and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe Kwan Ik, spokesman for Chongryun, the pro-Pyongyang residents group in 
Japan, said: "Historically speaking, in Japanese society there has been a 
strong bias and prejudice toward Koreans. Each time something happens on the 
Korean peninsula, you will see this kind of aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, at least 20 students -- mostly female -- attending pro-Pyongyang 
schools in Japan have been terrorized by skirt slashings, name-calling, 
beatings and theft, Chongryun said. A Korean boy in Osaka was riding his bike 
home when five Japanese students threw rocks at him and shouted, "We will kill 
Koreans!" The group also reports a rise in anti-Korean graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, about 1,400 Kyoto police raided a North Korean school and 26 
Chongryun offices and homes on the pretext that the group had failed to notify 
the city about a land deal. After a 10-hour search, police admitted they had 
erred and the transaction had been properly reported. But that did not stop 
officials from confiscating boxes of documents that Chongryun says detail the 
group's finances and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese authorities have denied having political motivations and say 
officers made an honest mistake, "it's quite apparent that the police wanted 
inside information about our organization," Choe said. "It's quite obvious that 
they are trying to suppress our organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, some Japanese officials say the alleged threat posed by Koreans 
here is exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 On the controversial issue of remittances of money and materiel to Pyongyang, 
for instance, Japanese sources say the amount seems to have dropped recently. 
The widely reported figure of remittances of $600 million to $800 million is 
based on a 1990 estimate of 15,000 visitors each year to Pyongyang 
hand-carrying $30,000 per person, in addition to bank transfers and other 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japanese sources say the latest figures indicate the remittances may be as 
little as $100 million. They speculate that Koreans in Japan have reduced sums 
they are sending home because of nervousness over the political furor, the 
recessionary pinch in their own finances and a reported order from Pyongyang 
not to send money directly to relatives but to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Chongryun itself says the contributions amount to only $23 million and that 
the number of visitors to Pyongyang has dropped from 8,691 in 1992 to 5,157 
last year. "Our businessmen have been hard hit by the collapse of the 
(Japanese) economy," Choe said. "Who dares send money free of charge?" 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese economic sources also say that Koreans in Japan have in the last year 
drastically reduced their business investment, which had provided critical 
machinery and equipment to Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials are divided on how great a security risk Chongryun is. One 
police source said Japanese radical organizations pose a greater threat than 
Chongryun, whose members, when compared with the group's founders, are younger, 
less nationalistic and more assimilated. 
</P>
<P>
 But others dispute that assessment and say Chongryun members will be forced to 
cooperate in acts of terrorism, because Pyongyang holds their relatives hostage 
in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows that better than individuals like the frail woman who showed up 
earlier this year at a Tokyo meeting that aimed to aid North Koreans with 
stranded relatives. In a tearful interview, the woman, who gave only her 
Japanese surname of Yamada, said her elder brother, a biology professor, had 
repatriated to North Korea in 1961 at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Dazzled by Pyongyang's propaganda depicting North Korea as a paradise for 
Koreans, he was one of more than 90,000 Koreans who repatriated from Japan, 
mostly in the 1960s. "He wanted to be a bridge between Japan and Korea," Yamada 
said. "But once he arrived he found there were no microscopes, no books. There 
was no milk for newborn babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few years, his parents, at his request, sent him -- via the 
Chongryun organization -- science books, research equipment, clothes and tens 
of thousands of dollars in cash, Yamada said. 
</P>
<P>
 But six years after he left, they got their last letter from him, saying, "I 
can't live like this any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 The demands for money from Chongryun continued, Yamada said. "They would 
promise if we donated money, my parents would be permitted to go to North Korea 
and visit and his treatment would improve." And after he stopped writing, 
officials told them they would investigate his case if donations continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Yamada and her family learned he had been sent to "something like 
a prison" and died. Now she is driven by a promise to her dying mother that she 
would search for his wife and three children, still believed alive in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrimination that led Yamada's brother to repatriate to North Korea 
still exists, Koreans say, noting a history of ugly incidents. In 1990, 
scandals involving Korean-owned pinball parlors prompted an outbreak of 
hostility; there were earlier problems, after the November, 1987, bombing of a 
Korea Air jet by North Korean agents off the coast of Burma (now Myanmar). Such 
harassment dates to 1923, when the Great Kanto Earthquake set off rumors that 
Koreans were poisoning water supplies. The tales instigated mob violence that 
left 6,000 Koreans dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans here say they also suffer social and economic discrimination. Although 
more big Japanese companies are hiring Koreans -- including the Bank of Tokyo, 
trading giant Mitsubishi and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- most still work in 
small businesses, such as restaurants or pinball parlors, because they cannot 
easily get jobs in major Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiko Lee, 38, said she never personally felt discrimination because she 
attended Korean schools in Japan and generally associated with other Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she has no expectation that her three children can land jobs with 
major Japanese firms or enter top Japanese universities. The Ministry of 
Education still does not allow graduates of Korean schools in Japan to enter 
national universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee laments that her Korean education at the Chongryun-sponsored school taught 
her ideology but few useful skills for succeeding in Japanese life. "I feel I 
am an incomplete person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Koreans also complain that they are ineligible for pensions, voting 
rights and employment as public school teachers and government workers. 
Discrimination is not the only reason: Japanese citizenship is a requirement 
and most Koreans do not naturalize, even though eligible to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Legally, the Japanese government settled the major outstanding issue for 
Koreans here in 1991 when it extended the right for their people -- many 
technically stateless -- to live permanently in Japan under Korean citizenship. 
That status had been granted only to first-generation Koreans, not their 
descendants. (Unlike the United States, citizenship is automatically granted 
only to those with a Japanese parent.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Korean activists are pressing on other issues, such as the right 
for non-citizens to vote, others are being lulled into the increasingly 
comfortable life in Japan. As one indication, more Koreans are naturalizing as 
citizens: 7,698 in 1993, compared to 4,759 in 1989.

POLICE UNION LEADERS OK RIORDAN DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a potential breakthrough in the police labor dispute, Police Protective 
League leaders on Thursday agreed to a tentative contract proposed by Mayor 
Richard Riordan and other city officials, but the deal still faces significant 
opposition on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract offer accepted by the union board of directors -- which sources 
said would cost the city about $10 million more than the deal officers voted 
down in May -- was presented by Riordan, Councilman Richard Alatorre and others 
at a meeting Wednesday night at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if there is any way possible for the council and (union) members to 
accept this proposal, it absolutely should be done," Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams said in a telephone interview from Philadelphia. "We should do 
everything we can to restore stability to the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and his allies circumvented the city's formal negotiating committee 
in drafting their package and taking it directly to union leaders. As a result, 
several key council members were very critical of the plan and said it would 
cost more than the city could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Those critics said the offer would significantly cut into Riordan's police 
expansion plan -- resulting in the equivalent of 250 fewer officers on the 
streets -- and would put the city at financial risk.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our people, I believe, had no clue as to the cost of what they were agreeing 
to until after they agreed to it," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the 
council's budget chairman. "It is one of the most appalling things I have seen 
in 19 years as a member of the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan called the plan a "reasonable deal (that) hurts both sides a little." 
He conceded that the pay raises could take money away from his plan to put more 
police on the streets. But he said "ingenuity" could preserve the plan and 
cited, as an example, a special committee that is looking for ways to reduce 
the amount of time that police spend in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer was seen as a last-ditch attempt by city officials to put the 
contract dispute behind them and avoid disruptions during the World Cup soccer 
tournament -- even if the proposal crimps their future budget plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the $50-million offer would give police a 7% raise over the 
next 18 months and payments of $1,000 this year and $500 next year to make up 
for the two years officers went without a contract. Patrol officers would 
receive an additional 1% hike this year and 1% next year as incentive pay, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $40-million deal that officers overwhelmingly rejected in May called for 
6% raises over the next two years without the patrol bonus or the retroactive 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear which side would next take action on the pact. Riordan said the 
offer would be presented to police officers for ratification before a formal 
City Council vote, which is expected to be close. But police union President 
Danny Staggs said he believed ratification meetings, scheduled to begin 
Tuesday, would come after the council gathered the eight votes necessary to 
approve the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an agreement that . . . everyone, our entire membership, has something 
in there for them," Staggs said. "It's not exactly what we would like. It's not 
going to be exactly what everyone would like." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which came the day after the city declared an impasse in the 
dispute, was presented to the union's 115 delegates Thursday night at the 
Police Academy. That move was a first step in gathering officers' support for 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the proposal is under consideration, the union called on officers to 
cancel any unauthorized job actions planned to interfere with the World Cup -- 
including picketing at Los Angeles International Airport that had been 
scheduled for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking our members, as a show of our good faith and professionalism 
and for the sake of the public, to refrain from participating in any wildcat 
actions such as a 'blue flu,' which we believe would be counterproductive to 
the negotiating process," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with council members indicate that the vote will be close, decided 
by one or two swing votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to kill the deal, Yaroslavsky and Councilman Marvin Braude 
called a special joint committee meeting for this morning to analyze the plan 
and disclose how it would affect the mayor's plan to expand the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said the deal is far costlier than some officials realize. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Riordan has promised to give firefighters the same raise that 
police receive -- a pledge that would cost the city nearly $40 million in the 
coming year if the contract is approved, $15 million more than the mayor 
budgeted for raises.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan "has made the intellectual and political decision not to deliver fully 
on his Project Safety Los Angeles plan -- to have higher salaries and not as 
many more police," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, was concerned that 
the deal was not presented through normal channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes outside the city's . . . procedure," Braude said. "Nobody speaks 
for the city except the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said the unorthodox negotiations might set a 
dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has made council members feel discounted and unimportant in the 
process," Goldberg said. "Now union leaders will think that all they have to do 
is get one or two key council members and work something out on the side." 
</P>
<P>
 Another critic of the deal, Councilwoman Rita Walters, said she is concerned 
about the city's financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have a settlement that breaks the bank," she said, predicting that 
the offer would trigger aggressive salary demands from other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alatorre, who played a major role in brokering the deal, accused his 
colleagues of hypocrisy. "Some people keep saying they love the police, but 
when it comes time for a raise they won't do it. It's not going to bankrupt us. 
That's just bull," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed that money for the raises might reduce a police overtime account, 
which had been set aside to put the equivalent of about 800 officers on the 
street in the coming year. "What is the point of saying we are going to 
increase the force if we can't even keep the officers we have?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he had been told that overtime accounts for police could be 
reduced by $10 million or $15 million in the coming year to pay for the police 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can still have a major increase in police presence and improvement in 
public safety," Williams said. "It will not be 100% of what the public safety 
plan called for, not quite. But it will (still) be more than a 100% increase 
over what we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who were considered supporters of the deal were Alatorre, council 
President John Ferraro and council members Hal Bernson, Rudy Svorinich Jr., 
Joel Wachs and Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the union held out the hope that they could sell the deal to 
officers, they remained cautious and said the two-year labor dispute is not yet 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an uphill battle ahead of us," Staggs said. "There are still members 
of the City Council that view any fair and equitable police contract as 
unattainable."

BROKERING VOTES FOR HEALTH REFORM BEGINS IN EARNEST; POLITICS: SPECIAL 
INTERESTS -- OIL AND TOBACCO -- STEP UP LOBBYING. DEAL MAKING MAY BE ONLY WAY 
TO GET BILL PASSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hey, it's just a thought, Mr. President. Just an offhand suggestion on how to 
get around a sticky little legislative technicality -- and one that might make 
it a bit easier for you to get that health bill through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe all the health bill needs is, say, a tax break or two for the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing that idea, offered Thursday when President Clinton met with about 
60 oil-patch lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen "just kind of put his 
head in his hands," said Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who had broached the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol Hill hand that he is, Bentsen knew that -- as surely as the National 
Anthem is followed by the words "Play ball" -- he was hearing the opening pitch 
in a time-honored game. And the playing field in this case -- health care 
reform -- is bigger and richer than anything Congress has seen for a long, long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is as high a priority for the President -- and, therefore, no bill is 
likely to involve more incongruous trades to get it passed. The nation has 
heard two years of soaring rhetoric invoking high moral principle, a 
generation's duty to its sick and vulnerable. But in the end, it is likely to 
take scores of far-flung breaks for special constituencies to make the 
legislation happen. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem odd, for instance, that a congressional committee working to 
improve health care would vote to lower a proposed tax on such a notorious 
carcinogen as tobacco. But that is precisely what the House Ways and Means 
Committee did Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 24-14 vote, the committee scaled back Clinton's proposed 75-cent-a-pack 
cigarette tax increase in favor of a 45-cent increase, because that was the 
most that Democratic Rep. Lewis F. Payne Jr. of a tobacco-growing Virginia 
district said he would support. And the committee needs his vote, if it is to 
get any bill at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers are getting plenty of advice on what they should ask for. Last 
weekend, while the rest of the Capitol was dark, no fewer than 70 lobbyists 
could be seen going in and out of the Ways and Means Committee chamber with 
other proposed amendments to be considered by overworked Republican staff 
members, according to a Washington Post report. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest sense, the crafting of the health care bill will be an example 
of politics as the art of the possible -- and of the cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about lawmakers brokering health reform votes in exchange for oil 
concessions, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
deadpanned: "Grazing fees come first with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan can afford to scoff at those who must get their breaks by begging for 
them. As chairman of a pivotal committee, he can write his in himself -- as he 
did when he included $40 billion in aid to academic medical centers (of which 
New York has many) in the legislation that will serve as his panel's first 
draft of health care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux said that Clinton was noncommittal about his proposal to add 
oil-industry tax breaks to the health care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other oil-staters also vehemently deny any suggestion that their health 
care votes might be tied to any special deals for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not think there would be that much direct linkage. Health care is too 
important," said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee and one of those who met with Clinton. 
"It may sweeten the pot a little bit for some marginal voter who is right on 
the fence but I just don't see the linkage." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the oil-patch legislators also point out that the oil business is 
hurting and that it would take a tax bill to ease its financial problems. By 
happy coincidence, the only tax bill on the horizon is the health legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been done before," Breaux said, when it was suggested that the health 
bill could be loaded down with unrelated goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry and its allies are seeking a series of breaks, including tax 
credits to encourage production from new and marginal wells, reductions of 
penalties for pollution and measures that would reduce imports of refined 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 On the oil industry's side is one of the most formidable and savvy allies any 
interest group could have: Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee and one of the chief architects of the 
health reform effort in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Dingell co-signed a letter to Clinton that implicitly linked the 
issues of energy and health as "two very important domestic policy concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 "In particular, two vitally important issues must be resolved this year, both 
of which affect the long-term economic security of this nation and its 
citizens," the letter said. "Specifically, we are concerned with the economic 
devastation occurring in the energy industry and we believe that comprehensive 
health care reform must be adopted during this Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Few in Congress are as skilled as Dingell in figuring out where the votes are 
on a bill, and what it takes to get them. The version that he is drafting is 
laden with breaks for such important groups as small business and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made a high-profile concession that would weaken Clinton's proposal to 
give the government significant leverage over the prices of breakthrough drugs 
-- a move that allowed two freshmen on his committee, Reps. Lynn Schenk (D-San 
Diego) and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.), to claim a significant victory 
for the biotechnology firms of their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are facing difficult battles for reelection, and won wide praise from the 
businesses in their districts for winning the biotechnology breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all his maneuvering, Dingell still finds himself several votes short 
of a majority. Which means that the dealing is not over.

COLUMN ONE; ILLUSION, REALITY AND HEROES; SHOULD IT COME AS A SURPRISE THAT 
ANOTHER AMERICAN ICON -- O.J. SIMPSON -- MAY BE TUMBLING FROM GRACE? NOT 
REALLY, SAY STUDENTS OF SOCIETY'S LOVE-HATE AFFAIR WITH THE FAMOUS.

<P>
 Heroes are created by popular demand, sometimes out of the scantiest 
materials, or none at all.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Gerald W. Johnson, in his 1943 book, "American Heroes and Hero-Worship" 
</P>
<P>
 There is a moment, in the lives of some whom society holds up as idols, when 
private character collides with a public persona. It is at this juncture that 
Americans often make a jarring, unwanted discovery: Their gods have feet of 
clay. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Kennedy, we learn after his death, cheated on his genteel wife. A 
bloated Elvis Presley, his body brimming with drugs, takes his last breath on a 
bathroom floor. Jimmy Swaggart cavorts with a hooker. Magic Johnson cuts short 
his brilliant basketball career, disclosing that his promiscuity is responsible 
for his infection with the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is O.J. -- so likable, so friendly, so familiar that the initials 
need not be followed by a last name. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not charged with any crime, but he has wandered into a maelstrom that 
already is tarnishing his reputation, possibly beyond recovery. In the minds of 
his public lurk unspeakable, unthinkable images that do not comport with their 
perception of a man who has befriended them through their TV and movie screens. 
</P>
<P>
 News vans and paparazzi now surround Simpson's Brentwood home, angling for the 
perfect shot. Defense lawyers speak for a man who once spoke eloquently for 
himself. Ugly details of spousal abuse are being aired anew. Unnamed police 
sources whisper about shreds of evidence -- a bloody glove, stains on a 
driveway -- that may or may not implicate the man many call the greatest 
running back of all time in the slaying of his pretty former wife and her 
handsome waiter friend, 10 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hero, it seems, is falling from grace. People are shocked, 
disappointed. "He seemed like such a civilized guy," one crushed fan laments as 
he pores over a newspaper story containing sordid allegations that Simpson had 
beaten his wife in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Should another tumbling icon come as any big surprise? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really, according to psychologists, sociologists and observers of popular 
culture. Scandals such as the one enveloping O.J. Simpson come about, these 
experts say, because of the unique tendency of Americans -- through television, 
the movies, the print media and advertising -- to embellish heroes by assigning 
qualities of perfection to those who are not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of the medium of celebrity is to make (stars) seem familiar to 
us," said David Harris, a San Francisco writer and author of a book on the 
National Football League. "We think we know them. They are people that are in 
some way included, in the psychological sense, as extended family. That's the 
illusion that keeps being punctured in these things. Stepping back from it, how 
could we think we knew who he was?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even Harris said part of him -- the part that is purely a football fan -- 
was stunned to learn that police are considering Simpson a suspect in the 
brutal slayings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. The pair were discovered stabbed to death shortly after 
midnight Sunday, their blood-soaked bodies sprawled on a walkway near the 
Brentwood condominium where Nicole Simpson lived with the couple's two young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no. No no noooo," Harris said, recounting his reaction to the news. "Not 
O.J. Simpson. This couldn't be. I didn't want it to be true. Nobody wants it to 
be true." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Famous people are very important in a democratic society," said Leo Braudy, 
an English professor at USC and author of "The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its 
History." Americans, Braudy said, "have an ongoing preoccupation with the 
famous as enlarged images of ourselves, ideal versions, versions of traits we'd 
like to have . . . or do have in small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the very reason the public can idealize famous people is that stars enjoy 
a luxury few others have: the ability to create a public image that is separate 
from -- and sometimes not consistent with -- one's private life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fame is the most obvious place where individuals, private people, can create 
a personality that exists not just for their family or for their inner nature, 
but for an audience," Braudy said. "The whole question of who we are when we 
are alone is something that the issue of fame plays around with in an 
intriguing way." 
</P>
<P>
 The more people expect of a famous person, experts say, the more difficult it 
is for the public to accept that their idols fall short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 When a rock 'n' roll star with an outlaw image gets in trouble, the public is 
not particularly surprised -- and experts say the star's standing may even be 
enhanced by his escapades. But when, in the wake of the death of Martin Luther 
King Jr., reports emerge that the revered civil rights leader may have been a 
philanderer, his admirers are devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when we heard about the Watergate tapes," said Century City 
psychologist Lilli Friedland. "To hear that the President could talk in that 
kind of gutter language. . . . It took something away from the power of the 
office, from the awesomeness of it all. It made it almost too human." 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, through Watergate and other political scandals, Americans have come 
to expect less of their politicians -- so much so that although U.S. Sen. Gary 
Hart was forced out of a presidential race after being linked with a woman 
other than his wife, Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency despite 
allegations of marital infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sports world is a place where people still yearn for untainted heroes 
to remain untainted, said Steven Stark, who comments on popular culture for 
National Public Radio. So it is especially devastating when sports heroes fall. 
Recent sports history is full of scandal, ranging from outfielder Darryl 
Strawberry's drug problems to boxer Mike Tyson's conviction for rape to 
baseball great Pete Rose's gambling troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports is this place that we like to think is pure, whereas the rest of 
society has been corrupted," Stark said. "It's a place where clear rules apply. 
There is always black and white, there is a winner and a loser. In a culture 
where so much else has gotten confused, where so many other images have gotten 
blurred, it is very important for people to hold on to these pristine images of 
sports. So when these sorts of scandals occur in the sports world, it is 
terribly upsetting to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Also terribly upsetting, psychologists and others say, are scandals in which 
children are let down. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Pee Wee Herman, who was arrested in a Florida X-rated movie house, 
said Michael Kamins, a USC marketing professor. "Pee Wee Herman," Kamins said, 
"was for kids. You said: 'Oh my god, how could he do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A similar refrain -- "Could he really do that?" -- is now being echoed across 
the nation about Simpson, despite the legal presumption that he is innocent. 
The shock is especially acute because of the vast gulf between the football 
star's image and the grisly nature of the crime at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Orenthal James Simpson has long been more, much more, than a great football 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 His early story was the stuff of media legends -- a local boy who made good 
and overcame a difficult life, born in what was then the predominantly black 
Potrero Hill section of San Francisco to a hospital worker mother who was 
separated from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He led an aimless, street-corner existence," reads one 1969 biography of 
Simpson, "running with a gang and coming close to serious trouble with the law 
on several occasions before his energies found a positive outlet in athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 His statistics spoke for themselves. When his career ended, he had carried the 
ball more times -- 2,404 -- than any previous running back in pro football 
history; he had rushed for more yards -- 11,236 -- than anyone except Jim 
Brown; he had gained more ground in one season -- 2,003 yards in 1973 -- than 
any other player before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Any athlete can rack up numbers. Simpson had style. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, he was elegant, graceful; when he retired in 1979, the 
Washington Post sports page wrote of "moves that Nureyev could envy . . . fakes 
and sprints and balletic leaps, a powerful choreography that elevated running 
with a football to an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the field, he came across as charming and easy to like -- dashing across 
airports in Hertz rental car ads, picking apart plays as a television 
commentator in the awkward, yet endearing manner some retired sports stars 
have, playing hokey characters in Naked Gun movies. He seemed like the kind of 
guy who would gladly sign an autograph for a stranger, said Harris, the writer 
from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "After his football career, he succeeded in projecting an extraordinarily warm 
persona," Harris says. "While this guy made his living selling rental cars and 
the like, he did it without seeming to cheapen himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a guy without a smudge on him," Harris said. "If you ask the question: 
'Who is likely to go out and murder his wife?' there are plenty of sports 
figures who might come to mind instantly. O.J. Simpson is not one of those. Far 
from it. He's at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Figueroa Street near USC, at a Mexican restaurant and sports bar in the 
shadow of the stadium where O.J. Simpson made some of his greatest touchdown 
runs, the Wednesday night scene serves up a mixture of disbelief, confusion and 
sadness along with the margaritas and cervezas.  
</P>
<P>
 "Devastated," Steve Franks declares himself at the mention of Simpson's name. 
</P>
<P>
 On the big screen, the New York Knicks were duking it out with the Houston 
Rockets in the NBA finals. But another sport was on Franks' mind. The fortyish 
controller of an attorney's messenger service in Downtown Los Angeles grew up 
watching Juice cut and fake and sprint, first for the USC Trojans and later for 
the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is such a glove, if there were bloodstains. . . . To take a knife? . 
. . " his voice trails off. "It's like a dagger in my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Franks' table mate, 24-year-old Ladell Wilkins, doesn't really want to talk 
about the Simpson affair. Wilkins played some high school football -- running 
back, the same position Simpson played. "I'm a little confused," Wilkins said 
plainly. "He was my idol." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet twinned with this sense of disbelief is a grim curiosity, a thirst for 
more information. Even as the media come under attack for sensationalizing the 
murders and laying out a case against Simpson before he has been charged with 
any crime, people such as Franks say they are lapping up whatever information 
they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting hooked," Franks said. "Today I caught myself reading three papers 
to find out about the story." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the reason people have heroes, especially sports heroes, is to 
make them feel better about themselves. Dr. Stanley Teitelbaum, a New York City 
psychologist who has written about the role of sports in American society, says 
people "connect how they feel about themselves and their own lives with how the 
hero is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Teitelbaum added: "If you latch yourself onto a winning team, and they win, 
you feel like a winner." But when the winning team loses, or the hero topples 
off his pedestal, he said, "it may feel like a personal blow -- like if you're 
bringing down (my idol), you're bringing down a part of me." 
</P>
<P>
 When an idol takes a tumble, psychologists and other experts say, there are a 
series of predictable reactions. Some people become even more loyal supporters, 
refusing to believe bad news. Some people blame the messenger -- often the 
press. Some become disillusioned, angry, even disgusted. And some watch with 
fascination, transfixed by the public unraveling of an icon. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to have heroes," said Stark, the NPR commentator, "but on the 
other hand there is this sort of interest in the perverse qualities of them at 
the same time. It's sort of an American tradition to tear people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Simpson will be torn down in the end depends, in large part, on how 
the slaying of his former wife is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that even if he is never charged, Simpson will always be tainted, if 
only by the revelation that he pleaded no contest to a charge of spousal 
battery in 1989. Others, such as Dallas Willard, a USC philosophy professor who 
lectures on the role of sports in society, say that even if Simpson is 
implicated, he will always be afforded more sympathy than scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spent too many years," Willard said, "wearing those grooves of goodness in 
the mind of the public."

HILL CONVICTED OF EXTORTION IN STATE CAPITOL STING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After only eight hours of deliberation, a federal jury on Thursday found state 
Sen. Frank C. Hill (R-Whittier) guilty of using his elected office to extort 
$2,500 from an undercover FBI agent who was part of a Capitol sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, an assemblyman at the time of the extortion in 1988, was found guilty on 
all three counts on which he was charged: extortion, conspiracy and money 
laundering. He faces a sentence that could exceed six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, the fifth and last state legislator convicted in the ongoing federal 
investigation of corruption in Sacramento, does not have to resign. He declined 
to comment after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 But the office of Gov. Pete Wilson said the governor is expected to set a date 
by July 1 for a special election to replace Hill, in the expectation that he 
will resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found former Democratic Senate aide Terry E. Frost guilty of one 
count of conspiracy for his part in steering the undercover agent and a federal 
informant to those who could help them win passage of a bogus special-interest 
bill. He faces about two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When the verdict was read aloud to a packed courtroom late in the afternoon, 
neither Hill nor Frost showed any emotion. At one point, Hill put a comforting 
hand on the back of one of his attorneys, Stephen D. Miller. But Hill's wife, 
relatives and many of the legislative aides who had waited for the jury's 
decision broke into sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, who had worked for a time as a lobbyist but is now unemployed, said he 
had no idea what he would do next. "I don't know what there is to appeal," he 
said. "We're going to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Frost will remain free without bail until their sentencing, scheduled 
for Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators are not required to resign their offices when they are 
convicted of crimes. The state Constitution allows each house of the 
Legislature to determine who is fit to serve. In recent cases, convicted 
legislators have stepped down voluntarily -- in one case only after threat of 
formal expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Capitol, where news of Hill's conviction spread rapidly late Thursday, 
there was already talk of who might succeed him in his heavily Republican San 
Gabriel Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 For federal prosecutors, the verdict brought the end to a long series of 
prosecutions that grew out of a government sting operation known as "Bri-spec," 
for Bribery-special interest. 
</P>
<P>
 That corruption investigation tarnished the image of California politics -- 
bringing the conviction of five state legislators as well as numerous aides, 
lobbyists, and other government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the earliest convictions, the Legislature changed the rules of 
conduct for legislators and staff, and required legislators and lobbyists to 
take courses in government ethics. Although some critics contend that the 
reforms did not go far enough, the change ended the practice of legislators 
taking sizable gifts and honorariums, such as the $2,500 that Hill took from 
the undercover FBI agent six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, the chief prosecutor in the Hill-Frost case, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. John K. Vincent, announced that the curtain had finally been drawn on 
cases growing out of the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the final prosecution out of the Bri-spec investigation that we 
anticipate at this time," Vincent said. But he left open the possibility that 
his office, together with the FBI, might be looking at other public officials 
as a result of information gathered during the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment about his office's record in corruption prosecutions -- all 
14 individuals who were charged were convicted or pleaded guilty -- Vincent 
said: "We weren't looking for a perfect record. We were just looking to enforce 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
 One juror said that the panel had little trouble finding the defendants 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Audrey Russell of Carmichael said: "The evidence was in the videotapes. 
It was very clear he (Hill) was guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, an accounting technician with the state Employment Development 
Department, acknowledged that actually proclaiming someone guilty of a crime 
had been more difficult than she thought it would be. "I think there was a 
natural sympathy for Hill, especially with his family sitting there every day 
-- even though I didn't have any doubt about his guilt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she came to believe that Hill, like many political figures, had succumbed 
to the trappings of office. "He may have started out honest but like a lot of 
politicians got caught up in all the power," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Frost were originally charged along with former Assembly Republican 
Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after months of maintaining his innocence and vowing to fight the 
charge, Nolan surprised supporters by making a deal with prosecutors in 
exchange for a reduced sentence. In February, he pleaded guilty to one count of 
using his office as a racketeering enterprise and he is serving a 33-month 
sentence at the federal prison camp at Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Nolan entered his guilty plea -- in court and under oath -- the 
legislator remained unrepentant. He later explained that he decided to stop 
fighting the charges out of concern for his young family and fear of a longer 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his deal, Nolan refused to cooperate with authorities. And he was 
not a witness in the trial of his alleged co-conspirators, Hill and Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 The key witness in the case was a former Nolan aide, Karin Watson, who pleaded 
guilty to one count of extorting payments from an undercover FBI agent in 1989. 
In return for her cooperation, the prosecution recommended that she be 
sentenced to six months in a halfway house. Her sentencing has been delayed 
until after the Hill-Frost trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who once worked for Hill when he was in the Assembly, described her 
legislative job as raising money for Republican legislators. "My whole world 
revolves around making money for myself and others," she said in a 1988 
conversation secretly recorded by an undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Hill described Watson as "bold and brassy" -- someone who 
had arranged the $2,500 honorarium without any prompting from him. Hill's 
attorneys tried to cast doubt on Watson's credibility by showing that her 
account of events was clouded by the abundant champagne supplied by FBI 
undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But as in all of the sting cases, the most damaging evidence against Hill and 
Frost was the tapes of secretly recorded conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Hill, the most troublesome recording was a black-and-white videotape 
of his hourlong meeting in a dimly lighted hotel room with an undercover FBI 
agent using the name George Miller. It was at this meeting, in June, 1988, that 
Hill took a $2,500 check from Miller, who was posing as a gregarious Southern 
businessman trying to win support for a bogus special interest bill that would 
help him build a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller -- actually FBI Agent George W. Murray -- testified that the check was 
in exchange for Hill's agreement to use his influence to persuade then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian to sign the legislation. But Hill flatly denied that he ever 
agreed to take money in return for his help. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment, Hill said, was an honorarium, for taking the time to develop a 
relationship with the supposed businessman. It was perfectly legal at the time 
to take the money, which, he said was "for upholding my end of the bargain . . 
. spending time with him." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent peppered Hill with questions about why he had taken such a 
substantial payment for doing little more than walking to the hotel across from 
the Capitol and chatting with the bogus businessman. "Two thousand, five 
hundred an hour?" asked an incredulous Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't getting paid by the hour," snapped Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those snared in the sting in addition to Hill and Nolan and aides Frost 
and Watson, were former Sens. Paul B. Carpenter and Joseph B. Montoya and 
legislative aides Tyrone H. Netters and Darryl O. Freeman. All four are 
currently serving time in prison, except for Carpenter, who fled before he was 
sentenced to Costa Rica. An aide to Montoya, Amiel Jaramillo, who was indicted 
in the sting eventually pleaded guilty to the unrelated charge of lying on a 
Veterans Administration loan application. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were spinoffs of the sting. Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham and 
Assistant Sheriff Wendell Luttrull both pleaded guilty to extorting campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 And undercover informants led investigators to the door of state Sen. Alan E. 
Robbins (D-Van Nuys). At first, it appeared that the veteran legislator would 
not be charged because of his relatively minor role in the sting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FBI discovered that Robbins, along with California Coastal 
Commissioner Mark L. Nathanson, had extorted almost $250,000 from a San Diego 
hotel developer. Both men eventually pleaded guilty to corruption charges. And 
Robbins, while still a sitting senator, agreed to go undercover, wearing a 
hidden recording device. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence he gathered led to the conviction of insurance industry lobbyist 
Clayton R. Jackson, who is now serving time at the Dublin prison camp while the 
verdict is appealed.

SENATE CONFIRMS PAEZ FOR FEDERAL COURT JUDGESHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed Municipal Judge Richard A. 
Paez for a federal district court judgeship, meaning that Paez will be the 
first Mexican American to serve as a federal trial judge here. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, 47, was nominated for the position last year by President Clinton upon 
the recommendation of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that the Senate has confirmed this exceptional public servant 
for a federal district court judge position," Boxer said. "He possesses 
tremendous integrity, skill and experience and I am confident that he will 
serve the people with distinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, in a brief interview, said he was very honored to have been confirmed. 
"I intend to be fair and impartial, to work hard and be productive, as I was on 
the Municipal Court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez said he expected that "the cases will be more complex, more demanding, 
and the issues will be more varied." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Senate confirmed him on a voice vote Thursday, President Clinton 
signed Paez's formal commission of office and the new federal judge said he 
expected to be sworn in early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez said it has been 17 months since he initially sent papers to Boxer after 
she announced that she was taking applications for the position in the Central 
District of California, which covers seven Southern California counties from 
Riverside to San Luis Obispo. Under a power-sharing compact, Boxer and her 
colleague, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, agreed that each would get to recommend two 
judges for the federal court vacancies that existed when they came into office. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75 people applied to Boxer. They were screened by a committee of 
Southern California lawyers headed by Angela Oh of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer's other selection, Alhambra civil rights attorney Samuel Paz, is still 
awaiting confirmation, as is one of Feinstein's choices, state Court of Appeal 
Justice Robert J. Timlin. Feinstein's other choice, Audrey Collins, who had 
been a deputy district attorney, was confirmed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's nominees stand in contrast to those appointed by Presidents Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush. During Clinton's first year in office, more than half 
of his nominees for federal judgeships were women or members of racial and 
ethnic minorities. Reagan and Bush named white men to 82% of the available 
federal judgeships over their 12 years in office, but only 39% of Clinton's 
first 48 nominees were white men. In California, of the four nominated thus 
far, only Timlin is a white male. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez has served as a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge since 1981. He was 
appointed by Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and was reelected twice without 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as presiding judge of the Municipal Court in 1989 and was chairman 
of the Los Angeles Municipal Court Judges Assn. in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 12 years, he also filled in as a substitute Superior Court 
judge and state Court of Appeal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez's appointment was praised by a wide range of lawyers and other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still regard him as the best" substitute justice "that ever sat with us," 
said California Court of Appeal Justice Earl Johnson. "He was just outstanding 
in his grasp of the legal issues, his fairness, his writing ability and the 
depth and creativity of his research." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a truly outstanding judge," said Aviva K. Bobb, who has served with 
Paez on the Municipal Court bench for several years and was just elected to the 
Superior Court. "Most judges on our court seek his counsel when they have 
difficult matters before them. He has mentored many new judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Olmos, executive director of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, 
who has known Paez since they were law students at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall 
more than 20 years ago, also praised the appointment. He said Paez is ideally 
suited for the federal judgeship because he is "very bright, compassionate and 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Los Angeles, Paez was born in Utah and, in keeping with his 
Mormon faith, attended Brigham Young University. He said he holds liberal 
political views and is a committed family man, actively involved in raising a 
9-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. His wife, Diane Erickson, works for 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a judge, was a practicing lawyer doing public interest work. 
His began as a field attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance in Delano. 
Paez moved on to the Western Center on Law and Poverty and the Legal Aid 
Foundation of Los Angeles, where he became director of litigation.

5.0 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES LANDERS, BUT CAUSES NO DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnitude 5.0 aftershock rattled residents of Landers and the surrounding 
Morongo Basin desert region Thursday morning, unnerving even veterans of the 
powerful 1992 earthquake but prompting no reports of injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like the one before but I was beginning to wonder because it was 
starting to wind up," said Tina Stockman, who with her husband owns the 
Grubstake restaurant in Landers.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was rockin' and rollin' and the lights were swinging and pictures and 
knickknacks were falling off the walls," she said. "I got that feeling in the 
pit of the stomach where you wonder, 'Oh no, not again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency response agencies said they received no reports of injuries or 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the cab of our engine and it felt like someone was on the back, 
jumping up and down," said Steve Ruddell of the California Department of 
Forestry station in Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there were reports that the aftershock was felt as far away as Los 
Angeles, 70 miles to the west, Helen Thompson said she was at the market in 
nearby Yucca Valley and did not feel the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gal at the check stand mentioned it so I went home (to Landers). A couple 
of my drawers opened and some things fell off the tables, but there was no 
damage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Grubstake, Stockman said the movement came quick and hard. Based on 
Caltech reports that the epicenter was 10 miles north of Yucca Valley, Stockman 
figured it might have come directly below her restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no buildup," she said. "It just hit, boom, right there. And that's 
the part that scares you most."  
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 earthquake at Landers was a magnitude 7.6 -- the largest to have 
struck California in 40 years. It was followed later that morning by a 
magnitude 6.7 quake at Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the two San Bernardino County earthquakes killed a young boy, 
injured 400 people and damaged more than 4,000 homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech spokeswoman Kate Hutton said Thursday's aftershock at Landers was the 
strongest this year -- and one of an estimated 45,000 that have struck the 
region since 1992. Landers Aftershock 
</P>
<P>
 A magnitude 5.0 aftershock rattled residents of Landers and the surrounding 
Morongo Basin desert region Thursday morning. It was centered 10 miles north of 
Yucca Valley. There were no reports of injuries or damage.

STANDING TALL; TUSTIN BLIMP HANGARS HONORED AS FEATS OF ENGINEERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To see a group of engineers gush over the blimp hangars at the Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station, you would think the giant structures were the eighth wonder 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be exaggerating the hangars' importance, said Fred J. Meier, a 
retired civil engineer from Santa Ana. But not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a nearly three-year effort by Meier, the twin hangars received the 
same national recognition from his peers that has been extended to other 
engineering landmarks in the United States, including the Statue of Liberty and 
the Golden Gate and Brooklyn bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony Thursday at the Marine base, the American Society of Civil 
Engineers dedicated a plaque that recognized the two hangars as the largest 
wooden frame structures in the world. Although the buildings already are listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places, the event still had all the pomp 
of a military ceremony, complete with color guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes these hangars unique is they are the largest wooden structures of 
their kind in the world," Meier said. "The frame is made entirely of wood, and 
we believe they support the largest covered space of any building in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1942 at a cost of $2.5 million each, the hangars housed 12 blimps 
that were used for submarine patrol. Each structure is 18 stories high, 1,088 
feet long, 297 feet wide and covers almost 300,000 square feet. It would be 
possible to play a basketball game, football game and soccer match in one 
building simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge wooden doors, which have six leaves that weigh 26 tons to 39 tons 
each, fold open on steel rails like an accordion, powered by electric motors at 
each end. Giant concrete pylons anchor each corner of the hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction was supervised by the Navy Department's Bureau of Yards and 
Docks. Wood was used for the framing because steel was needed to build ships, 
tanks and weapons during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Klehn, executive vice president of Dames & Moore, a Los Angeles-based 
engineering firm that helped build the hangars, said the soft, swampy ground 
presented a challenge that few engineers had faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, our firm was one of a handful in the country that specialized in 
foundation engineering," Klehn said. "Our engineers bored 150 feet down to get 
soil samples that were tested for strength and compressibility. From those 
tests, the engineers decided the best foundation for the buildings were pilings 
that were pounded 100 feet into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the pilings and buildings have survived several earthquakes is 
testament to the ingenuity of the engineers, who were working in a new science, 
Klehn said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, the blimps were phased out, and over the years the hangers saw 
a varietyof non-military uses. In 1949, Howard Hughes rented space in one 
hangar for a blimp that his company used to advertise the movie "The Outlaw," 
which was produced by Hughes and starred Jane Russell. Local canning and 
trucking companies also rented storage space in the hangars in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, when the Korean War began, Tustin was recommissioned as the first 
Marine helicopter base. Today, each hangar can house almost 100 helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps is scheduled to close the base by 1997 and turn the land over 
to the city of Tustin. The fate of the hangars has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an attempt to preserve the buildings," Meier said. "I would like 
to see them preserved, but that's not up to me or to our group. We simply want 
them to be recognized for the engineering marvel that they are."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: SPICING UP HEARINGS ON FROZEN 
CHICKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing like a little chicken bowling to cut the tedium of a congressional 
hearing. Bringing Wolfgang Puck, the L.A. culinary impresario, into the fray 
doesn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his appearance, the atmosphere in the House Government Operations 
Committee hearing room had gotten mean. Intimations were flying about the 
chicken industry using its political muscle to bend federal policies to its 
liking, and the deputy secretary of agriculture was undergoing a fiery 
grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.) demanded that Richard Rominger, the embattled 
deputy secretary, supply records for all meetings and phone calls he had with 
industry groups for periods stretching back two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeing Rominger coldly, Mica asked: "Have you ever lied to or purposely misled 
a member of Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Rominger, looking out of sorts. Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr.'s director of food and agriculture said he'd be glad to supply the records 
and then beat a retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Into these somber proceedings arrived Puck, the impish creator of Spago and 
other must-go-to restaurants. Placing a seemingly rock-like chicken on the 
witness stand, the famed restaurateur mused: "It's like a weapon. I'm surprised 
they let this through the security check." 
</P>
<P>
 With one ad-lib -- and a great prop -- the jovial, world-famous chef cut to 
the heart of the issue for Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Puck was visiting Capitol Hill on the side of the state's poultry producers, 
who are trying to get the federal government to rethink a USDA policy that 
allows frozen chicken to be sold as fresh. In fact, to the feds, chicken is 
still "fresh" as long as it's above zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Two House subcommittees, chaired by Reps. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) and 
Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.), joined forces Thursday to air the matter and invited 
Puck to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Puck's second appearance before a House committee. A while back he 
fought a USDA rule that forced him to add tomato sauce to his famous packaged 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe because the big tomato growers said that's the way it should be . . . 
so in the end we wound up putting one expensive spoonful of sauce on the 
pizza," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The "fresh" issue is an old one that has been pushed into the forefront by 
allegations that Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy accepted illegal gifts and 
trips 
</P>
<P>
 from Tyson Foods, the poultry processing giant based in Springdale, Ark. Espy 
has said he reimbursed the company for sporting event tickets and a trip on a 
Tyson airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid cries of "fraud," California producers describe what they call a 
frozen-thaw-fresh scheme that allows producers to ship rock-hard broilers to 
the California market -- the nation's largest -- yet still be allowed to label 
them as fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials and consumer groups want the USDA to push the standard up to 
26 degrees -- near the point where chickens begin to freeze. Anything below 
that temperature could not bear the "fresh" imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
 California enacted just such a law last year. But the National Broiler Council 
and the Arkansas Poultry Federation quickly filed a suit opposing it, and a 
federal judge in California struck it down because it conflicted with U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 The "chicken war" flows out of a larger issue. Towns' subcommittee has been 
pondering whether the USDA can effectively regulate a food industry that it 
also promotes.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems clear that many subcommittee members have serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "USDA's policy amounts to outright consumer fraud and deception," Towns said. 
"The Department of Agriculture has been guilty of deception," Mica added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearing ground to a midday halt for a series of floor votes, the action 
moved around the corner to the California Fresh Chicken Fest, a wingding put on 
by the California Poultry Industry Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon pulled in scores of guests to graze on barbecued chicken and 
lemon oregano chicken and California jumbo asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
 But guests could also venture out to the balcony, where the fresh-chicken 
forces had set up bowling pins and invited revelers to "bowl" with the solid 
(but wrapped) carcasses of chickens chilled to about 20 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), the U.S. Senate candidate, dropped 
by and issued his policy statement on the fresh-frozen controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relevant issue, but it doesn't mean people who freeze their chicken 
can't sell it in California. It just means the label has to say 'frozen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And then he went outside to go chicken bowling.

RISK FROM DIESEL FUMES ESTIMATED; POLLUTION: STATE BOARD SAYS THE EXHAUST COULD 
CAUSE UP TO 1,000 CASES OF LUNG CANCER A YEAR. STUDY COULD INCREASE PRESSURE 
FOR MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The California Air Resources Board has tentatively concluded that diesel 
exhaust could be responsible for more than 1,000 cases of lung cancer a year, 
which increases pressure on the state to tighten its stringent regulations on 
buses, trucks and other vehicles that run on diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its efforts to control smog, California, since 1988, has imposed 
the nation's strictest program for controlling diesel exhaust. In the process, 
according to ARB officials, the state has substantially reduced components of 
diesel exhaust, such as benzene, butadiene and formaldehyde, which are 
potential carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have identified and regulated some components of diesel exhaust in the 
past," said William Sessa, an ARB spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, however, the state has sought to gauge the health risks of 
everything that comes out of the exhaust pipe of diesel engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an assessment of the health risk of all components combined," Sessa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study estimates that "from 300 additional cancer cases a year to 1,100 or 
1,200" could be caused by diesel exhaust, Sessa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are contained in a preliminary draft of an ARB risk assessment 
study that will be undergoing review and modification for more than a year. At 
the end of that process, the ARB will decide whether to impose additional 
regulations on diesel emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB study echoes research by the federal government that concluded in 1990 
that diesel exhaust probably causes cancer in people. 
</P>
<P>
 Factored into the California study, however, is the amount of diesel exhaust 
in the air that people in this state are exposed to. The exposure level in 
Southern California is significantly higher than it is statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 58,000 tons of diesel exhaust go into the air each year, more than 
a third of it in Southern California, according to the study. The concentration 
level ranges from 3.7 micrograms per cubic meter statewide to 5 micrograms per 
cubic meter in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the study prompted one environmental group, the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, to call Thursday for new regulations "which will 
phase out diesel trucks, school buses, locomotives and (diesel powered) 
construction equipment from California cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Sessa emphasized that the study is a first draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first cut at a risk assessment to determine the risk of diesel 
emissions, and there is still some uncertainty about the risk level." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the risk assessment is based on the results of 40 studies on animals 
and humans, but he cautioned that it does not take into account how much diesel 
pollution will be reduced as some of the state's regulations on fuel 
reformulation and emissions "go more fully into effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "As more new vehicles are introduced, the emission levels will go down," he 
said. "We have estimated that diesel emissions will be reduced by 50% over the 
next 16 years." Whether the ARB's latest study will lead to more regulation "is 
premature at this stage in the process to speculate about." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, the state has attempted to reduce toxic diesel emissions by 
mandating reformulated fuels. And its emission standards require a reduction of 
particulate matter by 90%. That regulation went into effect for buses last year 
and will apply to trucks beginning next year.

LAWYER BRANDS THE CITADEL BASTION OF DISCRIMINATION; TRIAL: WOMAN SEEKING 
ADMISSION TO ALL-MALE CADET CORPS ALLEGES CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS. JUDGE 
ASSAILS SCHOOL FOR FILING MISTRIAL MOTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lawyers for a woman fighting to gain admittance to The Citadel, South 
Carolina's all-male military academy, on Thursday called the school a remnant 
of a past era of rampant discrimination and asked a judge to order her 
immediate admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men in South Carolina have choices, and women do not," said attorney Val 
Vojdik during closing arguments in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Shannon Faulkner is suing the 152-year-old state-supported 
college for admittance to its all-male cadet corps. She filed the lawsuit last 
year after the school rejected her because of her gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for The Citadel Thursday earlier asked for a mistrial, arguing that 
U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck may have already made up his mind on the 
case. Houck denied the motion Thursday and said he was considering citing the 
school for filing the motion for publicity purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck said he will issue a ruling on Faulkner's case in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling The Citadel's refusal to admit women a clear violation of the 
Constitution's equal protection guarantees, Vojdik said the school would rather 
"dig at the bottom of the barrel for another man to fit a bed" than admit a 
qualified woman. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the school has had to lower standards and admit men from out-of-state 
to keep its enrollment up, a contention the school has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for The Citadel acknowledged that the state offers unequal educational 
opportunities. They argued, however, that this did not violate the Constitution 
because financial -- not gender -- factors was the reason why South Carolina 
has no all-female public college. The state's one all-female public college 
became co-educational 20 years ago because of declining enrollments, attorney 
Dawes Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for The Citadel's failure to admit women, he said that the court should 
defer to the state's "longstanding policy of supporting single-gender 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Citadel is committed to single-gender education," Cooke said, adding that 
if it loses the lawsuit it would choose to set up a separate all-female program 
rather than admit Faulkner to the cadet corps. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked Houck to allow the school sufficient time to set up such a program 
rather than require it to admit Faulkner this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck earlier had told school officials to make contingency plans for 
admitting Faulkner this fall in case he ruled in her favor. He scolded them 
last month for dragging their feet and excoriated them Thursday for filing the 
mistrial motion, partly in response to the order. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion said the contingency plan order suggested Houck may have already 
made up his mind against them. Citadel's attorneys also argued that they had 
been held to stricter rules than the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the motion "totally frivolous," Houck said, "I haven't even begun the 
process of deciding this case, much less reached a decision."  
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, a high school honors student, said she deleted gender references 
from her application to The Citadel and gained admission. Once the school 
discovered who she was, she was rejected. She has been allowed to take day 
classes at the school pending the outcome of the trial, but she cannot take 
part in military training, wear a uniform or live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Military Institute, the nation's only other all-male, state-supported 
military college, is creating an off-campus parallel program for women after a 
court ordered it either to admit women, become private or develop a parallel 
program for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents of South Carolina's two women's private colleges say they aren't 
interested in developing a military program on their campuses, and Citadel 
officials say they doubt they can raise the money necessary to sever its ties 
to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the options South Carolina is considering, if the judge rules against 
the state, is to send women who want a military education to attend school in 
another state. But Vojdik said that should be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the school's prestige, its influential alumni network, low 
student-teacher ratio and low tuition, she said: "The Citadel is rich in 
opportunities that should be shared with women in the state."

D'AMATO STOCK DEAL NETTED HIM $37,000 IN 1 DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), one of the GOP's most vocal critics of the 
Clintons' Whitewater real estate ventures, acknowledged Thursday that he made a 
$37,000 profit in a one-day stock investment arranged through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock purchase, an initial public offering of 4,500 shares of a 
little-known California company, Computer Marketplace, was made for D'Amato by 
a Long Island brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato said he did nothing wrong or improper. He also said that after turning 
the big profit, he transferred his investments into a blind trust controlled by 
a conservative investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 stock deal was included in D'Amato's personal financial statement 
made public this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, D'Amato told reporters Thursday, he took his entire retirement 
savings, worth $19,324, from an individual retirement account and gave it to 
David Beall, 20, the son-in-law of a friend, to invest as he wished. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato has been leading the call for hearings on President and Mrs. Clinton's 
investments and real estate dealings when Clinton was the governor of Arkansas.

U.S. RAISES PENALTIES FOR CHILD LABOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS; WORKPLACE: EMPLOYERS 
NOW FACE MULTIPLE FINES FOR AN INJURY OR DEATH. THE SANCTIONS ARE ANNOUNCED 
AMID A PUSH FOR MORE SUMMER JOBS FOR TEEN-AGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to crack down on companies that subject teen-age employees to 
hazardous working conditions, the Labor Department on Thursday began enforcing 
stiffened penalties for child work safety law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new sanctions, employers that allow young workers to suffer serious 
injury or death can be fined $10,000 for each violation. Previously, negligent 
companies faced a $10,000 penalty for each accident. A single accident can 
involve multiple violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Child protection advocates said that many young workers are mistreated on the 
job. Hospital emergency rooms treated teen-agers for 64,000 job-related 
injuries in 1992, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the school year draws to a close, teens across the country will be looking 
for work," said Bernard Anderson, assistant labor secretary for employment 
standards. "They mean everything to us as parents and they are undeniably our 
country's most valuable asset." 
</P>
<P>
 As the penalties took effect Thursday, the Clinton Administration announced 
its plans to create more than 600,000 summer jobs for young people. Labor 
officials also urged private employers to hire 330,000 teen-agers for summer 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4 million children work in the United States in every industry from 
agriculture to manufacturing to food service. Frequently, teen-agers suffer 
burns and cuts while working at fast-food restaurants, become caught in 
agricultural machinery or are hit by cars while delivering newspapers, said Dr. 
Phillip J. Landrigan, a child specialist at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Work-related deaths are caused primarily by machinery, electrical accidents or 
falls, according to the National Child Labor Committee, a New York-based 
advocacy group. A NIOSH report on working youngsters found that 70% of deaths 
involved violations of federal child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that older teen-agers are injured more frequently than young 
adolescents but that child injury is less prevalent than adult injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Department officials said they expect the new policy to mean that more 
money will be collected in fines assessed in job-related injury cases. For 
example, if a 15-year-old is killed while operating a forklift in a warehouse, 
the Labor Department could dock the company once for violating rules against 
minors operating forklifts and again for breaking laws against 14- and 
15-year-olds working in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A company could be fined $20,000 for such an accident under the new penalties 
but could have been charged with a maximum of $10,000 under the old system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose is to deter violations," said Art Kerschner, chief of the 
department's child labor unit. "We don't want to deter children's employment." 
</P>
<P>
 More stringent penalties probably will not prompt businesses to hire fewer 
children, said Dorianne Beyer, general counsel for National Child Labor 
Committee. "When employers need certain types of employees, for example those 
that can work part-time without benefits, they have no choice. They have to 
hire kids," Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal child labor is the driving force behind "an underground economy" in 
the garment industry, said Jo-Ann Mort of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile 
Workers Union in New York. "It's so prevalent that you can go into the heart of 
the garment district and almost everywhere you look, there's a sweatshop." 
</P>
<P>
 New York state has a labor "SWAT team" that storms into suspected sweatshops 
and searches for safety violations. Investigators have turned up serious safety 
violations and in one sweatshop found children who had lost fingers while 
operating a machine used to make leather belts.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, child workers are most often injured using meat-slicing 
machines, dough mixers and in occupations that involve driving, a Labor 
Department spokeswoman said. Working Children 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Labor Department study at six Los Angeles high schools found: 
</P>
<P>
 50% of 14- and 15- year-olds in violation of laws barring companies from 
working them past 7 p.m. during the school year.

<P>
 It was a day of weather extremes Thursday as the East and Midwest baked in a 
record-setting heat wave while parts of the West shivered in record-tying low 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities set record highs for the date, including Ft.Wayne, Ind., with 
96 degrees; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., 88; South Bend, Ind., 95; La Crosse, Wis., 
94, and Pittsburgh, Pa., 95. 
</P>
<P>
 Milkwaukee reported a high of 100 degrees, breaking the mark of 93 reached in 
1939 and 1922 and setting a record for the second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other cities tied record highs, including Rochester, N.Y., at 93 degrees; 
Toledo, Ohio, 98; Madison, Wis., 93; Youngstown, Ohio, 91, and Washington, 
D.C., 98. Green Bay, Wis., reported a high of 93 degrees, matching a mark set 
in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago officials opened public pools 10 days early to help residents cope. 
Schools in Washington, D.C., and its suburbs closed two hours early. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat-related advisories and warnings were again posted for parts of the East, 
including Philadelphia, southwestern New Jersey, central Virginia and the 
eastern part of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the West was experiencing the opposite problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature fell to 36 degrees in Great Falls, Mont., tying a 100-year-old 
record. Another record low was tied in Havre, Mont., at 34 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures fell into the 30s and 40s across the northern Rockies and the 
Pacific Northwest, weather officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced strong winds and hail that downed trees and 
power lines in Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri and Virginia. Winds gusted to 
58 m.p.h. in Indiana and 76 m.p.h. in Virginia.

WORLD PERSPECTIVE; NUCLEAR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been trying for 
months to take samples from the nuclear fuel rods in North Korea's 
five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, but they have been blocked by the Pyongyang 
government. What are they looking for -- and why? The Times asked David Kay, a 
former IAEA inspector now with Science Applications International Corp. in 
McLean, Va., to detail the process. Here is his description of how the IAEA 
inspectors do their jobs: EXHIBIT A: The Fuel Rods 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel rods contain the uranium that produces a nuclear chain reaction. This 
chain reaction -- triggered when control rods are partially withdrawn -- causes 
a tremendous amount of heat, which turns the turbines that generate 
electricity. It also produces plutonium. By monitoring the fuel rods, 
inspectors can determine if the weapons-grade material is being diverted. 
EXHIBIT B: Reprocessing Tanks 
</P>
<P>
 The areas where nuclear technicians reprocess fuel rods provide clues to 
whether plutonium is possibly being diverted to make bombs. Here is how 
plutonium is stripped from fuel rods: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Technicians shear the ends off the rods with a rotary saw 
</P>
<P>
 2. Rods are placed in a vat of nitric acid to dissolve the aluminum coatings 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rods are then dunked in a second set of chemicals to retrieve plutonium. 
What the inspectors do. . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the initial visit: Take swabs of soil samples and of dust gathered on plant 
machinery to measure their radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Install videotape cameras at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Place special seals on key pieces of equipment -- such as those involved in 
reprocessing spent fuel rods -- to show whether they have been tampered with 
between inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 On Periodic return trips: Change the videotape on the cameras and replace the 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Check to see whether the seals have been broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure the radioactivity both outside and inside the reprocessing building to 
see whether there are signs that more of the spent reactor fuel has been 
converted to weapons-grade material plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reactor has been shut down for refueling: Check the spent fuel rods 
being removed from the reactor to determine whether the North Koreans have been 
reprocessing more spent fuel than the 40 rods that they initially claimed. The 
inspectors do this by picking out about 300 of the 8,000 used rod. By measuring 
how much plutonium has accumulated in various rods, the scientists can tell how 
long they have been in the reactor. They can then determine whether the Koreans 
have removed more spent fuel than they have acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Check nuclear waste sites to analyze their contents. This is standard 
procedure, but the North Korean government has forbidden the IAEA from visiting 
its nuclear dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Return samples to Vienna for more thorough analysis. The U.S. -- North Korean 
Dispute and How It Grew 
</P>
<P>
 1985: North Korea signs the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In the process, 
it agrees to list all its nuclear facilities and to allow inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency to visit its reactor and radioactive waste 
sites to verify the information. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: Almost seven years after North Korea joined the treaty, the Vienna-based 
IAEA finally conducts a preliminary inspection visit, and finds a major 
discrepancy: Although North Korea claimed that it had acquired a small amount 
of plutonium from a single reprocessing of spent fuel rods from its reactor, an 
analysis shows that it actually reprocessed used fuel rods several times, 
suggesting that it had been conducting a much larger operation than it was 
admitting -- possibly with plans to manufacture nuclear weapons. North Koreans 
repeatedly balk at further inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: The Clinton Administration, alarmed by the prospect that the North 
Koreans might be building a nuclear arsenal, demands additional IAEA 
inspections -- ultimately in vain. North Korea surprises the West by announcing 
in late April that it is shutting down its reactor at Yongbyon immediately and 
removing the spent fuel rods, jeopardizing the IAEA's ability to tell whether 
additional plutonium has been diverted. 
</P>
<P>
 MAY, 1994: The IAEA tries to extract samples from the spent fuel rods, but is 
blocked by North Korea from taking the measurements that it wants. The United 
States, South Korea and Japan begin pressing for imposition of U.N. sanctions 
as punishment. Other Nations Under Close Watch

 In a meticulously organized minuet of diplomacy Thursday, Japanese royalty 
visited the United Nations, where their country aspires to a permanent seat on 
the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who favors Japan's membership on the 
council, greeted Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at U.N. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, there was no discussion of Japan's goal of permanent 
membership in the most powerful U.N. body, the 15-nation Security Council. 
There are five permanent members of the council. Japan's eventual membership is 
widely expected, but expansion of the council is a delicate issue.

YOUTH'S SUIT SAYS CHURCH FAILED TO AVERT MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified youth filed a lawsuit Thursday in Stockton alleging that Roman 
Catholic officials, including then-Bishop Roger M. Mahony, knew of and failed 
to protect him from being molested by a priest for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, now 18, is identified only as John Doe 4B.In the suit, he alleges 
that Father Oliver Francis O'Grady molested him beginning in 1979. The suit 
also charges that in 1976 O'Grady admitted to molesting a 10-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady, who is serving a 14-year sentence in a California state prison, 
pleaded guilty in a Calaveras County court last summer to four felony counts of 
lewd and lascivious acts with two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants are the Stockton Diocese, Sacred Heart Parish in Turlock, 
Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Stockton and St. Andrew's 
Parish in San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony served as bishop of Stockton from 1980 to 1985 before becoming cardinal 
in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to hold (Mahony) personally responsible," said Dave 
Burleson, attorney for the youth. "We're holding the diocese responsible for 
the effects of Mahony's actions. Mahony was in the position to remove the 
priest and prevent him from doing this to this child and others"

RWANDA REBELS REJECT FRENCH ROLE IN STRIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 France is seeking partners to intervene militarily to stop the slaughter in 
Rwanda, but Rwandan rebels said Thursday that a French role would make matters 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence that erupted in April after Rwanda's president was killed in a plane 
crash has left hundreds of thousands of people dead.Most were minority Tutsis, 
killed by the Hutu-majority army and militias, or Hutu moderates killed by 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who proposed intervention Wednesday, is 
scheduled to visit Senegal and Ivory Coast today, in part to discuss African 
involvement in ending the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Juppe told the French Senate that any intervention would be of limited 
duration and aimed only at "protecting people threatened with extermination." 
</P>
<P>
 "Others must come with us, and we are in the process of contacting our 
European and African partners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, in a broadcast on their Radio Muhabura, 
said France "is incapable of making the situation in Rwanda better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-dominated rebels hold France indirectly responsible for the 
slaughter because of France's past military assistance to the Hutu-led 
government.

TOP DEMOCRATS OFFER BILL PUNISHING CHINA; TRADE: PRO-HUMAN RIGHTS MEASURE 
CHALLENGES CLINTON. IT WOULD BLOCK $5 BILLION OF BEIJING'S EXPORTS TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a direct challenge to President Clinton, Democratic congressional leaders 
introduced a bill Thursday that would punish China for human rights abuses by 
blocking some of its exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) told a news conference that 
Clinton had erred three weeks ago when he renewed China's most-favored-nation 
trade status even though the Communist regime had satisfied few of the 
Administration's demands for changes in human rights policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like giving China the carrot and throwing away the stick," Gephardt 
said, adding, "When we pretend we can separate trade from human rights, we're 
only fooling ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who introduced the bill in 
the Senate, said that "China obviously needs our market much more than we need 
theirs." He estimated that thousands of American jobs are lost because of the 
large trade deficit with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the measure include House Democratic Whip David E. Bonior of 
Michigan and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who joined Mitchell and 
Gephardt at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he would try to bring the bill to a vote in the Senate this 
year. Although there is a good deal of sentiment among lawmakers in favor of 
Clinton's decision, the bill tries to appeal to some of them by targeting only 
a small percentage of Chinese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Most-favored status permits a country to export goods to the United States 
under low tariffs that apply to almost all of the United States' trading 
partners. Loss of the status subjects a country's goods to prohibitive tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said his bill would block $5 billion in Chinese exports to the United 
States but would not affect American exports to China. At present, China 
exports $31 billion in goods to the United States annually and imports $8 
billion from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would bar most-favored status for all Chinese goods manufactured by 
the People's Liberation Army and for Chinese defense-industry trading 
companies. Prohibitive tariffs also would block a small list of goods such as 
arms, footwear and glassware manufactured by state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the choice of targets, Mitchell said, "I do not believe the 
American people want to buy goods produced by the People's Liberation Army, the 
same army which massacred hundreds of defenseless Chinese students and workers 
in Tian An Men Square five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the defense industries are included because they are run by the 
military and that the other exports targeted by the bill are made by low-paid 
Chinese soldiers working in state-owned factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and the other Democrats said they are trying to hold Clinton to an 
executive order he signed a year ago in which he threatened to revoke China's 
most-favored status if the Asian giant failed to make significant progress in 
its human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 When he decided to renew the status, the President did not claim that such 
progress had been made. Instead, he bowed to those in his government who 
maintained that the loss of trade would hurt the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm offering this legislation," Mitchell said, "because I believe the United 
States has a responsibility and right to ask that Chinese Communist leaders 
make the significant progress called for in the President's executive order." 
</P>
<P>
 He said China should be forced to "abide by international standards of human 
rights" and to "cease unfair trade practices, including the illegal export of 
prison labor products . . . , before we grant them unconditional renewal of a 
trade status . . . so disproportionately advantageous to the Chinese Communist 
regime."

DISCIPLINE WEIGHED IN IRAQ COPTER DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration faces a controversial decision over whether to 
discipline the pilots of the Air Force F-15C jet fighters that shot down a pair 
of U.S. Blackhawk helicopters over Iraq two months ago, sources familiar with 
the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal report on the tragedy, on its way to top Pentagon officials this week 
after an inquiry by a military investigating team, is expected to confirm 
initial indications that the lead fighter pilot, relying on a visual sighting, 
mistook the helicopters for Iraqi Hinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who probably will make the final decision 
on the issue, is coming under pressure -- both from some U.S. military officers 
and from the Turkish government -- to court-martial the pilot on charges of 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 14 tragedy claimed the lives of all 26 crew members and passengers 
on the two helicopters, including 15 Americans and three Turkish officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is expected to be difficult for an Administration that already 
has had its problems with the uniformed services. Insiders said the military is 
split over the issue and that the pilot, whose identity has not been made 
public, is a Persian Gulf War veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arguing for court-martial proceedings -- said to include a growing 
number of senior Air Force officers -- contended the pilot's error was so 
grievous that it amounted to negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. helicopters were clearly marked and were flying at slow speeds, 
clearly no threat to the fighters. And the helicopters had filed flight plans 
with U.S. military authorities in the region. But Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, Air 
Force chief of staff, is said to strongly oppose any such action on grounds the 
pilot's mistake was understandable under rules of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has been kept under wraps, with only a handful of officials 
informed on its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources familiar with the report said it is expected to reaffirm that the 
helicopters were shot down because the lead F-15C pilot misidentified them when 
he first saw them and did not take extra precautions to confirm what 
nationality they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Any punishment is expected to fall mainly on the lead pilot. The pilot of the 
second F-15C is expected to receive less of the blame because by practice he 
follows the senior flier. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators' report is also expected to reassert that transponders 
carried by the two helicopters -- known as "identification, friend-or-foe" -- 
had been turned off in a previous landing stop and had not been reactivated 
before takeoff, as procedures require. 
</P>
<P>
 But that point could be moot. Experts familiar with military flight procedures 
said that once a fighter pilot decides to act on the basis of visual 
identification of a potential foe, the decision overrides any other element. 
</P>
<P>
 There is substantial debate over how easily an Air Force-trained fighter pilot 
should have been able to tell that the helicopters were Blackhawks rather than 
Iraqi Hinds. Military experts said the two have a similar appearance when the 
Blackhawks carry fuel pods but that differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources familiar with the case have said the Blackhawks both bore standard 
U.S. markings and that the bottom of the fuel pod was adorned with a large, 
full-color replica of the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the standard markings, which are relatively small, might have been 
visible from above, the fighter pilot would not have been able to see the flag 
replica without flying under the two helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the Blackhawks were flying slowly, having just taken off 
from a village airport. They also had filed a flight plan with U.S. 
authorities. The helicopters had been ferrying high-level officials on a tour 
of Kurdish villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The downing came as a jolt to the Air Force, which has been plagued by a rash 
of similar incidents. Immediately after the accident occurred, Perry tightened 
procedures for determining when fighter pilots may shoot at another aircraft 
inside the "no fly" zone -- essentially prohibiting them from firing solely 
upon visual identification.

ARAFAT SIDESTEPS QUESTIONS ON MOVE TO JERICHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO leader Yasser Arafat, still waiting for $24 million in promised financial 
aid, sidestepped questions Thursday on when he will move to Jericho to head the 
Palestinian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of Arafat's planning depends on receiving the money from 
international donors, senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials said 
he is likely to meet his target of making "the voyage of return" by month's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people had expected him to leave Tunis, the PLO's headquarters since 
1983, after the three-day Organization of African Unity summit ended Wednesday. 
But all Arafat would tell reporters who tried to pin him down on his departure 
was, "Soon, soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel turned over the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip to 
Palestinian self-rule last month under its accords with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a final date depends largely on how soon donor nations provide 
the promised aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is adamant he will not move until the money is in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor delaying the media-conscious Arafat's arrival in Jericho is 
concern about news coverage, particularly television. 
</P>
<P>
 His advisers are counseling against competing with this weekend's opening of 
the World Cup soccer series in the United States.

RELEASE OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FULFILLS AGREEMENT, ISRAEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel released more Palestinian prisoners Thursday and said it had fulfilled 
its agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization to free about 5,000, 
although hundreds of Islamic activists remained behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's representative on a joint security committee with the PLO, Brig. Gen. 
Yomtov Samya, said the number of prisoners freed or in a "released" status 
since the May 4 accord on Palestinian autonomy was more than 4,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, unequivocally the security committee, in the opinion of both 
sides, clarifies that Israel has upheld the Cairo agreement for the release of 
about 5,000 prisoners," Samya said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian official on the committee said that 650 members of Islamic 
groups opposed to the self-rule accord were slated to be freed Thursday but had 
spurned Israeli conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had these 650 people from the Islamic groups signed, they would have been 
released today," said Samir Siksik, a Palestinian member of the committee, 
referring to a written renunciation of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all the arrangements ready for them. I think in all fairness, the 
Israeli side has tried to see the agreement fulfilled," Siksik told Israel 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Israel-PLO accord, Israel agreed to release or turn over to the PLO 
about 5,000 Palestinian prisoners of an estimated 9,600 held by the Jewish 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians said they expected Israel to release 1,000 prisoners Thursday. 
But the radio said only 170 were let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 650 Islamic activists stayed in jail, dozens of other members of 
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group -- the PLO's main rivals in the Gaza Strip -- 
were freed Thursday, released prisoners said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saiyed Abu Misameh, 50, a former top Hamas leader freed after three years in 
jail, told reporters that the group had been opposed to pledging support for 
the peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Hamas had subsequently ordered followers to sign a modified 
version of the Israeli document that deleted references to the peace accord.

CONVICTED BRANCH DAVIDIANS DEFY JUDGE; COURTS: WITH SENTENCING EXPECTED TODAY, 
DEFENDANTS HURL INSULTS, CHALLENGE THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S AUTHORITY OVER THEM. 
THEIR LAWYERS PLEAD FOR LENIENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convicted members of the Branch Davidian cult, awaiting sentencing for their 
roles in the deaths of four federal agents, hurled insults at a federal judge 
Thursday and blamed the government for the ill-fated raid on their compound 
outside Waco, Tex., last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The defiant courtroom statements by the cult members followed pleas from their 
defense lawyers to U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. that he show leniency 
toward them for their convictions on weapons violations last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a seven-week trial, 11 Davidians were acquitted of the most serious 
charges of murder and murder-conspiracy. But the same jury convicted eight of 
them on lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and carrying a weapon in the 
commission of a crime. Some of the Davidians could receive prison terms as long 
as 40 years. Smith said that he would impose sentences this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Diminishing their lawyers' pleas for leniency, some of the cult members 
challenged Smith's right to sentence them. One compared him to Pontius Pilate, 
the Roman official who sentenced Jesus Christ to be crucified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not feel that justice has been done," said Livingston Fagan, 34, a 
former British social worker. "This court does not recognize -- as another 
court failed to recognize 2,000 years ago -- the spiritual aspects of this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another cult member, Renos Avraam, 29, a former British businessman, asked 
Smith: "How can I believe you're an impartial judge? You know, judge, you are 
going to be judged. And I hope your record is squeaky clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that "I would like to bring back the jury and ask them some 
questions," Avraam demanded of Judge Smith: "Are you saying you are the 
constitutional officer?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I have jurisdiction over crimes committed here," Smith replied evenly. But 
when the defendant demanded answers to more questions, an exasperated Smith 
shook his head and told him sternly: "Make statements but don't ask me 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the defendants took the witness stand at their trial, seven 
addressed the court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All defended their resistance on Feb. 28, 1993, when dozens of Treasury 
Department agents stormed their compound in an effort to serve a search warrant 
on cult leader David Koresh for alleged possession of illegal weapons. After a 
51-day standoff, the FBI entered the compound with armored vehicles and tear 
gas. A subsequent fire, which the government says the cult members started, 
burned down the frame buildings. Koresh and more than 80 of his followers died, 
some shot by their own weapons, according to a government report.  
</P>
<P>
 Fagan brought applause and cries of "amen" from a courtroom packed with family 
members and friends of the defendants when he said: "We do not accept this 
notion, this facade, that somehow we have agreed with this sentencing. We know 
we are innocent."  
</P>
<P>
 Among those who spoke in court, the most conciliatory was Kevin Whitecliff, 
32, who told the judge: "I hope you show as much mercy as you can on all of us 
in the group. I think that law enforcement officers should have considered 
there were mothers and babies in there."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith explained to the cult members and their supporters that federal judges 
no longer have "unlimited discretion" in imposing sentences since Congress has 
adopted sentencing guidelines setting minimum and maximum punishments for most 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the firearms charges, for example, Smith said that the range is five to 30 
years in prison, depending on his determination of whether the cult members 
deliberately sought out automatic weapons. Voluntary manslaughter, the other 
charge involved, carries a maximum punishment of 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys argued that the firearms charges should be considered in the 
lower range in view of the jury's determination that no conspiracy to murder 
federal agents existed.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom Sara Bain, the jury forewoman, told reporters that the 
jury did not have a clear understanding of what was involved in the firearms 
charges.

CLINTON'S ACCUSER GOES ON THE INTERVIEW CIRCUIT; ARKANSAS: PAULA JONES SEEKS TO 
BOLSTER HER CREDIBILITY. SHE ADMITS GETTING PAY RAISES, CONTRADICTING A CLAIM 
IN HER SEX HARASSMENT SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paula Corbin Jones, the woman who filed suit accusing President Clinton of 
sexual harassment while he was governor of Arkansas, has broken a silence of 
six weeks with a number of interviews apparently in an attempt to drum up 
financial support and address questions about her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' allegations of a crude sexual advance by Clinton in a Little Rock hotel 
room in May, 1991, has been challenged in recent weeks by the Arkansas state 
trooper who she says set up the encounter and by her own sister, who accuses 
her of fabricating the story in hopes of enriching herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interviews -- with ABC, CNN, CBS and several publications -- Jones 
sticks to the main elements of her story but undercuts one of her key claims by 
acknowledging that she received cost-of-living and merit pay raises in her 
low-level job with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. In her suit 
against Clinton, she claimed that she had been denied advancement and salary 
increases after rebuffing Clinton's request for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones repeatedly denies that her motive is to get rich or to embarrass the 
President. But she does say that she registered to vote for the first time 1992 
so that she could vote against Clinton and that she thinks Clinton is morally 
unfit for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I filed the complaint is because I asked for an apology and I 
didn't get an apology, and instead he (Clinton) called me 'pathetic' and 'a 
liar,' " she told Sam Donaldson in an interview for the ABC program, "Prime 
Time Live," which was broadcast Thursday night. "I'm not trying to hurt the 
President. . . . He needs to come forth and he needs to tell the truth and he 
needs to pay for what he's done."

 Jones said she did not complain immediately after the incident with Clinton 
because she was afraid of the governor's power and feared losing her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a job that paid very good for Arkansas, I thought. I needed a job. . . 
. I was scared," Jones said in an interview with CNN to be broadcast tonight. 
"I didn't know if I could tell Dave Harrington (her supervisor). He was the 
director; he was also a dear friend of the governor's." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' attorney, Gilbert K. Davis of Fairfax, Va., said that Jones consented 
to the interviews because "it is important to let the American people know who 
she is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to allow the American people to determine for themselves that she is 
believable, that she deserves a good reputation, that she is credible," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer also said that, at his urging, Jones took a polygraph examination 
earlier this month which he said demonstrated that she is telling the truth 
about her encounter with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the 27-year-old former clerk now living in Long Beach received 
"not a penny" for the interviews she did this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' sister, Charlotte Brown, and state trooper Danny Ferguson, who says he 
escorted Jones to Clinton's hotel room, have alleged separately that Jones told 
them she believed she could make money by selling the story of her encounter 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said in the CNN interview, "I haven't received any money. I don't 
want any money. I've turned down offers for money." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House referred all questions to Robert S. Bennett, the attorney who 
is handling the matter for Clinton. Bennett refused to comment but a source 
familiar with the case contended that Clinton and his advisers are pleased that 
Jones has decided to do a tour of the talk shows. They believe she will damage 
her credibility and may draw a rebuke from the judge for trying the case in the 
press.

 A White House memo asking presidential aides to pay for towels and bathrobes 
they may have taken from an aircraft carrier was disclosed by Rep. Dan Burton 
(R-Ind.).Forty White House aides and 23 reporters were on the George Washington 
during President Clinton's recent visit to Normandy, and the memo said that 
ship's officers discovered that 84 towels and robes, valued at $562, had 
vanished. After Burton distributed the memo to reporters, a White House 
spokesman said that a top Clinton aide had already repaid the Navy.

 A federal judge rejected an anti-abortion group's arguments and upheld a new 
law that bars protesters from blocking the entrances of abortion clinics. U.S. 
District Judge Leonie Brinkema of Alexandria rejected the claim of the American 
Life League Inc. that the law is too vague and violates the right of free 
speech. The ruling was the first to come out of several challenges that 
anti-abortion activists have filed against the law.

GOP ENDS WHITEWATER FILIBUSTER, GETS VOTE ON INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Republicans ended a filibuster over the breadth of Whitewater hearings 
late Thursday after Democrats agreed to allow a vote next week on a GOP plan to 
expand the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican plan, to be voted on next Tuesday, calls for an inquiry into 
any Whitewater developments after President Clinton was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 
1993. The GOP wants hearings to begin by July 22, a week earlier than the 
Democrats' deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans virtually halted Senate action for the last week as they 
introduced one proposal after another -- all designed to expand the limited 
hearings already approved in a Democratic resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time they did so, Democrats responded with a superseding resolution that 
negated the Republican effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the latest deal, negotiated by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Republicans will get a 
vote on their proposal next Tuesday. Democrats will not introduce a superseding 
amendment, although the GOP effort is likely to fail on a party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans then would have to decide whether to start tying up legislation 
again. The end of the filibuster had an immediate effect, as the Senate late 
Thursday was able to pass bills to run congressional operations and authorize 
construction projects at the nation's airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate last Tuesday, voting straight party line, approved Mitchell's 
language for narrowly focused Senate Whitewater hearings to begin by July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings would concentrate on contacts between Administration officials 
and savings and loan regulators; the suicide of White House lawyer Vincent 
Foster, who was handling Whitewater legal work for the President, and the 
removal of files from Foster's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the language was added to the airport construction bill. But under 
the new agreement, it was removed from that legislation and made a separate 
resolution that will be voted on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The language of the proposal by Dole and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) calls for 
an investigation of any activity in connection with Whitewater that occurred 
after Clinton became President. Any action that may have been "illegal, 
improper, unauthorized or unethical" could receive scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans had demanded hearings that would include Clinton's former Arkansas 
real estate development and its relationship to the failed Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan, owned by Clinton's Whitewater business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Republican compromise still would prevent hearings on Whitewater 
that occurred when Clinton was governor of Arkansas. That period will remain 
under investigation for some time by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who 
has asked Congress not to interfere with his criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 One matter that could be probed under the Republican -- but not the Democratic 
-- language would be internal strife in the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency 
dealing with the assets of failed savings and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
 An RTC investigator, Jean Lewis, was removed from the Whitewater case late 
last year. She said her superiors asked whether she would change her conclusion 
that the Whitewater land development caused a loss to Madison depositors.

POLICE RECORDS DETAIL 1989 BEATING THAT LED TO CHARGE; VIOLENCE: A BLOODIED 
NICOLE SIMPSON, HIDING IN BUSHES AFTER 911 CALL, TOLD OFFICERS: 'HE'S GOING TO 
KILL ME.' JUDGE OVERRULED PROSECUTORS' REQUEST THAT SIMPSON SERVE JAIL TIME. 
</P>

<P>
 O.J. Simpson beat his wife so severely in early 1989 that she required 
hospital treatment, and told police at his Brentwood mansion that he could not 
understand why they wanted to arrest him since it was their ninth response to a 
domestic disturbance report from the house, according to police reports 
released late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have been out here eight times before, and now you're going to 
arrest me for this?" Simpson is quoted in one report as yelling to two police 
officers who were responding to a 911 call. "This is a family matter. Why do 
you want to make a big deal out of it when we can handle it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The documents were released by the Los Angeles Police Department and city 
attorney's office after Freedom of Information Act requests by the news media, 
including the Los Angeles Times. The reports say that when police arrived at 
Simpson's North Rockingham Avenue house Jan. 1, 1989, they saw Nicole Simpson 
running out of some bushes, bruised and scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me," she cried while running toward 
the officers, one of them wrote. "She kept saying: 'You never do anything about 
him. You talk to him and then leave." 
</P>
<P>
 During a fight after a New Year's Eve party at the house, Simpson had punched 
and kicked his wife and pulled her hair and screamed, "I'll kill you!" 
according to the documents. He had slapped her so hard, one police report said, 
that a handprint was left on her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, when Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal battery charges, 
Municipal Judge Ronald Schoenberg overruled prosecutors' requests that he serve 
a month in jail because of the severity of the beating and undergo an intensive 
yearlong treatment program for men who batter their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, according to the court documents and interviews with prosecutors 
Thursday, Simpson received no jail time and was allowed to pick his own 
psychiatrist and receive counseling over the phone, which prosecutors said was 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports are in marked contrast to a public statement by Simpson when he 
was named an NBC football analyst in July, 1989. At a news conference to 
announce his hiring, Simpson downplayed the incident: "It was really a bum rap. 
We had a fight, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, prosecutors said they had sought the jail time because of the 
severity of the beating, and that they had wanted Simpson to undergo intensive 
treatment for spousal abuse because they believed his problem was deep-rooted 
and potentially dangerous to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very concerned for her safety," Lisa Foux, who counseled Nicole Simpson 
as a victims' advocate for the city attorney's office, said Thursday. "Without 
appropriate intervention and consequences for batterers' actions, (we believed) 
the violence (would) get more frequent, and more severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in the 1989 incident emphasized Thursday that they were not trying 
to link the earlier case with the homicide investigation. Nevertheless, the 
prosecutor in the case, Deputy City Atty. Robert Pingle, said: "I was not happy 
with the sentence. I felt that the case merited jail time." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, who represented Simpson in that case and who was his lawyer 
in the current homicide investigation until Wednesday, would not comment on the 
reports. Schoenberg could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 After the case was over, Nicole Simpson talked frequently with another 
victims' advocate. "Nicole repeatedly told her that she feared for her life," 
said Deputy City Atty. Alana L. Bowman, domestic violence coordinator for the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thursday that they did not know exactly how many times officers 
had been called to the Simpson residence to intervene in domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers first responded at 3:30 on that morning in 1989, a woman later 
identified as a housekeeper told them over an intercom that "everything was 
fine" and that police were not needed, one report said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officers, who had received word through police dispatchers of a 
frantic 911 from Nicole Simpson, demanded to see her. Then they saw her run out 
of the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 As she told the officers her account of what happened, O.J. Simpson came 
outside dressed in a bathrobe, and began yelling at his wife, who was seated in 
a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson told police that he had been drinking with his wife when they began 
arguing, and that any injuries were the accidental result of "a mutual 
wrestling-type altercation." 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers took a crime report from Nicole Simpson, he became angry that 
he was going to be arrested. He later slipped out a side exit, got into his 
Bentley and drove off, one police report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said late Thursday that they did not know if Simpson was 
arrested later that day or turned himself in.

PLAN TO REINTRODUCE WOLVES TO IDAHO AND YELLOWSTONE IS OKD

<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has given final approval to a plan to 
reintroduce the endangered gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming 
and to central Idaho for the first time in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, which was backed by environmentalists but opposed by 
ranchers fearful for their livestock, about 30 wolves initially will be 
collared and monitored in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the drafting of final rules, the animals would gradually be 
reintroduced to Yellowstone and Idaho beginning this fall. The aim is to have 
at least 100 wolves at each location by the year 2002.

COX PLAYED BIG ROLE IN SCORING CUP; BUREAUCRACY: THE O.C. CONGRESSMAN HELPED

 Oh, so no w you're a World Cup Soccer fan. Now that the commemorative coins 
are minted and the T-shirts are printed and the hawkers are selling the flags 
and the American team is warming up in Mission Viejo and the first game starts 
today and all you have to do is get a ticket to the final in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, your speech is peppered with words like "mid-fielder" and 
"header" and "corner kick." 
</P>
<P>
 But where were you in 1986 when the United States government nearly mucked the 
whole thing up? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth be known, most Americans don't get soccer. They never have. This is 
the most popular sport in the world, and most of the games, if they are 
broadcast at all, are not even broadcast in English. And so it came to pass 
that World Cup Soccer, played for the first time in the United States, might 
not be here at all if not for the likes of Christopher Cox -- USC soccer player 
turned White House legal counsel turned Republican congressman from Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cox who helped steer World Cup officials through Washington's 
bureaucratic rapids when the United States was first proposed as a venue eight 
years ago, securing an executive order from then-President Ronald Reagan that 
directed the cooperation of all federal agencies and cinched World Cup USA 
1994. He has since watched over everything -- from the commemorative coin to 
the site of the American team's practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a key. Everybody in the damned government had their fingers in this," 
said Eddie Mahe, who ran the U.S. Soccer Federation's 1986 campaign to bring 
the event to the United States. "Without him, I don't know that it would have 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the process behind this event, one must understand the United 
States' tepid relationship with a sport beloved by the rest of the world: 
</P>
<P>
 British fans have been known to get so worked up over soccer that they trample 
each other to death. But a recent Harris Poll suggests that only 20% of the 
Americans are even aware that the World Cup will be played here, and fewer than 
half of those intend to watch it. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup soccer draws a global audience of 2 billion -- that's 2 1/2 times 
the number of people who tune into the Super Bowl. But when professional soccer 
was briefly played in Anaheim several years ago, officials tried to draw a 
crowd by asking the Beach Boys to perform; the Beach Boys left before the first 
kick.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't as though America hasn't tried to love soccer. Once, Henry Kissinger 
went to Stockholm to persuade FIFA, the international soccer body, to send the 
World Cup here. FIFA said the United States was a pain in the neck and gave the 
games to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out FIFA officials are more accustomed to dealing with leaders who 
sign a piece of paper and say "let the games begin." They do not take kindly to 
an unappreciative public and a President who has to get permission from every 
agency of government just so a few countries can kick a ball around a field. 
</P>
<P>
 So one can only imagine a soccer lover's panic in 1986 when the United States 
was in the running to host the 1994 World Cup and the bureaucratic monster 
reared its ugly head. The Department of Treasury wanted to know about taxes on 
income earned by foreign soccer players in the United States. Agriculture 
wanted to know about the foreign food some athletes planned to import (soccer 
players are evidently quite finicky eaters). Labor was muttering something 
about a 40-hour work week. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Baker, then Reagan's chief of staff, sensed trouble. He needed an 
attorney who could not only navigate the Washington bureaucracy, but relate to 
a sport that required the use of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 There stood Chris Cox, who had played four years of soccer at St. Thomas 
Academy in St. Paul, Minn., when most of the other kids in his high school 
class went out for football. A fellow who played varsity soccer at USC, knowing 
that any other varsity sport at such a prestigious university would have been 
out of his reach. ("Soccer was accessible to mere mortals," he would later 
recount.) So what if Cox did switch to hockey at Harvard grad school? This guy 
knew soccer. Baker gave him the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "World Cup USA was in a panic," Cox remembered. "They needed waivers from 
virtually every agency of the federal government. The President didn't have the 
authority to waive the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 In record time, Cox prepared an executive order directing the agencies to fall 
in line. Reagan signed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris personally kept the heat on," Mahe remembered reverently. "He kept a 
club to the head of every agency. The order was signed on a Saturday, three 
hours before the bid was to get on a plane for Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Chris, we wouldn't have had anyone inside the White House," Mahe 
said. "He just kept saying 'President Reagan wants this. Go do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, great sighs of relief were breathed by American soccer fans, a 
much-deprived lot left to worship a game that, in the words of one foreign 
journalist, "America can't bring itself to love." But there was no national 
jump for joy, not like when Los Angeles locked up the '84 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nineteen-ninety-four seemed like a long time off, so it was not a very 
impressive story to tell at the time," Cox said modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the ensuing years helping introduce a bill allowing the commemorative 
World Cup coins to be minted, lobbied to have the American team practice in 
Mission Viejo and helped the Rose Bowl win out as final venue over someplace in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, the U.S. team presented him with the first jersey to be 
signed by all 22 members; he sent it out for framing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he can sit back in soccer nirvana, enjoying a game he has loved most of 
his life, even if he hasn't played it in 20 years. Maybe America will catch his 
soccer fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's over, all 22 of the home team's players will leave the country to 
play with foreign soccer clubs, because soccer at their level does not exist in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," the congressman said, "it's just easier to watch football."WORLD

GNATCATCHER GETS TEMPORARY HAVEN ON THREATENED LIST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California gnatcatcher was placed temporarily back on the federal 
threatened species list Thursday by the same judge who ordered the bird removed 
from the list two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial ruling May 2, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin had 
ordered the gnatcatcher removed from the list, saying that the government had 
failed to make available to the public all the data it relied upon when it 
declared the gnatcatcher threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt had responded almost immediately 
by making the information public and petitioning the judge to, in effect, put a 
"stay" on his decision while federal authorities provide evidence to prove that 
the listing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decision reversing himself Thursday, Sporkin wrote that what "should 
have been done initially . . . is being done now," referring to Babbitt's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the judge's ruling, the federal government will have 100 days in 
which to accept and evaluate public comment on newly available scientific data 
before making a final decision.

JURORS REJECT SUIT AGAINST COURT OFFICIAL; TRIAL: THE ADMINISTRATOR DID NOT 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A FORMER COUNTY EMPLOYEE WHO CLAIMED HE SEXUALLY HARASSED 
HER AND DROVE HER FROM HER JOB, PANEL DECIDES. 
</P>

<P>
 An Orange County jury rejected a sexual harassment lawsuit Thursday by a 
former county employee who alleged that a top courthouse administrator taunted 
her with insults and drove her from her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they believed Bonnie Severson had a bitter work relationship with 
her boss, but said she never proved that the actions of Central Municipal Court 
Administrator Robert Kuhel amounted to sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go with the evidence that was presented," juror Haven Tieck said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Severson alleged that Kuhel repeatedly called her a "bitch" at 
work -- an insult she said was sometimes preceded by "coldhearted" or 
"pigheaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhel, who supervises more than 220 employees at the Santa Ana courthouse, 
denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he's thrilled," said defense attorney Charles Matheis Jr., who 
represented Kuhel and the county during the weeklong trial. "But it was sad it 
had to happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
 A disappointed Severson said: "I think more women need to stand up and be 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "It's a difficult thing to leave a career of 20 years, spend five 
years in the legal system and have this type of result." 
</P>
<P>
 After about seven hours of deliberations, the Superior Court jury decided 10 
to 2 that Kuhel did not discriminate against Severson, a former division head 
at the courthouse, by creating a hostile and offensive work environment based 
in part on her gender. Unlike criminal cases, a jury verdict in a civil trial 
does not have to be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Severson alleged that her boss created such a hostile work 
environment that she was forced to take early retirement from her 
$36,000-a-year job in 1988. Her retirement came on her 50th birthday, the 
earliest date she could retire and still claim minimum retirement benefits, her 
lawyer, William M. Crosby, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson, who began working as a court clerk in 1968, said her problems with 
Kuhel did not start until 1983, when she was was promoted to court services 
division head. 
</P>
<P>
 Tieck said Thursday that Severson's case might have been strengthened if she 
had filed a grievance with the county at the time of the alleged incidents. 
Without any documentation, Tieck said, the case boiled down to Severson's word 
against Kuhel's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhel's lawyer characterized the case as unsubstantiated claims by a woman 
troubled by personal problems at home and said that the suit amounted to 
nothing more than a bid for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhel conceded he had given Severson a novelty note pad at one point inscribed 
with the phrase "From the desk of the bitch," but that another female employee 
picked out the gift, Matheis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the jury believed Severson's claims of verbal abuse, there was no 
evidence that such comments amounted to gender discrimination, Matheis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Severson was seeking more than $500,000 in compensation from the county for 
lost wages and benefits as well as emotional distress, and unspecified punitive 
damages from Kuhel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since retiring, Severson has found work as a real estate agent, but only after 
a substantial struggle to find a new career, her lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, Severson said she regretted not filing a formal complaint 
with the county years before her 1990 lawsuit, but said she had been concerned 
at the time that it would cause more problems at work.

PARTIAL VERDICT IN RAT CASE; JURY STILL DELIBERATING; CRIME: CHILD-ENDANGERMENT 
CHARGES AGAINST PARENTS DECIDED BUT PANEL IS SPLIT ON MANSLAUGHTER IN DEATH OF 
BABY BITTEN 110 TIMES. DECISIONS ARE TEMPORARILY SEALED. 
</P>

<P>
 An Orange County jury was having trouble Thursday reaching a unanimous verdict 
in the manslaughter trial of a homeless couple whose infant son was bitten 110 
times by a starving pet rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors announced that they had reached verdicts on two child endangerment 
charges, but said they were deadlocked 9-3 on the involuntary manslaughter 
counts against Kathyleen and Steven Giguere Sr., said defense attorney William 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury resumed deliberations on the remaining counts Thursday, then recessed 
for the day without reaching a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Kazaharu Makino ordered jurors to return to court today) 
to determine whether the case is headed for a mistrial, or whether jurors feel 
additional deliberations will help them close the gap, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jim Tanizaki. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury did not indicate whether it was split in favor of conviction or 
acquittal. The judge sealed the verdicts on the endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents were arrested after 4-month-old Steven Jr. died Aug. 26 in the 
trash-strewn, roach-infested station wagon the family called home. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends the rat killed the baby after striking an artery, 
causing him to bleed to death. Tanizaki contends the couple knew the rodent had 
a history of biting people, yet left the helpless infant and his 3-year-old 
sister alone in the vehicle with the rat. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys say the child was dead from sudden infant death syndrome 
before the rat attack. The parents are distraught over the death of their child 
and are being blamed unfairly for a freak accident, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the child endangerment charges carry the more severe penalty 
-- up to six years in prison. Involuntary manslaughter carries a four-year 
prison term. Under sentencing guidelines, the most either parents could face is 
six years in prison even if convicted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The rat was killed after the attack and a necropsy -- an autopsy for animals 
-- showed it was in advanced stages of starvation and also was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, witnesses testified that much of the money the parents received 
from welfare and food stamps was spent on liquor and junk food. Witnesses also 
testified that the family's car was strewn with soiled clothing, dirty diapers, 
rat feces, gnats, flies and roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecution experts also conceded that Steven Jr. seemed well-fed and 
showed no signs of abuse before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Social Service workers were repeatedly asked to investigate the 
couple, but each time, social service workers found insufficient evidence to 
remove the children. Workers were unable to locate the transient couple to 
investigate a complaint filed by the child's grandparents just before the 
death.

DAY OF DECISION FOR SILICONE IMPLANT RECIPIENTS; HEALTH: FOR ABOUT 1,000 LOCAL 
WOMEN WITH AILMENTS, TODAY IS THE DEADLINE TO ACCEPT A PRODUCT-LIABILITY 
SETTLEMENT FROM MANUFACTURERS OR PURSUE INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS. THE FINANCIAL 
VARIABLES ARE MANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Claudia Roberts wrestled with all the issues -- medical, legal, financial and 
emotional -- and tentatively decided to accept the settlement offer that 
silicone breast implant manufacturers are extending to women who believe the 
devices have destroyed their health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to be optimistic," said Roberts, 43, one of about 1,000 Orange 
County women who, like their counterparts across the country, face a 
court-established deadline today to decide whether they want to reject the 
settlement and pursue their own lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts expects to receive $450,000 to compensate her for the chronic fatigue, 
joint pain and headaches she blames on breast implants she had for seven years, 
before they were surgically removed 19 months ago. She said she wants to tuck 
the money in a savings account to help her two children through college in case 
her health worsens and she can't continue working as a hairstylist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't seek retaliation, just some future security for my family's welfare, 
so I am not a burden," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of silicone breast implants have offered a settlement of up to 
$4.3 billion. They contend that will be enough to give each claimant in the 
United States between $105,000 and $1.4 million, depending on her illness, its 
severity and her age when she became sick. The hitch is that the awards could 
be reduced if there are more eligible claimants than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 If award reductions occur, the women will have an opportunity to back out of 
the settlement. But if too many women pull out, the settlement will fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of women are going into it with the understanding there is a 
reasonable chance it won't work, that too many will qualify and there won't be 
enough money in the fund," said attorney Ramon Rossi Lopez, whose Newport Beach 
firm represents about 500 women with silicone breast implant complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez estimates that, despite the uncertainty, 80% to 90% of women with 
silicone breast implant complaints will cast their lots with the settlement. He 
also predicts that the manufacturers will beef up their existing settlement 
offer, even if it means adding billions of dollars, rather than incur the 
expense of fighting thousands of individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that about half of his clients would be content with the payment 
schedule that is projected in the settlement, while others would accept it just 
to avoid the delays and emotional strain of the court process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women, he conceded, would have trouble pursuing their own 
product-liability lawsuits because they failed to file suit within the legal 
time frame. Others would have difficulty proving that the silicone was 
responsible for their symptoms. Still others, he said, have been unable to 
identify the manufacturers of their implants, or the manufacturers have gone 
bankrupt, making it unproductive to sue them for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement deadline comes two days after the New England Journal of 
Medicine published a study that found no evidence that silicone breast implants 
cause illnesses. Lopez said he worries that the study could scare women into 
the settlement who would be better off taking their cases to court.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman pursuing a product-liability lawsuit against a silicone breast implant 
manufacturer would need to prove that silicone migrating from the implant into 
her body triggered her health problems. However, a woman who accepts the 
settlement would not have to prove silicone was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (publicity about the study) will influence some people on the fence 
to opt into the settlement," said Lopez, who contends that the study conducted 
at the Mayo Clinic was "biased" because it was sponsored by plastic surgeons 
and did not look for the kind of novel autoimmune diseases from which his 
clients suffer. Ann Andrews, a plaintiff attorney in Long Beach, also 
complained about what she called a "well-timed" warning from Dow Corning Corp. 
-- once the leading manufacturer of silicone breast implants -- that if too 
many women opt to pursue individual lawsuits, the company would consider filing 
for bankruptcy protection. This also is pressuring women to settle, she 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews cautioned that the settlement has shortcomings. For one, she said, a 
team of claims adjusters may determine that a woman's medical records do not 
substantiate the amount of damages she is demanding. As a result, she said, a 
woman may be pushed into a lower-paying category. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women were still in a quandary whether to jettison the settlement in the 
last days before the deadline. Richard Radcliffe, a Newport Beach attorney, 
said he had received eleventh-hour calls from hundreds of women. "It is 
difficult for them to find lawyers with the expertise or interest in handling 
these matters," Radcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 If women do not mail an exclusion form by today's deadline, they will 
automatically remain in the class action. But some women who requested an 
official settlement information packet will have until the end of the month to 
make up their minds, if the packet was mailed to them on or after June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Women rejecting the settlement, the lawyers say, are primarily those with the 
most severe disabilities and income losses who feel they would be grossly 
undercompensated. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Walsh of Laguna Hills, founder of the Orange County-based Breast Implant 
Information Foundation, said she is determined to go ahead with her lawsuit. 
Walsh, who had breast implant ruptures, said although her diseases -- including 
scleroderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis -- would qualify her for the top 
$1.4-million settlement award, that would fall far short of her losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement would not compensate the pain and suffering, future medical 
expenses and loss of future wages," said Walsh, 48, who is on Social Security 
disability. Walsh, who suffered severe scarring from multiple operations on her 
breasts, said another shortcoming of the settlement is that it does not offer 
compensation for disfigurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Mello -- who, like Walsh, is an outspoken advocate for breast implant 
victims -- said she also is forging ahead with her lawsuit, which is scheduled 
for trial in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa woman said she is skeptical about the proposed breast implant 
settlement, fearing that the final outcome will repeat the frustrating history 
of the settlement involving the Dalcon Shield, a defective intrauterine birth 
control device. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dalcon Shield case, a trust fund of $2.5 billion was set up by the 
American Home Products Corp. in 1985 to compensate 325,000 women who filed 
lawsuits. As of last December, 85% of those eligible had been paid $935 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello has a letter from a woman in the Dalcon Shield settlement who has 
received only $725 after nine years and now, as a silicone breast implant 
claimant, is choosing to opt out of this latest settlement. "For me it is deja 
vu," wrote the woman, whose identity Mello withheld.

IT PAYS TO HANG AROUND; ENGINEERS FINALLY PAY RESPECTS TO WWII-ERA MARINE BASE 
STRUCTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To see a group of engineers gush over the blimp hangars at the Tustin Marine 
Corps Helicopter Air Station, you would think the giant structures were the 
eighth wonder of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that is exaggerating the hangars' importance, said Fred J. Meier, a 
retired civil engineer from Santa Ana, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a nearly three-year effort by Meier, the twin hangars Thursday 
received the same national recognition that has been extended to other 
engineering landmarks in the United States, including the Statue of Liberty and 
the Golden Gate and Brooklyn bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony at the Marine base, the American Society of Civil Engineers 
dedicated a plaque that recognizes the two hangars as the largest wooden frame 
structures in the world. Although the buildings already are listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places, the event still had all the pomp of a 
military ceremony, complete with color guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes these hangars unique is they are the largest wooden structures of 
their kind in the world," Meier said. "The frame is made entirely of wood, and 
we believe they support the largest covered space of any building in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1942 at a cost of $2.5 million each, the hangars housed 12 blimps 
used for submarine patrol. Each structure stands 18 stories high, 1,088 feet 
long, 297 feet wide and covers almost 300,000 square feet. It is possible to 
play a basketball game, football game and soccer match in one building 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge wooden doors, which have six leaves that weigh between 26 and 39 tons 
each, fold open on steel rails like an accordion, powered by electric motors at 
each end. Giant concrete pylons anchor each corner of the hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction was supervised by the Navy Department's Bureau of Yards and 
Docks. Wood was used for the framing because steel was needed to build ships, 
tanks and weapons for World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Klehn, executive vice president of Dames & Moore, a Los Angeles-based 
engineering firm that helped construct the hangars, said the soft, swampy 
ground presented a challenge that few engineers had faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, our firm was one of a handful in the country that specialized in 
foundation engineering," Klehn said. "Our engineers bored 150 feet down to get 
soil samples that were tested for strength and compressibility. From those 
tests, the engineers decided the best foundation for the buildings were pilings 
that were pounded 100 feet into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the pilings and buildings have survived several earthquakes is 
testament to the ingenuity of the engineers, who were working in a new science, 
Klehn said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, blimps were phased out, and over the years the hangers saw a 
variety of non-military uses. In 1949, Howard Hughes rented space in one hangar 
for a blimp that his company used to advertise the movie "The Outlaw," which 
was produced by Hughes and starred Jane Russell. Local canning and trucking 
companies also rented storage space in the hangars in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, when the Korean War began, Tustin was recommissioned as the first 
Marine helicopter base. Today, each hangar can house almost 100 helicopters.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps is scheduled to close the base by 1997 and turn the land over 
to the city of Tustin. It is not know what will happen to the two hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an attempt to preserve the buildings," Meier said. "I would like 
to see them preserved, but that's not up to me or to our group. We simply want 
them to be recognized for the engineering marvel that they are."

<P>
 A vacant seat on the Parks and Recreation Commission was filled this week when 
the City Council appointed Steve Brunette to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette and three other candidates interviewed Tuesday by the council were 
seeking the spot vacated by Kenneth Ryan, who resigned from the commission to 
serve on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 With Brunette's appointment, the Parks and Recreation Commission now has five 
members appointed since November. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the previous five commissioners were fired from the commission last 
September after a letter from them critical of the City Council appeared in a 
weekly city newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The former commission members came under fire last year from the City Council 
and representatives of several youth sports organizations for not focusing 
their attention on the needs of youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those groups also questioned why the commission had four members 
without children involved in youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The new commissioners are all active in at least one youth sports 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette will join the commission next month and serve the balance of Ryan's 
term, which expires in December, 1995. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON PARK EQUIPMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will vote June 27 on a plan to add a volleyball court and new 
playground equipment to Edison Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has divided the College Park West neighborhood.Some residents argue 
that the 30-year-old park needs improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, whose homes back up to the park, fear that the volleyball court 
will attract loud youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks Commission voted last month to support the proposal, which was 
submitted by a group of residents who also are raising money to pay for the 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said Edison Park could be more valuable to residents if a sand 
volleyball court is built and the aging metal jungle gym is replaced by a more 
modern playground. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $8,000 has been raised to pay for some of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents complained that the park already generates too much noise. 
</P>
<P>
 They have asked the city to add lights to the park and increase security 
patrols.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 68% AT SCHOOL PASS PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST 
</P>

<P>
 Heritage Oak Private Elementary School has announced that a record 68% of its 
kindergarten-through-sixth-grade students recently qualified for Presidential 
Physical Fitness Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the highest percentage in the state, according to curriculum 
director Elizabeth Holloman, who said Heritage Oak finished a close second to a 
Temecula school in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 64% of Heritage Oak students earned the award. Statewide results 
are expected in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I think we have it," said Holloman, who credited physical 
education instructor Leonard Johnson with dramatically increasing the fitness 
of students over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Johnson began the training program, less than 20% of the students 
passed the nationally certified test, Holloman said. "It's amazing to see how 
much better they are physically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the students in shape, Johnson instituted a program of running, 
pushups, pullups, relays and other activities. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BALANCED CITY BUDGET RAISES NO FEES, TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has adopted a $47.2-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year that includes no increases in fees or taxes and is balanced for the first 
time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city trimmed $900,000 from the previous year's budget by asking each city 
department to reduce operating expenses 2% for the fiscal year that begins July 
1, said Scott Morgan, assistant to the city manager. In previous years, the 
city drew on its reserves to make up deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the reductions should be all but imperceptible to residents, 
Morgan said, with the notable exception of cuts in swimming pool programs and a 
23% drop in new book purchases at the library. Morgan said the library still 
hopes to extend its hours, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the savings came from a continued hiring freeze that began in 1991 and 
excludes only certain police positions. Other savings are from a program that 
limits all employees except police and firefighters to a 36-hour workweek, 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget, approved by the council Tuesday, was the first compiled by 
City Manager David F. Dixon, who was hired in February. Council members hailed 
the new "Dixon Era," as Councilman Mike Spurgeon phrased it. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed appreciation for the nuts-and-bolts work that went 
into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said that in recent years council members have 
found themselves involved in marking up line items in the budget, but can 
return to being a policy-making body with Dixon at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a pleasure to come to this meeting and find all this work has been 
done by the staff and the city manager," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first concern of the staff and manager was coping with cuts in sales taxes 
and state revenue that have totaled $9 million over the past three years, Dixon 
said. "As a result of these declines, the community has faced some hard 
decisions," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget may have to be revised in midyear if the state makes further cuts, 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to knock on wood and hope for the best that the state won't come 
after the cities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon noted that he wants to cut the city's expenditures by $5 million more 
over the next 12 to 18 months, as part of a restructuring plan. "We must define 
what are our wants and what are our needs," he said. "Currently, they are not 
the same."LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; TRASH FEE BILLING CHANGE UNDER STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is studying the possibility of putting trash collection fees 
on property tax bills, but City Manager Fred Maley has warned that the change 
could cause many problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in billing could assure homeowners of no increase in trash fees for 
the next two years, according to Mayor Barry L. Denes. He said the city's trash 
hauler, Taormina Industries Inc., has agreed to freeze fees until July 1, 1996, 
if the city agrees to a 10-year extension of its current five-year contract and 
if the city also agrees to bill homeowners on their property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley, however, cautioned the council against any immediate action on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that in the overall interests of public perception it's a good 
idea," Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said he believes the council needs more information before changing the 
city's current form of trash billing. Taormina Industries now bills homeowners 
directly, Maley said. He said that the public is likely to be confused if the 
city starts billing for trash fees as part of property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tax roll billing is not an assessment, not a tax," Maley noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Denes presented the proposed change in trash billing to the council Tuesday 
night during a special budget study session. Denes said a council committee has 
been meeting with Taormina representatives. An overall goal, he said, has been 
to keep trash fees from rising. He said the proposed agreement would accomplish 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 But some on the council were skeptical of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares me to think we'd be tying ourselves up for 15 years" in a 
trash-hauling contract, said Councilman Bob Bell. Councilman Joseph S. Barsa 
said he also has concerns about a 15-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Patchin noted that both Maley and City Atty. Leonard Hampel had 
raised questions about the proposed billing changeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Denes told the council that no immediate decision on the proposal is needed 
and that the idea will be studied further. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; KIDNAPING SUSPECT SOUGHT BY POLICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were searching for a 32-year-old man who allegedly kidnaped his son at 
gunpoint during a domestic dispute Thursday morning, then returned the boy 
unharmed three hours later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:15 a.m., Elias Garcia Vidal forced his way into the apartment of 
37-year-old Maria Melendez in the 1000 block of West Highland Street, police 
said.Melendez, who had obtained a restraining order from a judge against Vidal, 
was in the apartment with their two children, Sgt. Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidal "brandished a handgun and Melendez and her daughter ran for safety," 
Faust said. "Vidal then took his 4-year-old son from the residence." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing Vidal had fled to Mexico, police searched for him and the boy, who has 
the same name as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the father returned to the area about 11:15 a.m. in a different 
car than the white 1983 Buick he was originally seen driving. He managed to 
drop the child off near Melendez's apartment complex without being noticed, 
Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was reunited with his mother, who declined to talk about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least there was a happy ending," Faust said.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICIALS KICK OFF ANTI-CRIME DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The large yellow letters on a black background demand attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen!!!" the billboard message blares. "Orange County: If you ignore the 
plague of this county -- Crime -- our children will not have a future. Get 
involved now! Help reduce the causes of guns, gangs and graffiti. Call 
1-800-78-CRIME." 
</P>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren joined local law enforcement officials 
and dignitaries Thursday to kick off a campaign designed to get more people 
involved in reporting crimes and assisting law officers. In the next week, the 
message will be posted on 100 billboards and 100 more bus stop shelters in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement needs community support, perhaps now more than ever," Lungren 
said during a ceremony outside Santa Ana City Hall. "That's a direct goal of 
this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is the latest sparked by businessman Robert Acosta, known for his 
anti-graffiti ad campaign of last year, which included billboards and messages 
beamed in Santa Ana from the Goodyear blimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta and his Newport Beach public relations firm raised about $25,000 
through private donations to design and produce the new billboards. Advertising 
and media companies donated the billboard and bus shelter space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not costing the taxpayers one penny," said Acosta, a former public 
relations officer with the Santa Ana Police Department. "This problem of guns, 
gangs and graffiti is a major one in this county. What we have to do is bring 
everyone together and work together." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make a difference because crime is the concern of every 
American." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards and bus stop shelters carry the toll-free crime hot line of 
WeTip Inc., a national nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing and 
reducing crime. The 22-year-old company operates a 24-hour bilingual hot line 
for reporting criminal activity anonymously, offering rewards of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 WeTip, which forwards 500 to 1,000 tips to law enforcement agencies nationwide 
each day, added five operators for the new Orange County campaign alone, 
bringing local staff to about 60, said Bill Brownell, founder and chief 
executive officer of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren and other officials at Thursday's ceremony called the campaign a model 
for public and private partnerships. "I don't think there's any doubt this 
helps," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will include radio and television ads and opportunities for 
sponsors. For more information on the campaign, contact Robert Acosta & 
Associates at (714) 252-5474. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; MACKENZIE STREETERS WANT SPEED RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years Mackenzie Street residents have lobbied first the county and now 
the young city of Laguna Hills to do something -- anything -- to slow drivers 
who use their residential street as a high-speed shortcut between La Paz Road 
and Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the residents' latest year-and-a-half campaign for speed humps, stop 
signs or cul-de-sacs, the speeders still control the street, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not tried stop signs or speed humps, instead trying to choke 
traffic down into narrower spaces through pylons where Mackenzie intersects 
Pike Road and Cousteau Street and new white lines painted along both sides of 
Mackenzie. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Ken Rosenfield said such funneling of traffic has worked in 
other cities, and that he plans to leave the simulated "choker" in place for 
three months, surveying traffic to see if speeds slow. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents say the stripes have made the street even more dangerous, with 
speeding cars now coming within inches of crashing into each other, and drivers 
flooring it once they've passed the pylons. 
</P>
<P>
 They say low-impact speed humps would force commuters who use Mackenzie as a 
freeway alternate during rush hour to slow to the 25-m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed surveys have shown that people regularly cruise the street as fast as 60 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of the foot dragging and the speed monitoring," said William 
Oldham, who has lived on Mackenzie for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is not listening, he said, because, "we're a small minority. Those 
who live on Mackenzie are the only ones who care." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members say speed humps would set an unwelcome precedent in a city 
where no streets have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield said stop signs also are not a good solution because they generally 
are used to assign right of way, not slow drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barricading the street to keep commuters off was tried in the early 1970s but 
was stopped when too many drivers complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Now residents and city officials are waiting to see the results of the 
"choker" trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield will bring preliminary results of the latest speed study to the 
June 28 City Council meeting, along with more information on the speed hump and 
stop sign alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they are frustrated with having spent more than a year and a 
half bringing their problem to the Traffic Commission, the city engineering 
department and the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need another study. We've had study after study," said Susi Schley, 
a Mackenzie resident for 11 years. "The speeders are still speeding. Someone is 
going to get hurt. It's really just a matter of time." LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; TRAFFIC CRASH FATAL TO 2 UCI STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two UC Irvine students were fatally hurt just after noon Thursday when their 
compact car crossed a double center line on Campus Drive and crashed head-on 
into a freight truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were identified as Abbette Rodriguez, 19, of Oceanside and Ritika 
Rajasanhsi, also 19, of Fremont, according to the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women, who were suite mates on the UCI campus, had to be cut out of the 
car they were riding in, Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car came to rest in the westbound lane of Campus Drive, in the marshy area 
between University Drive and Jamboree Road, not far from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajasanhsi, who was a passenger in the car, was pronounced dead at the scene. 
Rodriguez, the driver, died 1 1/2 hours later at Irvine Medical Center, 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajasanhsi was studying social sciences, and Rodriguez was studying physical 
sciences. Both were freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, which came to rest in the eastbound bicycle lane, was 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that the cause of the accident was under investigation but that it 
did not appear that drugs or alcohol were a factor. MARK PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DISASTER RECOVERY CENTER CLOSING TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After serving about 1,000 local residents victimized by last year's fires, the 
Community Disaster Recovery and Preparedness Center will close its doors at 664 
N. Coast Highway today. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the joint state and federal program are waiting for new funding 
sources and hope to reopen the office for another three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, those interested in contacting the organization can go next 
door to the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition for assistance, center manager David 
Sabaroff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center offered a wide range of disaster relief and emergency preparedness 
services, "a brand new concept that had never been tried before," Sabaroff 
said. "Overall, I think we've been very successful and we'd like to keep 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 The fires destroyed 366 homes in Laguna Beach last October, causing millions 
of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The center opened in December with funding for six months. Sabaroff hopes to 
share office space with another nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us at the center feel like we should stay open for a year," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; 2 STREETS WILL GET NEW SPEED LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Changes in the speed limits on two city streets have been approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 One will be raised 5 m.p.h. and the other lowered by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit on Alicia Parkway between the southern city limit and Moulton 
Parkway will be changed from the current 45 m.p.h. to 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that speed limits be fairly set. According to recent court 
rulings, speed limits should be set within 5 m.p.h. of the speed driven by 85% 
of the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 A speed survey conducted in April showed that 85% of the drivers on Alicia 
between Moulton and the city boundary were traveling at 53 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The other change will come on La Paz Road between Paseo de Valencia and 
Rickenbacker Road. The new speed limit will be 35 m.p.h., down from 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic survey showed that 85% of the drivers were traveling at 44 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But the limit was still lowered because of the high number of accidents, the 
presence of Valencia Elementary School and limited sight distance for drivers 
entering La Paz Road from the Mission Hills Shopping Center.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 2 LOCAL SCHOOLS WIN NATIONWIDE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education has designated two Orange County campuses as 
National Blue Ribbon Schools for 1993-94. The honorees are Bryant Ranch 
Elementary in Yorba Linda and Fred Newhart Elementary in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "These schools exemplify some of the most successful programs in the 
California educational system," said William D. Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, 276 public and private elementary schools achieved the 
distinction. Since the program began in 1982, more than 2,500 U.S. schools have 
been honored. In California, 26 public and four private schools are being 
recognized this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Factors considered in the selection process include student achievement, 
teaching environment, parental and community support, curriculum and student 
and teacher attendance. Members of a federal review team visit finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, representatives from the winning schools will attend an awards 
ceremony in Washington, which is expected to include a meeting with President 
Clinton at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Ranch Principal Bonnie Drolet said strong teamwork among parents, 
students and staff members was instrumental in gaining the Blue Ribbon 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very clear vision of where we want to go," Drolet said. "We 
encourage parents to be in the classroom, we encourage students to help one 
another. We try to have an environment of risk taking. Kids know that it's OK 
to try things." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent-Teacher Assn. held fund-raisers for computers and various hands-on 
learning experiences for the children, Drolet said. There is now at least one 
computer in every classroom, and children can access an on-line encyclopedia 
and other resources for their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Drolet said that the site visitor from the federal review team was "very 
impressed with how happy the kids were" at Bryant Ranch and took note of the 
low absentee rate -- less than 1% -- among the 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhart Principal Jean Trygstad said her school's Kids and Seniors Together 
program played a role in winning the Blue Ribbon award. The program encourages 
the 1,600 youngsters from kindergarten through eighth grade to become friends 
with members of the nearby Norman Murray Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We coordinate activities with seniors," Trygstad said. "Some kids do Meals on 
Wheels, they have senior buddies, they talk about careers together, we attend 
their hobby fair, we have a lot of senior volunteers in our classrooms." ALAN

COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT SEEKS $1.2-MILLION FOR HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department has proposed a $1.2-million plan to add a 
helicopter to its firefighting arsenal in an effort to avoid the kind of 
disaster that devastated Laguna Beach last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Having already endorsed the program in concept, the Board of Supervisors is 
expected to approve the request Tuesday so that the helicopter can be in place 
by the Fourth of July weekend, a potentially hazardous period for fire and 
other emergencies, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This contract would give the Fire Department, for the first time, the ability 
for immediate, initial air attack on a fire," Chief Larry J. Holms said in a 
report to the board. "This initial attack response is critical to stopping a 
beginning wildfire and avoiding conflagration." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes Laguna 
Beach where 441 homes were damaged or destroyed in last fall's firestorms, said 
he would support the program if the budget permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, at this time I would like to have it," Riley said. "There is no 
doubt that this would be helpful, but we've got to have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposal, the aircraft would be leased for a year from 
Evergreen Helicopters Inc., which also provides services to the California 
Department of Forestry. Evergreen would be paid through existing savings of 
$1.2 million in the Fire Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The board first endorsed the helicopter program in March, when Holms presented 
a 50-page report reviewing the department's response to wildfires in Laguna 
Beach, Anaheim Hills and another off Ortega Highway. Together, the fires caused 
$528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, Holmes said that helicopters were necessary to fight fires of 
the magnitude that raked Orange County last fall and indicated that more 
readily available firefighting helicopters could have spared much damage in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past and during the fall firestorms, Orange County has relied on other 
agencies to provide helicopter assistance during fire emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board, the helicopter will be based at John Wayne Airport 
and also would be used for fire detection, personnel transportation and rescue 
services.

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL HOLD FUND-RAISER IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democrats are arriving in force to Republican-controlled Orange County on 
Saturday, but local GOP leaders say they aren't worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending the message that no corner of the state will be ignored in their march 
toward the Nov. 8 general election, the Democratic Party's candidates for 
statewide office will hold their first post-primary fund-raiser at the local 
ranch of former state party Chairman Richard O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those scheduled to attend the "Fiesta de California" are Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown, lieutenant governor nominee Gray Davis, 
acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, Controller candidate Kathleen Connell, 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who is running for attorney general, 
and others on the state slate. The only major candidate who is not expected to 
attend is U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown also is expected to attend the statewide 
campaign kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Maliniak, a spokesman for the California Democratic Party, said party 
leaders hope to raise $100,000 from the event, with half the amount pledged to 
voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in central Orange County, where 
Democratic voter registration is highest. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the funds will go to the state party, which is expected to spend 
$6 million to $8 million for the fall campaign, an increase over the $2 million 
spent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are bringing the statewide team right into the belly of the beast," 
Maliniak said. "There's a significant opportunity there (in Orange County), and 
we are trying to show a unified support for the strong Democratic team we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic registration for the June 7 primary was 34.4% of all county 
voters -- about 18 points below the Republican registration of 52.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Democrats do not expect to become the dominant party in Orange 
County in one campaign season, Maliniak said party leaders hope to make enough 
gains to cut into the 2-to-1 vote ratio that statewide GOP candidates count on 
in Orange County to offset Democratic Party strongholds in Los Angeles and the 
San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Christiansen, the local GOP director, claimed the Democratic Party 
fund-raiser will only help the GOP cause because "it makes our volunteers that 
much more active." 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen said local GOP activists will be staffing tables at malls, 
grocery stores and swap meets this weekend to step up their own voter 
registration drive and "show the Republican presence" in Orange County.

LEGAL CHALLENGE TO COUNTY CAMPAIGN LAW WITHDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawsuit alleging that Orange County's strict campaign contribution law is 
discriminatory because it limits the amount of money married couples can donate 
to candidates is being withdrawn because it is not an appropriate test case, 
attorneys said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have standing," said attorney Dana Reed, whose wife, Debra, filed 
suit April 26 against the campaign reform act known as Measure T. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which was overwhelmingly approved by voters in June, 1992, 
candidates for county office are prohibited from accepting contributions of 
more than $1,000 from any single source during an election cycle, generally 
four years. Married couples are considered one source and bound by the $1,000 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Reed's lawsuit was the first legal challenge to the county ordinance. 
According to court documents, she gave $100 to Supervisor William G. Steiner 
after her husband had already contributed $1,000 to the supervisor's reelection 
campaign. Steiner's treasurer returned Debra Reed's check because it appeared 
to exceed the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Reed said Thursday that a recent review of the dates of the checks, 
however, showed that a portion of his contribution to Steiner was made six days 
before he and his wife were married and did not apply to the couple's maximum 
allowable contribution to Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that discovery, Dana Reed said his wife must drop the suit. He said 
he was alerted to the situation by Shirley L. Grindle, a local political 
activist who pushed for the campaign finance reform law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It galls me to say this, but Shirley Grindle got me on this one," said Dana 
Reed, adding that he still intends to challenge the law some time in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said she wasn't surprised that the Reeds had to dismiss the suit. She 
said she was not worried about a challenge to the law because she wants "this 
issue resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said the reason the law restricts married couples' contributions is 
actually to protect contributors from getting "hit up twice" by political 
fund-raisers. "We're not trying to tread on anyone's constitutional rights," 
she said.

EXCESSIVE FORCE SUIT AGAINST HUNTINGTON POLICE DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County jury deliberated just 45 minutes Thursday before dismissing 
an excessive force lawsuit by a Long Beach man who claimed Huntington Beach 
police assaulted him during an arrest five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was served and the promptness of the jury's verdict demonstrates 
that," said Mark Rutter, a Long Beach lawyer who represented the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Grantham, a 43-year-old screen fabricator, was seeking $550,000 damage 
from the city and Officer Richard McMillan, an eight-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham alleged that McMillan slammed his face into the pavement after 
officers stopped a car in which Grantham was a passenger. The car was stopped 
by officers because it had been reported stolen to Long Beach police a few days 
before. It was recovered before the May 27, 1989 car stop, but Long Beach 
police failed to update their computer record on the stolen vehicle, according 
to testimony during the trial in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham said he suffered cuts on his chin and aggravated a back injury he had 
suffered after falling down a stairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam earlier ruled that police officers 
had not violated Grantham's civil rights by detaining him. 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham's attorney, Mark Carrozzo, could not be reached for comment. But in 
closing remarks Thursday, the attorney said his client only wanted to be 
compensated for his injuries.

1,000 LOSE TELEPHONE SERVICE IN ANAHEIM WHEN CABLE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 1,000 businesses and residents lost telephone service Thursday when an 
underground cable was cut, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The outage occurred about 2:25 p.m. and service is expected to be restored 
early this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have technicians out there now, who have to get in and splice the lines 
back together," Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. "We'll do a full 
investigation on how these cables were damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell officials suspect a contractor digging underground may have 
sliced a thick bundle of telephone lines near Lincoln Avenue and Anaheim 
Boulevard, close to Anaheim City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to call about a dozen City Hall offices Thursday afternoon resulted 
in repeated busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonniksen said Pacific Bell technicians will monitor customer complaints about 
service today to pinpoint which customers in Anaheim lost service.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where those thousand customers are and who they are, we're not sure," she 
said. "We do know it's about 60% business and 40% residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police said Thursday they had received no complaints from telephone 
customers who had lost service.

FAMILIAR FOES MAY MEET AGAIN IN SUMMER; BASKETBALL: MATER DEI AND EDISON BOYS, 
WOODBRIDGE AND MATER DEI GIRLS MIGHT FACE OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Mater Dei boys' basketball team, led by Schea Cotton, a 6-foot-5 sophomore 
who was a member of The Times' All-Orange County basketball team last season, 
will compete in six tournaments this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, 33-1 last season in winning their third consecutive Southern 
Section title, play host to their tournament beginning June 22. They'll also 
take part in the Surf City tournament July 1-3, the Nike-Mater Dei tournament 
July 6-10, the Great Western Shoot-Out July 11-15, the Las Vegas Nike 
Invitational July 16-22 and the BCI Tournament in Phoenix July 25-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton will be joined by returning seniors Clay McKnight at guard and Shaun 
Jackson at forward. McKnight is the son of of the Monarchs' coach, Gary 
McKnight, who has a career record of 352-29 at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Olujimi Mann and Santa Ana Valley will participate in the El Dorado and 
Cypress tournaments as well as the Mater Dei, Surf City and Nike-Mater Dei 
tournaments, where Mann could go face-to-face with his former Monarch 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, who transferred after his freshman season at Mater Dei, was The Times' 
all-county first-team selection. He helped the Falcons (26-4) reach the 
Southern Section Division I-AA semifinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (19-11), which gave Mater Dei a scare in the Southern Section I-A final 
before losing, 65-59, could get another crack at the Monarchs in the Surf City 
tournament. The Chargers, a senior-dominated squad last season, are also 
scheduled to play in the University tournament July 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (30-2), which won the section III-A title and reached the State 
Division III final last season, appears to be in for a rebuilding year after 
losing the bulk of its players to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who will be led by guard Jaimi Bessho and forward Ed MacDonald, 
will get opportunities to regroup this summer in seven tournaments, beginning 
with Mater Dei's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea-Olinda girls' team, four-time defending State champions and the 
nation's No. 1-ranked squad last season, plays host to a tournament beginning 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats (33-0) lost to graduation their top three players -- Nicole 
Erickson, The Times' county player of the year; Colleen Hudson and Sarah 
Beckley -- and saw their coach, walk-on John Hattrup, quit May 31 after one 
season on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But guard Kiyoko Miller and forward Lee Moulin lead a talented group of 
players for new coach Jeff Sink, the third-winningest girls' coach in Alaska 
history at Fairbanks Lathrop, where his teams won state titles in 1990 and 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge girls' team (32-1), which won the section II-AA title and 
reached the State Division II championship game, will be without its floor 
leader, Jamie Oenning (UCLA), but she is all the young Warriors lose. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll participate in the Estancia and Marina tournaments, where they could 
meet Melody Peterson and the Mater Dei Monarchs (24-5), who gained the section 
Division I-A final.

CAMARILLO'S ALLEGRE HAS A LOT TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THESE DAYS; AMATEUR TENNIS: NOW 
16 AND PLAYING GIRLS TWO YEARS OLDER, SHE'S GOTTEN A GRIP ON HER BACKHAND AND 
HER GAME HAS BECOME MORE CONSISTENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her name means "happy" in French, but one of the most important memories for 
tennis player Monique Allegre is perhaps the most unhappy time of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre can't forget an age-group tournament 18 months ago in Orange County in 
which she was ousted by an unseeded player. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre was humiliated. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she boarded a van 
and started the long ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She cried the whole way back to Camarillo," said Wayne Bryan, Allegre's coach 
and chauffeur that day. "I was afraid she was going to get dehydrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre, 14 at the time, was competing against more-experienced players in the 
16-and-under division. Her official year-end ranking by the Southern California 
Tennis Assn. was 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Most girls her age would be thrilled with No. 13. For Allegre, that wasn't 
good enough.  
</P>
<P>
 It was time to stop playing inconsistently, time to stop losing to unranked 
players such as Sarah Denson of Newport Beach, the 13-year-old who defeated her 
in a three-set match in December 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was crying for like three hours," said Allegre, who laughs about it 
now. "I took that one pretty hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think that was the turning point. I was determined, I guess. It just 
made me want to fight even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre began practicing with Bryan three hours a day -- every day -- at the 
Cabrillo Racquet Club in Somis. She changed her style -- switching to an 
unconventional one-handed grip on her backhand stroke -- and learned to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1993, Allegre was among the nation's top 50 in the 16-and-under 
division. She has continued to improve and to take on new challenges. Although 
she won't turn 17 until December, Allegre has jumped to the 18-and-under 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the 92nd Annual Southern California Junior sectional championships in 
Orange County that starts with qualifying rounds today, Allegre is seeded 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal is to reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 If she reaches the round of eight and moves up in the SCTA seeding system, one 
can bet Allegre will set her sights on a new goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never satisfied," she said. "There's always a better level." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre has been obscured by better-known players in the area who also play 
18s. At last July's USTA national championships in San Jose, Ania Bleszynski of 
Thousand Oaks, Krissy Hamilton of Agoura Hills and Meilen Tu of Northridge all 
reached the round of 16. At the same time in San Diego, Allegre, entered as an 
unseeded player in 16s, was knocked out in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre finally grabbed some attention last fall. With Bleszynski, Hamilton 
and Tu not playing for their high school teams, Allegre was brilliant for 
Camarillo High in the Southern Section individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded, she stunned third-seeded Laura Ruben of Mater Dei in the 
quarterfinals, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Ruben, a top junior for several years, had won 51 
consecutive sets during the high school season before losing to Allegre. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was kind of a breakthrough," Allegre said. "I had only one good win that 
year. I had consistent wins, but no big wins. It just boosted my confidence. It 
showed me I could play with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre's previous breakthroughs had always come after an unexpected loss and 
a major crying session. Bryan capitalized on those episodes when Allegre got 
fed up with her game and was willing to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest adjustment came last September, when Allegre switched her stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Most young female players prefer to stay on the baseline, content to return 
backhand shots with a two-handed grip. But Allegre has the athletic ability to 
run the court, attack the net, and do it with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "She runs really well," Bryan said. "She's very coordinated and she's got a 
clean game -- which made the change possible. The one-handed backhand is very 
rare for a girl. You'll see it maybe in one out of every 50 players." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan attributes the two-handed stroke's popularity to Chris Evert. The 
three-time Wimbledon champion won 18 grand slam tournaments with a two-handed 
backhand. Nearly every girl player in the country has since copied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evert was not particularly fast and was not an unusually great athlete," 
Bryan said. "But she was patient and mentally very tough. As a result, better 
athletes adopted her style." 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, some of those athletes shortchanged themselves. Allegre was one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking the two-handed habit understandably leaves Allegre feeling awkward at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was tough and it still is," she said. "All the other girls are already 
solid and grooved in their stroke, while sometimes I'm struggling with my 
one-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's getting a lot better every day, and I look at it as long term. It's 
going to be better in a couple of years. And when it does, it's going to be 
big." 
</P>
<P>
 Her victory over Ruben was a glimpse of the future. Ruben, like most females, 
was unaccustomed to being attacked at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't like that," Allegre said. "She didn't like the moving around. She 
didn't like the pressure. Most girls don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in losing, Allegre has found she can compete against opponents who once 
walked all over her. After upsetting Ruben in the Southern Section tournament, 
Allegre lost to second-seeded Pam Trump of Arcadia, 6-3, 7-5, in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allegre led, 5-3, in the second set before Trump -- headed to USC on a 
tennis scholarship -- could adjust and win the final four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, that caught me by surprise -- to know that I could 
(play with Trump)," Allegre said. "When I got up, I started playing a little 
looser and a lot smarter. I came out of it thinking, 'God, I should have beat 
this girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her one-handed backhand also made an impression last March at the Easter Bowl, 
a national tournament in Miami. Allegre lost in the second round to 10th-seeded 
Megan Miller of Bradenton, Fla., 7-5, 6-4, after breaking early to lead the 
first set, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to the consolation bracket, Allegre won two matches before falling to 
eighth-seeded Liliah Osterloh of Columbus, Ohio, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not only playing every day, but concentrating every day," said Allegre, 
who appears to be riding a wave of little successes that could lead to 
something big in the sectional. "My goals are higher, and I'm doing better 
because of it."

NO VACANCY; ERRONEOUS NEWS ITEM RESULTS IN FLOOD OF BASKETBALL COACHES 
CONTACTING CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh what a difference a typographical error can make -- even when it's in small 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge athletic department has received several calls during 
the past week from coaches interested in applying for the supposedly vacant 
position as head coach of the women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: Northridge already has a coach, Kim Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the calls? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that last week when USA Today published the announcement of assistant 
Cheryl Kennedy leaving to become head coach at the University of Wisconsin 
LaCrosse, the paper misidentified her as Northridge's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches assumed Northridge had an opening for a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got calls from all over," said Barry Smith, Northridge's sports 
information director. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Northridge officials figured out what happened, they had some fun with 
the callers. Asked by one person whether Chandler had been fired, Smith shot 
back, "I don't think so. I just saw her earlier today at breakfast with the 
vice president. She was smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 All this was news to Chandler, however. She was not informed about the 
misprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not know anything about it," Chandler said. "This is the first I've 
heard of it. If you can find some positives out of it, people are interested in 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's teams have posted records of 2-24 and 8-19 her first two seasons. 
But she is not surprised by the interest in her job. The Matadors will soon be 
on the rise, she said, in the wake of the devastating 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were better player for player last season," she said. "But we had one 
career-ending knee injury and another that forced a player out of eight games. 
We had one player diagnosed with cancer and she's doing very well now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was diagnosed with cancer and he's had extensive surgery and now is 
going through chemotherapy. We had three players hurt in a car accident and two 
dismissed for disciplinary purposes. And, of course we had the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said the nine recruits she has signed for next season have drawn 
praise from USA Today and coaches across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand there are possibilities, and the possibilities are going to 
become reality," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Northridge was been bitten by the misinformation 
bug. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, wire services announced that former Colorado State baseball coach Ran 
Railey had been hired to coach at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 They were half right. Railey had been hired by Northridge -- as the athletic 
program's fund raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge asked for, and received, a note of clarification on the wires -- 
much to the relief of Terry Craven, Northridge's baseball coach at the time.

GAIL WARNINGS STILL IN EFFECT ON BEACH; CASTRO, 36 AND FIT, REMAINS A FORCE IN 
WOMEN'S PRO VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail Castro, professional volleyball player, was getting ready for work. She 
changed into a purple bathing suit and tied back her long blond hair. Then she 
donned a visor and a pair of mirrored wraparound sunglasses and jogged off 
barefoot, towel in one hand and thermos in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, 36, is one of the pioneers of the Women's Professional Volleyball 
Assn., yet with a washboard stomach, muscular legs and well-defined biceps she 
wears her age well. 
</P>
<P>
 She has played so consistently that volleyball has been her only job the past 
five years. During the season, she is on the road each weekend, but her 
husband, Larry, and 7-year-old son, Larry Jr., usually stay at home in 
Carlsbad, awaiting tournament updates by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 This season has been another success for Castro. She and Elaine Roque, a 
former UCLA All-American, are 28-12, including two second-place and two 
third-place finishes. Last year, they advanced to six finals and compiled a 
60-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Castro and Roque, the third-seeded pair in a 41-team field, will 
compete in the Hermosa Beach Open, the seventh tournament of the 1994 WPVA 
season. The 15-event tour began in April in Puerto Rico and will conclude in 
Las Vegas on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting older is harder," Castro said. "Workouts have to be much more quality 
and you have to be in better shape to compete with the younger players. You 
really have to work harder to stay in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 During an eight-year beach career in which she has teamed with various 
players, Castro has recorded three tournament victories, 14 seconds and 15 
thirds. She has advanced to the semifinals in 50 tournaments and has earned 
almost $150,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the victories came in 1991, with Lori Kotas as her partner. Castro and 
Kotas played together in 69 events and still hold the record for the longest 
partnership in women's pro beach volleyball history. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotas was the blocker and Castro the team's defensive backbone, covering the 
regulation-sized court and traversing the deep sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro is also a powerful hitter, but she is best known for her lethal jump 
serves. She leads the tour with 41 aces. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really goes for it with a lot of velocity," said former UCLA All-American 
Liz Masakayan, who forms the top-ranked team with Karolyn Kirby. "There's no 
doubt about it, Gail has one of the toughest serves around." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro played volleyball and basketball at Crescenta Valley High. She was an 
All-Southern Section middle blocker as a senior in 1975 and was named school 
co-athlete of the year with Brad Holland, current basketball coach at Cal State 
Fullerton who played for UCLA and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State offered Castro a full volleyball scholarship, but she wanted to 
stay close to home and chose Valley College because of its well-regarded 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro led the Monarchs to consecutive Metropolitan Conference titles in 1976 
and 1977 and a state championship in '76 when the team was undefeated. She was 
named the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 During her sophomore year in '77, the Monarchs advanced to the state final 
before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had unbelievable talent on that 1976 team and Gail was our leader," said 
Diedra Stark, who coached the team and still teaches physical education at the 
school. "We always used her offensive strength because she was such a great 
hitter and blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark has followed Castro's career through the years and often watches her 
matches on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to see her play," Stark said. "I see that she still has that 
enthusiasm and she is still so talented. I'm not surprised that she has had so 
much success." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro completed her college career at Cal State Long Beach, where she was an 
All-Southern California Athletic Assn. middle blocker. Later, she played two 
years of professional indoor volleyball in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides competing on the domestic pro beach tour, Castro plays internationally 
in a winter series that will help determine which two-person teams represent 
the United States at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Beach volleyball will 
be a medal sport for the first time. Three U.S. women's teams will qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro likes her chances, so retirement is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they have dangled that carrot in front of me I want to go," Castro 
said. "I want to play in the Olympics and I'm going to work hard to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why most days Castro can be found at the beach. She trains four times a 
week for about four hours and lifts weights twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The sand workout includes intense drills and practice games. It's really no 
day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this is hard work," she said during a water break. "You really have to 
push yourself and go hard every single time."

 Jessica De La Cerda of Hart High, the runner-up in the 1,600 meters in the 
Southern Section Division I track and field championships last month, will 
attend Oklahoma State in the fall on a full athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cerda chose Oklahoma State over Adams State, an NCAA Division II school 
in Colorado that offered a three-quarter scholarship."I really liked the school 
and the town," De La Cerda said. "Everything was nice and green there and the 
people were really laid back and nice." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cerda, who plans to major in either pre-veterinary science or physical 
therapy, has a personal best of 5 minutes 5.76 seconds in the 1,600. She won 
the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 in this year's Foothill League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Kristin Kabo of Kennedy will attend UC Davis in the fall. Kabo 
placed second in the 3,200 in the City Section championships last month and has 
a personal best of 11:38.09. JOHN ORTEGA

 Sara Griffin, a senior right-hander from Simi Valley High, has been selected 
the state softball player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine for the second 
consecutive season, leading a list of several area honorees. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, five area players were named all-state in baseball and two in 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who will play next year at Michigan, was 21-2 with an earned-run 
average of 0.15. She threw two no-hitters, 16 shutouts and struck out 252 in 
183 innings. She is joined on the all-state softball team by Esmeralda Macias, 
a junior outfielder from Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Three pitchers led the way in baseball -- Randy Wolf of El Camino Real, Jim 
Parque of Crescenta Valley and Carlos Velazco of Sylmar. All are seniors. 
Senior infielders Ryan Hankins of Simi Valley and Bryan LaCour of Chatsworth 
also made the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Rick Collier and outfielder Jason Adamson of Moorpark, both seniors, 
were named to the all-state medium schools' team, along with Calabasas senior 
pitcher Josh Morton. Matt Hernandez, a senior pitcher from L.A. Baptist, made 
all-state in the small schools' division. 
</P>
<P>
 Five juniors made the all-underclass team -- outfielder Jim Landress of 
Granada Hills, catcher Kevin Serr of Kennedy, pitcher Richard Soliz of Rio 
Mesa, infielder Kyle Goss of Quartz Hill and utility player Luis Sanchez of 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Ashley Gayer and pitcher Jamie Johnston, both seniors from Paraclete, 
made the all-state medium schools' softball team. Junior infielder Shane 
Anderson of La Reina and freshman infielder Tamra Freedman of Montclair Prep 
also made the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Michelle Cordes of Buena and infielder Crystl Bustos of Canyon 
joined Macias as juniors on the all-underclass team. Sophomore pitcher Jamie 
Gillies of Saugus also made the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Romero of L.A. Baptist, a football and track athlete who has accepted a 
football scholarship to Arizona, was named state small schools' athlete of the 
year.

WORKING CLASS; WHAT SHOULD A NEW HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE EXPECT FROM THE JOB 
MARKET? IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE. MANY WILL BE LUCKY TO FIND A LOW-PAYING, 
PART-TIME JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Garcia, who will graduate from high school in two weeks, is worn out from 
day-and-night party hopping. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than grad-month celebrations, the parties are birthday bashes for 
kids. Garcia, 18, has a job setting up and taking down Jungle Jumps, those 
bouncy, house-sized balloon tents. He keeps the kids jumping, and vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent Saturday, exhausted from a 16-hour workday, Garcia finally hit his 
pillow only to experience a new, sleep-stealing form of graduation Angst : Come 
June 30, a day after he receives his diploma from Garfield High in East Los 
Angeles, Garcia won't head off to college. Instead, he'll be clocking in even 
more hours at the Hollywood company where his job enables him to help pay the 
rent and buy groceries for himself, his parents and two sisters. And he knows 
he's lucky to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 As some 27,663 Los Angeles Unified School District seniors -- and tens of 
thousands more at other Southern California high schools -- graduate this 
month, many will move directly to two- or four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But others will postpone college -- or skip it altogether -- and try to find 
full-time work. And the opportunities in factories or civil service that might 
have been open to high school grads a generation ago are severely limited. 
Although the Los Angeles school district does not keep complete records on how 
many students go on to college, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 42% of 
1992's high school graduates did so. 
</P>
<P>
 High school career counselors report that most seniors will find low-paying, 
part-time jobs, most in the fast-food and retail industries. Many of the jobs 
come without benefits; wages range from $4.25 an hour to as high as $10 an hour 
for a lucky few. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students pounding the pavement might consider themselves fortunate to 
get hired at all in a Southland economy that can be cruel to job-seeking youth. 
</P>
<P>
 California's youth unemployment rate, always two to three times the overall 
jobless figure, is at a five-year high, according to state figures. The 
unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds was 24% in April; during the summer, 
the rate usually goes up another three to five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to tell Los Angeles-area graduating seniors that the job 
picture is gloomy -- they know. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of their parents are out of work. Seniors who graduated last year have 
lost their jobs or have had to compete for positions with older, more 
experienced adults. And this year's senior class has seen college graduates 
return home unable to get work using their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Konantz, career development director for the LAUSD, said graduating 
seniors who aren't college bound should concentrate on job training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employment is not good right now. The best thing for high school graduates 
not opting for college is to enroll in job-training programs in the high-tech, 
business technology, health care or travel and tourism industries."  
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, (good) jobs require more skills," he said, citing that labor 
statistics show that high school graduates will change jobs five or six times 
in their careers. "You can't go to General Motors and work there for 30 years," 
he said. "Those days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette Corsey-Graham, who directs First Break, a districtwide job 
development program for senior high, adult and continuation schools, said the 
need for graduating seniors to work has increased each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Across the board, it doesn't matter if you are an inner-city kid or a Valley 
kid, more and more graduates have a parent who has been laid off or is 
unemployed. Jobs are no longer a luxury. Jobs are a necessity for young people 
who have to help support their family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a reality to postponing college," she added. "To get work is to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's all John Davis, 18, is trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Davis, who lives alone and is self-supporting, was laid off 
from his $5-an-hour after-school job at the Federal Aviation Administration, 
where he handled data entry and office work. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while he juggled two jobs so he could afford his rent, food and 
utilities after his mother moved to New Orleans five months ago. Davis said he 
chose to say in Los Angeles because he didn't want to leave Locke High School 
in South-Central Los Angeles and figured he could take care of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who graduated Wednesday, said he can survive for one month on his 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to file for unemployment, that's not my style," he said. "It was 
my decision to live alone. My mother said, 'Fine, you've got a job and I 
believe you can make it on your own.' But I didn't think I would lose my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davis remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 With his diploma in hand and a positive attitude, he said: "Right now is not a 
time to be picky. I'm willing to flip burgers because I've got to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 At 14, Davis earned his first few dollars mowing a yard. He's worked as a 
junior lifeguard, a cook, an assistant manager, a cashier and has experience in 
retail merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about going to college in the evenings while he worked during the 
day, but not now, not since he's out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go to college right away," he said. "I don't feel comfortable with my 
decision, but I have to deal with it. I have to pay rent. If I get a job that 
I'm real comfortable with and that I can keep for a long time, I'll go to 
school in the evenings and take up a trade like electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how it is when you have to survive on your own. You just get used to 
it. You do what you have to do, even if it means delaying college." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eryn Lewin, an 18-year-old Birmingham High School student who graduated 
Thursday, just wants to land a job -- any job. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though her mother would rather she go to college, Lewin said she'll 
postpone her dream of teaching kindergarten for a bit. For now, she just wants 
a break from school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother says if I don't go to college I'm not going to get anywhere in the 
future. I told her that everybody in this world did not go to college and that 
there are people who are graduating from places like Harvard and Berkeley and 
they can barely find a job themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go to college and not be guaranteed a job afterward. For me, 
that's a lot of money down the drain to only end up working at McDonald's, 
which is where I could get a job now without college." 
</P>
<P>
 But even a gig serving up french fries seems distant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job market looks bad for me. It's horrible out there," she said, adding 
that she's applied for jobs at an area mall but hasn't received any callbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the military is an appealing option. Kristina Sneider, 18, also a 
Birmingham High graduate, said she's not waiting to be rejected by prospective 
employers. By summer's end she'll begin a two-year Marine Corps stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, she'll keep her part-time weekend job as a restaurant hostess 
because "I need to help out my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of her senior year, Sneider was set to go to the University of 
Arizona. But just a few months ago she changed her mind after a Marine 
recruiter came to her school. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the military experience "will make me a stronger person, more 
disciplined, more well-rounded. I need that, especially now that I'm going to 
be out there in the world and out of this little high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother thinks it's a pretty good idea, Sneider said. "I'm glad for that. 
The rest of my family was all set on me going to college for four years, then 
law school . . . and well, that's not how it's gonna be. They think my plan is 
radical. What? The Marines? Are you crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, she tells them. "I'm just being practical. I don't want a dead-end job." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Neither does Garcia, but for the time being, he's happy to remain at his job 
setting up Jungle Jumps until better opportunities materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 He would like to go to college, but must put it off to help support his 
family. His father, a furniture finisher, worked regularly until three years 
ago when he had heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad's been suffering for a lot of years," said Garcia, who has worked 
every summer and after school since he was 12 in construction, plumbing, 
painting and alongside his dad, making $6 an hour as a furniture finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have helped me out all my life. They struggled and sacrificed a 
lot for me. And now, I just want to return the favor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when people learn that he's not going to college, "they probably 
think that I'm gonna be lazy the rest of my life. I want those people to know 
that sometimes it's very different for other kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to know that I'm a hard worker, that I'm not a gangbanger, that 
I'm not lazy. Later on, I'll get some college, but for now I'm just trying to 
live a normal life by working for a living."

IT'S A GREASY JOB, BUT MILLIONS DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On balmy days thick with sweat and the smell of simmering onions, Jose 
Castanon stares into the grill and swears he can see a vision of his own 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always a small joint in the Mexican town of Zacatecas, where his family 
can see where he grew up -- away from Los Angeles, away from the gangs. He even 
has a name for it: Lupitas, for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a mirage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But inevitably, human voices draw him back to Tommy's outdoor shack on Beverly 
Boulevard, where Castanon, 42, started working in 1978 for $2.75 an hour. They 
ask for chili burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life, I've wanted to own my own business," he said. "But you have to 
pay bills and the family gets sick, and so on. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Castanon flips burgers for a living. It may not be the dream of plush offices 
and power lunches that many high school graduates see over the horizon, but for 
more than a million immigrants, teen-agers, and even a few laid-off executives, 
it's a job. America in the '90s, after all, is a nation where more people are 
taught to fry Quarter Pounders each year than are trained by the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 That bit of trivia comes from Jane Hulbert, a spokeswoman for McDonald's. She 
provided two more statistics that may hit closer to home for the nation's 
estimated 2.3 million 1994 graduates: One in 12 Americans obtains his or her 
first job at the Golden Arches and one in eight works there at some point in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Burger flippers. They're a little-respected fraternity in a land where "Ya 
want fries with that?" serves as something of a low-wage epitaph -- where 
they're perpetually invoked by national politicians in search of a whipping boy 
or cast as cartoon buffoons. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1988 presidential primaries, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), now 
House Majority Leader, touched on a key economic theme when he declared: "We 
can't just clean each other's clothes and flip hamburgers for each other." Not 
to be left out, Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis later warned of "an America 
where all we do is flip each other's hamburgers and take in each other's dry 
cleaning for $3.35 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 (The dry cleaning is another story.) 
</P>
<P>
 The job's place in the pantheon of ridicule was solidified when Beavis and 
Butt-head, America's favorite cartoon losers, took jobs working the night shift 
at Burger World. 
</P>
<P>
 But "that's where the jobs are right now," said Douglas Christopher, a Los 
Angeles investment analyst who tracks the burger market for Crowell, Weedon & 
Co. "People are being laid off right and left. We are laying off the affluent, 
skilled work force and replacing it with an unskilled, service-oriented work 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All this talk gets Ray Macias a little animated. Macias, who works at his 
neighborhood McDonald's, graduated Thursday from Hollywood High School and 
plans to study architecture at Los Angeles Valley College. Despite his current 
employment, "I know I'll come out (of college) as a professional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias, 17, was working the grill at the McDonald's near Hollywood and Vine 
the day of the Northridge earthquake, flipping burgers in a frenzy for six 
hours without a break. The drive-through hosted a steady stream of cars flowing 
out onto Vine, waiting to be served at one of the few area restaurants that 
remained open Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make cracks all the time," he said. "I hear it at school." He imitated 
a nasal, Southern accent and said: "Ya want fries with this? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people know what the pressure is. If you're an executive, 
sitting back in your office, kicking your feet back, what's that? McDonald's is 
not easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The world looks a little different from the other side of the drive-through 
window. From his perch behind the McDonald's microphone, Macias has seen the 
relatively tranquil neighborhood disturbed by gun-toting youths swirling 
through the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the customers, some of whom are a few fries short of a 
Happy Meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgina Lopez, 20, will never forget the finicky patron who changed his order 
seven times in the drive-through, arriving at the counter only to change his 
order again. After several permutations of burgers and fries, shakes and 
McNuggets, the computer finally surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to call the manager over," said Lopez, who works with Macias. "It took 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to most popular images, the job requires "a high degree of mental 
focus," Macias said. This means making the burgers well no matter how nasty the 
customers get, and adding spice to tasks that can be monotonous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like making a competition out of it," he said. "I tell my co-workers 
'You're too slow' or 'You took too long for that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Macias and crew fought to see who could sell the most fajitas -- an 
experimental product that has yet to catch on with more tradition-bound 
customers. He relished lacing his sales pitch with unscripted adjectives like 
delicious and mouthwatering . 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate statistics show that McDonald's employs more than half a million 
people, followed by Burger King, with 210,000 workers, and Wendy's, with 
120,000. Combined, local favorites Tommy's, Carl's Jr. and In-N-Out Burgers 
employ more than 20,000 people in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages range from the $4.25-an-hour entry pay at McDonald's to the $7.50 
garnered hourly by Castanon, who has worked 16 years to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 With a steady influx of immigrants from Central America and Mexico, 
California's fast-food restaurants employ a predominantly Latino work force, 
industry experts said.  
</P>
<P>
 William Trimble, a manager at the '50s-style burger joint Johnny Rockets in 
Encino, said immigrants are willing to perform many tasks looked down upon by 
others who "are allergic to hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble knows. In the past eight years, he has virtually traversed the Yellow 
Pages listing under "Restaurants," moving from McDonald's and El Pollo Loco to 
slower-paced national chains such as Tony Roma's and Baker's Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many people who want a shortcut to the top," Trimble said. "They 
have too much ego and not enough pride." 
</P>

 Cecilia Hernandez, 33, stands at the helm of the Fatburger at Hollywood 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. Her black uniform prominently displays a huge 
button with the words "Unhappy Guest" written in bold letters and a red line 
running through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be over here," she said, pointing to the freezers, "and over here," 
she added, dashing over to the grill, "and here," she concluded at the 
computerized register, finding these words blinking at the bottom of the 
screen: "It's up! Come and get it!" 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get home, I go to sleep at 8:30," said Hernandez, who emigrated 13 
years ago from El Salvador. "One day, I'm going to get real, real tired. But 
not yet." 
</P>
<P>
 It hurts when her daughter wants to go to the movies on Saturday and Hernandez 
has to work, she said, and even worse are the regular bills her $7.25-an-hour 
wage strain to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have learned to say to Pacific Bell, 'Give me credit,' "she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who is paying her way through college at McDonald's, said many of her 
immigrant co-workers are reluctant to leave their jobs in search of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they find a job, they stick to it," she said. "They're afraid. Sometimes 
they tell me they wish they could go to school. They tell me I'm lucky my 
mother is here helping me." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years from now, Lopez is expecting to get her degree from Valley College; 
she hopes to become an elementary school teacher. Meanwhile, she said, she'd 
just as soon leave the burgers at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go to a restaurant, I don't order hamburgers. My brothers are always 
begging me to bring them home. I just tell them, 'I've had enough.' "

 Bryan Alfaro is afraid of heights. Tall buildings and cliffs make him nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 But he'll gladly jump off one to hang-glide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous before I started, but they told me to run and take off," Alfaro 
said. "And once I was in the air, all the fear left me." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior at Sunny Hills High started hang-gliding a year ago after learning 
about the sport from his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that there is no barrier between the glider and rugged 
environment, Alfaro insists the sport is only dangerous if "you're not thinking 
about what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But to a non-glider, the sport is not exactly perceived to be a harmless 
hobby. "There's always an element of danger," he said. "But the worst thing 
that can happen is you can fall a little when you land." 
</P>
<P>
 Careful assembly of the glider is key to avoiding injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The hang-glider) is like a kite," Alfaro said. "You have to put it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hang-gliders fly in groups, and before taking off they all help put together 
the gliders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hard to put it together, but everyone takes their time," Alfaro 
said. "And we double-check everything." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid bumping into buildings, hang-gliders fly in open terrain, over hills 
and valleys and maybe the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather also determines how dangerous the flight will be, but 
hang-gliders, and especially beginners like Alfaro, won't fly unless the sun's 
shining and there is only a light breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's really gusty, (the wind) can blow you into the mountain," Alfaro 
said. "But you don't fly when it's windy." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a bright day brings "thermals," drafts of rising hot air. 
It is thermals that lift the glider after the takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hills and mountains have a lot of thermals," Alfaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 With good thermals, a glider can fly around for hours. As the sun goes down, 
the thermals decrease, and the glider loses altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 This signifies that it's time to land, a process much like landing a plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Without thermals, the glider will take off and promptly glide toward the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang-gliders wear helmets, and tennis shoes are handy for the running takeoff. 
But other than that, there is no special equipment needed -- except for a 
glider, which Alfaro said can be rented for about $50 per session. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other sports, it's at the competitive level that expenses mount -- 
transportation, high-tech equipment and time. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced hang-gliders can enter endurance or acrobatic competitions. The 
former is a match to see who can stay in the air the longest, while the latter 
involves making loops and flying upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hang-gliders) can do anything an airplane can do," Alfaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in order to be a successful competitor, the glider must purchase a 
hang-glider built for endurance and another for acrobatics. These gliders 
generally have longer or thinner wings than the basic hang-glider. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro, who considers himself a beginner, said he enjoys the exhilaration of 
flying hundreds of feet above the earth, skimming over hills and oceans and 
taking in the smell of salt water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think just doing it for recreation is good enough for right now."

 Jumping out of an airplane would appear to be an activity grounded in 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it's traditionally been reserved for emergency escapes from flaming 
single-engines. But sky-diving has become a thrill-seeker's sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ultimate version of bungee-jumping. It starts out the same -- with a 
flying leap -- but sky-diving affords you no no last-minute tether to sling you 
back. With sky-diving it's all or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 And the promised adrenaline rush is the exact reason why Sunny Hills junior 
Chris Winkler decided to do it. "I'm a thrill-seeker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler let his cousin drag him to do it last year. But before be could get in 
the plane, he and all other prospective participants had to take a sky-diving 
class. They were versed in emergency procedure and safe landing and basically 
told what to expect out of a jump. 
</P>
<P>
 And before anyone could back out, the jumpers were fitted with parachutes and 
taken up in an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took us out over the desert, and then they just opened the door and we 
had to jump," Winkler said. "I kind of hesitated at the door, but I had to do 
it. I didn't want to have to go back down in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wasn't that scared." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Winkler, right as you jump out of the plane you feel that 
"falling" sensation, when your stomach kind of jumps into your throat. But 
after a few seconds, "you get used to it" and can enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 After a little while, Winkler pulled the cord on his parachute and sailed down 
to a sort of rough-and-tumble landing. "I landed and then fell down and got a 
lot of bruises." 
</P>
<P>
 But he liked it enough to give it another shot a few months later. That time, 
they just went up, no training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't as scared the second time," Winkler said. "I waited longer before 
pulling the cord on the parachute." 
</P>
<P>
 In case the first cord doesn't work, there's a second emergency cord on the 
parachute. But, he added, "If the second cord doesn't work, you're screwed." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler, however, never really thinks about the danger aspect of sky-diving; 
he figures it's part of the fun. "That's what makes it exciting."

 Josh Gensicke bungee-jumps because of the powerful feelings it generates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adrenaline rush is just awesome, and the jolt (when the elastic pulls the 
jumper back) and the shock give me a total rush," said the sophomore st Sunny 
Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Gensicke describes flying through the air at 50 m.p.h. as "incredible." Part 
of the feeling is the "rush" and the other part is fear.  
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how many times you (bungee-jump), the ride up and the first two 
minutes are always scary," Gensicke said. "It's especially scary when you're 
going up and you look down." 
</P>
<P>
 Gensicke admits there is a truly scary and dangerous side to this sport.  
</P>
<P>
 He described one time when, at the end of his fall, he heard a ripping sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the elastic was ripping," he recalled. "I thought I was going to 
die. But it was only my shirt, which had caught in the straps."

THE GOODS; NEW SPIN FOR VINYL; REMEMBER THE ALBUMS YOU HAVE STACKED AWAY? NOW

 With a plastic squeeze bottle in one hand and an RCA Victor long-playing 
record in the other, Randy Cooley demonstrates the Nitty Gritty Record Cleaning 
System, contained in a modest plastic and wooden box. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't get rid of scratches, but the pops, clicks and surface noises will 
fade away," he says, carefully placing the LP onto a spindle in the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 He squeezes fluid onto a brush, sloshes it on the record surface, turns the 
record over and rotates it by hand, to a slurping sound -- the sound of a 
vacuum brush suctioning every groove of the record clean and dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooley was demonstrating an insider's secret: It is possible to make many old 
LP records sound like new. As owner of Optimal Enchantment, a small Santa 
Monica shop specializing in upscale audio equipment and used records, he runs 
all his LPs through the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 This and other specialized technology, such as new cartridges and turntables, 
provide the answer to the LP dilemma: What to do with those beloved jazz, 
classical or old rock albums -- sentimental journeys you can't bear to throw 
out -- that got shoved into the closet when the trendy little CD player moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooley sees many customers who reluctantly bring in their record collections 
to sell. "Because of the industry hype, people assume LPs aren't as good as 
CDs, so they get rid of them, or never play them," he says. "It makes me happy 
because I can buy them, but it also makes me sad, because they are selling 
their emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sentiment, there is music that is available only on vinyl. 
"There are many esoteric things from the '50s that weren't reissued on CD," one 
audio dealer says. "Let's be honest -- how much can a store hold? If you want 
to hear Frankie Laine doing 'Ghost Riders in the Sky,' I think it has to be on 
a record." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take some time and money, but you can rejuvenate your LP listening 
pleasure. The starting point is the cleaning machine, long used by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best way to revive a record," says Mark Lehman of Cincinnati, a 
college English teacher and serious record collector with a library of more 
than 6,000. Although the record-cleaning machine has limits -- "It can't do 
anything for scratches or wear," he says -- it will take off the accumulated 
dust and grit that gum up record grooves and interfere with sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines work like this: The record is doused with a special fluid and 
scrubbed with a brush whose microscopic fibers loosen all the film, grease, 
dust, mold and carbon fibers in the grooves. Then the record is rotated over a 
vacuum motor that sucks every groove dry and clean. Adaptors for 45 and 78 rpm 
records are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The two commercial manufacturers of record cleaning machines -- Nitty Gritty 
Record Care Products Inc. (price range: $239 to $759) and VPI Industries Inc. 
(price range: $450 to $900) -- are small operations in a market that expects to 
sell 23 million compact disc players this year. "This is the best-kept secret 
in the whole world," says Mike Randall of VPI in Cliffwood, N.J., which has 
been making record cleaning machines since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the machines have been favorably reviewed in specialized audio 
magazines, these reach only about 300,000 readers, he says, a small number in 
the scope of things. "There are probably 3 billion records out there." 
</P>
<P>
 And most of them, he says, are dirtier than their owners think. "If you went 
to college you had records in the dorm, flipped them around from room to room. 
You probably got pizza on them. We get letters from people who buy this machine 
and they clean off things that have been on the record for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 A good cleaning, Randall says, can be a rediscovery. "People are finding out 
how really good records are -- the finest records ever made were in the late 
'50s. I think we're in a kind of little vinyl renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
 At Nitty Gritty in Montclair, Gayle Van Syckle agrees with Randall that vinyl 
is not dead. "We have a number of different models and probably sell a thousand 
record-cleaning machines a year. It's a specialized product, though. You aren't 
going to find it in Circuit City." 
</P>
<P>
 Audio writer Corey Greenberg, who reviewed a Nitty Gritty and a VPI for the 
May issue of Stereophile magazine, says he was astounded by the "leapfrog 
improvement" in his records both in sound resolution and tonal balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried better turntables, arms, cartridges, pre-amps, cables and 
isolation schemes," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "While all of them have improved the sound of my records, none have ever given 
me the kinds of improvements in noise reduction, clarity and elimination of 
mid-to-treble ringing that these record-cleaning machines have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, a former broadcast engineer, reviewed a $450 model in each line. 
"Boy, it's like getting a new system," Greenberg said in a phone interview. 
"For years I really pooh-poohed the notion of these things. For me, $450 is not 
a small piece of change. But you can also buy the Nitty Gritty for around $240, 
if you don't mind turning the record by hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Now for ways to make your newly clean records sound even better. Despite the 
dominance of CDs, the past decade has seen continued progress in LP playback 
technology. Audio shops are stocking new turntables, new cartridges and even 
new recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Charles Back, an executive at Miller and Kreisler Sound in Los Angeles: 
"It happens because there is a community of people, the high-end audiophile 
contingent, who strongly prefer the sound of records and continue to pursue and 
support this technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the equipment is esoteric. Such turntable improvements as minimizing 
micro-vibrations or upgrading control on disc-rotation speed are for the 
purist, Back acknowledges. But there are also technologies that would please a 
mainstream listener: 
</P>
<P>
 * A new cartridge will translate the sound better than your old one. The 
technology in cartridges has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. The 
modern stylus tracks lighter, so you may play in less worn parts of the grooves 
than with your old machine. A $30 Grado is considered an excellent entry-level 
cartridge in a field that can go to $2,500 for a Linn Arkiv. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new entry-level turntable with arm, such as a Sota Comet (about $550) or 
VPI ($700) can make an amazing difference in sound, particularly if your 
present turntable is the sort of $250 Sears special that dominated the last 
mass market of the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you must choose one or the other, put a cheap cartridge in a good 
turntable, rather than the other way around. Cartridge performance is limited 
by turntable and arm vibrations. Get your dealer's advice on matching. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you can't afford a record-cleaning machine, a commercial hand-held brush, 
available for $15 to $20, is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you buy a cleaning machine but don't want to buy the cleaning fluid ($60 
a gallon, which will clean 800 to 1,000 records), here is Mark Lehman's recipe 
to make your own: Stir together four pints of distilled water, one pint of 
isopropyl alcohol (90% solution or better) and three or four drops of 
Photo-flow, available at photography supply shops, or Windex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep records in optimum playing condition, handle them carefully without 
getting fingerprints on them. Put one at a time on the turntable, not a 
spindle-load. Store records properly. Paper liners won't keep grit out. Buy 
plastic-lined paper, and keep records in the album covers. Stack albums 
vertically in a cool dry place. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people are making fresh starts with LPs, says Brooks Berdan of 
Monrovia, a longtime turntable designer and consultant who sells upscale 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests a $1,000 package as a starting point. For that price he recommends 
a VPI HW 19 Jr. turntable, an Audioquest PT6 tone arm and a Bluepoint 
cartridge. "That's a popular package." 
</P>
<P>
 Want to go all out? Berdan mentions an Immedia RPM-2 turntable, Graham tone 
arm and Lyra Parnassus cartridge. "We're probably talking $11,000," he says. 
"And there are certainly price tables in-between." 
</P>
<P>
 At whatever level you can afford, what you are buying is a warm reunion, 
Berdan says: "People call me and say they've discovered their record 
collections all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 'Because of the industry hype, people assume LPs aren't as good as CDs, so 
they get rid of them, or never play them. It makes me happy because I can buy 
them, but it also makes me sad, because they are selling their emotions.' Randy 
Cooley, Owner of Optimal Enchantment

THE GOODS; MAGAZINES' SUCCESS IS IN THE CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C.A. WEDLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the routine: You pick up a magazine. Cards flutter out. You put down 
the magazine, rake up the clutter and curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you take the fallout personally? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. It's designed just for you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why are loose subscription cards -- known in the publishing industry 
as blow-ins or shake-outs -- such pests? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: They're supposed to be. "It is proven that if you have to pick it up 
you will look at it," says Al Baglios of AM Graphics, a bindery and printing 
equipment manufacturer. There's a 97% better reader reaction to a loose card 
than to an attached card in terms of paying attention, says Baglios. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why won't the cards just go away? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because they work. The Magazine Publishers of America reports that inserts 
"generate 22% of subscriptions," second only to publisher mailings. "If it's an 
initial subscription, insert cards make up 28% of subscriptions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of paper trail are we talking about here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Using annual subscription sales figures from the MPA with one six-inch 
loose card per magazine, if you placed the cards end to end, you could circle 
the Equator nearly 1 1/2 times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When were they born? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I remember insert cards at least since 1948 at Life Magazine and further 
back than that," says Hal Speer, a publishing consultant. "In the late '40s, we 
got an insert card mailed in that had run in one of our magazines many years 
earlier. . . . Blow-ins are more recent, possibly late 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do the cards get into magazines? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They're spit in by a device, dubbed the blow-in machine. Robb Steinman of 
Quad/Graphics Inc. in Pewaukee, Wis., describes the machine as "a bit bigger 
than a breadbox, standing up on end. It has a drum. A subscription card is 
vacuum-sucked down into little gripper fingers, which open and close. The card 
drops down. It's pinched inside the fingers. Then a belt drive shoots the card 
into the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to those cards after you mail them in? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The cards wind up at a company such as Neodata Inc., in Boulder, Colo., 
which processes 15 million subscription cards annually for 400 magazines. 
Neodata oversees first-time subscriptions as well as renewals, address labels 
and billing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any bogus requests from famous names? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, from Disneyland to the White House. "We do get some wonderful notes 
from Mickey Mouse and the President," says Nancy Talmey, Neodata's general 
manager. She says Neodata forwards suspicious cards to the appropriate 
publisher. "I'm sure the President's subscriptions are paid for," Talmey says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would a musty subscription card found in the attic be honored? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "We got someone who sent in a blow-in card from years ago when Seventeen 
was $3 for a year's subscription," recalls an executive at the magazine, where 
the annual rate is now $14.95 for 12 issues. "Unfortunately, the blow-in card 
didn't have an expiration date. We prorated and sent four issues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any shenanigans with subscription cards? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's the Hex of the Ex, for starters. Former spouses have been suspected 
of mailing a slew of subscription cards in the names of ex-mates, who are 
besieged by a blizzard of magazines and ensuing bills. Other folks don't 
subscribe; they just scribble little notes, from lovey to loony, and toss 'em 
back to the magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does prepaid postage inspire high jinks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sometimes the cards arrive with little gifts taped to them. Presents have 
ranged from Life Savers to tea bags. "Next thing you know, they'll strap a 
brick to the card just to see if the post office will deliver," one circulation 
director predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can the cards be put to good use other than ordering magazines? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They make cheap bookmarks, coasters, paper chains, emergency toothpicks, 
note paper, origami practice and peashooters.

POP NOTES: CLAW HAMMERS OUT MAJOR-LABEL DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE BOEHM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 Claw Hammer, a bluesy rock band with Orange County roots, has joined the 
major-label ranks. Interscope Records has signed the group, which was founded 
by Jon Wahl and Christopher Bagarozzi in 1986 after Wahl's hitch with the 
esteemed Pontiac Brothers band from Fullerton. Wahl fronts Claw Hammer with a 
distinctive, wired yelping vocal delivery and joins Bagarozzi in sizzling 
interlocking guitar arrangements. Brett Gurewitz, the Bad Religion guitarist 
who produced all four previous Claw Hammer albums, is expected to work with the 
band on its Interscope debut.

 The Orange County Musicians Foundation raised $13,000 with a recent benefit 
concert featuring the Righteous Brothers, Jann Browne, Jason Chase and other 
local performers. The show at the Airporter Garden Hotel in Irvine brought the 
nonprofit group's funding to about $24,000, according to its founder, 
bandleader Greg Topper. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation issues grants to help full-time musicians in Orange County pay 
emergency medical bills. Topper said the organization is trying to set up an 
insurance program in which musicians would be able to buy major medical 
coverage at group rates. Information: (714) 362-4200.

 The Coach House soon will have a second sister club, in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Gary Folgner -- who opened the original Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano in late 1985 and added the Ventura Theatre to his holdings in 1988 
-- is planning to open a Fresno club, also called the Coach House, within three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is converting an old roller-skating rink into a 1,000-capacity 
nightclub with the same dinner-and-concert format as his other two venues. He 
set his sights on the undeveloped Fresno market after plans for a club in San 
Diego fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner and his concert booker, Ken Phebus, expect the Fresno location to be 
busy because it is a natural stop for touring bands making their way between 
Southern California and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner also thinks an active club in Fresno could help his San Juan 
Capistrano operation: Booking agents for bands that want a Fresno date, but 
hadn't planned on playing Orange County, will be negotiating with Phebus, and 
might be persuaded to include a Capistrano stop as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask you about Fresno, and maybe at that point we can entice them to play 
the (original) Coach House," Folgner said. "Agents are going to be (discussing) 
more bands with us, and we'll try to negotiate deals from there."

GETTING COZY WITH CONTEMPORARY; JAZZ: DANA POINT FESTIVAL HAS A SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA FLAVOR, SPICED WITH AN INTIMATE SETTING. IT OPENS WITH SOME 'BEACH 
JAZZ.'

 You could spend this weekend at the Playboy Jazz Festival, crammed into the 
Hollywood Bowl along with 17,000 other jazz fans. You could, that is, if you 
can get tickets (at press time, a few scattered seats remained for Sunday's 
show). 
</P>
<P>
 There, you could lug your two-ton cooler up the steep hillside to squeeze in 
hip-to-hip on the hardwood bleachers next to someone sputtering with beer every 
time a band strikes up the funk. 
</P>
<P>
 From your vantage point high above the stage you can have fun guessing which 
act is which -- "Hey, that's David Sanborn down there! No, wait! I think it's 
Wynton Marsalis!" -- while the infamous Bowl sound is either flat and distant 
in the cheap seats or loud and harsh in the boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could try something a little more civilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the three-day Dana Point Jazz Festival, going on this weekend at the 
Renaissance at the Dana Point Cafe, doesn't have the kind of big-name roster 
that graces Playboy's two-day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does have a dandy selection of Southern California-based artists, some 
of them stars on the national and even international level. And they are 
presented in an intimate and comfortable setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at Playboy won't be able to go up to Tito Puente after his performance 
to talk about the time in the '50s they saw the timbale master at New York's 
Cafe Mambo, but those so inclined probably could approach Saturday's Dana Point 
headliner, Max Bennett, after his set to reminisce about his days with Peggy 
Lee. The Dana Point festival has always been that kind of cozy gathering, in 
which musicians and audience can interrelate. And that's its greatest 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's edition, the fifth, signals a change in direction.  
</P>
<P>
 First, the Old Dana Point Cafe has been remodeled and, since May, under new 
management. All of the cafe's attractions remain -- wine, beer, specialty 
coffees and food -- but in new, spiffier surroundings, 
</P>
<P>
 And although previous editions of the festival have presented a wide variety 
of styles, from Dixieland to fusion, this year's fest will look to the 
contemporary side of the ledger, with both familiar favorites and some new 
faces. Music starts tonight at 8 and continues from noon to midnight Saturday 
and Sunday, with afternoon sets on the patio and evening sets indoors.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to concentrate on the more dynamic side of jazz," said Candy 
Strocker, a music broker who booked the talent for the Dana Point fest. "We 
looked for acts that were more melodic and accessible and reflected the music 
heard at the other Renaissance locations." (The Renaissance also has sites in 
Tustin, Brea and Laguna). 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's opener is Long Beach-based guitarist Bruce Baldwin and his band. 
Baldwin calls his music "beach jazz" (his self-produced album goes by the same 
name) and he says it's a blend of influences leaning heavily on Brazilian 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of what we do is original music," he said. "I grew up in Long Beach 
next to the water listening to the Beach Boys. I especially admired Brian 
Wilson, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin studied classical guitar at Cal State Long Beach but says he also was 
influenced by such rock guitarists as Duane Allman, Jimi Hendrix and Johnny 
Winter. It was Brazilian guitarist Baden Powell, the composer of "Sad Samba," 
who left the biggest mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed my total outlook toward guitar playing. I'm also influenced by 
Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonfa and Bola Sete." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin says he kept stirring the pot of influences until his music "became 
its own thing." His group features Brazilian bassist Antonio C. Sant'Anna and 
percussionist Victor Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though Baldwin may be a new face to some, Saturday's headliner, San Clemente 
resident Max Bennett, is the well-known founding member of the L.A. Express 
(with saxophonist Tom Scott) and the long-time musical director for Peggy Lee. 
Others he has supported with his bass playing over a distinguished career 
include Joni Mitchell, Barbra Streisand, Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett will front his Maxx Band, including saxophonist Jeff Jorgenson, 
guitarist Brian Price and drummer Dave Hooper, in tunes from his album "Great 
Expectations," a Japanese release that includes guest appearances by Crusaders 
keyboardist Joe Sample and saxophonist Scott. The album is set for release in 
Europe late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on the ultimate ego trip," Bennett said. "I write the tunes and run the 
band. But I don't consider this a lollipop-jazz band by any means. We don't 
follow the formula. It's the real essence of what a jazz band should have and 
that's great soloists. I came up playing in rhythm sections, and that's my 
first love. That and listening to great solos from the guys in my group." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Vail, who plays Sunday afternoon on the Renaissance patio, is familiar to 
many as the saxophonist in Kilauea. He performed earlier this year as a guest 
at both the KSBR Jazz Bash and the Southern California Jazz Festival. Vail, who 
is under contract to Brainchild Records to do a solo album sometime this year 
or early next, said his duo, with keyboardist Randy Gonzales, will cover the 
gambit: 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy knows a zillion tunes, so we'll do some originals from Tony Guerrero as 
well as some Grover Washington Jr., Kenny G, David Sanborn and standards like 
'Misty' and 'My Funny Valentine.' We'll also cover some stuff from female 
singers like Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and some off-the-wall stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * The fifth annual Dana Point Jazz Festival will be held today through Sunday 
at the Renaissance At the Old Dana Point Cafe, 24701 Del Prado, Dana Point. No 
cover. (714) 661-6003.

VERSATILE SINGER REVELS IN NEAR FREEDOM; POP MUSIC: HOLLY NEAR HAS DONE WELL 
WITH THE NO-COMPROMISE, NO-CATEGORY APPROACH TO HER MUSIC. THE AUTHOR AND 
ACTIVIST WILL BE AT THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Holly Near is known primarily as the guiding spirit of women's music, a 
singing proponent of gay and lesbian rights who has survived on her own terms. 
In fact, the versatile singer-songwriter has worked at enough different, often 
simultaneous careers to fill numerous lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor, author, activist, teacher, producer, record company president -- Near 
has filled many, many roles, and her music career has been equally diverse. She 
has performed in a number of different styles since her 1973 debut album, 
following her artistic whim rather than being directed by the flow of popular 
tastes or the dictates of major labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that we lived in a world that made more room for a multifaceted 
personality," Near, who plays the Coach House tonight, said in a recent phone 
interview. "In the commercial-music world, you're supposed to be a country 
singer, a folk singer, a jazz singer, a cabaret singer, and I've never done 
well fitting into that. I'm all of those things, and I don't want to have to 
choose one over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the homophobia, that's maybe the other reason I've had difficulty 
fitting into the mainstream," she said. "I haven't been easy to categorize and 
promote, I have too much fun singing different kinds of music. But I actually 
discovered that I could make a living and have a career without a PR department 
and someone saying, 'You've got to pick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Near has managed to do quite well. She has sold a total of more than 1 million 
units of her 16 albums, all on her own label, Redwood Records, and in the 
process has become recognized as a valued spokeswoman for the lesbian community 
and other activist factions. She has won a roomful of awards and honors over 
the years, including being named one of Ms. magazine's Women of the Year for 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Near, 45, grew up on a Northern California ranch, the daughter of politically 
progressive parents who were active in the labor movement of the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Oh, those crazy Nears' is how people kind of spoke about us," Near 
recalled. "But my parents were so charming that people liked them anyway. I 
learned from them how to have opinions, but have them in a way that there was 
laughter, kindness and room for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near attended UCLA and worked in summer stock in the late '60s and early '70s, 
and became a reasonably successful actress. Her credits from the period include 
appearances in the television shows "All in the Family," "Room 222," "The Mod 
Squad" and "The Partridge Family," and such films as "Slaughterhouse Five" and 
"The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
 Near blew more than a few minds some years later when she revealed in her 
autobiography, "Fire in the Rain . . . Singer in the Storm" that she had had a 
brief affair with her "Magic Garden" co-star Don Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those reckless, teen-age love-generation things," she said with 
a chuckle. "We were both lost in trying to grow up and figure out who we were. 
But actually, I've run into him a couple times since then, and he's been very, 
very sweet and friendly. He was doing 'Miami Vice' and I was doing a NOW 
convention in Miami, and he said hello and sent flowers to my room." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire in the Rain . . ." had a second life as a stage production that Near 
wrote and performed in when it was staged in 1992 at the Mark Taper Forum in 
Los Angeles. An album of the same name with songs from the show was released in 
1993 and is Near's most recent release. She said she is enjoying touring 
without the added responsibility of a new album to promote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although real recognition as an actress seemed imminent in the early '70s, 
Near found that she preferred music as her main creative outlet. In 1972, she 
founded Redwood Records to release her highly personal, political albums. 
Coming out as a lesbian in 1976, she became an early light in the women's music 
movement and an inspirational figure to her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually kind of a latecomer; there were women singing songs about 
their lives way before I came along," she said. "But before they were called 
performers of women's music, they were called anonymous. There was Alix Dobkin 
and Meg Christian, there was the Berkeley Women's Music Collective and the 
Chicago Women's Liberation Band. I came about six or seven years after all this 
began in the basements of homes, very clandestinely at first." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In those early years, Near said she drew resistance to her message of sexual 
tolerance from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came out as a lesbian, the left hadn't caught up to gay 
politics," she said. "There was still a kind of a hangover from an old party 
line that said homosexuality was part of the fall of the empire, a sign of 
decadence. But the women's movement helped people see that this was an 
inappropriate analysis, and they've come out a wiser, more sensitive group of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 As tensions eased over the years, even some mainstream entertainers began to 
acknowledge their sexual orientation publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's not as easy as all that," said Near. "They've come out very slowly 
and gracefully, if you actually look at it. But I don't think they could have 
done it any differently and still be accepted by the mainstream. It's not that 
easy and automatically accepted yet. They're very brave, and they are 
exceptions rather than the rule. I almost feel a twinge of maternal tenderness 
when I see these people come out, because I was part of it, and I know how 
difficult it is." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Near, she's happy with the relatively small but lovingly devoted 
following she has earned over the years. She refuses to make overtures toward 
mass acceptance if that means compromising either her political ideals or her 
musical creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life's too short to spend it knocking on doors that aren't easily opened," 
she said. "The only reason to try to be part of the mainstream is to reach a 
larger audience, and I think there's a lot of people out there who would like 
what I do. On that level, I think it's very sad. I wish there was somehow a way 
to be invited into it that was accessible and not too scary." 
</P>

FROM DEATH COMES A WILL TO SURVIVE; CONCERTS: THE SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC 
SOCIETY DECIDED TO CARRY ON DESPITE THE LOSS OF A KEY MEMBER. TODAY ITS BUDGET 
AND BOOKINGS ARE THRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Southwest Chamber Music Society is ending its seventh season this weekend 
in sound financial shape and is facing what looks to be a brighter-than-ever 
future. But it wasn't so long ago that the ensemble almost folded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost disbanded and threw the thing into the ocean when (pianist and 
Society co-founder) Albert Dominguez died" of pancreatic cancer in 1992, 
artistic director Jeff von der Schmidt recalled during a recent phone 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say some of the (current) success is deeply gratifying, but a lot of 
the catalyst has been, 'How do you go on when someone in the group has died? 
How do you continue?' 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of music groups in this area have experienced the death of someone 
essential," he noted. "We did the best we could. But there is no way to 
describe how devastating that felt. That's one of the things that music does a 
lot better than words. We decided that if we continued this, we would become 
the best ensemble we could be." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard work is paying off. Next year the group's operating budget jumps to 
$175,000 from the current $98,000, and the season will also expand to include 
10 different venues across the Southland (the Society essentially has been 
playing at only two, Chapman University in Orange and the Pasadena Library). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expanding dramatically," Von der Schmidt said. "With the amount of 
gifts we've received, we have to increase the numbers of people who come to the 
concerts . . . So the group is going to be busier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an incredible convergence of major gifts," he elaborated, "shored 
up by an impressive increase in personal gifts. We're obviously grateful. Who 
wouldn't be excited in this era of riots, fires and quakes to raise these types 
of funds? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a validation of just keeping your nose to the grindstone. A lot of the 
convergence will look like it happened overnight but believe me, there was a 
lot of sustained work. Not every proposal we threw in got funded." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, the Society has received: 
</P>
<P>
 * A two-year $20,000 grant from the Clarence E. Heller Charitable Foundation 
in San Francisco to rehearse and perform a complete cycle of Beethoven's 17 
string quartets; 
</P>
<P>
 * $15,000 from the Ahmanson Foundation in Los Angeles to launch the Society's 
first summer season, at the Huntington Library in San Marino; 
</P>
<P>
 * A three-year $45,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation in Los Angeles 
to boost the Society's administrative structure and expand its educational 
outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * $30,000 from Chamber Music America in New York for a three-year residency at 
the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena. "This grant is particularly 
gratifying to us," Von der Schmidt said, "since one of CMA's founding members 
was Peter Marsh," the Society's current first violinist. "So it has come full 
circle for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * A two-year grant of $40,000 from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation in Los 
Angeles for general operating support. 
</P>
<P>
 * An $8,500 grant from the National Endowment of the arts to produce the 
Society's second CD, a recording of the late chamber works of Ernst Krenek. "It 
will probably be out in fall of '95," Von der Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the society has come a long way since 1987 when, with only about 
$25,000, it launched its effort to become the Southland's first resident 
ensemble modeled on the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Southwest Chamber Music Society will play Halsey Stevens' Trio for 
Violin, Viola and Violoncello; Purcell's "Theatre Music" and Brahms' String 
Quintet in G, Op. 111 tonight in Bertea Hall at Chapman University, 333 N. 
Glassell St., Orange. Curtain: 8 p.m. $8 to $15. (800) 726-7147. THE SOUTHWEST 
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY

Noir" ; Bruckner's String Quintet in F.

RENO AIR PLANS TO START SERVICE AT JOHN WAYNE ON THURSDAY; TRANSPORTATION: ALL 
BUT SURE OF O.C. BERTH, CARRIER SAYS IT WILL OFFER SIX FLIGHTS TO SAN JOSE AND 
MATCH SOUTHWEST'S LOW FARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reno Air, all but assured of becoming the second low-fare airline at John 
Wayne Airport, said Thursday it plans to start service in Orange County 
Thursday with six daily nonstop flights to San Jose and will match rival 
Southwest Airlines' $69 one-way fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline also said Thursday that it plans to replace one of those flights 
starting July 15 with a single daily trip to Reno. The Nevada-based airline is 
being limited by airport noise restrictions to six flights a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air went ahead with the announcement even though its arrangement is still 
subject to contract approval by the Orange County Board of Supervisors at a 
meeting next Tuesday. The board gave its unanimous approval to the concept 
earlier this week over the objections of several other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno plans to take over daily flights from American, which is dropping its San 
Jose route because its costs of service are too high to be competitive with 
those of low-fare Southwest, which began serving John Wayne Airport last month. 
But American hopes to keep customer loyalty by handing the flights off to Reno 
Air, with which it has a strategic relationship and the same frequent-flier 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air and American plan to share check-in counter space and aircraft gates 
at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air also plans to match Southwest's $49 one-way advance purchase fare and 
$138 round-trip, two-for-one tickets. Reno Air, however, which tries to 
distance itself from Southwest by offering assigned seating, snacks and other 
amenities, will also offer a first-class section, for which it plans to charge 
$89 for one-way passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Burke, a Southwest Airlines spokeswoman in Dallas, said the carrier will 
welcome Reno Air. "Vigorous competition is good for the consumer," she said. 
"We have competed vigorously with Reno Air in other markets and will do so in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of airlines like Reno Air and Southwest could be a boon for air 
travelers who have had to pay some of the highest ticket prices in Southern 
California at flight-restricted John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say they are willing to give Reno Air a try through 
September while they review the process by which additional airlines are 
allowed to offer service at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking at Reno Air as an independent entity," said Courtney 
Wiercioch, airport spokeswoman. "This is a limited-term arrangement." Reno Air 
Flight Plans 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air has preliminary approval from the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
to begin six daily nonstop flights between John Wayne Airport and San Jose, 
effective Thursday. One-way advance purchase fares are $49 for regular assigned 
seating and $89 for first class. Round-trip, two-for-one tickets are $138. 
</P>

HOME BUILDING RECOVERY PEGGED TO JOBS, PRO-BUSINESS REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite signs that the real estate market is improving, the California home 
building industry won't recover fully until the business climate grows stronger 
and more houses are built, an industry expert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An economic recovery, pro-business reforms and new jobs are needed to push 
down home prices and get more buyers into the market, Bruce Smith, president of 
the California Building Industry Assn., said at the Pacific Coast Builders 
trade show here. 
</P>
<P>
 But those changes won't happen until some environmental laws and other 
regulations are eased, Smith said in a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are coming back, but we are coming back relatively slowly as compared to 
the rest of the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 California had a $31-billion housing construction industry in 1989, but by 
last year the industry had slumped to $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with an economic recovery, Smith said, a looming shortfall in new home 
construction could mean higher prices in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 New home construction has not kept pace with the state's housing needs. The 
state needs 250,000 to 300,000 new homes built each year to keep up with 
demand, according to figures from the California Department of Housing and 
Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1989, we were close, at 238,000 units, but by 1993, production had dropped 
to 84,000 units--meeting less than a third of California's housing needs," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that 100,000 new homes will be built in California this year and 
140,000 next year--still not enough to keep pace with the state's changing 
demographics and housing demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When housing is in short supply and more costly than in other states, it 
takes away our competitive edge," said Robert Rivinius, chief executive of the 
5,000-member trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 To spark a housing boom and economic recovery, politicians must review state 
and federal environmental laws to reduce onerous and costly provisions, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, litigation costs are growing and are being passed on to consumers 
in higher home prices, he said. That's because laws designed to protect 
citizens from shoddy construction and housing defects are being abused, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 8,000 home builders, developers and suppliers were gathered for 
the annual conference. Housing Permit Values Decline 
</P>
<P>
 Housing permit activity in Southern California has dropped drastically since 
1989, although Orange County saw a slight upswing in 1993. Value of residential 
building permits issued, by county, including alterations and additions, in 
thousands (not adjusted for inflation): 06,06,12,13,12,16,10 Year Orange Los

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; CAA GETS IN FAST LANE BY HIRING AT&T MEDIA 
EXEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bold and surprising move that acknowledges the rapid convergence of 
entertainment and technology, Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency on Thursday 
hired AT&T multimedia chief Robert M. Kavner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner's responsibilities will be far-reaching. But Chairman Michael S. Ovitz 
said Kavner will largely focus on creating new-media opportunities for CAA's 
stable of clients, which includes such well-known technophiles as Steven 
Spielberg and Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put our clients in the express lane of the so-called information 
highway, and Bob is going to help formalize the architecture of that strategy," 
Ovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner, who runs AT&T's multimedia products and services group, is the most 
prominent executive to make the leap from technology to show business. But the 
move comes as much of Hollywood is racing to gain a foothold in the burgeoning 
multimedia market, where new alliances are routinely forming -- often out of 
pure caution. Analysts foresee a day when many of the walls dividing the 
industries will tumble, as entertainment becomes more technology-driven and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new post at CAA, Kavner said, he plans to forge a series of alliances 
with technology companies, though he did not rule out the possibility that the 
talent agency might acquire an interactive firm of its own. The executive said 
he "has a lot of learning to do" before he gets into more specific details. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of a possible deal involving CAA and AT&T had circulated for weeks. But 
the Kavner announcement caught most of the industry off guard, because he is 
leaving a job in which he supervises more than 50,000 people to take over a 
staff of roughly 10. Sources speculated that CAA lured Kavner away with a hefty 
pay raise and the opportunity to play matchmaker between some of Hollywood's 
top talent and some of the technology world's biggest companies. AT&T's most 
recent proxy report shows Kavner already makes more than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he took the job, Kavner said: "Life is short. I'm 50 years old, I've 
got a terrific family, and I wanted to force myself into another phase in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 With Kavner coming from AT&T, where Ovitz also has close ties, some onlookers 
took his hiring as a sign that one of the first new ventures will involve the 
New Jersey-based telecommunications giant, which has a market value of more 
than $61 billion. Neither side discouraged that speculation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner has been on the front line of the information revolution at AT&T. He 
was the keynote speaker at January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, 
where he took the cable industry to task for trying to act as "gatekeepers" to 
the home. He reported directly to AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen, and his duties 
have included finding commercial markets for products developed by Bell 
Laboratories. Kavner also led the charge for Eo, AT&T's disappointing foray 
into the portable communications world. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Allen said several AT&T executives will assume Kavner's 
responsibilities, with Global Operations Chairman Victor A. Pelson taking on 
multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner formally joins CAA on July 1. Despite his soft-spoken manner, he is 
described as a fierce negotiator capable of "wielding his power like a knife." 
While no one knows exactly how the new-media puzzle will sort out, analysts say 
Kavner has as good a grasp as anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a very smart move," said Mitch Ratcliffe, editor of the San 
Francisco-based newsletter Digital Media. "With Kavner, CAA is an instantly 
powerful player (in the multimedia world). . . . He can point the way and 
arrange alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations that led to Kavner's hiring were closely guarded, even by 
CAA's rigid standards. Spielberg, who arguably has more new-media irons in the 
fire than any other CAA client and who recently struck a deal with CD-ROM 
developer Knowledge Adventure, professed ignorance of the Kavner talks. 
Informed of the deal Thursday, the director of "Schindler's List" and "Jurassic 
Park" responded: "Really? He's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner, a former Coopers & Lybrand accountant who has worked at AT&T for 10 
years, said the CAA deal came together very quickly: "It was only a matter of 
weeks ago that we sat down and opened up the subject of joining our 
capabilities," he said. "It just seemed to flow naturally. . . . For a lot of 
people that may seem unusual, but there's a part of me that wants to be in an 
entrepreneurial environment." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he insisted money wasn't the motivating factor: "If you gave 
me the choice of taking Mr. Toad's Wild Ride through my life or making money, I 
know what I'd take. I'd take the ride," he said. "If my life also creates great 
wealth, that's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Ovitz and Kavner became acquainted over the past two years, as the CAA 
executive discussed possible business deals with AT&T. "In our discussions it 
was clear this was really a first-rate thinker," Ovitz said. "In putting 
together a strategy for our clients, we realized the convergence of creativity 
and communications technology is the future, and he has been involved at the 
highest level in every area." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Kavner will do everything from negotiating video game design deals 
to working out the rights agreements for actors' likenesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Spielberg and Williams, CAA clients who are said to be interested in 
new-media opportunities include Francis Ford Coppola, John Hughes, John 
Singleton, Renny Harlin, Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, Janet Jackson and Sylvester 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 One executive speculated that Kavner will run the new-media division as a 
stand-alone entity. The high-placed source noted that "Ovitz doesn't need 
anyone to make introductions for him. He already knows everybody. Kavner's the 
kind of guy you want running a business." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his first moves, Kavner is expected to bolster CAA's new-media 
staff.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I've been in a leadership role at a very large company, it's a 
few people that do very great things," Kavner said. "It's very hard to get 
1,000 people to do very great things, but the right 10 people can climb the 
mountain." Profile: Robert M. Kavner

RELEASE OF NEW PAIN RELIEVER SPURS ANALGESICS MARKETING WAR; PHARMACEUTICALS: 
SYNTEX CORP.'S ALEVE COULD HASTEN A SHAKEOUT IN THE CROWDED $2.4-BILLION 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The first new non-prescription pain-relief remedy in a decade has landed on 
retailers' shelves, igniting a marketing war in the fiercely competitive 
$2.4-billion analgesics business. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve's arrival -- with an expected $100-million marketing budget for the next 
year -- could hasten a shakeout in the glutted pain reliever field, analysts 
said, as weak-selling products are dropped from retailers' shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like D-Day," said Paul Freiman, chief executive of Syntex Corp., the 
Palo Alto-based manufacturer of Aleve. "The allies are landing with Aleve, and 
the Panzer divisions are on their way to the beach to take shots at us. It's 
going to be a battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rival manufacturers, which have been anticipating Aleve's arrival for months, 
have tried to blunt its launch by stepping up TV advertising, in-store 
promotions, discount coupons and free samples. 
</P>
<P>
 One competitor has wasted no time preparing a rival product. Johnson & 
Johnson, maker of segment leader Tylenol, said it has received federal approval 
to begin marketing a longer-lasting version of that pain reliever. The company 
said Tylenol Extended Relief, which at eight hours lasts longer than current 
Tylenol products, will go on sale by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve is effective for eight to 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect Johnson & Johnson to bolster the new Tylenol product with a 
major promotional effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble Co., which is marketing Aleve with Syntex, says Johnson & 
Johnson's promotions for Tylenol Extended Relief could actually help Aleve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tylenol is a very influential product in this market category, and they will 
be telling consumers that what counts is long-lasting pain relief," said Tom 
Moore, president of health care products for Procter & Gamble. Aleve provides 
the longer-lasting relief, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve's ad campaign, created by New York-based D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, 
will promote the pain reliever as more economical for consumers because it 
provides relief for roughly twice as long as other comparably priced 
analgesics. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor & Gamble will also promote the product's child-resistant cap, dubbed 
Safety Squease, which it says is easier for arthritis sufferers to open than 
current child-resistant designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said Aleve is "an important new launch" for Procter & Gamble, which has 
not introduced a major new brand since the Always feminine pad eight years ago. 
So far, he said, response from retailers to Aleve is "extremely strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts project Aleve sales at up to $225 million, which would give it about 
10% of the U.S. market and make it the No. 3 brand behind Tylenol and Advil, 
which is manufactured by American Home Products Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 While Procter & Gamble is renowned for its global marketing prowess -- its 
mainstay brands include Crest, Pampers and Tide -- Aleve would be its only 
analgesic product. The Cincinnati-based firm's earlier attempt to market a 
coated aspirin called Encaprin flopped due to stiff competition from 
ibuprofen-based products. This time, Procter & Gamble has a significant new 
product but faces very powerful marketers in Johnson & Johnson and American 
Home Products.  
</P>
<P>
 Aleve is likely to hurt the market share of all pain-relief products, but 
Tylenol and Advil may have the most to lose, said Marc Sterger, national 
merchandising manager for McKesson Corp., a drug distributor based in San 
Francisco. Tylenol, in particular, comes in so many different sizes and 
strengths that retailers may make room for Aleve by cutting back on that 
product's display space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Decker, a spokeswoman for American Stores Co. in Salt Lake City, owner 
of the Lucky Stores supermarket and Sav-On drugstore chains, said the biggest 
squeeze will come in grocery stores, where shelf space is at a premium. At 
Lucky Stores, she said, "we'll have to look at the whole category and see if 
there are me-too products, like two ibuprofens." The main ibuprofen products 
are Advil, Nuprin and Motrin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve is an over-the-counter version of naproxen sodium, a fast-acting form of 
the prescription pain reliever Naprosyn. It is the first non-prescription drug 
containing a new analgesic compound to be approved by federal regulators since 
the introduction of ibuprofen in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Matthew Conolly of the UCLA Pain Medicine Center said naproxen sodium has 
proven effective as an anti-inflammatory medication during years of use as a 
prescription drug. But he advised consumers to use it with caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though these things have been made for over-the-counter use, it doesn't 
mean people can consume them ad lib," Conolly said. "These are serious drugs 
with serious side effects, as well as serious benefits. People need to read the 
package insert carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Aleve will be the first non-prescription pain reliever to include a warning on 
the package insert about alcohol consumption and use of the product. Johnson & 
Johnson said Tylenol Extended Relief will carry a similar warning. BATTLE FOR 
THE ANALGESIC MARKET Syntex Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. will fight to gain 
sales for the new Aleve over-the-counter pain reliever in a $2.4-billion market 
where Johnson & Johnson has a big lead. Market share based on sales of adult 
analgesics for the year ended May 8:

FARMERS HALTS SALE OF HOMEOWNER POLICIES; INSURANCE: THE MOVE, CALLED 
TEMPORARY, ALSO APPLIES TO QUAKE COVERAGE. IT RAISES FEARS OF A CHAIN REACTION 
IN THE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, California's third-largest home insurer, abruptly 
pulled the plug on homeowners and earthquake coverage Thursday, ordering its 
agents to immediately stop writing new business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which Farmers described as temporary, raises fears of a chain 
reaction that could imperil the state's fragile economic recovery. At a 
minimum, it will worsen consumers' problems finding coverage after the 
devastating Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quickly developing into a crisis," Marjorie M. Berte, insurance 
adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson, said Thursday. She cited last week's decision by 
20th Century Insurance Co. to withdraw from the homeowners and earthquake 
insurance market, as well as moves by other major insurers to restrict the 
number of new policies they write. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is very concerned that a squeeze in the availability of homeowners 
insurance could disrupt real estate sales and hurt the recovery, Berte said. 
Mortgage lenders require borrowers to obtain homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers actually suspended its earthquake writings nationwide, though by far 
the bulk of its quake policies are in California. It extended the suspension to 
homeowners coverage in California only, because state law here requires that 
insurers who write homeowners policies must also offer earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the five largest California insurers, only No. 2 Allstate Insurance Co. 
has continued to write earthquake coverage without restrictions, and that 
company is having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in a position to be the only company doing business out here, 
because we have exactly the same concerns as everybody else," Dick Donegan, 
Allstate's regional underwriting chief, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns are that another quake similar to the 6.8-magnitude temblor 
that hit Los Angeles on Jan. 17 could threaten the survival of some insurance 
companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, which had its claims-paying ability rating downgraded Monday by 
insurance rating firm A.M. Best Co., on Thursday raised its estimate of gross 
claims costs from the Northridge quake to more than $1 billion, from an earlier 
estimate of $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake is expected to cost the insurance industry more than $6 billion, 
making it history's second-worst insurance disaster after Hurricane Andrew, 
which caused $16 billion of insured damage in Florida and Louisiana in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Woodland Hills-based 20th Century announced its withdrawal from the 
homeowners and earthquake markets, saying that $600 million in earthquake 
claims had wiped out two-thirds of the company's surplus. 20th Century is 
writing no new policies, its 90,000 current earthquake policies will not be 
renewed, and its 240,000 homeowners policies will be phased out over the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers writes about 200,000 new homeowners policies a year in California. 
About 30% of its 1 million California homeowners customers have quake 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, unlike 20th Century, said it will renew existing policies. The 
company did not indicate when it will resume writing new policies. A spokesman 
acknowledged that Farmers is buying time while it ponders how to reduce its 
earthquake exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer said Thursday that it is considering applying for an increase in 
its earthquake and homeowners rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that its sudden exit from the homeowners market could disrupt pending 
real estate sales, Farmers said it will accept new policies that "are already 
in process and due to close within a reasonable time." Farmers did not define 
"a reasonable time."  
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, California's largest insurer, adopted a "managed growth" program a 
year ago, placing a cap on the dollar amount of its new homeowners business. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeco Insurance Group stopped writing policies for homes built before 1960 
unless they have been retrofitted against earthquakes. TIG Insurance Co. 
(formerly Transamerica) and Chubb Group have also placed restrictions on new 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that the flow of business has been diverted to the companies 
that continue writing. Allstate's Donegan said new business is up 60% over last 
year's levels.  
</P>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, in a statement from Washington, 
said, "There are a number of significant statutory powers available to the 
insurance commissioner, which I can and will invoke if necessary to ensure the 
continued availability of homeowners and earthquake insurance to all who seek 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, Garamendi was in Washington to push for passage of federal 
legislation to create a national disaster insurance fund.

BROADWAY'S MAKE-OVER; NEW CEO REMODELS STORES AND THE CORPORATE CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale shareholders were expecting to see a change when they 
gathered a year ago for their annual meeting at Pasadena's Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Los Angeles-based retailer--operator of the Broadway department 
store chain--had recently emerged from a painful bankruptcy reorganization and 
was ready to introduce David L. Dworkin, the new chief executive who had just 
taken the helm from Philip Hawley, who held top company positions for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was easy to see. The suave Hawley had been known for his natty and 
expensive attire, but Dworkin attended the meeting dressed in a sports jacket, 
casual slacks and a denim shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, when shareholders gather in Los Angeles for the 1994 annual meeting, 
they will be seeing more than just a change in executive fashion. Dworkin has 
directed a face lift of the Broadway's once-dowdy stores, eliminated some 
redundant business procedures and is trying to engender a casual but creative 
corporate culture that encourages employees to dress down and speak up. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dworkin took Carter Hawley's top job in March of last year, he inherited 
a company that was struggling. The company went on to lose $95.9 million for 
the year ended Jan. 19, and sales for that 12-month period dropped to $2.09 
billion, down from $2.14 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 But sales are now slowly improving under Dworkin. Same-store sales--revenue 
from stores open at least a year--rose 4.7% for the 13 weeks ended April 30 
over the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin has developed merchandising programs designed to be more responsive to 
the demands of consumers. For ideas, he has cast a wide net inside the 
company--soliciting suggestions from sales clerks as well as executives. To 
encourage such communication, he has eliminated formality and symbols of 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Dworkin has a meeting table in his Los Angeles office, but no 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desk," Dworkin said, "is sometimes an artificial symbol of power, and I'm 
trying to remove symbols that stand in the way of communication. I want to be 
as accessible as possible. We want to encourage an open dialogue in the kind of 
informal environment that encourages associates to share ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin likes the word empower .  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to support and encourage people to take risks," he said. "This 
approach could be considered leadership as opposed to management. Empowerment 
is the solution to managing in a multicultural environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin will wear a tie at business meetings with outsiders, but he is an 
open-collar, blue-jeans-wearing executive at headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As laid-back as I am, I'm very intense about results," Dworkin said. "With 
empowerment comes responsibility. The key to good management oversight is 
measuring the most important operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his tenure, Dworkin concluded that there was excess staffing and 
redundant activity in the company's administrative operations. He eliminated 
about 800 positions at headquarters--leaving a main office of about 2,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there have been no cutbacks in staff at the company's stores, where 
Dworkin is trying to boost morale and the level of service. He meets at least 
once a week with employees at one of the company's stores, holds monthly 
interactive satellite broadcasts to stores and encourages employees to send him 
suggestions via computer or the company newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 One employee, Elizabeth Groff, an assistant buyer in cosmetics, suggested that 
department sales managers be assigned to act as customer sales managers to be 
responsible for the atmosphere in the store and for driving the day's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Management responded by rewriting the job description of department sales 
managers--the 15 to 35 employees in each store who supervise sales clerks. 
Previously, sales managers were not required to spend a specific amount of time 
on the sales floor. Now they are expected to spend about 75% of their time on 
the floor gauging customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to get more input from store managers, Dworkin also eliminated seven 
regional vice president positions and replaced them with hubs--14 brainstorm 
groups each composed of five to seven store managers who meet regularly to 
discuss ways to improve store operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hub leaders are in the trenches and understand the business, and they are 
part of the policy-making team," Dworkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Change will be a top agenda item at Carter Hawley's annual meeting today, and 
shareholders are expected to approve a Dworkin initiative to change the 
corporate name from Carter Hawley Hale Stores to Broadway Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin says the name change will allow the retailer to link its corporate 
identity more closely to its store operations. Carter Hawley operates 52 
Broadway, 22 Emporium and nine Weinstocks stores in five states. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the proposed change is also considered symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company wants to change the name to demonstrate that there has been a 
change in the corporate culture," said Thomas Friedberg, an analyst at San 
Francisco-based Genesis Merchant Group. "They're trying to show that this is a 
business with new management and a new style." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts question whether Dworkin can create enough change to make Carter 
Hawley a financial success in the Southland's increasingly fierce retail 
environment. Discount stores have been snatching market share from department 
stores--making it difficult for chains such as Carter Hawley to rebound, said 
Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail economist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dworkin has his work cut out for him," Barnard said. "He's making all the 
right moves, but the jury is still out. The question is, does he have enough 
time and financing to succeed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin's mission, Barnard said, is complicated by a troubling retail trend: 
lackluster consumer interest in new fashion. Flagging apparel sales and the 
rise of discount chains are a double whammy for many chains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a tough year ahead for most apparel-based retailers, especially 
department stores," Barnard said. "Carter Hawley Hale will continue to feel the 
impact of consumer reluctance to spend, because the public is more 
value-oriented and they perceive department stores as being higher-priced." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to company surveys confirming that consumers want more high-quality 
products at lower prices, Carter Hawley has reduced the number of sales events 
in favor of lower everyday prices on more items. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also developing marketing plans to attract more African 
American, Latino and Asian American shoppers, said Elayne Garofolo, head of 
marketing and sales promotion and a key member of the Dworkin team. Carter 
Hawley now produces Spanish-language television commercials.  
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes that a new store look and new products will lure more 
shoppers. It recently began to renovate 16 Broadway stores in California, 
Arizona and Nevada and plans to renovate 18 more stores next year.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the renovation plan, more space will be provided for more profitable 
products--such as apparel, shoes and cosmetics--and less will go to 
slower-selling items such as electronics and furniture. The company will also 
change fixtures, product signs and lighting in a bid to brighten and beautify 
its stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design changes are way overdue," said Doug Hope, a Los Angeles native and 
publisher of the Atlanta-based Display & Design Ideas magazine. "The company 
was in trouble partly because the stores looked stodgy and old-fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations have already been completed at Broadway stores in Canoga Park and 
Panorama City, two earthquake-damaged facilities that recently reopened. The 
Canoga Park store reopened Saturday, and sales that day were nearly double the 
level of the store's previous one-day record--a positive sign for the 
remodeling effort, Dworkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also introducing new products. A Taste of California--a line of 
housewares that includes boldly colored plates, cups and table settings--will 
arrive in September. The retailer will also introduce a new line of casual 
clothing for men and women early next year. Dworkin's Carter Hawley Hale 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale Stores stock has climbed in value since the company emerged 
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, 1992, though it has started 
to dip again recently. Some retail industry analysts say the stock's gain is 
due in part to changes made by David Dworkin, the company's chief executive 
since March, 1993. Monthly closes, except latest: Thursday: $9.375

MARTIN MARIETTA WILL CUT 1,800 POSITIONS AT ITS SAN DIEGO PLANT; AEROSPACE: 
WORK ON ATLAS AND CENTAUR LAUNCH SYSTEMS WILL BE SHIFTED TO A PRODUCTION 
FACILITY IN COLORADO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In yet another setback to California's aerospace industry, Martin Marietta 
Corp. said Thursday that it will eliminate 1,800 of its 2,100 jobs at its 
recently acquired space launch business in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said it will move the production of Atlas and Centaur launch systems to 
its Titan rocket plant in Denver, leaving behind in San Diego a small 
manufacturing and assembly operation employing 300 workers when the 
consolidation is completed at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its consolidation plan, Martin will transfer 1,400 jobs to Denver and 
eliminate 400 other current jobs in San Diego, which has been particularly hard 
hit by defense spending cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., did not disclose how many workers in San Diego 
will actually be offered transfers to Denver, though notifications will start 
soon, according to a letter to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the job losses will certainly hurt the state's economy in the short 
term, Martin's move also eliminates another piece of the industrial mosaic that 
has made California a dominant force in aerospace manufacturing for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide consolidation in aerospace and defense has nibbled away at 
California's industry for years now, reducing employment in the tactical 
missile, helicopter and aircraft businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, space booster production was not as crucial to the future of the 
state's aerospace business as other sectors such as communications satellites, 
military spacecraft, bombers, transport aircraft or a host of other 
multibillion-dollar industries, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Space launch is not a particularly high-growth, high-value segment," said 
McKinsey & Co. aerospace expert Robert Paulson. "If you told me the last 
satellite producer was leaving the state, I would be more concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of the Atlas work was almost predictable after General Dynamics 
agreed late last year to sell the unit to Martin, which is seeking to cut costs 
and eliminate excess facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said it will vacate a million square feet of plant space at a facility 
near downtown San Diego that is still owned by General Dynamics, but it will 
remain in a government-owned plant in San Diego where rocket fuel tanks and 
other metal assemblies are produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also said it will keep its space magnetics business in San Diego, an 
operation with just a few dozen employees that has been attempting to apply 
superconducting magnet technology to fast trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Martin agreed to buy the San Diego unit, it denied that it planned 
to leave the city, though The Times reported in February that the firm had 
disclosed such a plan to government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin had originally asked the government to share with it half the $500 
million in cost savings resulting from the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 After The Times disclosed the unusual request, the House Armed Services 
Committee began an investigation and demanded that the Pentagon justify such a 
major change in policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the government agreed to share just half of $60 million in 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Martin praised San Diego officials for their support, which it 
said allowed the firm to maintain "a significant presence in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is studying a further consolidation of its Atlas and Titan launch 
operations at Vandenberg and Kennedy launch centers, in which hundreds of 
additional jobs may be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has been stung by a series of embarrassing problems and has incurred 
the wrath of both Pentagon and NASA officials. For example, water was recently 
discovered in an Atlas tank that was to be filled with helium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not sure how the water got there," a Defense Department spokesman said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to employees, the firm said the Denver transition will require 
employees "to stay focused 100% on mission success." It said it will set up a 
duplicate assembly line for Atlas rockets there, then phase out San Diego 
production.

 Caterpillar Strike Threatened: The United Auto Workers union said it will 
strike plants nationwide if a labor dispute is not resolved by Tuesday.The 
union also asked federal mediators to schedule immediate meetings to address 
what it called unfair labor practices by the Peoria, Ill.-based company. The 
UAW said its 14,500 Caterpillar workers will strike if the meetings fail to 
resolve the conflict that has led to nine walkouts since September. "Our 
members are being illegally disciplined, suspended, fired and locked out," said 
Jerry Baker, chairman of the UAW central bargaining committee. UAW members have 
been working without a contract under terms of Caterpillar's final offer, 
imposed in April, 1992.

 Marion Merrell Dow to Appeal $19.2-Million Judgment: The Kansas City, 
Mo.-based subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co. said it will fight the verdict and 
judgment in a product liability lawsuit involving the drug Bendectin, once used 
to treat nausea.A Philadelphia jury found that a boy born in 1980 with club 
feet was harmed in the womb because his mother took the drug to treat morning 
sickness. "We feel that there has been extensive research done as to whether it 
causes birth defects. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it does not, 
and we will use that as the basis for our appeal," said Marion Merrell Dow 
spokesman Tom Heapes. Bendectin was developed by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals 
Inc., which merged with Marion in 1989.

 Support Claimed for Lifting Alaska Oil Export Ban: U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens 
(R-Alaska) said he believes President Clinton supports lifting the 
2-decades-old federal ban on export of Alaskan oil. But Administration 
officials confirmed that an interagency working group coordinated by the 
National Economic Council is still reviewing the matter."What I heard (Clinton) 
say was, 'We think it ought to be done,' " Stevens said after Clinton met in 
Washington with lawmakers from oil-producing areas to discuss problems in the 
domestic oil and natural gas industry. Separately, Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary said concerns about international trade issues -- raised by the 
proposed deal to ensure that U.S. ships and crews tanker any exported oil -- 
were the holdup. "We're going to spend some time with our colleagues at the 
U.S. trade representative's office," O'Leary said.

STRONG YEN REDUCES THE SIZE OF JAPAN'S TRADE IMBALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's trade surplus fell in May, snapping a five-month upward trend, as the 
strong yen curtailed growth in exports, the government and economists said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus fell to an unadjusted $6.54 billion from $7.78 billion a year 
earlier, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high yen has been helping to dampen exports by boosting the price of 
Japanese goods overseas, thereby making them less competitive, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a great shrinkage in the surplus is highly unlikely this year even though 
the up trend should peak, said Soichi Enkyo, economist at Bank of Tokyo Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year the surplus is likely to remain around the same level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus was far below the average forecast by economists earlier this 
week. They predicted a surplus of $7.1 billion for May. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the trade surplus climbed to $11.12 billion from $10.29 billion a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surplus with the United States, which has been most critical of 
Japan's trade imbalances, climbed to $3.04 billion in May from $2.83 billion a 
year earlier.

RANKING THE DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third year in a row, four luxury car brands and General Motors' Saturn 
topped the J.D. Power ranking of customers' satisfaction with the way dealers 
treated them when they bought new cars. J.D. Power & Associates, a marketing 
concern in Agoura Hills, surveyed 45,000 people who bought 1994 cars and light 
trucks. Numerical scores were assigned to the brands based on buyers' 
satisfaction with dealers.Among other things, the survey measured how well 
salespeople explained a vehicle's features, how well it was "prepped" and how 
customers were treated when they picked up the cars. The average score for the 
industry was 122, and 17 nameplates ranked above that. Here are the rankings.

SCECORP SLASHES STOCK DIVIDEND BY 30%; UTILITIES: THE COMPANY BLAMES 
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE PUC'S MOVE TOWARD DEREGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move long predicted by analysts, SCEcorp, parent of Southern California 
Edison Co., announced Thursday that it will cut its stock dividend almost 30%, 
from $1.42 to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our regret, we have reached the conclusion that we don't have the 
flexibility to maintain the dividend at the currently high level," SCEcorp 
Chairman and Chief Executive John E. Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited declining rates of return granted by state regulators, ongoing cash 
needs and potentially far-reaching changes in the electric utility business. 
All have brought "uncertainty about future earnings of the utility," Bryson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson had warned of a possible dividend cut in a March letter to 
shareholders. Electric utilities cut their dividends only with great reluctance 
because the dividend -- not the prospect of stock price growth -- is the main 
attraction for investors, many of whom plan their retirement around such 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edison and other big investor-owned California electric utilities have 
been hurt by rising interest rates and the uncertainties of a swiftly changing 
industry. In late April, utility stocks took an especially steep dive with news 
of the state Public Utilities Commission's proposal for a wide-ranging 
deregulation of the electric utility industry -- introducing retail competition 
as early as 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 SCEcorp shares, among the hardest hit, have fallen 46.6% since fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement was made after the close of trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with SCEcorp shares unchanged at $13.75. The new rate affects 
dividends payable on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the near term, the dividend goes down," said Steven M. Fetter, a senior 
vice president of Fitch Investors Service Inc., who applauded the move. "But if 
it allows SCEcorp to be more competitive, once competition comes about, SCEcorp 
could have actually strengthened its hand by taking this step. . . . Whether 
someone's a shareholder or a bondholder, they want their company to be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson held forth the "potential" for future dividend increases, but said that 
"the most important single factor is that the (California Public Utilities 
Commission) regulatory proceedings reach reasonable outcomes."

THREAT OF MORE LAYOFFS CONTINUES IN CALIFORNIA; ECONOMY: A SURVEY ALSO SHOWS 
THAT COMPANIES ARE CLAMPING DOWN ON PAY INCREASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite growing confidence that the state's recession has bottomed out, more 
California employers plan to shake up their work forces with layoffs, a survey 
released Thursday shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's authors conclude that growing numbers of companies, even 
successful firms, are laying off or buying out highly paid workers and often 
replacing them with lower-paid and younger employees. Temporary employees, 
experts say, are increasingly being used to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies "are trying to make themselves more efficient and more productive," 
said Kenneth R. Wechsler, one of the directors of the study for William M. 
Mercer Inc., a management consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, companies are clamping down on pay increases. The survey 
projected that increases in base pay will average 3.9% in 1994, the lowest 
raises in the 12 years Mercer has performed the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In one possibly hopeful sign for workers, the Mercer study found that firms 
embarking on layoffs are dismissing somewhat fewer people than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, however, the Mercer study and recent economic reports show that "in 
all of the good news about the recovery, there still are a lot of people 
subject to being laid off," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell said the widespread layoffs and the replacement of high-paying jobs 
with lower-paying ones have so far led to a weak recovery and heightened job 
insecurity among workers. "A lot of people are running scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercer survey was based on replies from 283 California companies employing 
1.8 million people. It found that 45.3% of those firms have had, or will have, 
layoffs during 1994, including 49% in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wechsler said the percentage of firms that actually lay off employees 
is likely to be even higher. For example, 24% of the companies Mercer surveyed 
last year anticipated layoffs during 1993, but the percentage that let people 
go turned out to be 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a rising percentage of firms are planning to cut their work forces 
through attrition: 57.2%, up from 51.4% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks are coming even though only 11.5% of the companies surveyed 
believe the economy is getting worse. Another 30.6% said the economy is getting 
better, while 57.9% said it is staying about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler said the "corporate re-engineering" trend that has led companies to 
get rid of highly paid employees even as the economy steadies is also holding 
down pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 As with layoffs, Wechsler said, the pay projections tend to be somewhat more 
optimistic than the true results. He predicted that raises in base pay will 
actually amount to 3.5% or 3.6% this year, rather than the projected 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news isn't all bad for workers' paychecks: While companies are 
clamping down on base pay increases, Wechsler said, they are easing the pain by 
increasingly giving employees onetime bonuses intended to link pay to 
individual performance or the firm's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Government figures generally show even lower pay increases than the Mercer 
survey and other management consultants' studies. For instance, during the 
first three months of this year, wages climbed at an annual rate of 2.4% 
nationally, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between the government figures and the management consultants' 
reports stems from the scope of studies. While the government tracks all 
civilian workers, the management consultants focus on pay raises for workers 
who continue with a company throughout the year. Consequently, they do not 
directly reflect the impact of a highly paid worker being replaced by someone 
earning less.

SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING STARTS TAKE ANOTHER DIVE IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Builders reduced construction of single-family houses in May for the second 
straight month, reflecting their increased apprehension over a slowdown in home 
sales due to rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said higher rates will curb activity for the rest of the year, 
though they predict that single-family housing starts in 1994 will top last 
year's total. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single-family sector is the bulk of the industry and . . . we're starting 
to see it taper off," said economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a general drift down in single-family starts," agreed economist 
Stan Duobinis of the National Assn. of Home Builders. "Interest rates are 
moderating a little now, which certainly will keep the decline from being 
overwhelming, but we will see a continued decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Thursday that overall housing starts rose 2.6% in 
May to a seasonally adjusted 1.51 million annual rate. Increases in the South 
and West offset declines in the Northeast and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the growth was entirely in construction of apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family starts, which represent 80% of housing construction and are most 
affected by mortgage rate changes, slipped 0.5% to a 1.20-million annual rate. 
They had fallen 5% in April to a 1.21-million rate. 
</P>
<P>
 And though multifamily starts jumped 16.7% to a 308,000 rate, many analysts 
said the increase was unsustainable. They predicted construction would decline 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in the single-family sector, housing starts for the first 
five months of 1994 were 21.1% higher than a year earlier. For all of 1993, 
starts totaled 1.29 million units; many analysts expect they will climb to 
nearly 1.40 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also reported Thursday that the number of Americans 
filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 11,000 last week to 
a seasonally adjusted 348,000, the lowest in nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline was expected by most economists, who say the job market continues 
to improve but at a slower rate than earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports are the latest signs of a slowing economy, following four interest 
rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve Board to check inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage rates have risen from a low of 6.97% last October to 8.33% this week.

 Disney Battle Intensifies: The fight over building a Walt Disney Co. theme 
park in northern Virginia swept onto the national stage as a group of 
congressmen vowed to block the project and Disney chief Michael D. Eisner 
mounted his own charge on Washington. "This is a national issue," declared Rep. 
Michael Andrews (D-Tex.), who introduced a resolution that he said sends a 
message to Disney not to build the $650-million project near Manassas National 
Battlefield Park in Prince William County.That announcement came as Eisner was 
having lunch in the Capitol with House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) and about 
30 other lawmakers. Eisner later attended the Washington premiere of Disney's 
new animated movie, "The Lion King," and hosted a party at the National Zoo 
expected to attract hundreds of invited, well-connected Washingtonians.

 Toyota to Boost U.S. Part Purchases: Toyota Motor Corp. plans to increase its 
purchases of U.S.-built parts nearly 40% in the next three years, the company's 
international purchasing manager said. Nearly all the increases will be in 
parts used by Toyota's U.S. manufacturing plants, Koichiro Noguchi said.The 
auto maker spent $4.65 billion on U.S.-built parts in the fiscal year that 
ended in March. It expects that total to reach $6.45 billion for the year that 
ends in March, 1997. "Growth will continue as long as American suppliers 
continue working to shorten their lead times, to raise their quality and to 
lower their costs," Noguchi told automotive writers in Detroit. He said there 
is considerable room for improvement.

 Saturn Shifting Into Export Gear: Ten years after General Motors Corp. formed 
its Saturn subsidiary to compete with imports, the upstart unit is making plans 
to take its show on the road and export cars to Japan and Europe. The company 
is already selling cars in Taiwan but hopes to expand to other Far Eastern 
markets and Europe by the end of the decade."Japan is No. 1 on our list," 
Saturn President Richard LeFauve said. He said Saturn is testing a 
right-hand-drive model for possible sale in Japan and Britain and is studying 
establishing sales operations in Singapore, Israel, China and Thailand. Saturn 
officials declined to say how many cars they plan to sell overseas, but Vice 
President Donald Hudler said international sales could ultimately account for 
more than 100,000 cars a year by the end of the decade.

YOUR MONEY ; STOCK, BOND MARKETS BUOYED AS COMMODITY PRICES RECEDE

 Stocks and bonds rallied Thursday as lower commodity prices relieved the 
markets of their latest inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks racked up strong gains, lifted by a rally in the shares of 
Exxon Corp. and nervous buying ahead of today's options expirations. After 
losing more than 24 points on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average 
gained 20.93 to close at 3,811.34, with 256.39 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell back to 7.35% from 
Wednesday's 7.39% on falling commodity prices, despite stronger-than-expected 
housing data that tended to push bonds yields higher. Short- and 
intermediate-term yields retreated as well. The long bond's price, which moves 
in the opposite direction, was up 3/8 point, or $3.73 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 9 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Other indexes tied to NYSE stocks were also higher. The NYSE composite gained 
0.85 to 254.99 while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.32 to 
461.93. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller firms lost 0.87 to 734.97, while at the 
American Stock Exchange the market value index was down 0.49 to 441.78. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect a lot of the decent activity in blue chips is a function of options 
expiration Friday," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at 
Gruntal. 
</P>
<P>
 The "triple witching" expiration of equity and index options and index futures 
often brings fluctuations in stock prices as groups of widely held shares are 
bought or sold in relation to stock index futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Exxon, one of the 30 components of the Dow index, bounced back 1 
7/8 to 58 7/8, helped by an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices were bolstered by a drop in the price of grains and other 
commodities, which had spiked Wednesday. The Commodities Research Bureau index, 
a gauge of daily changes in various commodities, dropped 1.33 points to 237.28. 
The index surged 3.31 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase reversed a slide in bond prices that began early in the day when 
the government reported housing construction was up 2.6% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had expected higher mortgage rates to depress housing starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was interpreted as a sign of economic growth, which carries the 
threat of inflation and often causes investors to sell fixed-income securities. 
Inflation erodes the value of these investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices began to turn around markedly in the early afternoon on a number 
of factors, the most important being the softening of commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Entergy fell 2 3/4 to 26 3/8 after it told analysts it was facing "an 
increasingly competitive environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hasbro lost 3 to 28 1/2 after saying it expects second-quarter results to 
fall below a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renal Treatment Centers tumbled 3 to 17 after it predicted second-quarter 
earnings would fall shy of analysts' estimates, citing unusually high operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks continued a recent decline. First Chicago lost 2 1/4 to 50 3/4 
and NationsBank was off 1 1/8 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer stocks kept the Nasdaq weak. AST Research was down 1 1/4 to 14. 
Dell Computer was off 1 1/16 to 26 7/8. Apple lost 1 7/16 to 26 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. In Europe, Germany's 30-share DAX 
average ended at 2,054.91, down 19.79 points, while in London, the Financial 
Times 100-share average closed off 15.7 points at 3,030.1 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended up 84.51 points at 21,367.47 and Mexico 
City's Bolsa index rose 29.93 points to 2,326.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen amid aggressive 
intervention by the Bank of Japan and jitters about a U.S.-North Korean 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 After dipping 0.16 yen to 102.87 in Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the 
dollar rose in New York to 103.25 yen, up from 102.65 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell to its lowest level this year against the German mark and 
Swiss franc in Europe and continued to drop when trading shifted to U.S. 
markets. But profit taking and concerns of possible dollar-supporting 
intervention by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped slow the 
slide. It closed at 1.632 German marks, down from 1.636, and at 1.370 Swiss 
francs, down from 1.3705.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY ; NOT ALL AUTO MAKERS ARE 
STICKING TO BUMPER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A survey released Thursday found uneven compliance among auto manufacturers 
with California's so-called bumper sticker law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old law requires car makers to put stickers on new cars that state 
the strength of the bumper. Under federal rules adopted in 1983, bumpers must 
withstand a 2 1/2-m.p.h. crash without damage. Before then, bumpers had to 
withstand a 5-m.p.h. collision, and some auto makers still meet the higher 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted by Motor Votes and the California Public Interest 
Research Group. The organizations said they checked 600 cars at 80 auto 
dealerships around the state.  
</P>
<P>
 All Acuras, Chryslers, Plymouths, Hondas, Infinitis, Mitsubishis, Saturns and 
Volvos checked had stickers, they said. But only 34% of Oldsmobiles and 40% of 
Mazdas surveyed had them, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Oldsmobile could not explain the company's poor showing. Gus 
Buenz said that before June 1, dealers were required to put the stickers on 
cars. The company has taken over the chore, he said, and stickers are now 
affixed at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may have been some slippage in between when (dealers) stopped putting 
them on and we took over," Buenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda representative Jack Pitney said he hadn't seen the study and couldn't 
comment on it. However, he said that all Mazdas entering the country for sale 
in California leave port with the stickers on them. He said safeguards are in 
place to make sure no vehicle is released from a port without a sticker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are 100% in compliance with this law. What happens once they reach 
dealers, I can't speak to," Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Voters and CalPIRG are lobbying to raise the federal standard for 
bumpers. They argue that the lower standard has raised repair bills for 
consumers. A CalPIRG spokeswoman cited a study by the Insurance Institute for 
Highway Safety showing that damage claims for Buick Regals rose 22% when the 
standard was lowered to 2 1/2 m.p.h. from 5 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers that continue to meet the 5-m.p.h. standard include Acura, Ford, 
Honda, Lincoln-Mercury and Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, wrong number: GTE said its computer scrambled long-distance charges for 
110,000 of its customers last week, causing them to receive someone else's 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One GTE customer contacted us to say she received a long-distance bill from 
AT&T for calls to Tomah, Wis., and Homass Spring, Fla. She said she did not 
make the calls and that her long-distance carrier is Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The error affected 3.5% of GTE's customers statewide, and all had a billing 
date of June 1. A GTE spokesman was unable to say what caused the billing error 
but said the problem is fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computers are strange creatures," spokesman Larry Cox said. "Sometimes they 
malfunction and then you reboot them and they work perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, GTE is sending postcards to customers explaining the mistake. 
 
</P>
<P>
 It's also calling customers who were erroneously billed $100 or more, advising 
them to disregard the charges.  
</P>
<P>
 GTE said all customers should examine their bills carefully and notify the 
company about any questionable long-distance or toll charges. Corrected bills 
will go out next month, GTE said. 
</P>

 Odds and ends: Mooving along: Consumers Union says the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture has agreed to hold hearings on possible revisions to a 
milk-pricing formula adopted last year. No date has been set. Consumers Union 
said the formula rewarded dairy farmers at the expense of consumers. . . . A 
good reason to take up sewing: A recent issue of the trade publication 
Brandweek reports that the fabric for a $60 pair of designer jeans costs $3.50.

 No Homer, here: The Fox network, which already brings viewers "The Simpsons," 
is contemplating another Simpsons project.But this one is not a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is said to be scouting for writers to produce a made-for-TV project on 
events surrounding the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox declined to comment, but an industry source said the office of Gary 
Hoffman, Fox's senior vice president of movies and miniseries, contacted agents 
at International Creative Management to inquire about the availability of 
writers to work on a Simpson project.

 ICM, however, also represents O.J. Simpson, who has been described as a

 On the heels of Atlantic Records Group scoring a No. 1 chart debut with Stone 
Temple Pilots, a Business Week article about Atlantic Chairman and CEO Doug 
Morris has escalated music industry chatter on expanded duties for Morris 
within parent Warner Music Group. In the article, Warner Music Group Chairman 
Robert Morgado is quoted as saying, "Clearly Doug has the talent to play a 
wider role in the future."Morris' Atlantic Group, which includes the Atlantic 
and very successful Interscope labels, has had a torrid chart run with 
hot-selling soundtracks to "Above the Rim" and "The Crow," as well as newcomers 
Collective Soul and All-4-One.

COMPANY TOWN; NETWORKS SELL RECORD $4.3 BILLION IN 'UPFRONT' ADVERTISING 
SEASON; TELEVISION: THE 18% INCREASE FOR THE 1994-95 PERIOD REVERSES YEARS OF 
LACKLUSTER GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The four broadcast networks, after several years of lackluster advertising 
growth, have rung up $4.3 billion in the "upfront" advertising selling season, 
an increase of 18% over the past year and better than the previous record set 
in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives were surprised at the demand by advertisers, who usually 
commit to buying advertising a year in advance. The current upfront selling 
season covers the period from the fall of 1994 through the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The big winners appear to be ABC and Fox, both of which posted increases of up 
to 9%. Fox sold $700 million worth of ad time, up from $550 million last year. 
"It was more than good," Fox Inc. Chairman Rupert Murdoch said. "I'd say it was 
a lot better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Network TV advertising is usually linked to the state of the national economy 
and is a measure of how advertisers feel about future consumer spending habits, 
as well as a reflection of recent corporate performance. All present signs are 
highly encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide recession of the early 1990s slowed the growth of the major 
broadcast networks, which in turn hampered their ability to spend money on 
programming and other investments. In recent years, cable TV and syndication 
have also cut into network advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the recently concluded TV season, cumulative ratings for basic cable TV 
dropped below their year-ago level, while the ratings for network TV rebounded 
somewhat.  
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the erosion in network viewing is slowing now that cable 
is a mature business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the largest upfront market in history," said Marvin Goldsmith, president 
of sales and advertising for ABC TV Network. "The national economy is going 
well, businesses are expanding and advertisers have recognized the value of 
network TV to move their product." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the networks sell advertising time in "packages," mixing in hits 
such as ABC's "Roseanne" or NBC's "Seinfeld" with lower-rated shows. The 
networks sell about 70% to 75% of their advertising in the upfront market, 
holding back the remaining time to sell in the "scatter" market later in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives said ABC has so far sold about $1.35 billion in prime-time 
advertising for next season, followed by CBS with $1.2 billion and NBC with 
about $1.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the four networks sold $3.6 billion in prime-time advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CBS has been the No. 1-ranked network in prime-time ratings, ABC 
attracts a greater segment of the key 18-to-49-year-old audience that 
advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach. Fox can also charge higher 
rates because it attracts more hard-to-reach young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big network TV spenders this year are the auto, fast-food and 
telecommunications companies, as well as the movie studios, said Joe Abruzzese, 
executive vice president at CBS. "There's been a lot of pent-up demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives said one of the reasons for the big jump in this year's ad 
sales was the absence of the Winter Olympics, which diverted as much as $200 
million last year. Olympic advertising is sold separately and is not counted 
among upfront sales.

 TV: The musical chairs game among network-affiliated stations continues. E.W. 
Scripps Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. announced an unusually long 10-year 
affiliation agreement for five of the nation's largest markets. The deal calls 
for two Scripps stations -- in Tampa, Fla., and Phoenix -- now affiliated with 
Fox to switch to ABC.Fox had notified both stations that its programming would 
move to other stations. A third Scripps station in Baltimore will switch to ABC 
from NBC. The new affiliates join two existing Scripps-owned ABC affiliates in 
Detroit and Cleveland. And Scripps said negotiations are continuing over the 
affiliation for its Kansas City station that also is losing its Fox 
affiliation. The announcement follows the landmark deal in May in which Fox and 
New World Communications announced a $500-million deal that will give Fox 12 
stations now affiliated with CBS, NBC and ABC.

ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS; LENDERS ACCEPTING LOWER DOWN PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the recent home refinancing boom slowing, mortgage lenders are again 
courting Orange County consumers by requesting smaller down payments, according 
to TRW Redi Property Data in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Between January and April, 16% of the home loans made in Orange County 
required a conventional down payment of less than 10%, according to TRW Redi 
data.In contrast, just 4% of mortgages made during the same period in 1991 
included down payments of less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, homeowners who put down less than 10% of a home's value have 
been perceived by lenders as greater credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mortgage lenders are obviously under pressure to increase their market share, 
said Nima Nattagh, TRW Redi's market analyst. But the trend toward lower down 
payments, he said, "could potentially lead to greater market instability in the 
future."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: IRVINE FIRM WINS CONTRACT TO DESIGN RUSSIA HOTEL COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CYP International, an architectural and planning firm, said Thursday it has 
won a contract to design a $100-million hotel and apartment complex in downtown 
St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-story Hotel Rafael will blend with the "unique historic 
architecture" in St. Petersburg's city center, said Donald R. Corbin, CYP's 
chairman.The 350,000-square-foot structure will consist of 150 guest rooms on 
the first four floors and one- to three-bedroom apartments on the top four 
floors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel, a joint venture by two British companies, will be near the famous 
Maryinsky Theatre, which is home to the Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 CYP must move quickly to draw the plans because construction is scheduled to 
begin late this year. IHS Hawaii Inc. will provide materials and supplies for 
the hotel, and a Finnish company will build it. 
</P>
<P>
 CYP has projects across California, Mexico, Europe and Asia, including the 
redesign of the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach.

'GREEN DARES' ENTICING COMPANIES TO MAKE LESS WASTE; ENVIRONMENT: VOLUNTARY 
PROGRAMS TO REDUCE TRASH MEET LESS RESISTANCE THAN LEGISLATION. PARTICIPATING 
FIRMS ENJOY GOOD PUBLICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. KALISH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tell companies they have to cut waste output, and they'll likely squawk about 
costly mandates that hurt profits and squelch expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But dangle a few carrots in front of them, and see how enthusiastic they get: 
</P>
<P>
 * Forty-six companies large and small touted how they cut a total of 1 billion 
pounds of garbage since 1990 -- about a year's worth of trash at a medium-sized 
landfill -- in a contest organized by seven Northeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Environmental Protection Agency won voluntary agreements from nearly 100 
companies to slash waste output and will crown their achievements at a 
"WasteWise" ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 * The winners of another contest in Massachusetts included a company that 
makes egg cartons from old phone books and another that ships computer parts in 
boxes made of recycled paper, and urges consumers to return the boxes for 
reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 While proposed legislation to reduce trash meets with resistance from 
businesses, a surprising counter-trend is emerging: Green dares, or contests 
that promise positive publicity, can entice companies into making voluntary but 
substantial reductions in their garbage output. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that businesses are more willing to cut trash output if they're asked 
rather than told is growing as governments push for waste reduction instead of 
new incinerators and landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Packaging waste totaled 47 million tons in 1990, about one-third of all waste 
in the United States, according to the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, the 
government group whose annual CONEG Challenge drew 46 companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble Co., a leading manufacturer of consumer brands, responded to 
the contest by saying it boosted the average recycled content in its packages 
to 36%. That included using 100% plastic trash in containers of Ultra Downey 
and Lemon Comet and 50% in containers of Tide, Bold and Dash. 
</P>
<P>
 Another participant, Campbell Soup Co., said it trimmed the weight of its 
steel soup cans by a total 4 million pounds and its juice cans by 1.1 million 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter Healthcare Corp., the $8.5-billion medical products company, said it 
cut 11.6 million pounds of packaging since 1990 and plans a 15% overall 
reduction by 1995. It also plans to use more recycled fiber in its corrugated 
shipping containers, and less chlorine-bleached paper and cardboard in 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 But support for the companies' efforts is far from unanimous. Some 
environmentalists and state officials say the voluntary actions can give 
companies credit for token measures and help them avoid more meaningful 
reductions that cost more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the CONEG Challenge is now boycotted by nearly all the 
environmentalists initially involved. They dropped out after businesses refused 
to support legislation that would have mandated specific reductions and 
recycled content in packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking support from the environmental community, the governors of New 
England, New York and Pennsylvania instead challenged businesses to voluntarily 
report on how they've slashed solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies get free publicity by complying. The latest 140-page CONEG 
Challenge report, published last fall, commends participants for their 
"leadership role" and "commitment to reduce packaging waste." 
</P>
<P>
 "You could do a good measure of waste reduction by eliminating the report," 
said Resa Dimino, solid waste specialist at Environmental Action Foundation, an 
environmental group that withdrew from the CONEG Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea you can get government and industry and environmentalists around the 
table and resolve the issue is just fundamentally flawed.

THREE D LOSES 29 CENTS A SHARE IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three D Departments Inc., a Costa Mesa operator of retail bed and bath 
specialty stores, posted a loss of $832,000, or 29 cents a share, for its 
latest fiscal quarter. That compared to a loss of $246,000, or 9 cents a share, 
for the same period a year earlier.Sales for the company's third quarter, which 
ended April 30, declined 5% to $8.6 million from $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first three quarters of its fiscal year, the company recorded a loss 
of $638,000, or 22 cents a share, compared to a loss of $64,000, or 2 cents a 
share, for the same period a year earlier. Nine-month sales slipped 5% to $31.3 
million from $33 million. The company attributed the sales decline to the 
closing of seven stores and earthquake damage to its Woodland Hills location.

APPRECIATION; FRANKLIN D. MURPHY: A CIVILIZING FORCE FOR THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was a man who made things happen. Today this gloriously glitzy Pop Culture 
Capital of a town has a veneer of high culture in its galleries and museums. If 
that patina of civilization can be traced to the efforts of any one individual, 
it was Franklin D. Murphy, who died Thursday at the age of 78. 
</P>
<P>
 We have lost him now and more's the pity. His official positions as UCLA's 
chancellor, president of the board at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and 
chairman and chief executive officer of Times Mirror made him a powerful part 
of officialdom, but the way he wielded that power was endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his endless tasks of fund-raising was to scrape together some $23 
million in the 1980s for expansion of the County Museum of Art. Completely 
baffled by such matters, I asked him how he went about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, so far," he replied, "it's just been me and (philanthropist-collector) 
Ed Carter on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 He cared boundlessly about the legacy of history that lives through art. It is 
a caring that seems to be dying with him, and more's the pity still. 
</P>
<P>
 His was a remarkable generation. It produced those World War II-type Yanks who 
walked with a certain swagger and behaved with extraordinary decency. They 
believed that the System, with its ponderous institutions and rapacious egos, 
could be made to ennoble ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a man with the administrative skills of a Medici banker turn those 
talents to the establishment of repositories for eloquently beautiful objects, 
even on those occasions when the objects are still so new they frighten and 
anger people? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was because he'd learned that to do less is simply wrong. In 1936, as 
a young man, he studied medicine in Germany. Always gifted with a knack for 
meeting the key people at the crucial moment, Murphy, on different occasions, 
shook hands with both Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in Munich he ran across an extravagant official art exhibition called 
"Entartete Kunst" -- Degenerate Art. The show was Hitler's notorious personal 
immolation of the advanced art of his time. Murphy looked at the searing 
expressions of Max Beckmann, E.L. Kirchner and the rest of the rebels of the 
Expressionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly," he said later, "it was so new I didn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get a clue. Hitler, with even-handed evil, had also included the 
advanced literature and music of the day. Murphy's mother, trained as a concert 
pianist, had imbued her son with appreciation of that muse. It happened that 
the record being played to demonstrate the immoral quality of modern art was 
Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's "Die Dreigroschenoper" ("The Threepenny 
Opera"). 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy instantly recognized the work's blend of tango, jazz and classical 
themes as the furthest thing from degenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned you must look hard and think long to grasp the new thoughts such 
art expresses." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson served him well. It was Los Angeles' luck that what served him well 
did as much for the city. At UCLA in the '60s, he established the Franklin D. 
Murphy Sculpture Garden for modern work, fostered an exhibitions program that 
allowed gallery director Fredrick S. Wight to make a showcase of national 
significance. By the time he departed UCLA for Times Mirror in 1968, the campus 
had a new art building, the Elmer Belt Leonardo da Vinci Library, the Grunwald 
Center for the Graphic Arts and its Museum of Cultural History. 
</P>
<P>
 He loved Italy and the Renaissance. He helped save Venice after her disastrous 
floods. He collected Pre-Columbian art. His activities were multicultural in 
the best sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy never did one thing at a time. It was all very well to lend artistic 
enrichment to a university but what L.A. really needed in the late '50s was a 
fully fledged, free-standing museum for the general history of art. What it had 
was a corner of what is today the Museum of Natural History in Exposition Park. 
There were only a few good things in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot," intoned the local naysayers, "build a collection for such a 
museum. At this point in history it is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy and his fellow museum enthusiasts had an answer for them, and its name 
was Norton Simon. Despite protean effort, however, Murphy and his forces were 
unable to gain the Simon collections, as they had hoped, as the aesthetic 
backbone of the museum. In the short term, it looked like humiliation for 
Murphy and an egomaniac's reputation for Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, a certain positive shrewdness manifested itself over time. 
Without the original carrot of the Simon collections, the museum would likely 
not have been built or renovated into the rather handsome complex it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar scenario attaches itself to Armand Hammer, another collector Murphy 
helped cultivate for the people's museum. Like Simon, Hammer decamped to build 
a private monument to himself in Westwood. Today that building is under the 
stewardship of Murphy's old school, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 What goes around comes around. When it comes around well one is likely to 
ascribe it to a certain tone that's been set. Franklin D. Murphy set a tone of 
doing the right thing for the community. When other members of the old guard 
opposed the establishment of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Murphy said, 
"There is room in this city for another museum!" 
</P>
<P>
 He sat on the board of the Kress Foundation, the Getty Museum and was board 
chairman of the National Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 He acted as if he believed that if you behave positively and set the 
groundwork solidly in the right direction, things will work out. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, he wrote his own epitaph. When he first moved to Times Mirror, 
someone suggested that he should give up his cultural activities lest they 
appear as a conflict of interest. In one of his crusty moods, he replied that 
no matter where he worked, "I will never become a cultural eunuch." 
</P>
<P>
 He was brave, constructive, admirable and not to be messed with.

WOODY HITS BULL'S-EYE AT MIRAMAX; MOVIES: AFTER BEING SHUNNED BY HOLLYWOOD OVER 
A DOMESTIC SCANDAL, THE WRITER-DIRECTOR HAS STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE COMPANY TO 
RELEASE HIS FILM 'BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woody Allen -- the New York movie icon who fell from grace after an explosive 
custody battle with Mia Farrow and child sexual abuse allegations clouded his 
career -- is back in business with Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old Oscar-winning writer-director has made a deal with Miramax 
Films, the distributor of such provocative titles as "The Crying Game" and "The 
Piano," to release his latest movie, "Bullets Over Broadway," which completed 
filming earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A gritty period comedy about gangsters and showgirls in New York in the '20s, 
the picture features an ensemble cast that includes John Cusack, Debi Mazar, 
Chazz Palminteri, Mary-Louise Parker, Rob Reiner, Jennifer Tilly, Tracey 
Ullman, Dianne Wiest and Jim Broadbent. Allen, who directed but does not appear 
in the film, co-wrote the screenplay with Doug McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax, which acquired U.S. and Canadian distribution rights from the film's 
executive producer, Jean Doumanian, plans to release "Bullets" this fall. 
Doumanian, a longtime friend of Allen's and former "Saturday Night Live" 
producer who has a three-picture deal with the filmmaker, raised $20 million in 
foreign money to finance his film. Foreign rights on "Bullets" have not been 
sold, though Miramax is in discussions about possibly acquiring them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While Allen was shunned by Hollywood's movie community after his highly 
publicized courtroom war with Farrow last year, as well as his affair with her 
oldest adopted daughter, it's no surprise he would team with an unconventional 
company like the New York-based Miramax, which is in his own back yard and is 
run by the scrappy brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shunned by Hollywood means nothing to Miramax. We're talking about a comic 
genius," Harvey Weinstein said Thursday. "Chaplin was shunned by Hollywood; so 
were a great many other international filmmakers, including Fellini -- and 
those are the people who belong with Miramax." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein was enthusiastic about the film, describing it as "a very funny 
exploration of the friendship between a young playwright (Cusack) and young hit 
man (Palminteri)."  
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who is currently writing his next movie, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how the family image-sensitive Walt Disney Co., which now owns 
Miramax, might feel about associating with Allen (who before the scandal had 
starred in the studio's "Scenes From a Mall" and "New York Stories"), Weinstein 
said, "When we contacted Disney and told them, they were thrilled." Miramax 
operates autonomously in marketing and distributing its movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Miramax deal, Allen gets complete creative control over 
the marketing of his movie, which could make the new arrangement with Miramax 
interesting, since the Weinsteins are known for their marketing acumen and have 
always controlled the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doumanian, speaking by phone from Switzerland, said, "Harvey and Bob have been 
well advised that Woody has creative control over anything that has to do with 
marketing, but they are good salesmen so Woody will be very willing to listen 
to their input." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein added, "This is a very special movie and our mission is to give it 
the kind of success it deserves."  
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said Miramax hopes "Bullets" will be the first of many films Allen 
will make with the studio. "As we try to build our own United Artists (the 
onetime distributor of other Allen films), we view this relationship with Woody 
as the cornerstone of what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood -- which had long clamored to be in business with the iconoclastic 
Allen despite that his movies generally didn't make money -- distanced itself 
from the filmmaker last year when the public custody battle with longtime 
companion Farrow revealed intimate details of the former lovers' private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrow had accused Allen of sexual abuse of their adopted daughter, Dylan, and 
of destroying his relationship with his other children by having an affair with 
Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. No abuse charges were ever brought 
against Allen and Farrow was awarded custody of their three young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about Allen's future viability in Hollywood swirled last July when 
it was announced Allen's production deal with TriStar was ending prematurely 
with one picture still remaining on a three-picture deal. Allen directed two 
films for that studio; the second, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," grossed only 
$11.2 million domestically, and "Husbands and Wives," whose story line bore an 
eerie resemblance to some of the real-life drama between Allen and Farrow, a 
mere $10.5 million in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending his relationship with TriStar, Allen then signed a financing deal with 
Doumanian, who is also producer of Allen's upcoming ABC-TV movie "Don't Drink 
the Water," which stars Michael J. Fox. The expected air date is September for 
the teleplay, which Allen adapted from his 1966 stage play. It was first turned 
into a movie in 1969; it starred Jackie Gleason and Estelle Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 Doumanian, who has a three-picture deal with ABC, is also co-producing with 
Julian Schlossberg, a trio of one-act plays written by Allen, David Mamet and 
Elaine May, which will be mounted Off Broadway next year.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: THEY DESERVE MORE THAN A TIE FOR FATHER'S DAY; 
AMONG ALL THE TV DADS, THESE SHOULD BE SALUTED FOR GIVING LASTING LESSONS AND 
SOME WELCOME LAUGHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Father's Day arriving Sunday, it's appropriate to take note of some 
television dads who mattered, even if it was merely for being funny. There are 
oodles of the species, the corny along with the conventional. Here is one man's 
list of five: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sheriff Andy Taylor, "The Andy Griffith Show," 1960-68. Symbolically, at 
least, Andy occupied a paternal pedestal for the entire town of Mayberry. But 
the "Opie the Birdman" episode alone -- one of the more tender and charming 
half hours in decades of sitcomdom -- earns him a place on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 When little Opie (Ron Howard) accidentally kills a mother bird with his new 
slingshot, Andy doesn't give his son a whipping or even a tongue lashing. 
Instead he takes Opie upstairs to a window so that he can hear the orphaned 
chicks chirping for their dead mama. 
</P>
<P>
 Opie is small, but he's no brick. Getting the message about responsibility, he 
ends up raising the young birds himself. Once they've matured enough to be 
returned to the wild, however, Opie laments how empty his bird cage seems. Andy 
again comes through. "But," he tells his son, "don't the trees sound nice and 
full?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Anderson, "Father Knows Best," 1954-62. Exposure to reruns of this 
fantasy is a perfect antidote to the parade of dysfunctional, shouting, freaky 
families that go public on daytime talk shows with their infinite hatreds and 
pettiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Jim (Robert Young) didn't always know best. But as head of a highly 
functional household in Springfield whose problems were usually resolved with 
some kind of simple moral lesson by the end of the half hour, he did always 
know how to make things better. Yet he wasn't the kind of I-told-you-so, 
know-it-all preacher whom you could easily resent. Could he help it if he was 
blessed with superior male wisdom? 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion Jim could get frustrated or impatient, but only mildly so, and his 
anger -- such as it was -- never lingered. His most memorable quality was his 
relentless geniality. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was sage Jim always so unruffled? Because he was Robert Young, that's why. 
Whether in this series or as the all-knowing physician in "Marcus Welby, M.D.," 
Young projected calm and order. What a kick it would have been for him to have 
played a real-life father: murder victim Jose Menendez. Eric and Lyle rush in 
with their shotguns, and smiling Robert Young greets them with a cup of Maxwell 
House coffee. "Boys, why so irritable?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Homer Simpson, "The Simpsons," 1990-continuing. An anthropological 
aberration who was once mistaken for Big Foot in a national forest, Homer (the 
voice of Dan Castellaneta) not only never knows best, he never knows anything. 
Be assured that whatever advice he gives his kids, it will be the wrong advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fatherly role model. He's stupid and lazy, a human celery stalk, a TV 
zombie and doughnut-devouring slacker in his job at the pollution-spewing 
nuclear plant in Springfield (surely a different Springfield from the 
Andersons' pristine hamlet). He's a belching beer belly who lets nothing get in 
the way of his pursuit of the expedient. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bonus, he is insensitive to his wife, Marge (Julie Kavner), and kids. His 
genius daughter, Lisa (Yeardley Smith), is a sax-playing prodigy whose sweet 
wailing he regards as noise. And his communication with his son, Bart (Nancy 
Cartwright), goes something like this: "Why you little . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Why celebrate him as a father? Because, despite his flaws, Homer is 
essentially sweet natured, and because his dead brain has helped make "The 
Simpsons" one of the funniest comedies of the '90s. And, ironically, one of the 
smartest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Al Bundy, "Married . . . With Children," 1987-continuing. Al (Ed O'Neill) is 
Homer Simpson with guile and a higher (barely) IQ. "Married . . . With 
Children" was conceived as a counterpoint to traditional family sitcoms 
featuring parents, a couple of kids and a dog. It has taken those formulaic 
components and raunchily distorted them, making the son (David Faustino) a 
junior scam artist, the daughter (Christina Applegate) a brainless bimbo, the 
mother (Katey Sagal) a hair-teased soap-opera freak and the father a lewd, 
crude oaf who gets euphoric just thinking about escaping his family. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of parents are the Bundys? When Kelly and Bud bring home their 
school dental checkups, Peg and Al shine flashlights in their mouths and send 
them upstairs, saying, "We'll forge your dental records later." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bud turns 18, Al shows the proper attention as he sits down in front of 
the TV set: "Eighteen years old, huh? Son, there's so much I want to say to you 
. . . but there's a show coming on." 
</P>
<P>
 Peg wonders if Al will use this occasion to pass on fatherly wisdom to Bud -- 
like what to do when his "bellybutton, ear and rear end itch at the same time." 
But Al, who is lacking in a few parenting skills, has other plans for Bud. He 
takes him to a nudie bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a great father, but a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jack Arnold, "The Wonder Years," 1988-93. Compared to other dads on this 
list, Kevin Arnold's father is both underdeveloped and peripheral, in part 
because "The Wonder Years" was that rare series whose universe -- America in 
the 1960s and '70s -- was presented entirely through the eyes of a boy. Even 
so, Jack (Dan Lauria) was ever-present and sometimes was deployed as a catalyst 
to help Kevin (Fred Savage) better understand his parents and the rest of the 
world around him. 
</P>
<P>
 In one especially notable episode, young Kevin is exposed to a bracing reality 
of adulthood when he accompanies his often gruff, uncommunicative father to his 
white-collar job. While at the office, something unexpected happens. Kevin sees 
his dad get loudly chewed out by his boss, just the kind of humiliating 
experience that no father would want his son to witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet instead of diminishing his father in his eyes, the experience is a bonding 
exercise that gives Kevin empathy for his dad. Now he understands what his 
father endures to make a living for his family and why he is often in a rotten 
mood when he arrives home from work. 
</P>
<P>
 The son learns the lesson; the father -- by inadvertently exposing his 
vulnerability -- delivers it.

PIANIST'S STRONG MIND IS AGAIN JOINED BY A STRONG BODY; JAZZ: THE CHINESE 
MEDICAL ART OF CHI GONG GIVES JOANNE BRACKEEN THE STRENGTH FOR SUSTAINED 
PLAYING OF INTRICATE, ANGLED, HIGHLY EVOLVED MUSIC. SHE MAKES A RARE SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA APPEARANCE THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The spare New York loft of JoAnne Brackeen is dominated by two grand pianos, 
facing and tucked into each other, the melding of curves a happy if formidable 
yin/yang. But nearby, on her wood writing desk, is the image that telegraphs so 
much more: a photo of Brackeen at the keyboard, characteristically bent forward 
while summoning canyon-like walls of chords, with a strange fuzzy cloud of 
light hovering over her. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a defect in the print emulsion? An eerie accident of flash lighting? 
</P>
<P>
 "Energy. It's the energy," says Brackeen. "If you can see it, then you know 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything characterizes this protean jazz artist, who makes a rare 
appearance in town tonight and Saturday at the Jazz Bakery, it is her seemingly 
exhaustion-proof capacity for the sustained playing of intricate, angled, 
highly evolved music that often rides a nervous edge between atonal anarchy and 
lavish, unapologetic romanticism. A fair amount of energy is required of the 
listener, not to mention the practitioner, and so energy and its management 
take on a special role in the Brackeen conception. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'80s, Brackeen was poised to enjoy the central role in modern jazz 
music that musicians and critics often prognosticated for her: to be a dominant 
force in the evolution of jazz piano. She had served with distinction the 
apprenticeships reserved for those very few up-and-comers who show not only 
facility but imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Stan Getz, Joe Henderson -- each had in his band 
the woman whose playing complemented the band's sound yet whose solos at times 
edged toward space, the odd chord, the roiling 3-D knit of new sounds. 
Brackeen, in the late 1970s, would go her own way, be her own force. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1980s, she'd achieved considerable artistic success as both 
composer and recording artist, notably with her 1981 LP "Special Identity," 
featuring Eddie Gomez on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums. She would, however, 
find herself struggling to find an identity as a band leader who might find 
easy booking at New York's hallowed but male-dominated jazz clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But her music expanded further in both solo and trio formats, and her sound 
became ever-singular. Critics struggled for modifiers of comparison. While 
McCoy Tyner's name serially appeared to account for her thunder and Bill Evans' 
legacy arose as compass to her tender side, it was clear that the only workable 
references would be spiritual and bear no similarity in style or content: 
Ornette Coleman for his freedom, his spaciousness, his daring; Cecil 
"What's-He-Doing?" Taylor for just that mysterious quality. 
</P>
<P>
 In being true to her idiosyncratic vision, however, Brackeen eluded many who 
classify and promote music. By 1987, Brackeen had become not a household name 
but one of jazz's inside players, lost on the mass audience but winning 
critical notice and passionate listeners willing to summon the energy to meet 
her on her own ground. If she wasn't at the Village Vanguard, she was nearby at 
Bradleys, the premier piano-bass room in America, happily exploring the outer 
limits of duo playing with the formidable bassist Cecil McBee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brackeen constellation also was undergoing a far worse threat than 
that posed by a fickle jazz marketplace. Her energy -- the very source of her 
complex, demanding art -- was threatened. In 1987 she was experiencing deep 
bouts of fatigue and, in her arms, pain and muscle failure -- symptoms she 
prefers not to name medically but refers to as "problems we all have at some 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she met the man who would help her find the cloud of light in the 
picture, help her commence what has since -- through the release last month of 
"Take a Chance," her latest CD -- been the most fecund period of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brackeen appeared recently at the University of Hawaii to perform and deliver 
a lecture titled "Jazz, Chi Gong and I." In the audience was Dr. Chu Chow, 
Brackeen's Toronto-based master of Chi Gong, an ancient Chinese medical 
practice that seeks to establish balance between one's output of physical 
energy and one's capacity to receive, or renew, it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow, says Brackeen, "changed everything. He teaches me, and Chi Gong has 
given me my life back." 
</P>
<P>
 It has also given Chow a tune in his name, a conceptual piece written and 
recorded by Brackeen in 1989 on what would become a landmark effort: the first 
of Concord's CD series of solo piano performances at Berkeley's Maybeck Recital 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Gong is a Tao-rooted system of animal-like body movements. Its name 
translates to "working with chi," or working with life-force energy. The 
exercises are designed to awaken natural fields of energy throughout the body. 
In Brackeen it has erased pain, bolstered energy and reinforced the notion that 
creativity is connected to the body as much as the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Brackeen gives at least two hours a day to her Chi Gong regimen but also notes 
that "you can live your whole day within it." The result, she says, is a 
continuous restoration of energy for someone who "puts out enormous amounts of 
energy" performing, writing, teaching and touring. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Brackeen's music, though, Chi Gong can challenge sensibility, and 
Brackeen's use of it as a life and art battery charge may be singular. Pianist 
Marian McPartland was introduced to Chi Gong by Brackeen but found it elusive. 
"I can't go with it," McPartland says, "and (JoAnne) knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 McPartland, however, is accustomed to challenge from her friend Brackeen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anybody like JoAnne," McPartland says. "She has wild 
ideas, and she's not afraid to try them. She'll lay out the melodic line, such 
as it is, and right away I'll think: 'What the hell is she doing?' Then, she'll 
improvise, with variations on chords that, it seems, shouldn't work. But it 
always sounds right. If I tried it, I'd be in a pickle." 
</P>
<P>
 Making unlikely things sound right, of course, is at the heart of 
improvisation. And improvising is a peculiar deed. It involves so many things: 
playing in real time with band members, hearing those band members and choosing 
yet simultaneously playing notes that "sound right" against the band's sonic 
backdrop and coalesce into a distinct statement, or solo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a subject that has pushed a professorial Wynton Marsalis to ponder 
consciousness and an incisive McPartland to differentiate between moments of 
"making choices" and moments of playing by "impulse." 
</P>
<P>
 Brackeen, ever the iconoclast, will have no such talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you eat your lunch," she says, "your stomach is working and doing 
things, your blood is moving all around, but all you know is the taste. Music 
is like that. All I know is the taste. I don't know about descriptions. 
Descriptions are at odds with facing the pure energy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy. Brackeen pauses a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Picasso had time to go into descriptions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brackeen, like Picasso, broke convention, and she always likely will. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura native refused to practice piano lessons as a child because, she 
says, "they were boring." But she did take from those lessons the ability to 
read "lines and spaces," all the notation she needed to teach herself facility 
on the instrument in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 She started gigging at age 11 at private parties. At 17 she won a scholarship 
to the Los Angeles Conservatory but dropped out in days because "they had names 
for stuff I considered very obvious." Then it was headlong into jazz, with work 
in L.A. in the late 1950s with Charles Lloyd, Dexter Gordon, Harold Land. In 
time she would show the daunting fluency that allows her to scoff at the 
mechanics of improvisation, a gift succinctly stated by McPartland: "She has 
the technical ability to play what she thinks." 
</P>
<P>
 More than most, however, Brackeen's career is marked by one constant, jazz's 
most important ingredient: change. Her newly released CD is a jazz 
appropriation of Brazilian music -- a taste she first developed playing with 
Getz and later made her own in her bristling 1991 CD, "Breath of Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 The new CD, featuring longtime associate Eddie Gomez on bass, drummer Duduka 
da Fonseca and percussionist Waltinho Anastacio, brings an especially supple, 
elegant contour to the genre while managing to clearly communicate that 
spacious, alternately dissonant and romantic, Brackeen voice. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has the most apt title in her discography: "Take a Chance." 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much all JoAnne Brackeen does at the keyboard anyway, pretty 
much her only choice under that cloud of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brackeen appears in solo performance today and Saturday at the Jazz Bakery, 
3221 Hutchison Ave., Culver City, (310) 271-9039.

'KID SCIENCE' SHOWS NO LONGER A CURIOSITY; TELEVISION: SERIES PROLIFERATE AS A 
RESULT OF A BIG PUSH ACROSS AMERICA TO UPGRADE STUDENT AWARENESS OF SCIENTIFIC 
PHENOMENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With his groomed beard and two-piece suit, David Heil doesn't look like the 
comic stereotype of the lab-coat-clad mad scientist -- maybe because he is a 
scientist as well as host of the long-running PBS show "Newton's Apple." 
</P>
<P>
 Please, he says, no lab coats, no mad science. 
</P>
<P>
 With his fright wig and fluorescent-green lab coat, Paul Zaloom, a "Seinfeld" 
Kramer look-alike, does fit the comic stereotype -- maybe because he's a 
performance artist, not a scientist, except when he plays one on CBS' 
"Beakman's World." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's "Bill Nye the Science Guy," more mod than mad scientist, from 
Disney. The engineering graduate and stand-up comedian looks like someone's 
image of a proper science graduate in pastel lab coat, bow tie and messages 
about "cool science." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What "Nova" has done to heighten science awareness for one generation, 
"Newton's Apple" and a batch of newcomers is doing for a younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the "Misfits of Science" 10 years ago has so much so-called science 
flashed before viewers' eyes as during this past television season, with three 
"kid science" shows -- all of which have been renewed for next season. Add the 
reruns of the redoubtable "Mr. Wizard" on Nickelodeon and there's enough 
science on TV for any Junior Achievement dropout. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Newton's" Heil, who is also associate director of the Oregon Museum of 
Science and Industry, this global-like warming to science shows seems to be 
part of a national change of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big push across the nation for science education," Heil says. 
"There's major funding for new curricula, textbooks, a big push in teacher 
training. There's new federal money going into math, science and technology 
programs. Private companies are becoming more involved in public schools. The 
coming world of 500-channel television is stimulating people's curiosity in 
science and technology. And that's what we do in 'Newton's Apple': We deal in 
curiosity, what's on our viewer's minds, how do things work." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than curiosity has served as the catalyst for these shows. Since the 
Children's Television Act of 1990, commercial broadcasters have been required 
to provide children's programming that is educational. Among the many programs 
it spawned were:  
</P>
<P>
 * "Beakman's World," a frenetic approach to show and tell, with viewer 
questions used as the basis for the half hour. Originally a syndicated 
offering, "Beakman" was lured to CBS last fall. Target: "all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bill Nye the Science Guy," from public broadcaster KCTS in Seattle. The 
stylized show has earned some National Science Federation support along with 
the marketing skills of Disney's Buena Vista Television group in syndicating 
the show nationally. Target: fourth graders and up. (Next season "Nye" will be 
shown both in syndication and on PBS.) 
</P>

 Heil, preparing for "Newton's" 12th season, takes a dispassionately scientific 
approach to the new arrivals. "The more children and adults develop an interest 
in science through these new television shows," he says, "the more they will 
want to see us. We planted the seeds. We'll see the growth in our audience."

 His audience numbers more than 1 million viewers, one-third of whom are school 
age, Heil says. "It's more a family science show," he says. "We have a broader 
niche, designed for people who learned to hate science. So the level we are 
working at is about where a lot of people got turned off to science, and that's 
at the junior high school level."

 That may explain the introduction to the show of a segment called "Science of 
the Rich and Famous," with musician Ted Nugent explaining amplified guitar 
feedback, Crystal Gayle talking about hair, Monty Hall dealing in probability, 
Shelley Duvall looking at reflecting surfaces, the Smothers Brothers explaining 
the aerodynamics of yo-yos and Michael York acting out stage fright. Even Robin 
Leach has shown up with a treatise on jet lag.

 The scientific values of celebrities aren't lost on the Disney show, of 
course. Bill Nye has enlisted Willard Scott to talk about weather, Sinbad to 
examine the cardiac system and Siskel and Ebert to comment on the vision thing.

 "One of the big movements in education," Heil says, "is called experiential 
learning. It's a constructivist, hands-on learning theory, a fancy term for 
learning through experience. 'Newton's Apple' tries to do that with me as the 
learner. It's a switch because I thought I would be teaching in a classroom of 
a million people when I came on the show. But here I'm the one who asks the 
naive questions to satisfy my curiosity." 
</P>

 For his curiosity, Heil has gone on a glacial expedition, windsurfed and 
experienced virtual reality, among other out-of-studio exploits.

 The pioneering science show, produced in St. Paul, Minn., through an annual 
$1.2-million grant from 3M that reaches through the 1995-96 season, is looking 
for new territories for its scientific messages. The show's producers plan to 
sell laser discs of past shows to schools and CD-ROM discs for home computer 
users. There's also a plan to go on-line with a computer network.

<P>
 Promotion and marketing are vital side ventures to most of the family science 
shows.

 "Newton's Apple" produces a number of teaching guides that go into schools, 
coordinated with themes presented on the programs. Disney has sent 50,000 "Bill 
Nye" science kits to schools, issued guides to teachers, sent out postcards to 
principals promoting the show and issued its own book, "Bill Nye the Science 
Guy's Big Blast of Science."

 But so far, no lab coats.

 NBC disclaimer -- A story in Wednesday's Calendar said that there was no 
disclaimer on an NBC January special, "Treasure Island: The Adventures 
Continues," to indicate that the program was a paid advertisement for the 
Treasure Island resort in Las Vegas. But NBC officials said there was a label 
at the end of the special that noted that the show had been paid for by the 
resort's owners.
