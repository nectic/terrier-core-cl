STOP ATTACKING EASY TARGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One new welfare reform idea floating around Washington is ridiculous. It would 
deny government benefits to many poor, elderly, non-citizen but legal 
immigrants in order to finance welfare reform for poor Americans. California 
can't be saddled with additional costs over which it has no control. That would 
be grossly unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants are an easy target in Congress. They can't vote: Though they can 
legally live and work in this country, resident aliens (the technical term 
under U.S. immigration law) can't vote until they become citizens. And in most 
states their numbers are small. That's not the case in California, where as 
many as 40% of the resident aliens live. They would lose federal Supplemental 
Security Income checks, food stamps and other benefits, and, if they do, 
California will pay in major ways.  
</P>
<P>
 A modest change being proposed by the Clinton Administration would require 
them to live here five years, instead of three, before they qualified 
individually for SSI benefits. That cut would save from $2.7 billion to $6.8 
billion per year. Some elderly or disabled immigrants could turn to their 
families; others would turn to the state. However, a bipartisan welfare reform 
bill introduced this week by two Midwestern senators, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and 
Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), would cut deeper. It would count the income of the 
family member who sponsored the newcomer's admission to the United States to 
determine eligibility for SSI, Medicaid, food stamps and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 A House Republican welfare-reform bill would do even greater damage. It would 
deny access to all means-tested social welfare programs for most non-citizen 
immigrants. This is extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress debates how to pay for welfare reform, the leadership of the 
California delegation and other fair-minded members must hold the line on what 
the federal government is obligated to provide for legal, permanent residents. 
They must take care that California is not savagely punished.

OPERA REVIEW; MIXED BLESSINGS IN MOZARTIAN MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some performances at the Music Center Opera soar. Others sag. As run by Peter 
Hemmings in a world compromised by fiscal uncertainty, the company certainly 
has its ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Le Nozze di Figaro" -- brilliantly conceived by Peter Hall and sensitively 
performed by an enlightened ensemble in 1990 -- could be counted among the ups. 
Everyone loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The production represented an uncommonly happy marriage of music and drama, an 
uncommonly intelligent response to the complementary needs of Mozart and his 
librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte, not to mention those of their theatrical source 
and political ally, Beaumarchais. This "Figaro" was a serious comedy of eros 
that allowed no room for intrusive gimmickry, no place for tired cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night it was back at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, where quick and 
frequent revivals are becoming a convenient if potentially lazy way of life. 
But there were drastic differences this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pit, the baton had passed from Lawrence Foster to Markus Stenz. Most of 
the principals were new. Not all the changes were for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 The most crucial, and most damaging change, perhaps, involved the conductor. 
Stenz, who was undertaking his first "Figaro," is a useful guide through the 
thickets of modernism. Anyone who has witnessed his pioneering work on behalf 
of Hans Werner Henze knows that. But Henze isn't Mozart, and Mozart seems to 
bewilder the young German maestro. Perhaps he doesn't go for baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 His tempos on Tuesday were, to say the least, erratic. The fast pieces tended 
toward sluggishness. The relatively slow ones zipped along as if sentiment were 
a dirty word (it is difficult to imagine "Voi che sapete" less alluring, "Che 
soave zeffiretto" less languid or "Deh vieni non tardar" less reflective). The 
recitatives -- particularly important in a production that stresses 
conversational fluidity -- tended to drag, and the exaggerated Luftpausen 
hardly enhanced narrative continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stenz inspired some very pretty playing from the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra, it could not be claimed that he accompanied the singers with much 
sympathy, or that he paid much attention to matters of dramatic impetus or 
stylistic consistency. Appoggiaturas came and went, mostly went. The high Cs 
that cap the second-act terzetto were allotted to Susanna, not, as Mozart 
intended, to the Countess. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist on the stage -- the Figaro -- took the trouble to add some 
fascinating period embellishment. The rest might just as well have been singing 
Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance, as in '90, was blissfully complete. It lasted 3 3/4 hours 
with, thank goodness, only one intermission instead of three. As paced by 
Stenz, however, it seemed dangerously long. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one had to be doubly grateful for Hall's elegantly 
earnest staging scheme, again re-created -- and this time somewhat broadened -- 
by Stephen Lawless. One also could take comfort in the lavish, warmly realistic 
decors of John Bury, even though they were designed for the smaller stage of 
the Chicago Lyric Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The major holdover in the uneven cast was Thomas Allen, the intrinsically 
aristocratic, suavely lecherous, magnificently befuddled Almaviva. This time, 
unfortunately, histrionic pluses were diminished by vocal minuses, possibly the 
result of a respiratory problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Solveig Kringelborn complemented him as an extraordinarily youthful, radiant, 
eminently seductive Rosina. The fact that the Norwegian soprano, undertaking 
this complex role for the first time, happened to be seven months pregnant 
added a few unintended wrinkles to the dramatic intrigue (previews of "La mere 
coupable"?). Sympathetic observers gasped when she accidentally tripped and 
fell during an exit. Luckily, both prima donna and Contessa turned out to be 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Finley, a promising lyric-baritone from Canada, introduced a sly, 
wide-eyed, strikingly stylish Figaro opposite a smart and winsome new Susanna, 
Elzbieta Szmytka. Replacing Angela Maria Blasi, the tiny Polish soprano 
vacillated between sweetness and squeakiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Rasmussen, a tall and gangly novice Cherubino, could hardly efface 
memories of her definitive predecessor, Frederica von Stade. (Who could?) But 
she held her own nicely, especially in a plush "Non so piu, cosa son, cosa 
faccio," never flinching from the bold priapic maneuvers invented by the stage 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gallup returned as an amiably crusty Don Bartolo, in tandem with 
Suzanna Guzman's poignantly giddy Marcellina. Jonathan Mack repeated his 
bravura Basilio, and secondary roles were in the appreciative hands and 
larynxes of Diana Tash (Barbarina), Mallory Walker (Curzio) and John Atkins 
(Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Rizzo's model supertitles matched the vocal lines perfectly. And 
someone had the good sense to turn them off at the Count's plea for 
forgiveness. For once, the pathos of this climactic moment was not contradicted 
by laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Le Nozze di Figaro" presented by the Music Center Opera at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. Also Saturday at 1 p.m., April 18 and 20 at 7:30 p.m., April 
23 at 1 p.m. and April 25 (Richard Bernstein replacing Finley) at 7:30 p.m.

MAN OF MANY FACES; PHOTOGRAPHY: THROUGH 70 YEARS AND A MILLION PICTURES, ALFRED 
EISENSTAEDT HAS CAPTURED THE CELEBRATED AND THE NOT-SO-FAMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The images, and the memories, are as sharp as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt is 95 years old and has taken a million 
pictures in his 70-year career. Age must be served, so now he shoots only 
rarely -- like his family portraits of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 He is unsure where the once-grand art of photojournalism is going, but he is 
proud to have been part, some say the progenitor, of its glorious past, as one 
of the original photographers for Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at the top of the world," he said. "We educated people." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenstaedt is still educating people, now with a traveling exhibition, "95 
for 95," which is at the Circle Gallery in San Diego's historic Old Town 
district through May 1. He made a rare trip out of New York for the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him about his life's work, and he remembers the faces. Then again how 
could you forget those faces once they've been shot Eisenstaedt-style, crisp, 
up-close and intimate? 
</P>
<P>
 He counts among his subjects many of the great and the celebrated: George 
Bernard Shaw, Katharine Hepburn (during the filming of "Philadelphia Story"), a 
young Bette Davis, an even younger Clark Gable, President and Mrs. Kennedy, T. 
S. Eliot, Churchill, Hitler and Mussolini, Nixon and Haldemann, Bernstein 
conducting, Thomas Hart Benton painting, Truman walking, Catholic scholar 
Martin Cyril D'Arcy, Haile Selaisse and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bertrand Russell had a fantastic face," Eisenstaedt said. "I told him, 'Mr. 
Russell, I've never seen such a stony face like you have.' He said to me, 'A 
crocodile moves very slowly.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are pictures where the faces are less important than the emotions. 
On VJ Day, Eisenstaedt was sent to Times Square, where he captured the joy of 
an America suddenly liberated from war: A sailor bending a nurse over backward 
in a kiss of exultation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, men still come up to Eisenstaedt and claim to have been the 
sailor in the picture (which is among those in the Circle Gallery exhibition). 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have had 50 men over the years tell me that is them in the picture," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He has bad memories of only two subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Britain's Prince Philip. Eisenstaedt accompanied him on a journey to 
the Arctic Circle for a Life cover. Eight days the little band pushed on and 
the royal one never deigned to talk to anyone beneath his station. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bad to everybody anyway," Eisenstaedt said. "The German photographers 
said they flashed at him all the time without film in the camera, just to anger 
him. He never spoke to any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also Hemingway. In a story that is now legend, Eisenstaedt was 
photographing Hemingway in a deep-sea fishing contest off Cuba soon after "The 
Old Man and the Sea" was published. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer's chase boat came too close, and Hemingway, as he had 
threatened to do, fired some shots in its direction. 
</P>
<P>
 A scary incident but thoroughly in character for Hemingway, Eisenstaedt said. 
"When you talk to Hemingway, you have to think before you say anything. 
Anything you say is wrong. Everything is wrong. A very difficult man." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad times, though, are minuscule compared to the good ones. Like 
"clicking" with Sophia Loren, whom he photographed several times, including 
posing her in a sexy costume that caused a flurry of Life cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several years later a reporter asked her, 'Why do you click with 
Eisenstaedt?' " he said. "She told him, 'Because he reminds me very much of my 
obstetrician.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sent to Hollywood in 1953 to photograph a story about a Southern California 
building boom, Eisenstaedt was redirected to shoot an aspiring sex goddess. He 
met Marilyn Monroe without the presence of press agents or image polishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was alone," Eisenstaedt said. "Today it would be impossible to do that. 
She wrote in my book, 'To Alfred, You made a palace out of my patio.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his age, the photographer is not going quietly into the good night. 
When a gallery curator asks how he is feeling, Eisenstaedt responds that he is 
still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 95 years old, but my brain always says I'm 30 years old, maybe 20," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 He has photographed in color (like his JFK portrait) but prefers black and 
white. Color is timely, but black and white is timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love color but exhibitions, in my mind, look good only in black and white," 
he said. "Except for a few color portraits, nobody is interested. Color is good 
for fashion and flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 His rules for photographers are simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrive on time ("I'm always early. When I say I have to be there at 9, I'm 
there at 8:30"), be neither servile nor hostile to your subject. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, there is rule No. 1: Remember to have film in the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 He admits shooting blanks on occasion. He shot Einstein and Oppenheimer in 
spirited discussion at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton and then 
realized his Leica was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily the two geniuses didn't notice his panic. "I sneaked out, they didn't 
even know," Eisenstaedt remembered.  
</P>
<P>
 He photographed (or so he thought) President Ford at a bicentennial 
celebration in Philadelphia but was sans film. When he tried to return to 
re-shoot, the Secret Service was instantly suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to let me back in," Eisenstaedt said. He persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 He always persisted and he always worked alone. It allowed him to be on time 
for 2,500 assignments for Life. "I work alone and without an assistant," he 
said. "Assistants are always late."

CLUB REVIEW; LETHARGIC NEW AGERS SHOULD FEEL AT HOME AT LIVING PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sign above the doorway to Living Planet reads, "No Smoking Please," and 
when you enter the Long Beach cafe you might feel as if you've boarded the 
Biosphere. The air, aided by lush foliage and discreet incense burners, smells 
so fresh it's almost suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a smoke-free coffeehouse is normally a contradiction in terms, this 
place still manages to feel stuffy. Beavis and Butt-head would have a field day 
making fun of its consciously PC atmosphere -- complete with generous "Practice 
Nonviolence" signage and books offering composting tips. The Sunday night "Drum 
Circle" -- bring your own congas -- cements the image.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent performance by L.A.-based singer-songwriter Jason Luckett (who 
performs at Living Planet every other Saturday, with the next date set for 
April 24) brought a real burst of energy to the surrealistically lethargic 
venue. Backed by the impromptu chirping of Living Planet's caged button quails, 
Luckett's literate love songs and hypnotic essays on growing up multiracial can 
make a visit to the Living Planet well worthwhile. Luckett, who performed 
barefoot, also may have inadvertently inspired a future sign for Living 
Planet's walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna make a rule," said one of the proprietors after Luckett's set. 
"No shoes allowed." Don't assume that he was kidding.

MOVIE REVIEW; 32 PASSIONATE VARIATIONS ON A LEGENDARY PIANIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything that is distinctive and irresistible about "Thirty Two Short Films 
About Glenn Gould" -- its audacity, its nervy playfulness, how smart and 
confident a motion picture it is -- comes through from its first scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a deceptive episode, simple yet exhilarating. The camera is motionless, 
fixed on a frozen landscape, dazzling and empty. Then a figure appears at the 
far distance, walking toward us but taking his own time about it. The closer he 
gets, and it takes nearly two minutes (an eternity in film terms) for him to 
arrive, the more aware we become of the rising music in the background, the 
liquid, intoxicating piano playing of the man himself, Glenn Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 A consummate musician who shocked the concert world by abandoning live 
performance for recordings when he was only 32 and who'd given layers of new 
meanings to the concept of the eccentric virtuoso by the time he died from a 
stroke at age 50 in 1982, Gould was too original a figure to fit into a 
conventional filmed bio, and Canadian director Francois Girard, who co-wrote 
the screenplay with Don McKellar, has not even attempted to give him one. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Girard has orchestrated (and that really does seem to be the best 
word) a film infused with its subject's singular spirit. A window into what it 
might be like to be a genius that is as off-center and uncompromising as the 
man himself, this is that rare piece of work that not only knows exactly what 
it wants to do but also just how to go about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is to assemble a portrait of Gould as if it were a mosaic, 
combining unrelated facets of his life, personality and career. That there are 
32 of these is a nod to Bach's Goldberg Variations, Gould's debut recording and 
the music behind that opening scene. The episodes range in length from less 
than a minute to more than 10, each one self-contained and carefully set off 
from the others with its own on-screen title. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds schematic, the reality is the opposite. For after "Lake 
Simcoe," which straightforwardly deals with Gould's sheltered youth as a 
prodigy sure of his future by age 5, the filmmakers have been quite thoughtful 
about the points they want to make about Gould and lively and inventive in how 
they've illustrated them. 
</P>
<P>
 To indicate his interests outside of music, for instance, there is a sly comic 
sequence called "The Tip" showing Gould manipulating the stock market, plus an 
excerpt from "The Idea of North," a dizzying sound collage documentary made for 
radio. To show how others felt about him and his numerous peculiarities, 
real-life friends are interviewed, while actors playing journalists demonstrate 
the kind of inanities the man who treasured solitude had to put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 First and finally, though, there is always the music, the center of Gould's 
life. His hypnotic playing of everything from Bach to Schoenberg hovers in the 
background of about three-quarters of the sequences, and the film casually 
utilizes an impressive variety of ways to convey the music in visual terms, 
most memorably in "CD 318," where we are taken inside Gould's favorite 
instrument to see exactly how its sounds are made. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the showcasing of the passion with which Gould approached music that 
"Thirty Two Short Films" surpasses itself. In sequences like "Hamburg," where 
the pianist, loping around a hotel room like Groucho Marx, insists that a 
chamber maid share his pleasure in his latest recording, to "Passion According 
to Gould," where he goes into a pure trance at the caress of his own music, the 
often-cliched joy of creation has rarely been so well and beautifully put on 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For a film this ambitious to be successful, the execution must match the 
ideas, and it does. Alain Dostie's measured, eloquent camera work provides 
crystalline images that are often hypnotic, and the Girard-McKellar script, 
which makes extensive use of ironic voice-over adapted from Gould's own words, 
conveys the wry and acerbic sensibility of a man who felt "the ideal 
audience-to-artist relationship is a one-to-zero relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every actor can pull off a character like Gould, simultaneously 
self-assured and erratic, and "Thirty Two Short Films" would be difficult to 
imagine without Colm Feore, a mainstay of Canada's Stratford Shakespeare 
Festival, in the title role. In addition to a confident and insinuating voice, 
Feore has the passionate spirit essential to playing Gould, a spectral wraith 
as transfixed by the sounds he created as the actor is by the opportunity to 
convey that obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the great thing about "Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould" 
is that rather than creating a desire to meet this formidable individual, it 
makes you feel as if in some way you actually had. "Gould was inexplicably 
gifted," biographer Otto Friedrich wrote, "with a phenomenal natural talent for 
playing the piano." Exactly what that means is what this film is so marvelous 
at conveying.

MOVIE REVIEW; SOME TELLTALE SIGNS IN 'THE WONDERFUL HORRIBLE LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What did she know and when did she know it? That this question, with its 
overtones of criminal suspicion, turns out to be a central concern of "The 
Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl" is an indication of why the career 
of this most controversial of film directors makes such a potent and engrossing 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Riefenstahl was a documentary filmmaker herself, as artistic and creative a 
figure as ever worked in the medium. But her truncated career will always have 
an asterisk next to it, because her two greatest films were made under the 
generous patronage of the Nazi Party and her personal friend Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Triumph of the Will," a celebration of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in 
Nuremberg, and "Olympia," a epochal look at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, are 
indisputably masterpieces, evidence of extraordinary visual and organizational 
gifts. Yet, also indisputably, they happened to be made to trumpet the virtues 
of an unspeakable regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the obvious questions about artistic responsibility in a totalitarian 
society that much more complex is the strong personality of the director 
herself. Still a pariah in Germany, Riefenstahl remains remarkably vibrant in 
her 90s, improbably going from friendship with Hitler to membership in 
Greenpeace. Assertive and persuasive, Riefenstahl is, paradoxically, a life 
force who ended up on the side of death. 
</P>
<P>
 German writer-director Ray Muller's aim with "The Wonderful Horrible Life" was 
to view Riefenstahl, "a legend with many faces, loathed and admired," as much 
as possible without preconceptions, to make a film that would continue the 
debate, not end it. The result, three hours long and filled to capacity with 
extensive clips, newsreel footage and both staged and candid interviews, is 
prodigiously researched, always fascinating, and completely successful. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a life with a reverse fairy tale quality to it, starting out with 
success and luck and ending with the opposite. A dancer who worked for famed 
producer Max Reinhardt, Riefenstahl had her life changed in 1924 when she was 
literally transfixed by a poster for a silent film she saw by chance in a 
subway station. 
</P>
<P>
 The film "Mountain of Destiny," directed by Dr. Arnold Fanck, was the first of 
a genre that came to be known as Bergfilms , tales of Alpine derring-do that 
featured actual locations and real-life climbing. Riefenstahl talked her way 
into Fanck's next film, became a star, and eventually directed herself in 
1932's eerie "The Blue Light." 
</P>
<P>
 Her association with Hitler began equally accidentally after a friend dragged 
her to a rally. She was intrigued, wrote him a letter, and found that he was a 
fan. As a real-life heroic superwoman who had become an expert mountaineer, 
Riefenstahl embodied the ideology Hitler was exploiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning from her largely unseen first attempt, "Victory of the Faith," a 
record of the 1933 party congress of which only a fragment remains, Riefenstahl 
in "Triumph of the Will" pumped up the dramatic intensity to make what is 
generally considered the most riveting propaganda film ever. Though she says 
today she's not proud of it, her eyes do gleam as she screens key segments. 
</P>
<P>
 Riefenstahl next embarked on a filmed record of the Olympics. Using 30 
cameramen, the director shot 250 miles of film, so much it took 10 weeks just 
to watch and two full years to edit. The result not only pioneered almost all 
the techniques used in current sports filming, but in a way that has never been 
bettered. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuasiveness itself, Riefenstahl is not at a loss for explanations for 
almost everything thrown at her. Art and politics don't mix, she insists, she 
never thought about ideology, never knew about any of the regime's numerous 
atrocities until after the war.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even more intriguing than these formal interviews, where Riefenstahl is on her 
best behavior, are candid glimpses when she seems to be unaware of being 
filmed. Here we see Riefenstahl's indomitable will, insisting where the camera 
must go. And, chatting with some former cameramen, we see what appears to be 
genuine puzzlement about Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her legendary determination, however, couldn't help her after the war, 
when she was detained by the Allies for pro-Nazi activities, charges later 
reduced to being "a sympathizer." She had something of a public renaissance in 
the 1970s with still photographs of the Nuba tribe in southern Sudan, and then 
moved on to her current underwater work. 
</P>
<P>
 True to his word, Mueller doesn't take sides, but the feeling is inescapable 
that Riefenstahl's blindness was self-inflicted, the willful looking the other 
way of someone who had powerful reasons to wish all the bad things would simply 
disappear. By the time she insists to Muller, "What do I have to regret, where 
does my guilt lie?" the answer is more obvious than she wants to admit.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TALL WOMEN': REVISITING AN ALBEE GEM; THIS REVIEW OF EDWARD 
ALBEE'S PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING "THREE TALL WOMEN" WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED WHEN 
THE PLAY OPENED IN MID-FEBRUARY. THE PLAY HAS JUST REOPENED AT THE PROMENADE 
THEATER OFF-BROADWAY.

 If there is a statute of limitations on dramatic exile -- a time to stop 
measuring Edward Albee against the man who wrote "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?" 32 years ago -- this must be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three Tall Women," which opened in an unflinching production at the intimate 
Vineyard Theater, is a devastating look at a certain kind of woman's life to 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 As uncompromising as the intellectual terrorism of his earliest successes, 
this new one -- with the splendid Myra Carter as emotional centerpiece -- 
should be irresistible to audiences with a weakness for smart old women, to 
those of us who cannot see a shriveling female form without yearning to know 
the stories disappearing with her. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the territory seems to be Albee-allegory country. The three women 
arranged around the wealthy suburban bedroom are identified in the program, 
ominously, as A, B and C. Fears of generic symbolism, however, could not be 
further from the vivid specificity of the truths. These women -- who are and 
who are not a single pampered widow -- live in a stylistic combination of 
intense realism and shared internal monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a hopeful young woman solidify into a formidable matron, then into a 
suspicious 92-year-old -- and end up an unforgiving, unmoving thing with an 
oxygen mask on a bed? As Albee tells it, the journey is as disturbing as it is 
engrossing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first act, the callow young woman (Jordan Baker) has come as an 
inquisitor from the old woman's lawyer. The matron (Marian Seldes, folded over 
like a buzzard on a rock) is the resentful, yet respectful nurse, cleaning up 
the indignities of the aged. The second act ties the women together in a moving 
story of the loneliness of satisfactory lives, of surviving and settling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Sacharow, who recently directed the American premiere of this play at 
his River Arts Repertory in Woodstock, N.Y., has staged it with simplicity and 
nuance. The triumph, however, is Carter, who also created the role in Vienna 
(where it had its world premiere in 1991). What a performance this is, a 
nonstop cadenza of mood swings, filled with the pride, cruelty, sorrow and 
playfulness of a difficult but worthy woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, powdered in pink and decorated with jewelry and sobbing in 
frustration, delivers a stream-of-consciousness ramble that, in less than two 
hours, becomes one of the great psychological portraits of the life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Albee, who fled to regional theaters and Europe after the Broadway dismissal 
of "The Man Who Had Three Arms" in 1983, has been writing all along. When his 
early one-act plays were published in 1960, he wrote in the preface that he was 
"just at the beginning of what I hope will be a long and satisfying life in the 
theater." It's time -- long past time -- that he lived it here.

NEWS BITES : NO CHIANTI THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF MONSOON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The year 1992 looked good in the Chianti wine country -- until torrential 
rains began Sept. 5 and continued six weeks without much letup.Only a small 
percentage of the grapes could be harvested, and not all of them proved usable, 
owing to rot. As a measure of the disaster, the famous wine house Tenute 
Marchesi Antinori isn't selling a single Chianti of that year. The only 1992 
red wine released from Antinori's Chianti property will be the modestly priced 
Santa Cristina, a vina da tavola that is made just like Chianti but sells for 
$7 or less. DAN BERGER

 Baskin-Robbins celebrates the tax-paying season with a flavor of the month 
dedicated to President Clinton: Cinnamon Almond Tax Crunch, featuring 
cinnamon-coated almonds (his favorite snack food) and a sweet cinnamon ribbon. 
Putting its ice cream where its mouth is, Baskin-Robbins will distribute free 
samples from noon to 1 p.m., 6-7 p.m. and 11 p.m.-midnight April 15 at Terminal 
Annex Post Office, 900 N. Alameda, Los Angeles. (an address you last-minute 
filers all know). The Milky Whey 
</P>
<P>
 Every once in a while a milk substitute comes along, usually based on soy or 
rice, for people who can't drink milk. For that purpose they're OK, but unlike 
them, the latest, Nature's Select, truly tastes like milk (well, skim milk). 
The secret: It is milk -- or rather the whey portion of milk, meaning that it 
lacks casein, the usual source of lactose intolerance. Sunflower oil replaces 
butterfat, but it still has only two grams of fat per serving, as well as being 
higher in protein than other milk substitutes (even 20% higher in protein than 
milk itself). It comes in powdered form, and there's a chocolate-flavored 
version too. Order direct from (800) 748-8288. Our Foodie President

 About 7,000 people a day come to Yokohama, Japan, to wait up to two hours so 
they can eat ramen (noodle soup) -- something you can get on just about any 
corner in Japan. Why? The historical thrill of slurping it up at Yokohama's 
noodle museum, which features ramen paraphernalia from the '50s and even a 
photo of the first ramen restaurant, ca. 1901. CHARLES PERRY

 Courtney Sales Ross doesn't feed any smelly canned pet food to her menagerie.A 
recent issue of W reports that the 46-year-old Texas-born widow, who inherited 
millions from her late husband, former Time-Warner chief Steve Ross, has hired 
a chef to cook exclusively for her critters, which include King Charles 
spaniels, ponies, a goat, a burro and a llama. Their menu eschews the normal 
pet junk food in favor of dishes such as mushroom risotto. (After all, you are 
what you eat, and that applies to animals, too.) KATHIE JENKINS

GETTING UN-SAUCED; SAUCES: ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS IN LOW-FAT COOKING IS A SAUCE

FLAVOR WITHOUT BUTTER. SOME OF AMERICA'S BEST CHEFS SHOW YOU HOW.

 In reading recipes by great chefs, I am always surprised how very elemental 
many of their preparations really are. The elaborate architectonic creations 
that dazzle us in their restaurants are often ingenious constructions of simple 
parts. Each one contributes a layer of flavor and texture. Taken individually, 
these techniques and flavor affinities are powerful tools that the home cook 
can use to achieve incredible effects easily and quickly. In essence, this is a 
building-block approach that relies on well-chosen key elements from which 
endless combinations can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 This method -- employing powders and quickly made sauces -- encourages 
spontaneity and ease in cooking. There are no predetermined combinations, only 
marvelous possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many chefs have taken to rubbing powders made from spices, dried wild 
mushrooms, ancho chiles, lemon grass and fruit peel into foods to create a 
delicious crust, a technique that seems to have erupted spontaneously across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Chef Allen's in North Miami Beach, Allen Susser dusts fish with powdered 
dried mushrooms before sauteing them, while David Burke of Park Avenue Cafe in 
New York City rubs shrimp with his pungent homemade curry powder. The method is 
simple: The toasted ingredients are pulverized in a blender and strained. They 
can be stored in small jars like ordinary spices and used to imbue simple 
dishes with complex flavor instantly -- to make a crust on seared or grilled 
foods, to transform ordinary tomato ketchup into a sophisticated sauce or to 
lend an extra boost of flavor to soups, sauces and stews. 
</P>
<P>
 Making sauces is no longer the time-consuming and laborious process it once 
was. These days they are more often quickly made of fresh ingredients with an 
eye toward clear, vibrant flavor. The classic definitions no longer apply. 
Vinaigrettes, broths and juices are commonly employed as sauces. Salsas, 
comprised of everything from mangoes and cherries to roasted peppers and 
olives, are in effect chopped salads, providing texture as well as an 
intriguing mix of sweet and savory flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver chef Kevin Taylor makes a sublime sauce of juiced red peppers that 
verges on being a soup. It is not only perfect on filled pastas, such as 
tortellini and ravioli, but with grilled seafood as well, which he serves at 
the Zenith American Grill. Susser explodes the traditional notion of ketchup by 
making his with spiced pureed mango, which is delicious with crab cakes and 
tuna burgers as well as grilled fish, pork and chicken. Chef Gray Kunz of 
Lespinasse in New York creates a yogurt sauce with a mix of subtle Asian 
flavors, such as cumin, coriander and lime, that has become his signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Artisanal balsamic vinegar, although enormously expensive, is perhaps the 
ultimate ingredient in simple cooking. Unlike its commercial counterpart, it is 
more a rarefied condiment than vinegar. Made by hand and long-aged, the true 
artisanal balsamics are judged by a consortium of the best producers, 
guaranteeing quality. Look for the words: aceto balsamico tradizionale and 
consorzio produttori and "Made in Modena or Reggio" on the label. Only a 
limited amount may be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Its fierce expense (from $40 to more than $100 a bottle) is offset by its 
intensity: You need only a few drops to add extraordinary flavor to a 
surprising array of dishes, from grilled and fried foods to thin shavings of 
Parmigiano Reggiano and ripe tomatoes or to buttery apple tarts, caramelized 
custards, fresh cherries and fine vanilla ice cream.

IN THE KITCHEN; POTATO GRATIN: THE 60% SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 What would you say if I told you you could make a full-flavored, rich, classic 
potato gratin with only 60% of the calories and one-third the amount of fat? 
Would you think I was nuts? 
</P>
<P>
 You'd probably be right. 
</P>
<P>
 A classic potato gratin is made from basically two things: potatoes and cream. 
Sure, there's a little garlic rubbed around the inside of the dish. And if you 
do it right, there ought to be a good smear of butter both in the dish and on 
top of the potatoes. You can't really alter that balance without drastically 
affecting the final result, with its luscious velvety texture and its 
mouth-filling, well-browned flavors of reduced cream and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 What it comes down to is this: Making a low-fat classic potato gratin is like 
making a compact Cadillac. You can call it that if you like, but you're not 
going to fool anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're on a diet and you've got your heart set on a classic potato gratin, 
the only thing to do is have fruit for breakfast, a lightly dressed salad for 
lunch and then treat yourself at dinner with a small portion of potato gratin 
(preferably with a very small portion of roast chicken breast on the side and, 
hmm, a red Burgundy?). 
</P>
<P>
 There is an alternative, however. By manipulating the ingredients and the 
cooking technique, you can sometimes come up with low-fat dishes that are just 
as satisfying as the high-fat classics, but different. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, face the music: You're going to have to give up the reduced heavy 
cream -- at least for a little while. But once you've made that heart-breaking 
concession, you can start to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the gratin, it's a matter of replacing the brown, creamy savor 
of the long-cooked fat with the brown, creamy savor of the roasted potatoes. 
They're markedly different, but they're both good. And while the original 
potato gratin contains about 388 calories and 26 grams of fat per serving, this 
one has 233 calories and 8 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the full flavor and texture of the potatoes, cook them in milk until 
they're quite soft (you should be able to easily smash a piece between your 
thumb and forefinger). By cooking the potatoes this well, you have released as 
much starch as possible into the milk -- making it thicker and creamier -- and 
you have let the potatoes absorb as much liquid as possible, ensuring that when 
they are roasted they will retain a creamy texture. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps to use other flavors that will reinforce and accent the tastes 
you're choosing to feature. At this time of year, one of the nicest things in 
the market is green garlic. You can get it slender as a scallion or almost as 
thick as a full-grown head. Whichever, it seems sweeter and milder than the 
regular cloves. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're cooking potatoes, there's always room for thyme. Its woodsy 
flavor, with what I find to be a slightly medicinal edge, is a natural 
counterpoint to the starchy taste of roast potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make no mistake, though. While this is a very good dish, it is not a 
substitute for the classic, full-fat potato gratin. Rather, it is an 
alternative. And if you're very, very good, someday you can go back to the 
original. ALTERNATIVE GRATIN OF POTATOES, GREEN GARLIC AND THYME 8 large waxy 
boiling potatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 heads and stalks green garlic, thinly 
sliced 2 teaspoons salt 6 sprigs fresh thyme 4 cups 2% milk 1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 Combine potatoes and garlic in wide, deep saucepan. Add salt, thyme and milk 
to cover. Bring to boil over medium heat, cover and reduce heat, watching 
carefully, until potatoes are fairly soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat 
and let cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly butter heavy gratin dish. Starting with smallest potato pieces or 
those that have broken, cover bottom of dish with potatoes. Layer remainder of 
potatoes in overlapping pattern over top, not much more than 1 inch deep. Pour 
just enough milk over to moisten well and dot with butter. Bake at 350 degrees 
1 hour or until well browned and crusty. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 233 calories; 420 mg sodium; 25 mg cholesterol; 8 
grams fat; 34 grams carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 0.48 gram fiber.

MARKETS; THE PERSIAN VERSION

 There's no one actually named Miller at Miller's Market Place, an Iranian 
supermarket in Reseda known for good kosher meats. It's simply the name that 
came with the business when Danny and Benny Aghaee bought it in 1980. Back 
then, when it was on Vanowen Street near the Van Nuys Airport, it was a 
mid-sized neighborhood American market. The Aghaee brothers did little to 
change the character of the place -- at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were only 16 and 18," Danny Aghaee explains. "We needed a business to 
support our family when we settled here after the revolution in '79. Our father 
was detained in Iran and we didn't have much capital to invest in inventory."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, sitting in his offices above the market on Sherman Way, snappily dressed 
in a well-tailored deep mauve suit, Aghaee admits with a kind of 
I-can-laugh-now grin that they had sunk most of the family's fortune into a 
white elephant. "People stopped shopping (at the old Vanowen location) because 
a lot of modern supermarkets were opening nearby. Suddenly we had to start 
thinking about how we could save the business." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, few stores catered to the growing Iranian expatriate population 
in the San Fernando Valley. And so, with only $1,000 for merchandise, Danny and 
Benny Aghaee began to stock most of the necessities for the cooking that 
Iranians living here prefer to call Persian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Miller's former location the ambience -- if you can apply such a term to a 
supermarket -- had a bit of an old-country Asian market feel to it. Perhaps it 
was the unadorned cement floors or the faintly musty aroma of sumac dust 
mingling with cumin and fenugreek, and the way shoppers scooped the bulk spices 
into plastic bags to be weighed. Near Eastern-style breads, almost the size of 
bath towels, were stacked by the window like folded laundry. And its shelves 
held Near Eastern staples: bottled pomegranate juice, basmati rice, garbanzo 
flour. 
</P>
<P>
 At the butcher counter there were always serious discussions accompanied with 
enthusiastic gesturing as housewives described exactly how they wanted their 
meat cut. The same serious discussions go on today at Miller's new store, which 
opened in Reseda in 1990. But now the spices are prepacked and bar-coded and 
there are even convenience foods -- for instance, seasoning mix for kubideh (a 
kind of ground meat shish kebab) and freeze-dried herb mixtures for ghormeh 
sabzi , the popular meat and herb stew. SHOPPING LIST APPETIZERS 
</P>
<P>
 * Torshi: Miller's sells a huge variety of pickles. They may be baby 
eggplants, okra, a mixture of seasonal vegetables, whole heads of garlic or 
even cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mast-o Musir: In the cooler to the right of the cheeses you'll find this 
shallot-and-yogurt appetizer ready for the table. FRESH HERBS AND SABZI-KHORDAN 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else there may be on the table, one essential ingredient is 
sabzi-khordan , a tray of fresh herbs, radishes and green onions. This is a 
sort of finger salad to be nibbled as a refreshing counterpoint to the main 
dishes. Add cheese to the herb platter (usually a fresh white cheese such as 
the Syrian cheese from Miller's cheese department) and you have panir-o 
sabzi-khordan ; add Persian bread and you'll have nan-o panir-o sabzi-khordan , 
the staple of any Persian table.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's produce department always has a luxurious selection of fresh herbs in 
generous bunches. Many are exclusively for sabzi-khordan while others, such as 
fresh baby dill, also flavor cooked dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mint: Known as nana in Farsi, mint is to the Persian kitchen what cilantro 
is to Mexican cooking -- the all-purpose fresh herb. It flavors cold drinks and 
salad dressings and it is sprinkled over salads and soups as a last-minute 
garnish. 
</P>
<P>
 * Persian Watercress: Called shahi , it lacks the bite of Western-style 
watercress. Instead its taste is mild and refreshing. You can recognize shahi 
by its two- to three-inch-long pointy leaves with serrated edges on a single 
stem.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Persian-Style" Parsley: This turns out to be the same thing that mainstream 
markets call Italian parsley. It's optional as sabzi-khordan but it is used in 
great abundance in many stews and stuffings.  
</P>
<P>
 * Persian Basil: At least that's what Miller's calls this clear relative of 
the sweet basil of Italian cookery and its anise-flavored Southeast Asian 
cousins. This basil has distinct, astringent citrus-like flavor of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh Tarragon ( tarkhun ) and Fresh Coriander ( gashniz ): These are always 
available at Miller's to use for cooked dishes. As a matter of personal 
preference, some cooks include them on their herb tray. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh Fenugreek: We've all tasted fenugreek seeds, which adds the musky 
maple aroma to curry powder. Iranians prefer the greens, called shambalileh in 
Farsi. They remind me of a sturdier version of clover -- the leaves, though 
slightly firmer, have a similar heart-like shape. Fenugreek's distinct, 
aromatic flavor is an essential part of khoresh-e ghormeh sabzi , a classic 
Persian stew loaded with fresh herbs that may be made with fish or meat.  
</P>
<P>
 * Persian Chives: Known in Iranian markets as tareh , these are flat and much 
wider than standard chives or even Chinese garlic chives. Tareh 's sweet, 
slightly onion-like flavor resembles that of leeks. Along with fenugreek, tareh 
is essential in khoresh-e ghormeh sabzi and Persian-style herb omelets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baby Dill: Shevid turns up in hundreds of dishes, from soups and stews to 
the green pea frittata known as kuku-ye nakhod sabz. Shevid 's slightly bitter 
edge is especially fine in cold yogurt soup. BASIC PERSIAN FLAVORING 
INGREDIENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Somagh: Somagh is simply dried, shredded sumac berries. Besides being an 
all-purpose table condiment, this fruit-scented seasoning eliminates the gamy 
flavor from lamb and is, therefore, popular in marinades. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adviyeh: This mixture of several spices, with cloves and cinnamon 
predominating, is the Persian equivalent of India's garam masala . That is to 
say, it's the spice mixture that shows up almost everywhere, alone or in 
combination with other seasonings. Usually cardamom, ground angelica, cumin and 
coriander seeds are included and mixed together with ground, dried rose petals. 
Miller's sells adviyeh in two-ounce packages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limu Omani: These dried Persian limes look like slightly shriveled, 
khaki-colored ping pong balls. However unattractive they seem, nothing exudes 
the wonderfully intense flavor of condensed lime essence like them. Limu omani 
are generally used in stews and soups, often in combination with adviyeh. The 
limes should be pierced in several places before adding them to the pot so they 
will release their flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 * Zereshk: Some cookbooks refer to zereshk as Iranian currants. They are more 
correctly known as barberries, and best known in zereshk polo , a pilaf 
flavored with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The berries also add their tart flavor to herbed frittatas ( kuku ) and to 
"bejeweled pilaf" (known as javaher polo or morassa' polo ), an elaborate pilaf 
mixed with nuts, slivered orange peel and chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Before using zereshk , pick off any stems and soak them in a colander immersed 
in a bowl of water until they soften, about 20 minutes. Then lift the colander 
and tip out the water. Holding the colander over the bowl rinse the berries; 
the dirt will fall through the colander and the bowl will catch any escaping 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Narenj: Prized for its sour juice and fragrant peel, narenj goes by the name 
Seville orange in English and naranja agria in Spanish-speaking countries. Its 
juice compliments fish; its peel, boiled in a light sugar syrup, is often used 
as a flavoring or garnish, for instance in khoresh-e morgh-e torsh , a chicken 
stew made with orange juice and fresh herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find the julienned, dried peel in Miller's spice section and the fresh 
oranges, in season, in the produce area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pomegranate Concentrate: If any dish represents the flamboyance of the 
Persian kitchen it is fesenjan , braised chicken or duck smothered with a sauce 
of ground walnuts and tart pomegranate juice. Many other dishes call for 
pomegranate, including ash-e anar , a lamb soup seasoned with pomegranate, 
ground angelica and assorted fresh herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Angelica Powder: Angelica ( golpar ) is an ingredient in adviyeh , 
pomegranate soup and many stews and pickles. It comes packaged in four-ounce 
packets and is found among the spices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saffron: Iranian saffron, an important element of Persian cooking, has a 
character all its own. At Miller's it is sold by the mesghal (or mithqal ), a 
medieval measurement of weight equivalent to about 4 1/2 ounces. You must ask 
for saffron at the check-out stand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Albalu: Sour cherries, best known from the flavor (and dark pink color) they 
give to the famous pilaf albalu polo , come in several forms: in packets 
(dried) and bottled, either in water pack or sweet syrup. When fresh sour 
cherries are unavailable, cooks use the water-pack bottled variety for pilaf. A 
refreshing iced drink is made from the syrup-pack cherries and the dried 
cherries are eaten as a snack, like prunes or raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kashk: This is a dried powder with a sour-cream-like aroma, made from 
wheat-thickened yogurt. It's often used as a delicious enrichment for soups and 
stewed dishes, most notably ash-e reshte , a complex meat, bean and noodle 
soup. The rich puree of roasted eggplant known as kashk-o bademjan is always 
blanketed with creamy reconstituted kashk . MEAT DEPARTMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Turkey Parts: Although Miller's sells plenty of kosher beef, lamb and 
chicken, turkey -- something you won't find abundantly in Iran -- has become a 
brisk seller here. "People use it for kubideh and for stews because it has less 
cholesterol," Danny Aghaee points out.  
</P>
<P>
 * Beef and Veal: Unlike Western markets, where the meat is broken down into 
specific cuts, at Miller's, the beef and veal are usually sold in large pieces, 
such as the shoulder clod ( sar shaneh ) and shank ( mahicheh ).

GARDEN FRESH; ASPARAGUS: A BURST OF GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For an asparagus gardener, there are six weeks in a year, and that's it. 
That's 46 weeks without fresh-cut asparagus! Come to think of it, there are few 
crops as fleeting -- only red currants come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 To indulge properly, each person needs around 10 asparagus plants. With the 
most intensive spacing, that's 12 1/2 square feet. That same space would give 
six times as many slicing tomatoes. Moreover, much of the year there's 
asparagus at the market. Then why grow these cousins of lilies that first 
sprang up at distant seas? 
</P>
<P>
 Because asparagus that was connected to the earth only minutes before cooking 
is infinitely sweeter, tastier, more tender and juicier on your plate than 
asparagus picked who knows when and where. Because an asparagus patch is 
low-maintenance and long-lived -- 20 years is not uncommon. And because picking 
the first shoots of spring is one of a gardener's cherished rites. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning of the season, all I want to do is taste asparagus on its 
own. I lay half a dozen raw stalks on the plate and we nibble them like 
rabbits. Then I cook stalks and dress them with olive oil and lemon juice or 
fine peanut oil and rice vinegar, or mayonnaise thinned with orange -- or blood 
orange -- juice. As the season advances, I get a yen to mix asparagus up a bit. 
Delicate asparagus is a soloist in the vegetable ensemble, but it gracefully 
lends its voice to an appealing duo or trio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When you bring stalks into the kitchen, plunge them at once into a jug of cool 
water, just as you would flowers. To preserve their quality, keep the jug in 
the refrigerator and cook the stalks the same day.  
</P>
<P>
 To prepare stalks for cooking, swish them in cold water. Gently bend the lower 
two to three inches of each stalk until it snaps -- where it snaps is the point 
between tough and tender. It depends on how long the stalks have been cut, but 
I find that trimming loses you between 1/4 and 1/3 of every pound. So to serve 
a pound of asparagus, start with a generous 1 1/4 pounds. Throw the ends into a 
pot, add water to cover and a sprinkling of salt to taste, cover and simmer 
until you have a flavorful stock for soup (freeze it for a taste of springtime 
in winter).  
</P>
<P>
 Cooking asparagus stalks is fast and easy. The best way is to simmer/steam 
them. Find a deep narrow pot you can cover tightly -- a double boiler's top 
inverted over its bottom works. If there aren't enough stalks for them to hold 
each other upright, tie them in a bundle with cotton kitchen string. Bring a 
couple of inches of water to boil, stand the stalks in the water and cover. 
Start tasting after four to five minutes, depending upon the thickness of the 
stalks. 
</P>
<P>
 To be served cool as an hors d'oeuvre or salad, a stalk is ready when there's 
a fine shaft of crunch at its heart. To be served hot as a side dish, the stalk 
should be tender all the way through -- but barely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overcooking asparagus is a crime against nature. To reduce the chances of 
criminality, have a big bowl of ice water beside the stove. The instant you 
think the stalks are done, turn off the heat, lift the asparagus out with tongs 
and plunge them into the water -- this stops the cooking. Finally, drain the 
stalks on folded dish towels, cover and pat dry. They can stay in the folds of 
the towels in a cool place for a few hours, if need be.  
</P>
<P>
 You can grow asparagus from seeds, but you lose a year of harvest compared 
with planting robust one-year crowns. Seeds are cheaper, if that's a 
consideration. Directions come with the packet. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant crowns around the expected date of your last spring frost or when the 
weather has settled. Choose a place with good drainage and full sun where the 
four-foot roots will have no competition and the three- to five-foot fronds 
will be an asset in the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the crowns moist while you prepare their bed. Get rid of weeds, then dig 
trenches at least eight inches deep and a foot wide. Dig in a couple of inches 
of compost -- your own or from the nursery -- and bone meal or rock phosphate 
according to package directions (use calcium phosphate on acid soil). Mix the 
soil from the trenches with equal parts compost or well-rotted manure.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give each plant about 2 1/2 square feet to itself. Set the crowns on hillocks 
in the trenches about six inches below the surface, and spread the roots out 
carefully. Cover with two inches of soil and water well. In the coming weeks, 
as the crowns surface, repeat until all the reserved soil has been used. The 
asparagus beds will now be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two years, keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall, and let 
rain do the watering while plants are dormant. Once established, the plants can 
get by on half the water of most vegetables, although more is welcome. Watch 
for slugs. Should you have problems (you probably won't), consult a county 
agricultural adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't cut fronds for bouquets and wait till the third spring to harvest -- the 
plants need their strength. The third year, pick for three weeks. Forever 
after, pick for six weeks. Harvest at six to nine inches while buds are tight 
-- snap off the stalk just below the soil. Never harvest stalks 1/4 inch or 
thinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Mulch the patch with a couple of inches of compost or well-rotted manure three 
times a year: just after the harvest, when the fronds start browning in autumn, 
and in very early spring. If by January the fronds haven't snapped of their own 
weight to make way for new shoots, cut them off at an inch or two, then chop 
and leave them for mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans are fond of ivory-colored asparagus, but it's rarely fresh in our 
markets, and when it is, it costs a fortune. These luxury spears have been 
raised without sunlight, a process called blanching. Sometimes the stalks are a 
bit fibrous, but the ones we blanch in our garden are tender and even sweeter 
than those that embrace the sun. Usually soil or organic mulch is mounded eight 
inches high down a row and the shoots grow up through it. But I choose a few 
plants for blanching, set a tall flower pot over them and cover the pot's 
drainage hole with a rock. It's important to check often under the pot because 
the shoots shoot. Last week I found ivory asparagus twirling in figure-eights. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanched asparagus is prepared the same way as green, but do dramatize its 
color -- use vibrantly colorful plates. When I serve it cold, I mix a little 
Dijon mustard into mayonnaise, then speckle with chopped fresh tarragon -- or 
parsley, capers, or watercress. For blanched asparagus served hot, I stir 
tomato puree bit by bit into hot cream sauce until it's the color of a Pacific 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus is one of the most beautiful vegetables in the garden, with rich 
green lacy fronds from late spring through autumn. In late summer, it produces 
a stippling of red berries as decorative as holly, then chilly weather turns 
the lace cafe-au-lait.  
</P>
<P>
 So I'm wrong about just six weeks of feasting on asparagus. Asparagus is a 
long delicious feast to the eye!

 This salad may be prepared a few hours in advance. It makes a handsome light 
luncheon or first course. Although bay shrimp offer the asparagus their soft 
pink color and another aspect of sweetness (I find Oregon shrimp larger and 
more flavorful than most), you can omit them and add 3/4 pound of trimmed 
asparagus for two or three more servings.  
</P>
<P>
 SICHUAN-STYLE ASPARAGUS AND SHRIMP SALAD 1 pound trimmed tender whole 
asparagus stalks (start with about 1/3 pound more) 1 (1-inch) piece ginger 
root, peeled and finely grated 2 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons 
richly flavored peanut oil or olive oil 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon low-sodium 
soy sauce 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons sesame oil or 2 teaspoons 
sesame seeds toasted over medium heat in dry skillet Scant 1 teaspoon crumbled 
dried red chile with no seeds, or to taste 3/4 pound cooked bay shrimp, thawed 
if frozen and patted dry 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions, tender stalks 
included Leaves of 1 large bunch watercress, rinsed and dried Freshly ground 
Sichuan peppercorns or black pepper 4 small unsprayed tulips, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer or steam asparagus in pot until tender-crisp. Plunge into bowl of ice 
water to stop cooking, then pat dry on kitchen towels. Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 To make dressing, blend ginger, vinegar, oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, sesame 
oil and chile in bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, mix shrimp and green onions in bowl. Beat dressing, pour over, and 
use hands to mix. Lay bed of watercress on each salad plate. Divide asparagus 
among plates, arranging stalks overlapping in center. Gently stir shrimp and 
onions. Use slotted spoon to heap over middle of asparagus. Moisten rest of 
asparagus and watercress with dressing in bowl. Season to taste with ground 
peppercorns. Set tulip to side (they're edible) as garnish and serve at once. 
Makes 4 servings.

GOOD COOKING: REAL RHUBARB RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to hothouses and commercial growers, you can now find rhubarb in the 
market almost all year round. But real seasonal rhubarb is a different thing 
entirely. Field-grown rhubarb has firm, vibrant red stalks with green leaves. 
The flavor is more pronounced than the hothouse variety, which is typically a 
pale red to pink and is usually sold without leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 Field-grown rhubarb, appearing in markets from April through June, is 
perishable and quickly becomes limp if not used shortly after purchase. Choose 
firm, crisp stalks that are bright-red with fresh-looking green leaves. Avoid 
old, withered stalks by checking out the cut ends -- if they are dry and 
crusty, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerate rhubarb, wrapped in plastic wrap, for no more than a few days. 
When preparing rhubarb, it is not necessary to peel it, but always discard the 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Though rhubarb is classified botanically as a vegetable, it's generally used 
as a fruit. Because of its intensely tart taste, rhubarb requires a staggering 
amount of sugar to make a sweet dessert. But this very tartness makes it 
versatile for relishes and savory dishes as well as for desserts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick, instant rhubarb sauce that can please even the most resistant 
rhubarb critic. Serve it spooned over ice cream, yogurt, puddings and cake.  
</P>
<P>
 MICROWAVE RHUBARB SAUCE WITH BERRIES 1/2 pound rhubarb, cut in 3/4-inch thick 
slices to equal about 2 cups 6 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
10 strawberries, rinsed, patted dry, hulled and cut in half 1/2 cup raspberries 
Vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Mix rhubarb, sugar and cinnamon in microwave-safe bowl. Cover loosely with 
plastic wrap and microwave on full power 2 minutes. Stir, return to microwave 
and cook until rhubarb is soft, about 1 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in strawberries and raspberries. Serve warm over frozen yogurt. Can be 
prepared day ahead and refrigerated. Gently reheat for serving. May also be 
prepared without berries and frozen up to 3 months. Gently reheat and add 
berries for serving. Makes 2 1/2 cups.

 This cobbler combines rhubarb with two berries under a tender cinnamon 
biscuit. The extra step of cooking the rhubarb on the stove top before baking 
the cobbler is essential; I've tried the recipe without doing this and the 
juices did not thicken satisfactorily -- they were far too runny. I like to 
serve this warm, with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt 
melting over the top.  
</P>
<P>
 JUICY DEEP-DISH RHUBARB COBBLER WITH BERRIES 1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, cut into 
1/3-inch slices to equal about 6 cups 1/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca Sugar 1 cup 
plus 2 tablespoons flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground 
cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled, cut in 8 pieces 
1/2 cup whipping cream 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 1 1/2 pints strawberries, 
rinsed, patted dry, hulled, cut in half if large 1/2 pint raspberries Frozen 
low-fat vanilla yogurt or ice cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Toss together rhubarb, tapioca and 1 1/4 cups sugar in bowl. Let stand 15 
minutes. Transfer to large skillet and cook, stirring, over high heat until 
juices begin to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in food 
processor or mixing bowl. Work in butter with processor metal blade or pastry 
blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream and process or mix just 
until dough clumps together. Press dough into firm clump on floured board. 
Knead dough, folding and pressing back onto itself, until smooth and cohesive, 
about 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Add orange zest, strawberries and raspberries to rhubarb mixture and stir. 
Transfer mixture to 10-cup souffle dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll out cobbler dough on heavily floured board to rough shape of souffle 
dish. Remove excess flour on dough with soft brush. Place dough on top of fruit 
and gently tuck edges down into fruit. Place dish on jelly roll pan to catch 
any juices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 425 degrees until crust is lightly browned and fruit juices are 
bubbling, about 20 minutes. Serve warm with frozen yogurt. Makes 6 to 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 487 calories; 219 mg sodium; 48 mg cholesterol; 
16 grams fat; 85 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams protein; 1.95 grams fiber.

WINE: ASSESSING THE TCHELISTCHEFF EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eyes beneath those formidable brows were deep-set, intense -- and, at the 
moment, angry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1981 and I was judging Pinot Noirs at the Sonoma County Harvest Fair 
wine competition. Beside me was the man with the deep-set eyes, legendary 
winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff, who died April 5 at age 92. We were part of a 
five-person panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting on wine No. 8, Andre firmly said: "Gold medal!" I concurred. The other 
panelists voted no award, so the wine was discarded. Tchelistcheff gritted his 
teeth and said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a break, as he puffed on a cigarette, he quietly said to me: "Wine No. 
8 was excellent. Whoever made it, he knows Pinot Noir." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he knew he couldn't protest too loudly because of the Tchelistcheff Effect 
-- the influence a powerful and respected judge can have on all the others in a 
wine judging. He was so certain about what was great wine and so forceful about 
expressing his opinion that he often intimidated younger judges. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after I told the competition director about Tchelistcheff's comment 
on wine No. 8, the director re-entered the wine in the next round, since the 
wine had received two gold medal votes. Tchelistcheff delivered a few favorable 
comments on the wine, and the second group of judges voted it a silver medal. 
Tchelistcheff smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Later we learned that the wine was 1978 Davis Bynum Pinot Noir. Tchelistcheff 
knew nothing about the winemaker, but predicted great things for him.  
</P>
<P>
 He was right. That was the first wine made by Gary Farrell, who since has 
become one of California's greatest winemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tchelistcheff was more than just a great judge and skilled winemaker. He 
was also a romantic with twinkling eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Davis, winemaker at Jordan Winery in Sonoma County, remembered how he once 
asked Tchelistcheff to describe a Chardonnay. "I used terms like 'apples' and 
'lactic acid,' " said Davis. "Andre shook his head. He said: 'No, this wine 
smells like the breast of a young woman in winter, wrapped in fur.' That was 
Tchelistcheff." 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff was also a realist and often told newcomers to viniculture of 
its problems, including the high cost of starting a winery. Richard Peterson, 
Tchelistcheff's assistant at Beaulieu Vineyard, tells of how the late Fred 
McCrea in 1946 asked the Russian-born enologist to help him assess what should 
be planted at Stony Hill, the rugged property he'd just bought. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two walked up the steep, rock-strewn hill, Tchelistcheff asked: "Mr. 
McCrea, what business did you say you recently retired from?" McCrea said he 
had been in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff replied: "I seriously recommend that you remain in the 
advertising business." 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff arrived here a 37-year-old enologist and found a wine industry 
ravaged by Prohibition. He could tell stories of the problems he encountered in 
those days -- vinegar flies in wine, a winery in ruins, an ill-prepared staff, 
rusted pipes, rodents everywhere. Often he spoke of himself in the third 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see is horrible technology," he said in a 1991 interview. "Look, I am 
coming from European wine industry to the most progressive technical country. 
And I locate this. . . . Sleepless nights of Andre Tchelistcheff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, 19 years after leaving BV, Andre rejoined the winery. By then BV had 
lost the prestige it once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to leave to this place my beginning," he said. He said he hoped BV 
would "be as well known (now) as in the past. I like to once again capture the 
position of Beaulieu in the wine. . . . I got to light them, start the fire. 
I'm living in young people now. I believe in the youth because I used to be 
very young. I got to give them something, my beliefs of the past. I like to 
accept something very good from yesterday and today, but leave to them 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Being back at BV, Tchelistcheff said, made him emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when I talk about the wines, I permit myself to suffer a little 
bit," he said. "When I'd come home, she (wife Dorothy) would say, 'Andre, what 
the hell, why in your age do you suffer so much?' But that's one of the reasons 
I came here (again). To give back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff declined credit for the rapid rise of California wine, 
attributing a larger share of credit to Albert J. Winkler and Maynard Amerine, 
the heads of the UC Davis viticulture and enology departments, and to Ernest 
and Julio Gallo, for their scientific commitment to making sound wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff said he wished to leave one message to today's young winemakers: 
Make wine that tastes like grapes, not production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chardonnays of today -- with 13.8% alcohol!" he exclaimed. "It's 
unbelievable. And the oak is too much. Give it the wood, but do not allow wood 
to betray the character of the wine. I am really a fighter against this thing, 
against the oak." 
</P>
<P>
 He opposed winemaking by formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy of us today (is that) people are guided by big ideas, big dreams, 
big images, but nobody likes to do fundamental works in winemaking," he said. 
"Winemakers are not living with wines any more, they are in offices." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the winemaker must be in constant touch with the wines, which means 
the winemaker must be in contact with every employee. "You have to talk with 
your staff. That includes the grower, the man in charge of crush, even the man 
in charge of barrel washing, every little thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In my many meetings with Tchelistcheff, I always got the feeling of his 
dedication to simple wines. He was the man who developed the famed BV Private 
Reserve Cabernet, but he took as much joy in a well-made glass of inexpensive 
red table wine, and he gave me the feeling that wine was an essential part of 
daily living.

WINE: ANDRE TCHELISTCHEFF: AN APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. BALZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News of the death of pioneer winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff in Napa Valley last 
Wednesday profoundly saddened the wine world.  
</P>
<P>
 The news was not unexpected. Months ago, the diminutive, deep-voiced 
aristocrat, still seemingly hale and hearty -- despite his 92 years -- and 
working a schedule that might fatigue anyone half his age, was diagnosed with 
cancer of the esophagus. Even the torturous rigors of radiation did not stop 
his vineyard and winery routines. But his return to the hospital last week, to 
undergo surgery for the removal of a stomach tumor, was more than he could 
endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the last day," his widow, Dorothy Tchelistcheff, told me, "his mind was 
fighting. When it became inevitable that he would lose, after receiving last 
rites from a Russian Orthodox priest, he told me: 'I am ready to go. I am 
wanting to go.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so peaceful. He was ready." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Tchelistcheff 55 years ago, over lunch at Beaulieu Vineyards just 
after the harvest of 1939, only one year after his arrival from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in 1901, the son of an anti-czarist judge and law professor from 
Kaluga Province, Russia, and attended the military academy of Kiev. He was 
still in his teens when the Bolshevik Revolution ripped his country apart. His 
father had served in the Provisional Government after the czar was deposed, and 
the Bolsheviks declared the family to be enemies. Tchelistcheff joined the 
White Russian Army and traveled with them to the Crimea in 1918.  
</P>
<P>
 From there, he and his family escaped to Turkey, then to Yugoslavia. After he 
reached Czechoslovakia, he finished his civil education at the Institute of 
National Agronomy in Brno. After five years of work and study, he earned a 
degree as an "engineer-agronomist."  
</P>
<P>
 In the early '30s, he moved to Paris and chose the way of the vine, becoming 
assistant in viticulture and enology to the director of the Institute of 
National Agronomy. It was here, in the spring of 1938, that he met Georges de 
Latour, the French-born founder of Napa Valley's Beaulieu Vineyards, who had 
come to France seeking a new winemaker. The director of the school told de 
Latour that he had just the right young man for the job -- highly intelligent, 
skilled and talented. It was, of course, Tchelistcheff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, if you can, the reactions of this ardent young European-trained 
winemaker when he first came to Beaulieu. Here he was in this new and alien 
vineyard, the autumn colors of the lush Napa Valley all around him. The 
luxurious canopies of vines were nothing short of awesome, as was the backdrop 
of the tree-covered Mayacamas Mountains bordering the vineyards. The intensity 
and taste of the grapes was stunning.  
</P>
<P>
 But inside the winery, the scene was different. He shook his head and knew he 
would have to make changes if the transformation of those grapes into wine 
would carry the superb essence of the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, when we were together in the winery at Beaulieu tasting his 1946 
Pinot Noir, a wine that would become the benchmark Pinot Noir for California, 
he told me this story: 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not find the French Burgundy taste or perfume in the wines made in 
the cellar before I came here," he said. "Capt. Joe Concannon of Livermore was 
visiting, and I asked him about this grape in California. He spoke to me 
directly.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Young man,' he said, 'as the sun sets, go into the garden of Madame de 
Latour and pick one of her fine red roses, just as it has begun to open. Take 
it home. Put it into a vase . . . without water. Next morning, put your nose 
into the heart of that dying rose. Inhale the unique perfume. There you will 
have the scent to guide you to a perfect Pinot Noir.' That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 As I swirled my glass of that 1946 Pinot Noir, a bouquet I can remember to 
this day, my eyes found it to be translucent. My nose found the perfume of 
those dying rose petals. My taste buds detected its long-lasting savors, wholly 
unlike Cabernet or Zinfandel. "It's silky . . . and aristocratic," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has great elegance . . . and structure," he said, calmly and accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the science of enology steadily advanced, the language of laboratory 
technology invaded the social scene, and Tchelistcheff saw the single emphasis 
of grape varietals and technology threatening the aesthetics of winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagination," he told me once, "can become lost in the scientific process, 
but not when there are deep feelings of love. There is no love unless there is 
imagination . . . and no imagination without love."

CARDAMOM: THE SPICE OF LUXURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It is said that a poor man in Saudi Arabia would rather forgo his rice than 
give up his cardamom," writes Frederic Rosengarten Jr. in "The Book of Spices" 
(Pyramid Books). Hyperbole, perhaps (though it's said that the farther into the 
desert you go, the more cardamom seeds and the fewer coffee beans the Bedouins 
put in their coffee), but the saying indicates the high regard in which much of 
the world holds this exquisitely fragrant spice.  
</P>
<P>
 Cardamom is a mainstay in the cooking of India, Sri Lanka, Scandinavia and the 
Middle East; in Ethiopia, which has its own native strains of cardamom, it's 
the most characteristic spice. Although largely ignored in this country as 
recently as 10 years ago, it is gaining popularity rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardamom is the seed pod of a tropical shrub related to ginger. In this 
country we're likely to see the two varieties native to southern India: green 
and black. Green cardamom -- a pale-green-to-straw-colored pod the size of a 
coffee bean with a lightly ribbed surface -- is the more common and aromatic of 
the two. It has an intense, almost floral aroma that lends a haunting perfume 
to any dish it encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Black cardamom is larger and darker than the green variety, being the size and 
shape of a plum pit. Its aroma is less exuberant, but there's no mistaking its 
intense smoky, nutty flavor. Both types of cardamom contain 15 to 20 angular, 
small black seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Green cardamom is sold in pod form, seed form and ground, and is generally 
used in cakes, cookies, puddings and other desserts. You can buy it at any 
supermarket. Black cardamom comes mainly in pod form and is generally used in 
savory dishes, like rice biryani , and in the famous Indian spice mixture, 
garam masala. Look for black cardamom in Indian and Pakistani markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Green cardamom is the ingredient that gives Arabic coffee its distinctive 
fragrance. (It goes by the name of hal in the Middle East.) It also figures 
prominently in Scandinavian desserts, such as brune kager (crisp Danish 
cookies), flotevafler (Norwegian sour cream waffles) and kermakakku (Finnish 
pound cake). 
</P>
<P>
 But this versatile spice also goes well in meat dishes, like northern Indian 
moghul-style chicken. A Greek friend makes a sort of Middle East beef 
stroganoff, using cardamom in place of paprika. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, cardamom has been treasured for its medicinal properties. The 
Romans gobbled it at the end of a meal to ward off post-prandial indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardomomum helpyth ayenst wamblyng (nausea) and indygnacyon (indigestion)," 
opined a 14th-Century herbalist. In Indian Ayurvedic medicine, cardamom is 
believed to help eliminate fat and cure urinary tract ailments. Pharmaceutical 
companies still use the spice to sweeten bitter medications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, boozers would nibble cardamom seeds to disguise the smell 
of liquor on their breath. In India, cardamom seeds are chewed after a meal to 
aid digestion. Whole cardamom pods can be added to applesauce, rice pudding and 
hot mulled wine and cider. To add an interesting flavor to coffee, add a 
cardamom pod to the beans just before grinding. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for uses that call for ground cardamom, buy whole cardamom seeds. When 
you grind them yourself in a spice mill or coffee grinder, the resulting powder 
will have a lot more flavor than commercial ground cardamom, which usually 
contains ground pod casings as well as seeds. If you can, buy the pale-green 
pods sold at spice shops and ethnic markets; the whitish pods sold in the 
supermarket are sometimes bleached, which can adulterate the flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 When you shop, you'll probably notice that, ounce for ounce, cardamom is one 
of the world's most expensive spices. Fortunately, it is so aromatic that a 
little goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In this country cardamom is generally used in desserts, but in India and the 
Near East the fragrant spice is often paired with meat. This recipe was 
inspired by one of my cooking students, Dina Hannah.  
</P>
<P>
 CARDAMOM BEEF WITH CARAMELIZED ONIONS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin or sirloin 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup nonfat yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Cognac 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large or 2 medium onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives or green onions for garnish 
</P>
<P>
 Trim off fat or sinew from meat. Cut beef into long, thin strips. Place meat 
in mixing bowl along with garlic, cardamom and pepper to taste. Marinate 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine yogurt, mustard, Cognac and flour in small bowl and whisk until 
smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in large non-stick skillet. Add onions and cook, stirring 
often, over medium-low heat until deep-golden-brown, 10 minutes. Add sugar 
after 5 minutes to help onions brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Increase heat to high and add beef to onions. Cook until seared on all sides, 
1 to 2 minutes. Stir in yogurt mixture and simmer 1 minute. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Sprinkle beef with chives. Serve at once. Makes 4 servings.

SCOTT HARRIS: NEIGHBORLINESS CAN BE THE BEST DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They would have been friends anyway, but it's nice that Gloria Lintermans and 
Leslie Ann Nichols share an interest in fashion. Gloria writes a syndicated 
fashion column; Leslie owns a wardrobe company that caters to the studios. It's 
a bonus, especially for Gloria, that they also share the same dress size. "It's 
usually me going over to Leslie's," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Their friendship, however, has always been more substance than style. For 18 
years now, they've been the best of neighbors. Gloria and Leslie have 
commiserated over their respective divorces and, more important, they have 
watched over each other's kids -- like the time Leslie caught one of her boys 
smoking cigarettes with Gloria's 10-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a decade ago. Their friendship has endured even as kids moved on and 
the neighborhood lost some of its neighborliness. It is only now, Gloria and 
Leslie say, that neighbors are acting like neighbors again. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. The bad news is that it took shock treatment to make a 
difference. It all began just after midnight March 20, when a new neighbor, Dr. 
Paul Hackmeyer, was shot three times in an apparent robbery attempt outside his 
home on Addison Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Leslie and Gloria decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't as if Neighborhood Watch was a foreign concept, but people in this 
affluent pocket of North Hollywood had never before shown much interest. After 
the shooting, Leslie and Gloria called the police and City Hall and passed out 
flyers inviting neighbors to a meeting at Gloria's house on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 people showed up, an extraordinary turnout for such meetings. At 
Gloria's house they met Police Capt. Richard Waller, the new commanding officer 
of the North Hollywood Division, and Senior Lead Officer Ed Brentlinger, who 
coordinates Neighborhood Watch programs in the area. They also met Mark 
Spellman, a field deputy for Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, they met each other. For, as Brentlinger explains it, nothing 
is more critical to making the LAPD's "community-oriented policing" efforts 
work than for law-abiding folks to watch each other's backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way this is going to work," says Brentlinger, a 20-year 
police veteran. "If the people don't get involved, we've lost. That's not just 
we as a Police Department. That's we as a community." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors made progress on a number of fronts. Brentlinger signed up eight 
new block captains. Spellman promised to help improve the area's street 
lighting. One neighbor took it upon herself to organize pepper spray classes 
for interested neighbors. Several neighbors said they intended to heed 
Brentlinger's advice and have outdoor lighting activated by motion sensors 
installed at their homes. They agreed to meet again to discuss the possibility 
of hiring a private security patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors were also encouraged by the appearance of Hackmeyer, who is 
making a strong recovery from his wounds, including one that passed within 
millimeters of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much easier to recruit people when something like that happens," said 
Brentlinger, who now has more than 1,100 North Hollywood residents involved in 
Neighborhood Watch efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the questions that always comes up after such a bloody encounter is 
whether guns would make a neighborhood more or less safe. In a previous article 
concerning Hackmeyer, I reported that he had bought a gun for home protection. 
One reader wrote a letter suggesting that if concealed weapons permits were 
easier to obtain -- and if Hackmeyer had been armed that night -- the results 
of his encounter might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentlinger expresses ambivalence about the value of guns for self-protection, 
saying that what might be safe for some people would be a disaster for others. 
Hackmeyer himself agrees that he wouldn't like his chances in a shootout 
between an obstetrician and a criminal. If living in Los Angeles meant carrying 
a gun, he says, it would probably be time to move out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Lintermans and Leslie Ann Nichols are adamant about their aversion to 
guns. That's one reason they voted against the recall of state Sen. David 
Roberti. And before neighbors pick up arms, they suggest they pick up the phone 
and organize a Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just another thing neighbors have to do to make their neighborhood 
better, Officer Brentlinger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting involved is one thing. Staying involved is something else.

POST-QUAKE WATCH; BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake, officials of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency were in Los Angeles, assuring victims that housing grants, 
food stamps, rebuilding loans, even new eyeglasses, were coming. The talk, from 
all of the agencies on the scene, was soft, reassuring and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the big stick has come out. People who snatched aid they didn't deserve 
are getting their comeuppance from a federal task force. A dozen people were 
arrested Tuesday on charges of making $64,000 in fraudulent claims. A mere drop 
in the bucket compared to the $1.5 billion disbursed by various federal bodies, 
but there's more to come. FEMA is mailing dunning letters to 3,000 recipients 
deemed ineligible for the grants they got. Two thousand checks worth about $6 
million have been returned, some of them clearly in response to the federal 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the attitude of FEMA and its seemingly inexhaustible director, 
James Lee Witt, is exactly right. "We want the money to 'go to the needy and 
not the greedy,' " says a FEMA spokesman. "Those who make honest mistakes will 
not be prosecuted." For those with a gnawing sense of doubt or guilt -- hey, 
there's still time to inquire or return the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the computers are whirring in Washington, cross-checking for 
duplicate applications, odd patterns -- anything suspicious. Any huge aid 
effort will tempt the greedy. But bring the hammer down too hard or too early 
and truly needy, desperate people will go wanting. FEMA has found the point of 
balance.

ARAB SUICIDE BOMBING IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "7 Israelis Killed in Suicide Bombing," April 7: 
</P>
<P>
 What does it take to make a massacre? Killing of Arabs qualifies, but 
apparently killing of Jews does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that Jews question the objectivity of the news media? In all 
their reporting, last month's events in Hebron are repeatedly referred to as 
the "Hebron massacre," while on April 6 Jews were "killed when a car exploded," 
almost as though it were nobody's fault. Then, these killings are reported as 
"retaliation" for the Hebron attack, while the latter seemed to come out of the 
clear blue -- not as a frustrated response to the murders of hundreds of Jews 
by Palestinians in a continuing genocidal war by the Palestinians against the 
Jews. The Hebron event is repeated as background information in every story 
related to Israel, while any attack on Jews is invariably one day's news. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly during the remembrance of the slaughter of 6 million Jews in the 
Holocaust, it behooves us to be especially aware of dangerous subtle 
undercurrents and not-so-subtle manifestations of anti-Semitism, which refuses 
to die even in our multicultural society . . . or is it just not politically 
correct to criticize, let alone condemn Arabs? 
</P>
<P>
 DAVIDA FISCHMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Regarding the slaying and injury of Jews in Afula and Ashdod -- will we make 
the same demands on the PLO as we made on Israel after the Hebron attack? 
</P>
<P>
 Will Arafat issue an unequivocal condemnation of the murders and murderers -- 
or will he finally be pushed into a mealy-mouthed declaration of regret for the 
"spilling of blood on both sides"? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the PLO make a series of gestures, concessions and confidence-building 
measures toward Israel to convince it of the PLO's sincere desire for peace 
with Israel? Of course nobody even dreams that Israel will suspend the 
negotiations in response to these murders as did the PLO after Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the PLO or any Arab country pay compensation to the victims and families 
in Afula and Ashdod?  
</P>
<P>
 Does the PLO intend to disarm and jail the organizers and planners of these 
killings? Will Hamas be outlawed as a terrorist organization under Palestinian 
autonomy? 
</P>
<P>
 Will Arabs disavow and condemn these murders? Will the U.N. Security Council 
swing into action and pass a resolution unequivocally condemning these 
killings? 
</P>
<P>
 It's obviously fatuous to expect that this time will be different from 
previous occurrences. Israel will again be expected to forgive and forget the 
most atrocious, outrageous, inhuman and barbaric attacks upon its people.  
</P>
<P>
 SIDNEY BROUNSTEIN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The Times' editorial of April 2 praises Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin's consenting to an international presence in Hebron and describes him as 
a great peacemaker. Rabin is applauded for his "commitment to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it should be understood that while the principle of "intent" is 
crucial in determining guilt in a court of law, "intent" is not the essential 
test of responsibility in things political. The true test of statesmanship is 
not intent, but rather results and consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rabin's many compromises with the Arabs result not in peace and security 
for Israel, but rather in the establishment of a militant armed PLO state, in 
Israeli return to the indefensible pre-1967 cease-fire lines, in Syrian control 
of the Golan Heights and Israel's water supply sources, in further Arab 
terrorism against Israel, in the redivision of Jerusalem, and in an Israeli 
society torn by religious and political fratricide verging on civil war, then 
Yitzhak Rabin will go down in history not as the great peacemaker but rather as 
the Marshal Henri Philippe Petain of Israel.

RAISING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Mothers and Other Strangers," Commentary, March 30: 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Dowling's sad lament regarding a supposed decrease in fecundity 
seems to be rooted principally in her concern for the future of her no-doubt 
lucrative career as an obstetrician. She also apparently feels the need to 
rationalize her own ample fertility (she enjoyed motherhood and went on to have 
"a couple more" -- totaling seven), which does not quite square with the 
thinking of those who believe that bringing an excessive number of children 
into an already overcrowded, undernourished world is selfish and irresponsible. 
Her final concern seems to be that if people limit their childbearing to one or 
two children, there will be no one around to take care of Dowling in her old 
age. Better a "child-poor" society, than a "poor child" society in which there 
is no clean air, little opportunity for betterment and violence around every 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowling seems to believe that all mothers with careers bear children merely 
for their trophy value, to be raised by "surrogate parents." And just who, Ms. 
Dowling, has been mothering your brood all these years? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Dowling omitted one rather obvious possible reason for the decrease 
in prenatal visits to her and her colleagues' offices -- the out-of-sight costs 
of medical care. My husband and I (we have two children and will stop there, 
shame on us!) are fortunate enough to make a decent living and to have health 
insurance. But the skyrocketing costs of medical attention and the increasing 
difficulty getting insurance claims paid have forced us to think very carefully 
before we make a trip to the doctor's office. We can only imagine what it must 
be like for those less fortunate than we. 
</P>

<P>
 * Strengthening the economy, infusing the job market and providing for our 
old-age security are dangerous reasons to bring a new life into this world. 
They are just as dangerous as procreating to complete one's life experience, or 
because it is normal and expected, or because your parents want to be 
grandparents, or because you think you will attain through your children the 
immortality or success you cannot achieve on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one reason to bring a new life into the world -- because you 
have time, energy, capacity and inclination to know, love, honor, nurture, 
patiently understand and respect this offspring for the rest of your life. How 
can a person know if he or she is ready and able to do this? Easy. What you are 
unable to do for yourself, you will not be able to do for others! 
</P>
<P>
 People who are hard on themselves are hard on their children. Those who 
chastise themselves chastise their children. You who set unrealistic 
expectations for yourselves do the same to your children. If you do not have to 
time, energy, capacity and inclination to know, love, honor, nurture, patiently 
understand and respect yourself, then learn to be first to yourself -- what all 
parents must be to their child.

 * What inconvenient timing. In her column "A Diversion That's Costing Us All" 
(Commentary, April 5), Deborah Tannen warns us that "the scourge of Whitewater" 
is taking the Clintons' time and attention away from the job that "we 
desperately need them to be doing."The same day had a report on the First Lady 
being in Chicago for opening day to throw out the first pitch. And another on 
the President being in Cleveland to do the same -- before heading to Charlotte

excellent job of running our nation. It's too bad the Republicans won't spend 
their time doing what we put them in office to do -- work on laws to improve 
our country economically and socially. Who cares what the Clintons did back in 
the '80s, some things back before he became governor. Is Sen. Alfonse D'Amato 
(R-N.Y.) so pure?

FACULTY WORKLOADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The recent letter from the chair of the CSU Long Beach Academic Senate 
(April 2) misses the main thrust of my investigation of educational fraud at 
CSU -- that San Diego State is systematically falsifying reports on faculty 
workload. Faculty are given units for supervising students whom they never even 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative analyst is currently conducting an independent investigation 
which, I believe, will confirm my allegations and bring about reforms to ensure 
that the CSU system is honestly accounting to the Legislature and the taxpayers 
on the use of educational resources. 
</P>
<P>
 I fully support faculty efforts at "flexibility and richness of opportunity" 
as Dorothy Goldish states, but I think we all agree that we are first entitled 
to accurate information about faculty workload, especially in this era of 
downsizing when the doors to higher education are closing to thousands of 
qualified students.

PLATFORM; KURT COBAIN REACHED PEOPLE WHO HAD A LOT TO BE MAD ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By KATHLEEN M. O'CONNELL, a senior at Catholic University in Washington, had 
this to say about the suicide of singer Kurt Cobain: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain's words spoke to a number of young people upset about the prospect 
of a nothing life at nothing wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have dubbed us Generation X -- a generation no one knew what to do 
with.Whether your parents told you, you learned it in school or it's just a 
story you heard, we've learned a lot of things. Our parents can be together, 
divorced, fighting, dating or alone. Some of us have sex, use condoms, get 
pregnant, have abortions, have babies or get AIDS. We get mugged, raped, 
assaulted, molested, abused and used. We escape through alcohol, marijuana, 
cocaine, crack and others. We are victims of violence and guns. We are in 
counseling, therapy or on balancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 We are also the Angry Generation and we have a lot to be mad about. We are 
bitter, depressed, sad or lonely -- college graduates who fear a future of 
passing fast food through drive-up windows. 
</P>
<P>
 We must try to look at the wonders of our generation, to help it grow into 
positivism. We are in it together.

PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION; SEX AND SIN: THERE IS A DIFFERENCE; ABSTINENCE IS 
HARDLY THE HEIGHT OF MORAL BEHAVIOR; OUR KIDS NEED GUIDANCE FOR REAL 
SITUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GOTLIEB, Michael Gotlieb is the rabbi for Temple Judea in Vista. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vista school board in northern San Diego County has adopted a new 
curriculum on sexual values, called Sex Respect, which teaches abstinence and 
restricts information about birth control, masturbation, abortion and sexually 
transmitted disease. It will be implemented this summer in Grade 7, and the 
board will vote April 21 on whether to extend it through Grade 11. 
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, those who advocate this proposed sex-education curriculum 
believe that human sexuality is a serious issue for educators. The problem is, 
Sex Respect does not address the many consequences and responsibilities that 
come with an active sex life and so leaves our youth woefully uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the new curriculum is that men and women should remain chaste 
before they marry, that sexual relations in any other context are immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rabbi and teacher who has worked with countless young people, I feel 
qualified to offer a different view: 
</P>
<P>
 Premarital sex between consenting individuals is not immoral; premarital sex 
is unholy. The difference between the two is significant. I do not want people 
who engage in premarital sex to think that they are committing a grave sin. The 
Hebrew Bible is virtually silent on this issue, but it certainly does not label 
premarital sex a sin. You will not find explicit reference to relations between 
unmarried individuals who engage in sex among the prohibitions of the Bible. 
Sexuality becomes a moral issue when trickery or deceit is employed. Incest, 
rape and acquaintance rape are indeed sinful.  
</P>
<P>
 I recoil when a person is described as "moral" because of their chastity. A 
far more significant question would ask if that person cheats on income taxes 
or gossips maliciously or acts in other ways with total disregard for fellow 
human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 At our most basic level, we humans are animals; we have animal impulses and 
drives. We communicate, we eat, we relieve ourselves, we tire, we sleep -- and 
we have sex. Ultimately, what makes us human is our ability to transcend our 
animal composition. What makes us human is our ability to channel and curb our 
God-given impulses in such a way that elevates the human spirit. Sexuality is 
one in a series of healthy life forces. When we eat with dignity, when we 
communicate to each other with respect, when we acknowledge the normal healthy 
function of our bodies, our animalistic foundation transforms itself and 
becomes human. 
</P>
<P>
 From a religious perspective, sex becomes holy exclusively in the context of 
marriage. That is something radically different than labeling it immoral when 
it is performed out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence until marriage is an ideal and the basic approach to sexuality that 
I would advocate as a rabbi. It is not only by far the best form of birth 
control, it elevates sexuality and makes it sacred. But honestly, do we provide 
a service to the generation growing up in the 1990s when we withhold from them 
explanation about other forms of birth control or open discussion of 
masturbation, abortion and sexually transmitted diseases? 
</P>
<P>
 What is the motivating force behind the advocates of Sex Respect? I am curious 
to know if the issue is age or the sexual act itself rendered outside the 
context of marriage. I think we can agree that 13-year-olds who engage in 
sexual intimacy leave us both pained and bewildered. But are we faced by the 
same dilemma when 21-year-olds have a premarital affair? If we say the issue is 
age, the inference is that not all premarital sexual encounters are equally 
wrong. Once we agree to the possibility that some premarital activity is not 
"sinful," the issue becomes one of moderation and balance. 
</P>
<P>
 We render a terrible disservice to our children by withholding vital 
information on sexuality from them. Concerned adults must push for a curriculum 
that teaches and empowers adolescent boys and girls, in an age-appropriate way, 
so they may choose a sex ethic wisely. Everything in life comes with 
trade-offs. By not teaching our children all they need to know about sexuality, 
in the controlled environment of the classroom, they will learn about sex for 
themselves in an environment that may be less than ideal, at a time in history 
when the stakes are great. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it through television and movies or magazines, or through uneducated, 
unprepared encounters on their own, our youth will happen upon expressions of 
human sexuality. Therein lies the deficiency of the Sex Respect curriculum. It 
is inevitable that from the onset of puberty, human beings will discover their 
own sexuality. So, while we still play an important role in the development of 
our children, why not teach them about sex in an open, sensitive way? Given the 
gravity of the matter, to do otherwise is both immoral and sinful.

COLUMN LEFT/ RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: FAIR WAGES AND STANDARDS SPUR GROWTH; WORKERS' 
RIGHTS SHOULDN'T BE ABANDONED IN GATT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN, Richard Rothstein is a research associate of the Economic 
Policy Institute and the author of The Global Hiring Hall in the spring issue 
of the American Prospect. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Morocco on Friday, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round 
will conclude when representatives of 121 nations initiate a new World Trade 
Organization. The deal almost fell through last week -- not because of last 
winter's high-profile issues like European restrictions on American films or 
subsidies for French farmers, but because of new demands by the Clinton 
Administration for negotiations on "international worker rights." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's insistence that developing nations enforce minimum-wage 
laws, abolish child labor and permit union organization goes beyond traditional 
concerns that low-wage imports destroy low-wage jobs at home. Rather, Clinton 
argues that American high-wage jobs won't expand without higher wages abroad: 
If Third World workers earn too little, they can't purchase what we make, 
annihilating purported benefits of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely reported in the United States, this initiative has caused a furor in 
Europe and the Third World. European Union trade minister Sir Leon Brittan 
denounced its "protectionism." Two weeks ago, developing nations rejected the 
U.S. demands, threatening the entire GATT deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the resistance was India, whose GATT ambassador claimed that 
restrictions on labor exploitation could undo seven years of progress. But 
India comes to the debate with a record that illustrates why Clinton is on the 
right track. 
</P>
<P>
 India's largest export industry is now handwoven carpets, manufactured by 
300,000 children between 6 and 15, often mortgaged by their parents to 
employers. India was not always a carpet exporter. Its industry developed after 
1970, when the shah of Iran prohibited child labor in his own country, causing 
carpet manufacture to migrate to Asia, where children could still be exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, carpets are made mostly in Uttar Pradesh, which adopted a "Child 
Labour Abolition and Regulation Act" in 1986. Yet not one employer has since 
been prosecuted for child labor abuses. In neighboring Pakistan, which shares 
in the carpet boom, about half of the children working in carpet factories die 
from malnutrition and disease before age 12, according to the International 
Labor Organization. One reason parents never redeem their children's mortgages 
is accumulating debts to employers for amphetamines that enable children to 
work long into the night. Such is the development path that India decries 
Clinton's attempt to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another opponent of labor standards has been Malaysia, which also comes to 
these debates without clean hands. At the behest of U.S. and Japanese 
electronics manufacturers, it prohibited electronics-workers' unions. And with 
no minimum-wage law, Malaysia grew in the 1980s to be the world's largest 
semiconductor exporter. Texas Instruments, Intel and National Semiconductor 
paid Malaysian girls 45 cents an hour for unskilled work. The Malaysian 
American Electronics Industry Society said member firms would move if unions 
were authorized. It's too bad that Malaysia doesn't welcome the Clinton 
initiative to protect it from such blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor last week responded to critics who 
argue that sweatshops and child labor are part of development and that only 
economic growth unhindered by regulation can eventually raise standards. Kantor 
noted that U.S. wages began to increase and child labor was abolished not as 
the evolutionary consequence of development, but after decades of bitter 
political conflict. From 1917 to 1938, the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down 
minimum-wage and child-labor laws. Only after popular agitation and the 
appointment by Franklin Roosevelt of sympathetic justices were we able to 
prohibit child labor in factories and establish minimum-wage rules. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kantor was speaking in Washington, a compromise was worked out, allowing 
the Morocco meeting to proceed. It was agreed that labor-standards discussion 
will come later. If Clinton and Kantor are able to follow up, we may escape 
from our worldwide downward wage spiral in which nations (not only Iran, India 
and Malaysia, but also the United States) have to compete for investment with 
promises of ever lower wages and worker protections.  
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton pointed out in Brussels in January, "If we're going to open our 
borders and trade more and invest more with developing nations, we want to know 
that their working people will receive some of the benefits . . . Otherwise, 
they won't have increasing incomes, and they won't be able to buy our products 
and services." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor standards are not protectionist. They're an essential ingredient of 
worldwide economic growth.

AFRICA'S SALVATION LIES WITHIN ITSELF; CIVIL WARS: DESPOTS HAVE REFINED WHAT 
COLONISTS STARTED -- EXPLOITATION OF ETHNIC DIFFERENCES TO PERPETUATE THEIR 
REIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE B. N. AYITTEY, George B.N. Ayittey, a native of Ghana, is an 
associate professor of economics at the American University and president of 
the Free Africa Foundation, both in Washington. His book Africa Betrayed (St. 
Martin's Press) won a 1993 Mencken Award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To attribute the carnage in Rwanda and past massacres elsewhere in Africa to 
ancient tribal rivalries is unsatisfactory. These rivalries would always exist 
in Africa. The real cause is the exploitation of ethnic differences by 
autocratic governments to maintain their grip on power. The colonialists did 
this but, in the post-colonial period, despotic African heads of state refined 
the stratagem. Although Somalia is ethnically homogenous, former military 
dictators played one clan against another in attempts to perpetuate their rule. 
In Cameroon, Kenya, Sudan and other African countries, one tribe is played off 
against another, often resulting in violence and ruinous civil strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed when their plane 
burst into flames. The Rwandan government has said rocket fire brought down the 
plane. Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprian Ntaryamira of 
Burundi were returning from Tanzania, where they and other African leaders had 
been meeting in another attempt to end years of ethnic warfare in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths unleashed a wave of terror and carnage as disaffected elements of 
the army and police forces went on the rampage, murdering Rwanda's interim 
prime minister, three cabinet ministers, nuns, Jesuit priests and Belgian 
peace-keeping soldiers. Tens of thousands have been slain in the orgy of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two factors underlie Africa's never-ending political violence and civil wars 
that have devastated economies and produced human suffering on a massive scale 
and a horrendous refugee problem. (Africa's refugee count has reached 8 
million, not counting those trapped in their countries.) The first is the 
proliferation of oppressive dictatorships, concentration of political power in 
the hands of the state or one person and the absence of mechanisms for peaceful 
transfer of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, only four of the 53 African countries were democratic. Although this 
tiny number has grown to 13 since then, political tyranny is still the order of 
the day. Consequently in the vast majority of African nations, the only way to 
remove an incompetent, corrupt and oppressive regime from power is by waging a 
destructive civil war. Ironically, the overthrow of an oppressive regime does 
not end the violence or strife. A political vacuum emerges and fierce fighting 
erupts over the spoils of power or to fill the vacuum: Witness Ethiopia, 
Liberia, Somalia and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The second factor has been the near-total absence of mechanisms or 
institutions for peaceful resolution of conflicts. The Organization of African 
Unity, whose mandate is conflict resolution, shirked this responsibility for 
much of the post-colonial period. As a result, a minor political dispute can 
escalate into a full-blown civil conflagration and rage for years until foreign 
powers intervene to impose a settlement or mediation. Unfortunately, foreign 
intervention does not always work, as recent experience in Somali attests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Somali mission, though a magnanimous humanitarian endeavor, lacked an 
African input and was reactive, rather than preventive. The mantra should be 
prevention. The international community should not wait until the violence 
degenerates into wanton carnage and destruction before rushing in peacekeeping 
troops and evacuating trapped foreign-relief workers. Where civil strife exists 
in any African country, the world community should insist on an African 
solution. It must have the following elements: 
</P>
<P>
 * The adoption of transition programs for democratic rule. The rules must be 
fair to and accepted by all parties before the elections. All parties must 
agree to abide by the results. In Burundi and Rwanda, for example, a national 
conference of all leaders -- religious, political and traditional -- should be 
convened. In both countries, a special constitutional provision should be 
adopted to rotate the presidency. The army, police, civil service, judiciary, 
educational institutions and political parties should be de-tribalized. A 
permanent supra-national commission should be appointed for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 * The establishment of mechanisms for peaceful resolution of conflicts. A 
commission or panel of retired judges from neighboring countries should, with 
the blessing of the OAU, adjudicate political disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should these steps fail and war erupt, the OAU shall put together a 
peacekeeping force with troops from neighboring African countries. In Liberia, 
an OAU-backed peace initiative, supported with a $25-million U.S. grant, 
succeeded. The warring factions are being disarmed and an interim government 
will be installed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burundi and Rwanda, the U.N. Security Council should pass its peacekeeping 
mandate on to the OAU. The solution to the cycle of wars lies in Africa itself 
and the ultimate responsibility of saving Africa with its leaders. If they are 
not willing to save their continent, there is little the world community can 
do.

MAN'S ART VS. NATURE'S; DECISION NEAR ON WHAT WILL -- OR WON'T -- BEAUTIFY THE 
BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A longstanding feud over public art on Santa Monica's beaches is expected to 
be resolved Thursday by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Arts Commissioner Bruria Finkel said she will argue in favor of 
placing artwork on beaches, while Louise Gabriel, president of the historical 
society, will ask the panel to prohibit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pieces, such as "Singing Beach Chairs," are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Finkel and Gabriel have lengthy petitions to bolster their contention 
that people want -- or don't want -- the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them will go home unhappy. The way things are going, that is likely to 
be Gabriel, who has fought for years against Finkel's brainchild, Natural 
Elements Sculpture Park, a series of eight related pieces that are part of an 
overall coastal art plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel says the sculpture garden complements nature and encourages public 
interaction with art. A trip to the beach "is not just sand in your sandwich," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel and her supporters are equally vehement in maintaining that the 
beaches' natural beauty is best left unadorned. Works of art "distract from the 
magnificent scenic view of Santa Monica Bay," Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has already lost a round with the Santa Monica City Council, which last 
year voted 6 to 1 to approve a comprehensive plan that called for 16 pieces of 
art along the coast, 13 of them at the shoreline. The council acted at the 
request of the Coastal Commission, which balked at approving the beach artwork 
on a piecemeal basis in 1989, saying it was impossible to ascertain the 
cumulative impact. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the council and the commission had already given the go-ahead to 
several pieces, including "Singing Beach Chairs" and "Art Tool." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs, on the sand close to the roadway north of Pico Boulevard, resemble 
lifeguard chairs and make sounds like a pipe organ when wind blows through 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is "Art Tool," a 12-ton concrete roller with an intricate relief 
pattern of a cityscape. When pulled by a tractor, it imprints the cityscape on 
the sand. Most of the time, the roller sits inside a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission staff is recommending approval of the city's art plan, 
which includes three more controversial works of art. But the staff suggests 
requiring separate approval by the commission for any further projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The three pending projects are a 14-foot statue of Mahatma Gandhi for Pacific 
Palisades Park; "Solar Web," a 52-foot-wide metal jungle-gym-like sculpture for 
the south beach area, and "Twilight and Yearning," featuring fishing boats 
strapped to pilings beneath the Santa Monica Pier. Finkel said this last work 
signifies the polluted state of the ocean; the boats will be unshackled when 
the pollution is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission staff report said the three proposed works do not 
impede public access to the beach, nor would they detract significantly from 
the views. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Robert T. Holbrook, who cast the lone vote against the plan, 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone in the world ever came to Palisades Park to look at the 
statuary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission public hearing is at 9 a.m. at Crown Plaza Holiday Inn, 
5985 W. Century Blvd., Los Angeles.

CITY SHOOTS DOWN HOME PERMITS FOR GUN DEALERS; FIREARMS: THE MOVE IN SANTA 
MONICA IS PART OF A GROWING TREND BY CITIES TO EXERT CONTROL OVER THE 
PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has voted unanimously to put home gun dealers 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 When the approximately 20 Santa Monica residents who sell guns out of their 
homes seek to renew their city permits on July 1, they will be told their 
business has been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to ban home gun dealers was made last month by City Councilman 
Kelly Olsen. It is based on similar laws enacted by Oakland, Berkeley and San 
Francisco. All are part of a recent effort by local jurisdictions to exercie 
what control they can over the proliferation of guns, which are usually 
regulated by federal and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a recent National League of Cities conference, there were various sessions 
on this very topic," said Assistant City Atty. Joseph Lawrence. "It's also part 
of a Justice Department and Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Department attempt to 
further clamp down on the availability of guns." 
</P>
<P>
 A second part of the new ordinance establishes strict guidelines for anyone 
who wants to open a gun shop in the city's commercial areas. It gives the 
police chief broad authority to screen applicants and provides strict security 
measures to protect the store's guns and ammunition from theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the dealers' operating permit will have to be renewed by the city 
every year and no gun shops will be allowed within 1,500 feet of schools, day 
care centers or each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to its usual lengthy discourse on issues, the council passed the 
emergency measure almost without comment.

 Students from ethnically diverse Fairfax and Hamilton high schools met last 
weekend to discuss race relations at a retreat sponsored by the National 
Conference (formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews). The 
three-day retreat, held at a campsite in Glendale, is part of a yearlong 
program to reduce racial tensions at area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although participants generally reported the meeting was illuminating, a few 
complained about the rigid structure imposed by adult organizers. But no one 
debated the need for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gave students an opportunity to cop to secretly held feelings they don't 
often have an opportunity to express," said Lecia Brooks, a program specialist 
at the National Conference who coordinated the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fairfax and Hamilton have been shaken by violence in recent years. In 
October, 1992, just months after citywide rioting, police and throngs of 
parents gathered at Hamilton after a minor melee had erupted between black and 
Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfax the following January, a visiting student accidentally shot and 
killed a 16-year-old classmate. The death marked the first time a Los Angeles 
Unified School District student had been killed in class and revived a debate 
over whether metal detectors should be used to screen students for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A diverse student body at both schools makes them fertile ground for a 
discussion of race relations. With an enrollment of 1,722, Fairfax is 39% 
Latino, 28% white and 16% black. Hamilton, with 1,579 students, is 43% black, 
39% Latino and 10% white. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, teachers at the two schools, as well as at San Gabriel 
High School, invited the National Conference to develop a program promoting 
racial understanding. Each school has implemented the program as part of ethnic 
studies or literature classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-nine students participated in the Glendale retreat, which was part of 
the program. Organizers developed a number of exercises to make students aware 
of their racial attitudes and biases. In one exercise, Brooks said, students 
had a "structured speak-out" in which they went around the room and told what 
they found most shocking or irritating about people of another color. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said the exercises, while well-intentioned, were "superficial." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were too structured," said Charki Sanders, a 16-year-old Hamilton 
junior who has a white mother and a black father. "At one point, we asked if we 
could have an open forum, and (the organizers) denied (the request) and said 
they weren't prepared. Well, I think the truth comes out when things aren't 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet students still appreciated a chance to clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people just came to hear about one another," said Gina Mirmova, a 
17-year-old Fairfax senior whose family immigrated from Russia. "There was no 
tension with each other. All of us felt equal."

PEOPLE: DAILY PLANET CUB REPORTER'S WORLD IS A STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN K. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Olsen is writing again. But these days he's not after scoops. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Larson, who portrayed the overeager Daily Planet cub reporter in the 
"Adventures of Superman" series of the 1950s, now spends his time in Brentwood 
spinning out plays and working behind the scenes on films. 
</P>
<P>
 At 61, and out of television and film for decades, he has been a successful 
poet, playwright and film producer since shortly after leaving the show, which 
went off the air in 1959 after George Reeves, who portrayed Superman, committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Olsen's familiar tweed coat, sweater-vest and bow tie are long gone, 
Larson's close-cropped hair hints of the character that brought him fame and 
still appears in syndicated reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Larson focuses on his stage pieces, which include the recent 
"Colors for Anna." The musical about an old woman who lives her life mourning 
the death many years ago of her husband opened last week in Boston, and Larson 
hopes it eventually will come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also writing "The Astronaut's Tale," an hour-long musical play about a 
young boy who wants to become the first man on Mars. And he is co-producing 
"Desert Rose," a film about a 40-year-old Las Vegas showgirl facing the end of 
her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, one of Larson's favorite achievements, the opera "Lord Byron," was 
recorded by conductor James Bolle and the Monadnock Festival Orchestra. 
Favorably reviewed in the New York Times, "Lord Byron" is selling briskly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larson has not forgotten his Jimmy Olsen days, and he is resigned to the 
idea that his association with the character known for the signature 
exclamation "jeepers!" is unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reeves and Larson were typecast by their "Superman" roles, making it 
difficult for them to land other parts. Larson appeared in a "Gomer Pyle" 
episode in 1974, then retired from acting and turned to serious writing -- an 
aspiration that stems from his boyhood days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was editor of the school paper at Eastmont Junior High School in 
Montebello," said Larson, who was born not far from Los Angeles City Hall 
(which served as the Daily Planet building in the "Superman" series). "I 
thought I might want to be a newspaperman." 
</P>
<P>
 But Larson didn't stay in school. Instead he began hanging out at bowling 
alleys and dropped out of school for a short time before entering a program at 
Pasadena Junior College to work toward a high school diploma. It was there that 
he was discovered by talent scouts from Warner Brothers and quickly landed a 
role in the 1948 film "Fighter Squadron." And the world lost a budding 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until 1951, when, at 18, Larson was offered the role of the exuberant 
Jimmy Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It instantly became a big hit, and I became Jimmy Olsen," he said, adding 
that the part "typed me and absolutely ruined my acting career -- though it 
didn't ruin me as a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
 To play Olsen, he said, "was very fortunate." But he added: "At first I was 
driven nuts by it, because everybody thinks you're Jimmy. It was a nightmare 
originally, and I saw that I was being typed." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to reverse that typing so that he could pursue other interests, 
Larson stopped giving interviews until the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 He focused on his writing career, getting his big break in 1966 when the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art asked Larson to write a play opening at the new 
Bing Center Theater. The result was "The Candied House," a critical success 
that retold the Hansel and Gretel story in verse. 
</P>
<P>
 Other successes followed, including "Chuck," the story of a magazine 
salesman's encounter with a television-fixated woman, in 1967, and the gay 
domestic drama "Cherry, Larry, Sandy, Doris, Joan, Paul," the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, composer Virgil Thomson was looking for someone to write a libretto 
for his opera, "Lord Byron." He chose Larson to develop what would become the 
writer's proudest work -- and one that was commissioned by the Metropolitan 
Opera. Directed by Oscar-winning actor John Houseman, "Lord Byron" premiered in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Larson teamed with longtime friend James Bridges to co-produce "Mike's 
Murder," starring Debra Winger, in 1984; "Perfect," with John Travolta, in 
1985, and "Bright Lights, Big City," starring Michael J. Fox, in 1988. He also 
helped develop the script for "The China Syndrome" in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Larson has overcome the fear that the Jimmy Olsen association 
would hinder his other interests, going so far as to host a number of 
"Superman" marathons for a New York television station. 
</P>
<P>
 And he hasn't ruled out an appearance in "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman," which airs Sunday evenings on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good show, well cast, but very different than ours and you can't 
compare them," Larson said. "Their show is a romance and ours was an action 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 But writing, he vowed, will dominate his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that, though I go on writing, and if I should win the Pulitzer Prize, 
and indeed the Nobel Prize, when they write my obituary it will say, 'Jack 
Larson, best remembered as Jimmy Olsen on the popular 1950s Superman series.' 
I'm pleased with it, I'm proud of it, and I would certainly do it again in 
hindsight. It's nice not to be forgotten."

COMMUNITY NEWS: KOREATOWN; A MARRIAGE THAT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preparation for their parents' recent wedding anniversary, Chan-Yong Kim 
and his brother and sister decided to look up the traditional anniversary 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 The list says silver for the 25th anniversary; gold for the 50th. If a couple 
makes it to 60 years, it's their diamond anniversary. But what about after 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knew . . . " Kim said. "I guess no one figured that any couple would 
be married beyond 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, recently, Kim's father, Jae-Ok Kim, and mother, Ok-Sun Kim, of Koreatown 
celebrated a union that has spanned three-quarters of a century and two 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember ever having a fight," said Ok-Sun Kim, who at 87 is a year 
older than her husband. As was the custom at the time in their native Korea, 
the marriage was arranged by the couple's parents. She was 12, he was 11, 
although they did not live together as husband and wife until they were in 
their 20s, said Chan-Yong Kim, 60, the oldest of the couple's three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, parents made the arrangements so as not to lose the 
opportunity for having a good son-in-law or a good daughter-in-law," explained 
Chan-Yong Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wedding, the couple lived at his parents' house near the city of 
Kaesong, now in North Korea. With the outbreak of the Korean War, the family 
fled to the port city of Inchon and then moved to Seoul in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the couple moved to Southern California, where their children were 
pursuing educations and careers. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved into an apartment building in Koreatown, where they became active 
in a Korean senior citizens' group and their church. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many older Korean couples, the Kims can occasionally be seen holding 
hands when they walk down the street, said Kyung-Yong Kim, their second son. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan-Yong Kim, who runs a tae kwon do school in Cerritos, sees his parents as 
role models for couples: "Maybe times aren't always happy, but when an 
unfavorable situation develops, rather than saying, 'The heck with it,' there's 
always a way . . . to work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Guinness Book of World Records lists two couples who were married for 86 
years, so the Kims have a goal. In the meantime, Ok-Sun Kim has a simple plan: 
"After all these years, my responsibility is to continue to love my husband, 
never hurt his feelings and make sure he eats well." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: HANCOCK PARK; HISTORIC LIBRARY GETTING SHORED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Work began last week on the renovation and expansion of the John C. Fremont 
Branch Library, a historic building closed since 1990 because its masonry did 
not meet seismic safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, paid with library bond funds from 1989's Proposition 1, will cost 
about $2.9 million.In addition to seismic reinforcement, the work will add 
6,000 square feet of parking and library space. Improvements will include air 
conditioning, carpeting, a computerized book catalogue and better accessibility 
for disabled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1927, the library combines elements of Italian- and Spanish-style 
architecture. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is 
one of the city's historic cultural monuments. The library is named after the 
noted explorer, soldier and politician John C. Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the closure of the building at 6121 Melrose Ave., the library has been 
operating out of temporary quarters at 736 La Brea Ave.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MALIBU: Civic center property owners have appealed a Superior Court decision 
upholding a municipal law restricting development, throwing one of the city's 
most contentious and costly land-use lawsuits back into court. Allan J. Abshez, 
attorney for the Malibu Village Civic Assn., a group of 15 civic center 
landholders who had sued the city to clear the way for a mixed-use residential 
and commercial project, said the state Court of Appeal will hear the case in 
six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Village Civic Assn. sued the city last year, charging that the 
city's February, 1993, interim zoning law was invalid because the council did 
not follow proper procedures in adopting it. The association has been concerned 
that the ordinance, which outlaws development, would become part of the city's 
General Plan, which is due for adoption in November.

ELECTIONS '94: DAY OF SURPRISES; BEVERLY HILLS; FAVORED INCUMBENT IS OUSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He had seemed one of the most deeply entrenched of the Westside city council 
incumbents up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why Beverly Hills Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum's defeat was 
perhaps the most surprising of Tuesday's political upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum not only had won his two earlier council campaigns, he had been the 
city's top vote-getter in both contests. But Tanenbaum, 51, fell dramatically 
short in his bid for a third four-year term -- despite endorsements from 
high-profile residents including actor Jack Lemmon and MCA President Sidney 
Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race Tuesday for two seats on the five-member council, he was ousted by 
first-time council candidates MeraLee Goldman, a former planning commissioner 
who has served 18 years on various city commissions, and Les Bronte, a former 
Chamber of Commerce president and longtime community leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum declined Wednesday to speculate on what may have caused his defeat, 
saying only that he would have done nothing different during the campaign. 
"There are no guarantees" when running for political office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldman, Bronte and outgoing Mayor Maxwell Salter -- a longtime foe of 
Tanenbaum who decided not to run for reelection -- had plenty to say about the 
incumbent's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who contributed heavily to a group that organized opposition to 
Tanenbaum, said the councilman lost in part because he failed to accept 
responsibility for the financial problems of the Beverly Hills Family Y, where 
Tanenbaum is president of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the aggressive style of Tanenbaum, a former New York prosecutor 
known for his courtroom-style oratory and for grilling those who appear before 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason offered for the upset was Tanenbaum's failure to win an 
endorsement from the Beverly Hills Police Officers Assn. The union gave its 
endorsement to Goldman and Bronte, ending what the union called a tradition of 
endorsing incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's decision came in part because Tanenbaum, in a surprising break 
with all seven of the other candidates, said the city should put more of its 
existing 128-member police force on the street rather than hiring additional 
officers. He angered the union with campaign remarks that the city should focus 
more of its support on officers in the field and "not add more police desk 
jockeys in suits." 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety was certainly the No. 1 issue," said Goldman, 60, who made 
hiring 10 more officers the centerpiece of her campaign. "The police are very 
precious to this community. Their endorsement is not easily made and not 
capricious. I think the community took it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte also cited Tanenbaum's tension with the police department. And he and 
Goldman said there was a widespread feeling among voters that two terms was 
enough. Said Goldman: "People believe in term limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, the top vote-getter in the race, said her immediate goal on the 
council is to comb through the city's $75-million budget, using volunteer 
financial advisers to find money to hire more police. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte said he plans to listen and learn -- and "make sure the police and fire 
departments have the best of everything to do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte, 58, said he also wants to see the city make a concerted effort toward 
improving its earthquake preparedness program. He said he would like to see 
every home inspected by the building and safety department for a modest fee to 
help residents determine what they need to improve their disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, who lost a 1992 bid for Los Angeles County district attorney, 
declined to say whether he will seek public office again. But the ousted 
incumbent, who has written several novels drawing on his experiences as a 
prosecutor, said he intends to do more writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've put off some major book tours," he said.

ELECTIONS '94: DAY OF SURPRISES; CULVER CITY; AFTER 16 YEARS, CITY CLERK IS 
COUNTED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 16 years she was a fixture in Culver City municipal government, never once 
drawing an Election Day challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, that is. On Tuesday, longtime incumbent Pauline C. Dolce went 
down to defeat in a surprising loss to Tom Crunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City voters also approved two ballot measures and picked a pair of City 
Council members Tuesday. Incumbent Mike Balkman was elected to a second 
four-year term, and Planning Commissioner Ed Wolkowitz won the other council 
seat up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drama was in the clerk's contest. Crunk, a computer consultant, 
prevailed after a contentious campaign, winning nearly 60% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 During candidate forums, it had appeared that Dolce, 73, had the solid support 
of senior citizens, a powerful force in Culver City politics. But Crunk, 37, 
said his victory showed that voters of all ages want a fresh approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the fact there is a large senior citizens vote, I must have received 
a large chunk of that vote," he said. "(Senior citizens) must have felt it was 
time for a change too." 
</P>
<P>
 As Crunk celebrated Tuesday night, the scene in Dolce's office resembled a 
wake. "I can't believe this," one of her staffers said indignantly. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, city employees filed into Dolce's office, some wiping away tears 
and hugging the outgoing city clerk, who dabbed at her reddened eyes with a 
tissue. Dolce declined to comment on her defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's race, a boring affair in most municipal elections, generated 
interest in Culver City after Crunk drew attention to Dolce's $75,000 annual 
salary, which he called excessive. Crunk supported -- and Dolce strongly 
opposed -- a recent council decision to cut the clerk's salary to $732 a month, 
or about $9,000 a year, starting in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Crunk said that as clerk, he will press the council to make the decrease 
effective immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 That would not be the only change affecting the clerk's office. Tuesday, 
voters approved a ballot measure transferring the city clerk's accounting and 
financial responsibilities to the city treasurer's department, also effective 
in 1996. The proposal was made by council members Steve Gourley and Al Vera as 
a cost-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also approved a ballot measure limiting council members to two 
consecutive four-year terms, a proposal that was widely expected to pass but 
was opposed by the two victors in the council race, Balkman and Wolkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's election, 22% of the city's 21,716 registered voters cast 
ballots, 7% fewer than in the previous city election, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ballots were counted, Balkman said his victory reflected support for 
renewal projects under way in the city, which include renovation of the 
downtown area. "It just proves that people applaud the accomplishments of the 
last four years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolkowitz said he hopes to use his new office to improve Culver City's image. 
During the campaign, he often remarked that the city is seen as a "backwater" 
that is hostile to business.

ELECTIONS '94: DAY OF SURPRISES; MALIBU; MODERATES JENNINGS, HARLOW WIN SEATS 
ON CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Candidates who promoted themselves as moderates on growth and defenders of 
property rights have won election to the Malibu City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent John Harlow and Jeff Jennings, an attorney, defeated four other 
candidates, including Councilman Walt Keller, in the Tuesday election for two 
seats. They will serve four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put an end to the idea that if you don't agree with one faction in Malibu, 
you're considered pro-development, but I still don't have a majority on the 
council," said Harlow, a retired Hughes Aircraft manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlow and Jennings garnered support from a cross-section of residents, 
including architects and members of the private-property rights group FED-UP. 
They beat out Keller, who finished 37 votes behind Jennings and 269 behind 
Harlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller and candidate Tom Hasse had been endorsed by Mayor Carolyn Van Horn and 
Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Kramer, who won election in 1992 with the backing of the 
Malibu Grassroots Movement, a powerful political group advocating slow growth 
that disbanded after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome Tuesday means that three instead of four council members advocate 
stringent restrictions on the construction of single-family homes and other 
growth concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 During Harlow's two years on the council -- he was appointed to finish the 
unexpired term of resigning Mayor Larry Wan -- he has often been the lone 
dissenter on votes concerning such issues as settling litigation with 
developers to avert high legal costs, loosening building restrictions on 
single-family homes and asking for regular budget reports from the city's 
finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 On several issues, Jennings tends to agree with Harlow, who had been dubbed 
"the lone ranger" by candidate Louis Ragsdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of concern out there about the direction the city is moving in 
and this shows a shift," said Jennings, referring to the slate of slow-growth 
advocates who won election in 1992. "I hope to forge a coalition and lower the 
level of anxiety in this town over distrust of city government. But I think 
Malibu will look very much like it does now, but people will be more 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said he will ask for a recount of the ballots if official results show 
a close margin between him and Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, on the council since cityhood and a principal architect of the city's 
policies, and Hasse were endorsed by a group calling themselves the "real slow 
growth advocates," many of whom formerly belonged to the Malibu Grassroots 
Movement.

ELECTIONS '94: DAY OF SURPRISES; WEST HOLLYWOOD; MARTIN, HEILMAN, GUARRIELLO 
WIN CROWDED COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Hollywood voters stayed with familiar faces in Tuesday's City Council 
election but broke up a majority closely tied to the renters' rights group that 
has been the local kingmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Martin, a lawyer and gay activist who narrowly lost a council bid in 
1990, collected the most votes in the race, for four-year terms in three 
available seats. Also winning were incumbents John Heilman and Sal Guarriello. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign -- though crowded with 11 candidates -- failed to create much 
excitement. Only a fifth of the city's 21,600 registered voters went to the 
polls -- the lowest turnout for a regular municipal election since cityhood in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, a member of the city's rent board, became the second politician to 
join the council without the endorsement of the renters' group, the Coalition 
for Economic Survival. He ran strongly throughout the city, gathering 2,144 
votes -- about half of the ballots cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Heilman was second with 2,020, and Guarriello garnered 1,778. Guarriello's win 
eliminated the possibility of the city having its first gay council majority 
since 1986. Everyone in the race except Guarriello was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The big news was the inability of Heilman and CES, a group whose touch has 
been golden in West Hollywood politics, to produce a win for Jeff Richmond, who 
came in fourth with 1,566 votes. Richmond, head of the city's Planning 
Commission and Heilman's running mate, was the first CES-endorsed candidate to 
lose since the city was established. Heilman was backed by CES. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond said he simply was known by too few voters. Others, however, wondered 
aloud whether CES -- architect of the city's rent-control law -- was losing 
clout as a political machine. The group has lost some of its activist base 
among senior citizens because of death or illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The election) demonstrates that John Heilman has no coattails, that the CES 
coattails are very short," said Jeffrey Prang, chairman of Martin's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Though rent control is under attack at the state level, it faces no local 
threat. All five members of the new council back the rent law and all but 
Martin have won CES support in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote dissolves a council majority made up of Heilman, Abbe Land and 
Babette Lang -- who did not seek reelection. Martin said he may serve as the 
council's "referee." Guarriello often goes his own way, and Councilman Paul 
Koretz did not always side with the previous majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a multi-polar council," Martin declared after the vote. "It's a whole 
new ballgame now." 
</P>
<P>
 The first task is closing a budget shortfall next year projected to be at 
least $1 million. Throughout the campaign, Martin called for streamlining City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's look could change again soon. Koretz and Land are running for 
state Assembly.

COVER STORY; THE JAVA JUNGLE; IN A MARKET AWASH WITH COFFEEHOUSES, REGULAR JOES 
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SLUGGING IT OUT WITH THE INDUSTRY'S CORPORATE BEHEMOTH. 
OWNERS HOPE THAT FINDING THEI NEIGHBORHOOD NICHE WILL KEEP THEM AFLOAT.

<P>
 It's precisely the sort of business imbroglio that made Doreen Stur gis ditch 
corporate life in the first place. An MBA and former management consultant who 
opted out to open a neighborhood coffeehouse in Santa Monica, Sturgis now finds 
herself pitted against a company Fortune magazine named one of the fastest 
growing in America: Starbucks, which has just opened an outlet within a block 
of her and plans to open another within the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the filling of a Starbucks sandwich," said Sturgis, who's puzzled and 
angry at the competition the Seattle-based corporation has brought to the Third 
Street Promenade in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's franchise opened two weeks ago and already business at Sturgis' 
Congo Square Espresso and Tea House has taken a noticeable slide. "We've felt 
more effects since they've opened than we have in three years," she said. "We'd 
like to stay but . . . how are we going to handle competing against two?" 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a new decade makes. Five years ago, when many believed the 
only decent cup of (American) coffee to be found on the Westside was at the 
Apple Pan on Pico Boulevard, and when many people assumed macchiatto was a new 
Italian sports car and espresso was how fast your pizza got delivered, 
coffeehouses were thought to exist only on cobbled European avenues or in the 
funkier stretches of San Francisco. Sitting over tiny white cups of dark, 
bitter brew was considered too languorous and "bohemian" for the muscular, 
upscale 1980s -- at least in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, of course, with Angelenos, and particularly Westsiders, embracing 
coffeehouses with the zeal of converts, it's hard to recall those 
pre-caffeinated times. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 230 coffeehouses in Greater Los Angeles, nearly 100 are 
clustered on the Westside, according to "Caffe L.A.," a recently published 
comprehensive listing of cafes, coffeehouses and merchants. Many opened in the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 With decor and ambience ranging from shabby to chic to shabby-chic, 
coffeehouses have become the perfect hangout for Generation X slackers long on 
time and short on prospects, the city's coterie of artists and those simply 
longing for a sense of community or a place to chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more coffeehouses than mini-malls at the current moment," quipped 
Toby Berlin, who, as executive director of the Learning Annex in West Los 
Angeles, is in a unique position to analyze the area's social and cultural 
Zeitgeist. Four months ago, the Learning Annex began offering a three-hour, $49 
course on how to open a coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Taught once monthly the popular course typically has an enrollment of more 
than 70 students. "It doesn't look to be a trend that's maxed-out," Berlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the multitude of activities available for Angelenos, why are 
coffeehouses, the symbol of laid-back introspection, suddenly flourishing? 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanni Natale, 45, who has patronized the Novel Cafe in Santa Monica about 
five times a week since it opened four years ago, has a ready answer: "In a 
city where you just see people from the shoulders up in their cars, people need 
to feel like they're part of a community." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Natale, a schoolteacher and massage therapist: "This is my extended 
living room." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the new social watering holes," concurred Ted Lingle of the Specialty 
Coffee Assn. of America, a Long Beach-based organization of coffee exporters, 
roasters and producers, which estimates that by 1999, there will be 10,000 
coffeehouses nationwide, grossing $1.5 billion in sales. In 1989, the latest 
figures available from the organization, there were 200 with $70 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics say that most of those will likely be Starbucks, a jest that to some 
has an uncomfortable ring of truth to it. Indeed, since opening its first 
Southern California store near the Beverly Center in August, 1991, the 
corporation has made an assault on the Southland, introducing 35 coffeehouses 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Nine of those franchises are on the 
Westside, including four in Santa Monica, and more are on the way. Nationally, 
Starbucks has 304 locations, and opens about two stores per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Such expansion has earned the company and its coffee a considerable amount of 
derision from independent coffeehouse proprietors as well as the dismissive 
sobriquet "McCoffee." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the McDonald's of coffeehouses," said Anastasia Israel, owner of 
Anastasia's Asylum in Santa Monica. "They have it down to a science. They're 
stark, they're sterile, there's no fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Sturgis: "They appeal to people who want a safe product, . . . 
something dependable." 
</P>
<P>
 More upsetting to independent owners, however, is the manner in which the 
corporation has spread throughout the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some independent proprietors, Starbucks not only has blanketed 
the area with stores, but has situated them near already-existing coffeehouses 
to siphon off customers. "They're fairly predatory in their locations," said 
Richard Karno, owner of the Novel Cafe, which is two blocks from the Starbucks 
on Main Street. "They pick the area that's already been paved by a couple of 
coffeehouses and take over the most expensive corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Starbucks officials deny that the company intentionally locates near 
established coffeehouses, saying that a variety of factors determine where the 
corporation opens franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't deny, however, that a certain amount of uniformity goes into every 
brewed cup, a tactic essential to the appeal of Starbucks, which last year 
grossed $93 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can expect a consistent level of quality in every Starbucks that you walk 
into throughout the country," said Starbucks spokeswoman Laura Moix, who 
defines the company's mission as "offering a convenient, easily accessible 
store located in a downtown area or a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all independents resent Starbucks. Noting that the company has helped 
create a market for gourmet coffee, some endorse Starbucks' presence in the 
hope that as consumers' tastes become more sophisticated, they will eventually 
seek out smaller, even higher-quality roasters. At any rate, some independents 
say, the more gourmet coffee that is being brewed, the better it is for the 
overall market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starbucks does marketing for all of us," said Tom Kaplan, co-owner of 
Highland Grounds in Hollywood, who says that prior to Starbucks' entry into 
Southern California, he had spent 14 years promulgating gourmet coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They helped me tremendously," he said. "They did more in a few months than I 
ever could on my own. I was looking forward to them coming to town." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristie Martin, manager of Westwood's Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf -- itself a chain 
-- said: "There's room for everyone. Any coffeehouse that moves in next to us 
brings more business in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 The short run, however, is a different matter. While the average percentage of 
profit in a two-ounce shot of espresso is 1,463%, according to the Specialty 
Coffee Assn., proprietors say coffeehouses need a constant turnover of 
customers to make money, and high turnover goes against the nature of such 
establishments, in which customers like to linger. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's really easy but the bottom line is that it's a tough 
business," said Kaplan. "You can put together a coffeehouse fairly cheaply but 
how do you keep it open? How many places can sell 300 to 400 cappuccinos a day? 
Because that's what it takes to break even." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Karno of the Novel Cafe says he receives calls every week from 
proprietors wanting to unload their cafes. "It's getting tough out there," he 
said. "A lot of people who opened didn't have the success they thought they 
would have and now they're getting out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such competition, independent proprietors are putting greater 
emphasis on carving a niche. In contrast to the "gulp-and-go" aesthetic of 
Starbucks, which some see as the antithesis of a coffeehouse, cafes are 
increasingly beefing up menus beyond the typical biscotti and muffins with such 
items as soups and sandwiches. And they are relying more and more on live 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Open-mike poetry readings, plays and music ranging from folk to grunge are now 
de rigueur at many coffeehouses. Some of the trendiest places for new bands to 
play are in the intimate settings of cafes, instead of the usual Hollywood club 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bulk of our people are in for the environment, not just to get a quick 
cup of coffee," said Israel of Anastasia's Asylum. "It's a place where you come 
to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that will be enough to make coffeehouses a permanent part of the 
cityscape, or simply a fad, is still open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kaplan says that Angelenos' taste for gourmet coffee has been 
irrevocably changed -- "I don't see how people can go back to drink supermarket 
coffee after they've been exposed to this stuff" -- he anticipates that only 
about 20% of the existing coffeehouses will eventually survive. Kaplan hastens 
to add, though, that many of the cafes that will close are likely run by 
inexperienced owners who "know nothing about coffee and (who) buy a cappuccino 
machine and take coffee out of the can." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Sturgis foresees troublesome times. Like Karno, she is regularly 
approached by other coffeehouse owners wanting to sell their operations to her 
and leave the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the abundance of coffeehouses, Sturgis predicts that within the 
next year the industry may be headed for a mini shakeout, or at least a 
"fundamental shift" in how coffeehouses and cafes operate. 
</P>
<P>
 And she and other owners are ever-mindful of the notion of Los Angeles as a 
city that seemingly celebrates and discards its trends within the same day. 
Already, the faddishness of coffee has been parodied, most famously in a scene 
from "L.A. Story" with Steve Martin in which a group of diners besiege a waiter 
with demands for complicated concoctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from Berkeley, where the coffeehouses last forever," said Sturgis. "I 
was hoping that here, coffeehouses wouldn't be like the latest club and just a 
passing fancy. It's a lot more competitive but I'm hoping that they can stay 
around."

OUT AND ABOUT / SORRENTO'S MARKET: KEEPING GOOD FOOD IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before trendy pasta restaurants began sprouting up on the Westside, 
Sorrento's Market was quietly selling authentic Italian food. Since 1963, in 
fact, the store has offered variety after variety of olives, cheeses, meats and 
other products, many of which are imported from Italy or made fresh locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality is high -- but not the prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kept my prices very low so people can shop here every day," said owner 
Albert Vera, a longtime Culver City resident and currently the city's vice 
mayor. "Our prices are cheaper than any chains in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, customers from throughout the Los Angeles area have cruised the 
store's narrow aisles, looking for such staples as pasta, breads and olive oils 
and for gourmet items including Italian truffles, caper nuts and specialty 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrento's also caters events and has a full-service deli. At lunchtime, the 
store fills with shoppers ranging from students to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that it's authentic Italian food," said Gonzo Sandoval, an 
office worker who stopped by on a recent Friday to order a pastrami sandwich. 
"The food is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera, who was born in a small village near Pompeii, Italy, came to Southern 
California at the age of 15. After graduating from high school and serving in 
the Army, he returned to Los Angeles and began selling imported Italian goods. 
Driving an old truck, he operated a "grocery store on wheels" and traveled 
between San Diego and Fresno distributing specialty items. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Vera decided it was time to open a place of his own. He settled on 
a small shop near the intersection of Jefferson and Sepulveda boulevards in 
Culver City. Paying homage to his native homeland, he named the store in honor 
of the Italian folk song "Come Back to Sorrento." 
</P>
<P>
 The huge success of this mom-and-pop store allowed Vera to purchase a large 
tract of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley for olive production. Using old 
family recipes, he markets his own line of olive oils, salad dressings and 
pasta sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the store is still family owned and operated by Vera, his wife, Ursula, 
and his two sons. Not much has changed since it opened -- the family still 
rings up customers' bills on a punch-key cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in (keeping) the family atmosphere in the store," said Vera. "I 
want to keep that personal feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrento's Market, 5518 Sepulveda Blvd., Culver City; (310) 391-7654. Hours 
are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.

HOMELESSNESS: ATTACK ON REPORTER'S FAIRNESS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marguerite Waller's complaint about the lack of reportorial balance in Nancy 
Hill-Holtzman's Metro section article ("Santa Monica Tangles With Homeless 
Issue," March 29) is laughable. Accusing Hill-Holtzman of an abandonment of the 
journalistic principle of balance, Waller engages in the most base forms of 
propaganda -- distorting the issue, failing to uncover facts and ignoring the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Waller characterizes all of the homeless as refugees from brutal economic 
changes worldwide. She totally ignores the countless cases of homelessness that 
are the product of the bad behavior and poor choices that accompany it -- the 
use of drugs, alcohol, and the cycle of dependency created by all the wonderful 
welfare programs of the '60s gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the female transient who defecated on the lawn at Roosevelt 
School did so -- or at least exposed those "pink panties" for the children to 
observe -- more than once. Because there may be few public lavatories in Santa 
Monica open 24 hours a day, does Waller imply that we should accept this 
behavior in front of our children as an appropriate response to the lack of 
facilities? 
</P>
<P>
 Any legitimate survey of the homeless in Santa Monica would reveal that 
Waller's assertion that many of them are longtime (previously housed) residents 
of the city is a complete fabrication. The word "many" has meaning: to wit, 
large numbers or a large percentage of the number. That is simply not the case. 
Many (with "meaning" intended) of us who were raised in Santa Monica and have 
had lifelong contact across generations of adults and youth (that also 
transcends race and economic status) can say that we have run into only a very, 
very few cases of homeless who are longtime Santa Monica residents. Some of us 
have seen none. 
</P>
<P>
 Waller's assertion that she, as an academic, was quoted while the comments of 
the homeless were ignored is amusing. As a professor, Waller is part of a 
self-described elite group in society that believes the "credentialed" are 
equipped to tell us how to live. Now she decries the fact that she is quoted 
while the subjects of the academic domain are ignored. Perhaps Hill-Holtzman -- 
an experienced writer, with a keen sense of observation -- simply selected 
those quotes that she felt most clearly described the tenor of the council 
session. The democratic process, of course, guarantees the right to free speech 
-- but it guarantees neither the right to listeners or the right to 
publication. The lack of general interest in newspapers published by the 
homeless is rather revealing about how enthused the public is about listening 
to their complaints. But ever the champion of "democratic process," Waller -- 
like most liberal academics -- would force us to read or hear another's "free 
speech" whether we wished to or not -- "freedom" once again sacrificed at the 
altar of "fairness."

NEWSPAPERS: NEW WESTSIDE TIMES FORMAT DISAPPOINTS SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time I received the newly formatted Westside section of the Los 
Angeles Times, I wanted to rip it up and send it back to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose bad idea was this? What possible reason could allow the degradation of a 
valued section into such a poor excuse for a community section? 
</P>
<P>
 To begin a tiresome list of complaints, the printing is atrocious with heavy 
bleed marks from dark ink on page after page. Often one has to turn the page 
countless times to read a single article on those weenie little pages. Don't we 
on the Westside deserve a quality section of the newspaper that actually looks 
like a newspaper rather than a cheap, throwaway shopper? 
</P>
<P>
 Last night I was at a community meeting and a large number of people became 
quite animated in their agreement about the inferior quality of this "new and 
improved" Westside section. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate it. Please reconsider your improvements and elevate this low-class rag 
to the rest of the paper's quality.

 TRIPLE DUTY 
</P>
<P>
 Malika Edmonson of St. Bernard High anchored the Vikings' 400-meter relay team 
to victory with a time of 47.74 seconds in the seeded race of the Arcadia 
Invitational last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman also finished third in the 400 in 55.63 in a race won by Monique 
Hennagan of Spring Valley, S.C., who finished in a meet-record 52.87. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonson also ran a leg on St. Bernard's 1,600-meter relay team, which was 
fourth in 3 minutes 51.22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' competition, a strong 1,600-meter anchor leg by Peter Gilmore 
paced the Palisades' distance medley relay team to a second-place finish in 
10:25.05. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairfax boys' team was fourth in the seeded 400 relay in 42.43. SIGNING 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long time since the Fairfax boys' basketball team had a standout 
such as former Lions Chris Mills or Sean Higgins, but they still managed to 
produce Division I prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Terryl Woolery, a 6-foot-4 transfer from Los Angeles, was the latest Lion to 
get a scholarship. Woolery will remain a Lion, only he will play for Loyola 
Marymount in the fall. REUNION 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills baseball team will hold a triple-header alumni baseball game 
April 23 at La Cienega Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The triple-header begins with an alumni game at 2 p.m. That game will be 
followed by 1976-84 alumni versus the Norman varsity at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The third game will feature 1985-93 teams coached by Bill Erickson against the 
varsity at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the noted alumni expected to compete include Tony Clark, Bobby Kay and 
Albie Silvera. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones from the class of 1937 is also expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually have 50 to 60 guys show up for this thing," Erickson said. POWER 
SHORTAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Heather Marshak pitched a three-hitter, striking out six 
against Peninsula. In most softball games, Marshak would expect to earn a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's top-seeded team, however, lost to Peninsula, 1-0, Thursday and 
dropped to No. 2 in this week's poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is hitting, that's the problem," Santa Monica Coach Debbie Skaggs 
said. "We've had no offensive power in the last three games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings' top power hitters -- second baseman Nicole Garland and catcher 
Michele Millard -- are in slumps. Skaggs is hopeful they will regain their form 
when the Vikings play three games against Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another outstanding pitcher this season has been Lisa Forst of Brentwood, who 
pitched a two-hitter and struck out 10 in a 11-1 victory over Delphic League 
rival Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Forst, a right-handed freshman, throws a ball that rises. 
</P>
<P>
 "She ranks among our top pitchers at Brentwood," Coach Penny Baizer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles are 3-6 overall and 1-0 in league. BACK TO FORM 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica baseball team needed a strong pitching performance from 
Frankie Gomez to snap a two-game losing streak in last week's San Luis Obispo 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez was scheduled to face a hard-hitting El Segundo team. Talk about 
pitching out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, however, was undaunted, pitching a complete game to beat El Segundo, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made them hit the ball on the ground and we made the plays," Santa Monica 
Coach Pete McKellar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez's performance woke up a sleepy club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that game will be the turning point of the season," McKellar said. 
"We played fundamentally sound. We moved runners along the bases and guys came 
up with big hits when we needed them. It was one of the better games we've 
played this season. After two losses, it was good to get a win against El 
Segundo." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings will be tested this week with two games against Inglewood and one 
against Peninsula. CAN'T BE STOPPED 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard leadoff hitter Dana Harrison continues to be on a hitting streak. 
Harrison went six for 10 with four stolen bases last week against tournament 
host St. Paul and La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has 23 hits in 48 at-bats for a .479 average with 20 runs scored and 
16 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the fastest man on earth," Coach Bob Yarnall said. "He turns a routine 
ground ball to shortstop and legs it out for a hit." MORE HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's talented forward Olympia Scott was selected to the Southern 
Section girls' super team for the second consecutive season, the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a 6-2 senior, was one of 10 players selected to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Also chosen were Timicha Kirby of Lynwood, Mimi McKinney of Peninsula, 
Michelle Giordano of Buena, Shannon Perry of Cerritos, Samantha Rigley of 
Alemany, Nicole Erickson of Brea-Olinda, Kristi Rohr of Santa Ynez, Carly 
Funicello of Alemany and Sara Hagemann of Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who averaged 18.8 points and 15 rebounds, was the Southern Section 
Division IV player of the year. SEAN WATERS

MARY LAINE YARBER: SUMMER JOBS DEVELOP MORE THAN A TEEN'S BANK ACCOUNT; MARY 
LAINE YARBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most Westside teens, summer is still dozens of homework assignments away. 
But those who want summer jobs had better start looking for them soon -- the 
competition is stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the country is experiencing varying degrees of relief from 
recession, California is still having a tough time. Even college graduates are 
invading segments of the job market (at $5 or $6 an hour) traditionally claimed 
by high-schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wise to begin checking out summer job possibilities now . 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate reason, of course, is to ensure you will have income for 
entertainment, family support, college, travel or other purposes. But summer 
work can also be educational in ways that classwork cannot. For example, 
students can learn job skills, develop social skills and discover which careers 
suit them. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, can help them choose classes the following school year. Some 
kinds of summer work, in fact, are counted as credit toward high school 
graduation. Jobs in food service and retail, which are especially popular among 
teens, may garner five or 10 credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a job -- even finding out about openings -- can seem daunting. Here 
are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 First, decide what kinds of work you are willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Then consider your ultimate career goal: Are there summer jobs in that field? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask family members, neighbors, friends, and teachers if they have heard of 
openings, and visit your school's career center for bulletins of available 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many teens overlook the newspaper's classified ads, which can lead you to 
real jobs much more quickly than does cold calling. But if you must cold call, 
try contacting big businesses that traditionally hire large numbers of 
teen-agers, such as hotel and retail chains, food chains and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have made a list of businesses to visit, pick up applications. It's 
important to dress well and go alone, even though you're just getting an 
application, so you appear serious and independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't fill in the original application until you've made a copy for use as a 
rough draft. That way, you can ensure the application you turn in will be free 
of errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Staple a typed resume to the application. There are plenty of books, pamphlets 
and workshops on how to write good resumes, but several points are worth 
mentioning here. Start the resume by describing the position you want. Be 
specific: If the description is too generic, the employer may think you're 
desperate and unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "experience" section of the resume, list any previous jobs you have 
held. If you have had none, don't worry -- most employers don't expect 
teen-agers to have much, if any, work experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The "skills" section should list all skills or talents that could possibly 
suit the job you want. Computer literacy and typing are especially attractive, 
so list them first. Don't fudge by listing skills you don't really have -- it's 
hard to fake typing 80 words a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 In an "other experience" section, describe briefly any volunteering, club, 
campus activity planning or school office-monitor work experience you have had. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress well when you deliver the application and resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The job interview is generally the most important factor in hiring, and that 
is why entire books are written on the subject. But, again, dress properly. 
Avoid bright or excessive makeup, sit up straight, don't chew gum, maintain eye 
contact and answer each question completely. Do not digress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring three letters of recommendation: one from a previous employer or 
volunteering supervisor, another from a teacher in your best academic subject, 
and a third in which an adult describes personal traits that would make you a 
good worker. Such traits may include punctuality, versatility and the ability 
to see jobs through and work without supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Your school's career center could save you time by providing you with leads on 
real jobs, guidance on which fields are right for you and help in writing 
resumes and interviewing. The center's staff can also help arrange for school 
credit and a work permit if you're under 16. 
</P>
<P>
 I also recommend a thorough but concise booklet published by the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education: "Job Finder's Guide: How to Obtain and Advance in 
the Job of Your Choice." For a copy, write to the office at 9300 Imperial 
Highway in Downey, 90242-2890. Mention Publication No. 91-2-11R.

REPORT FAULTS NSA OVER ITS WOMEN, MINORITY HIRING PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon's secret eavesdropping agency is years behind other federal 
agencies in hiring women and minorities and does a poor job handling complaints 
of discrimination, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon Inspector General Derek Vander Schaaf, in a 76-page report to 
Congress, said the National Security Agency has failed to increase its ranks of 
women and minorities significantly in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency "has not identified systemic problems and barriers faced by women 
and minorities in recruitment, hiring, promotion or career development," Vander 
Schaaf reported. The underrepresentation of women and minorities, he wrote, 
"will, in all probability, require years to correct." 
</P>
<P>
 The NSA, based at Ft. Meade, Md., is even more secretive than the CIA. It uses 
the most sophisticated technology to eavesdrop on foreign governments and 
military forces. Even the number of employees who work there is considered 
classified, although it has been reported at about 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities account for 11.6% of the NSA work force, compared with about 27% of 
the federal work force, according to 1993 statistics. The report found that 
minority representation at the NSA barely increased between 1989 and 1993, to 
11.6% from 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's own statistics show that 2.45% of employees at the highest pay 
grades are black, compared with 4.8% for the government as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, who make up 45.7% of the federal work force, accounted for 36.3% of NSA 
workers in 1993, down from 38.6% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the report found that the proportion of women and minorities among 
those hired last year rose to 20.7% from 13.6% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Top NSA officials not only agreed with the critical findings, but also set up 
a new equal employment opportunity plan to address its hiring and promotion 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. John M. McConnell, who has directed the agency since early 1992, 
told the House Intelligence Committee last fall that the NSA was in stiff 
competition with other agencies and industry for qualified minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior managers said the "major barrier affecting job opportunities for 
women and minorities is the attitude of the representatives who interview and 
select employees," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report found that NSA recruiters fell back on stereotypes to explain the 
low hiring levels of Latinos, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told it is a cultural problem -- that Hispanics are very close to 
their families and do not want to move away from them," the report noted. "In 
addition, they told us Hispanics do not complete and return the security forms 
because they have relatives who are illegal aliens or who live outside the 
United States."

LAWYERS DELIVER SUMMATIONS IN KING LAWSUIT; TRIAL: HIS ATTORNEY TELLS JURORS, 
"THIS IS A RACE CASE." THE DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY IMPLORES THEM TO "KEEP EMOTION 
OUT OF IT." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King was beaten by white policemen because he is black, his lawyer 
argued Wednesday, urging jurors to award him $15 million in a damage lawsuit he 
described as symbolic of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X -- these people were all in the 
civil rights movement voluntarily. (Rodney) King is a symbol involuntarily, but 
no less a symbol," said attorney Milton Grimes in his summation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a race case," Grimes said of the March 3, 1991, police beating that 
inflamed public anger and led to rioting in Los Angeles in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you can separate the Rodney King incident from black people, 
from African American people, from how we feel," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the city's case, Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent said the beating was 
not a racial matter and questioned whether a racial slur was really uttered 
during the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case about one word," he said. "This is not a case about racial 
slurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments were delivered in daylong summations by attorneys, after which 
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies instructed jurors in the law and gave them 
the case for deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 After jurors reach a compensatory damage figure, the second phase of the trial 
will address individual liability by officers and other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent suggested that the beating would not have occurred if King had not 
been drunk and had not broken the law when he led officers on a high-speed 
chase. He said King was not stopped because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes noted that an audio expert had isolated what sounded like the word 
nigger on the soundtrack of the beating videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close your eyes and listen to the tape," he implored jurors. "You can't close 
your eyes and pretend 'nigger' wasn't said on March 3, 1991, because you don't 
want to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said he could not hear the word on the soundtrack but suggested that 
if jurors do hear it, they should consider the feelings of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make the judgment it was said, think about the emotion of those 
officers," Vincent said. "Think of Rodney King saying he wanted to run . . . 
and think about one word. What is one word?" 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that a fair award would be $800,000, four times the medical costs 
incurred so far, but also offered a range of $500,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep emotion out of it," Vincent said. "This is a case where a 
person was stopped for violating the law. He was injured, and we will pay for 
those injuries. We want it to be fair to him and to the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 King's mother, Odessa, briefly disrupted Vincent's closing argument when he 
cited a piece of testimony by a witness who contradicted her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied," she called out, referring to the witness. Davies ordered her to 
leave. On her way out, she muttered: "It's all lies." 
</P>
<P>
 The city admitted liability for King's beating but rejected a demand for $9.6 
million to settle the case. King refused an offer of $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said $15 million would be fair compensation for pain, suffering and 
permanent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 King lives daily with the fear that he will develop more mental and physical 
problems, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes told the jury that King was dehumanized by the officers. "They beat him 
like a dog and then they took his pride away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes and Vincent were a study in contrasting styles. King's lawyer, wearing 
a bold red tie and handkerchief with a dark suit, was dramatic, speaking of 
ghosts haunting King and the history of black oppression. Vincent, a 
gray-haired man in a gray suit, was low-key and straightforward, concluding 
solemnly: "We trust you will do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were charged with King's beating and acquitted of most charges 
in a state trial, sparking the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. Two officers were 
later convicted of violating King's civil rights and sentenced to 30 months 
each in federal prison.

CARLTON DENIES HE MADE ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS 
</P>

<P>
 The baseball Hall of Fame has a new headache -- Steve Carlton, whose reported 
remarks on the "Elders of Zion" have angered Jewish groups who want the pitcher 
barred from the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, who spent most of his years in baseball without speaking to the 
media, denies making the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go until induction, and hopefully he will apologize or 
clarify his remarks," Ed Stack, the Hall of Fame's president, said Wednesday. 
"He's elected and he's going to be inducted." 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher set off the controversy with an interview printed in Philadelphia 
Magazine in which writer Pat Jordan quotes him as saying the "Elders of Zion," 
12 Jewish bankers in Switzerland, rule the world. 
</P>
<P>
 That led the American Jewish Congress in New York to ask that Carlton, elected 
to the Hall last January, be barred from induction until he apologizes. Carlton 
is scheduled to enter the shrine in Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton released a one-page statement through his former team, the 
Philadelphia Phillies, and to reporters in his hometown of Durango, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The article has almost no truth in it," Carlton said. "I reject it 
completely. It is wrong about my baseball career, my personal beliefs, my 
family life and my new hometown. I specifically deny saying anything that could 
be interpreted as offensive to Jewish people. I stand on my long record of 
treating all teammates and opponents with the same respect, be they Jewish, 
black or white." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton suggested that Jordan, while breathing the thin air in Durango, 
"became so disoriented that he lost his grasp on truth and decency." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, a free-lance writer and former contributor to Sports Illustrated, 
stood by his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went there and I wrote what he said and I don't care what he says," Jordan 
said from his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "I didn't invent this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Steve is a racist or an anti-Semite or anything like that. I 
think he's read too many books. Steve is one of the most fearful human beings I 
ever met."

 Chrysler CEO Plans Trip to China: Robert Eaton, Chrysler Corp. chairman and 
chief executive, expects to make the trip Friday to discuss Chrysler's proposal 
to establish a joint venture minivan plant there.Eaton said he does not expect 
his visit to result in an agreement in the immediate future. "I suspect this 
will drag on for months and months," he said. Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz are 
believed to be the two remaining auto makers vying for the lucrative joint 
venture. Some analysts say Chrysler may lose out to Mercedes-Benz if the United 
States revokes China's most-favored-nation trading status.

 Liza Dawson says she has a good life. 
</P>
<P>
 She gets up at 6:45 a.m., and her 6-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl get up 
shortly after. When she leaves her home in the suburbs to catch the 8:07 train 
to her job in New York City, a live-in nanny takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, a senior editor at William Morrow & Co., returns home about 10 1/2 
hours later. After the long day at work, her long night at home begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stressed out to the max, but I can't imagine life any other way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson's optimism may sound unique, but a new Gallup Poll says it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, commissioned by Working Mother magazine for its May issue, found 
working women to be increasingly satisfied with the balance in their lives 
between job and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallup polled 1,000 working mothers nationwide -- 500 chosen at random and 500 
selected as being committed to careers. The findings seem to contradict those 
of other studies reported recently in the media by experts in the work-family 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Those found many women -- and men -- to be uncomfortable with the long hours 
they spend on the job, often riddled with guilt about being away from their 
families and doing so only because they have to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media tend to pick up the negative side of women's lives," said Judsen 
Culbreth, editor-in-chief of Working Mother. "This study confirms what our own 
reader surveys have shown. Women are telling us, 'I like my life and I enjoy my 
job.' Working mothers are happy about their choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Gallup survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven of 10 women said they work because it makes them feel good about 
themselves, regardless of the job they do or how much money they earn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight of 10 working mothers said they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied 
with how their children were doing and how they were doing as mothers; 90% 
described their children as happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * From a woman who desnouts hogs in Missouri to a physics professor in 
Florida, 75% of the women said they "like" or "love" their jobs. Just 4% said 
they hate their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My congratulations to Working Mother for this survey," feminist author Betty 
Friedan said. Working Mothers

 Major findings of Working Mother magazine's Gallup Poll, contained in the May 
issue: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven of 10 women said they work because it makes them feel good about 
themselves, regardless of the job or how much they earn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight of 10 working mothers were "extremely" or "very" satisfied with how 
well their children were doing and with how they were doing as mothers; 90% 
described their children as happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three-quarters of the women said they "like" or "love" their jobs; 4% said 
they hate their work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mothers predicted sweeping social change in the next 20 years. 
Three-quarters of those polled said most schools will offer to care for 
children before and after school hours; 56% said most employers will provide 
child care at the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly nine of 10 women were concerned with getting paid what they were 
worth; just 4% said they were "not especially concerned about pay." 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight of 10 picked "providing for the family" as a major reason for taking a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most mothers said they see day care as a positive experience for their 
children. About 77% said their kids had gained social skills, 72% said their 
children improved their language skills, 68% said they learned more, and 56% 
said their children did better in school for having attended day care.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; IMAGINING HAITI THROUGH THE PRISM OF MANY LIVES; UNDER THE 
BONE BY ANNE-CHRISTINE D'ADESKY ; FARRAR, STRAUS AND GIROUX $20, 369 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nominally a novel, "Under The Bone" is actually a collage of literary 
techniques assembled to present a mural of contemporary Haitian life. 
</P>
<P>
 In that impoverished and exploited island country, anguish has a thousand 
shapes, misery a million forms. To convey that sad and almost infinite variety 
of suffering, the author uses reportage, drama, verse and fantasy, loosely 
linked by the observations of the narrator, an American employee of a human 
rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Doyle has come to Haiti to investigate the false imprisonments, 
beatings and murders that have continued long after the death of the tyrannical 
"President for Life" Francois Duvalier and the exile of his corrupt and 
thieving son, Jean-Claude. Though her special mission is to document the 
outrages committed against the women of the country, she soon realizes that 
Haitian brutality is anything but gender-specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under The Bone" begins with the story of a young peasant woman who discovers 
a corpse in the stream where she bathes. Innocent of any connection to the dead 
man, she is nevertheless imprisoned; her pathetic plight serves as a metaphor 
for thousands of similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti, like many Central and South American countries, has an invisible 
population: "the disappeared," people who have vanished from villages and towns 
never to be seen alive again. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Elyse Voltaire will escape death, her sufferings are explicit, extended 
and tragically typical. The stories of other women are presented in brief 
vignettes; Elyse becomes the voice of the silenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the author, Leslie Doyle lived in Haiti as a child, the daughter of the 
American envoy. Her sojourn left her with an enduring love for the land and a 
knowledge of the Creole patois spoken by all, though the so-called "elite" use 
it only in private. Translated sentence by sentence for our convenience, that 
patois is sprinkled generously throughout the book, lending authentic flavor 
but impeding the pace of a narrative already slowed by didactic explanations of 
past events. As in any discussion of Haiti, questions of class and color loom 
large, and d'Adesky confronts these sensitive issues unflinchingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the dialect term blan (white) originally referred only to the white 
overlords, it has long been used to describe anyone with power or wealth, 
regardless of color. A black general can be blan , the self-indulgent 
descendants of French colonists and slaves are blan , and so are all 
foreigners. Depending upon the context, the word can be either a derogatory 
epithet or a neutral description -- a succinct way of distinguishing the 
shrinking group of "haves" from the vast majority of "have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
 While d'Adesky has assembled a sizable cast of characters intended to 
represent various aspects of Haitian political and social life, each major 
figure is so laden with opinion and attitude that he or she tends to become 
merely a spokesperson for a particular point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard, a lawyer who longs to be a playwright, offers the entire first act of 
an allegorical drama in which all the actors are crows -- a sardonic Haitian 
version of "The Parliament of Fowls." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sylvie, a compassionate physician, tries valiantly to improve the lot of 
her patients, but is forced to work within the limits of a bankrupt system. "If 
you want to know how someone died," she says, "you can usually find out through 
an autopsy. But if you want to know how they lived . . . you have to look 
somewhere else -- under the bone," a definition of the challenge also faced by 
the writer. 
</P>
<P>
 A humanitarian priest, Father Emmanuel, struggles to reconcile his activist 
impulses with the constraints imposed by his vows. A troubled former army 
officer must deal simultaneously with the burden of his past and the realities 
of the present. Cedric, a political activist central to the story, never 
appears in the flesh, though the search for him reinforces the image of a 
country where those who oppose the regime do so at the risk of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Background is supplied by the shadowy figures of the extravagant and frivolous 
upper class disporting themselves as if Haiti were their private fiefdom to be 
plundered at whim, their luxurious lives in stark contrast to the wretchedness 
surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
 At home in the lush but depleted land, intellectually and emotionally involved 
with Haiti's tragic plight and thoroughly familiar with the customs of the 
country, the author creates a vibrant setting for her panorama of human misery, 
but as in many murals, the individual figures in "Under The Bone" are painted 
with the literary equivalent of a broad brush.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THE HIGH PRICE OF SITTING PRETTY IN THE PENINSULA CENTER 
LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CHAIR CARE: Palos Verdes Peninsula residents may be used to opulence, but when 
it comes to their libraries, many patrons say it's time to be frugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concern: chairs, couches and tables. Namely, $1.3 million in furniture 
that already has been ordered for the Peninsula Center library, which is being 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Libraries, a community group formed last year that has been critical 
of district spending, said many of the library's furnishings could be bought 
much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, leather chairs, some of which cost $1,895 each, can be replaced 
by ones with cloth upholstery at half the cost or less, said Jerry Slagter, who 
owns two contract furnishing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A trash can will cost $348. 
</P>
<P>
 "The names of the manufacturers (supplying furniture) are what you would 
connect to a Fortune 500 company," Slagter said. "We can get furniture that is 
equally pleasing and durable." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the library district's board will consider trustee Harold Jesse's 
proposal to cancel furniture orders and put the sofas and study tables back out 
to bid. The move could save at least $430,000, he said in a report to the rest 
of the trustees. How much it would cost to cancel orders is being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 But library director Linda Elliott said an interior designer hired by the 
library to select the furniture actually made a proposal $50,000 below budget. 
And while some furnishings may be posh, their cost was made up with more 
utilitarian chairs and tables elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 When the furniture was first ordered, the board agreed that if the designer 
"wanted to make a dramatic statement with a couple pieces of furniture, it 
could be evened out in other areas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the entire library renovation "is neither the most expensive or the 
least expensive" when compared to other projects statewide, and even falls in 
the "mid-range" in furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the trash cans, she acknowledged that the cost may seem high for 
someone who has purchased a home wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you recognize that these are large trash receptacles, built for use by 
the 1,500 people who come in every day, designed to last for 20 or more years, 
the price is more understandable," she said. The containers will be placed next 
to high-trash volume areas, such as photocopiers, and several will be used for 
recycling. 
</P>

 FLORAL MEMORIAL: Night after night, Angelenos watched the same scene on 
television: a microphone-toting reporter standing beside a colorful flower 
shrine outside a Ralphs supermarket in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrine was an impromptu creation of neighbors and friends mourning the 
killings of two 19-year-old Marymount College students who were shot March 25 
in the Ralphs parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched with a few bouquets, the memorial swiftly grew into a large mass of 
Easter lilies, chrysanthemums, azaleas, hyacinths and daffodils. Some tucked 
cards amid the flowers. Others lighted candles. Long white sheets of paper were 
laid on the pavement to be inscribed with messages to the slain students and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, two weeks after Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were shot, the 
parking-lot shrine was dismantled -- but the flowers live on. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro Garden Club, which had been watering the flowers, helped 
organize a final tribute to the slain students. Most of the potted flowers were 
then donated to Willenberg Special Education Center, a school for disabled 
students in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 70 plants bound for Willenberg filled a school bus and a station 
wagon, said the center's principal, Gayle Sadofsky. They will be planted at the 
school as part of its vocational program to train students in gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 More potted flowers were planted in a traffic island outside Ralphs. The cards 
and inscribed sheets of paper were taken to Marymount College, where they will 
be packed and shipped to the slain students' families in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden club president Hildegard Cox said she hopes Ito's and Matsuura's 
parents will return to San Pedro to see the plants that will have taken root at 
the Willenberg center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life ends," she said, "but the flowers will grow."

 A FAREWELL TO ARMS: This has been a grim week indeed at the Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium in San Pedro, where the beloved Octavia the Octopus was found dead 
early Monday morning after draining her own tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquarium officials said the mighty mollusk pulled the plug on her watery 
habitat by yanking a plastic pipe out of a tank drain. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the demise of the giant Pacific octopus has sparked the wrath of 
animal-rights groups, experts at other aquariums said they sympathize with 
Cabrillo officials' plight, explaining that octopuses are by nature 
manipulative creatures that frequently get into mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 "They creep and glide like the dickens," said Robert Anderson, manager of 
exhibits and life sciences at the Seattle Aquarium. The so-called stand pipe 
that Octavia unplugged poses a problem for any octopus owner, said Anderson, 
who added that the Seattle aquarium has taken "extraordinary care" to secure 
its pipes and avoid similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, an especially athletic octopus 
is said to have climbed completely out of its tank. Now the octopus tanks in 
Monterey are partially covered to prevent the creatures from crawling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavia was the first giant Pacific octopus ever displayed at the city-owned 
Cabrillo aquarium. The 58-pound creature arrived there in January after being 
caught by a fisherman. Schoolchildren flocked to stare at her eight 
sucker-lined tentacles and the gift shop stocked up on T-shirts decorated with 
a bright orange octopus. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-rights groups are calling for an investigation of Octavia's death, 
including a necropsy by an independent veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is inexcusable," said Lisa Lange, international campaigns manager for 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "Octavia died from suffocation 
because the water drained from her tank. . . . That's a horrible way to die." 
QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been a good wave there since the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lifeguard and surfer Wally Millican, 51, on the deterioration of the waves 
in Hermosa Beach, at the surfing spot he remembers as one of the best when he 
skipped classes at Mira Costa High School to ride his nine-foot balsa-wood 
surfboard.

ELECTIONS; VOTERS IN FOUR CITIES TAKE OUT THE BROOM AGAINST INCUMBENTS; 
ANALYSTS SAY RESULTS REFLECT DISCONTENT OVER CRIME AND STRAINED MUNICIPAL 
BUDGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 South Bay voters tossed incumbents out of office in four cities, sending city 
halls a signal of voter discontent with crime, graffiti and strained city 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents in El Segundo, Lomita and Manhattan Beach were ousted in surprise 
defeats Tuesday. Even tiny Rolling Hills bumped 18-year incumbent Councilwoman 
Gordana Swanson, a favorite to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 In Carson, however, where incumbents faced formidable challengers, Michael I. 
Mitoma, the city's appointed mayor, won the city's first election for the top 
post in a close race against retired economist James Peoples. Councilwoman 
Lorelie S. Olaes won another term in a squeaker against financial analyst Keith 
McDonald, son of state Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
 That so many incumbents lost "is a reflection of how bad cities are in terms 
of the budgets and the recession," said Fernando Guerra, political science 
professor at Loyola Marymount University. "It's tough to be a city council 
(member) in the '90s. Councils can make a difference in zoning and planning, 
but if you talk about big trends like defense downsizing, their power to soften 
the blow is minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
 A new mayor and two new council members were elected in Avalon, but no 
incumbents were running for the posts. The status quo easily won out in 
Gardena, Lawndale and Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout ranged from a low of 14.5% in Lawndale to 31.5% in Gardena and a 
high of 65.3% in Avalon. AVALON 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph J. Morrow Jr. was elected mayor, beating Councilwoman Barbara 
J. Doutt and two other candidates in the race to succeed longtime Mayor Hugh T. 
(Bud) Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessmen Keith LeFever and Tim Winslow won two open spots on the City 
Council over five other candidates. Incumbent Hal Host did not seek another 
term, and Doutt gave up her seat to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow took his victory as an indication that voters wanted City Hall to be 
more friendly to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hospitals, we have cruise ships, we have a resort coming in from 
Arizona," he said. "It sends a loud, clear message from the community. They 
want a business-oriented council." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new City Hall leaders will soon have to come up with a way to keep the 
island's hospital and paramedic services. In separate advisory measures, voters 
supported their continued operation, even though the city is paying $520,000 
this year to subsidize the hospital and pays $25,000 a month for Los Angeles 
County paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow "was pushing for keeping health care exactly how it is," Doutt said. "I 
was for keeping an open mind for possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow's next step: "We're going to have to tell L.A. County we can't afford 
them and then figure out what we're going to do." CARSON 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his campaign, Mitoma charged that Peoples, McDonald and city 
treasurer candidate Phyllis Y. Tucker ran as an African American slate. That 
all three lost -- even though the race was close -- was a signal that voters do 
not want racial politics at City Hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't run on race," Mitoma said when about half of the votes had been 
counted showing him with a slim lead. "You have to have a platform. You can't 
just say vote for me because I'm a certain color." 
</P>
<P>
 But the three challengers denied that they ran as a slate, even though they 
were all endorsed by United Voice, a grass-roots organization. The group had 
been formed to unify the African American community.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, race may have been on voters' minds in a city equally divided between 
African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders, Anglos and Latinos, Guerra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems the Asian, Latino and Anglo voters went for the Asian candidates," 
he said. "Their Spanish-sounding surnames helped them out in the Latino 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Peoples, McDonald and Tucker led after all the precincts had been counted, but 
an unusually large number of absentee ballots -- which had been circulated by 
many candidates -- pulled the incumbents ahead early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olaes, for example, distributed about 1,200 applications for absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was bitter to the end. Earlier on Tuesday, Juanita McDonald said 
she would complain to the state Fair Political Practices Commission about a 
campaign advertisement in the Carson News that endorsed both the elder McDonald 
in her race for the Assembly and Olaes, her son's opponent. McDonald said that 
her office staff told Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), who placed the ad, 
that she did not want to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was livid," Juanita McDonald said. "I do not wish anyone to be putting me 
in a slate with any semblance of disloyalty to my son." 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Helen Kawagoe handily won reelection against challenger Samson C. 
Labason. She has served in the post since 1974. Mary Louise Custer was 
reelected treasurer by a slim margin. EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents J. B. Wise and Alan West were defeated in a city that has been 
struggling to raise revenue as the aerospace industry shrinks.  
</P>
<P>
 The victors, legislative analyst Liam B. Weston and U.S. Census surveyor Jane 
Waag Friedkin, said voters were upset with division at City Hall. Both West and 
Wise supported a controversial tax break the city gave to a hotel chain that 
plans to build in the city. As candidates, Friedkin and Weston opposed the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incumbents were making the same old tax-and-spend mistake," said 
Friedkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise has been on the council for four years and West for eight. 
</P>
<P>
 But West, whose daughter was slain in an early morning attack in her El 
Segundo apartment in February, said his campaign never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first speech was just about as flat as you could get," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise said he was dismayed at what he called dirty politics. An ad in a local 
newspaper suggested that Wise and West -- political allies -- might be 
reelected out of sympathy after the death of West's daughter. GARDENA 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, challengers accused incumbents of ignoring the 
heavily African American and Latino neighborhoods on the city's north end, but 
their criticisms did not translate into votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Dear, in office for 12 years, easily won reelection against 
aerospace worker Rafael Garcia and insurance benefits executive Philip Johnson. 
Councilman Mas Fukai, on the council for two decades, and Gwen Duffy, a 12-year 
veteran, beat challenger Steven Bradford, a recycling director for the Los 
Angeles Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Bradford sought to become the first two African Americans on the 
council. They contended that the Police Department poorly patrols the city's 
north end, while south and central sections of the city get immediate 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents denied such favoritism and accused the challengers of promoting 
divisiveness in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many twisted untruths brought up," Fukai said.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fukai said he did note that Bradford beat both him and Duffy in seven 
north Gardena precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear their message and I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure 
their needs are met, regardless of race or color," Fukai said. LAWNDALE 
</P>
<P>
 Voters reelected Mayor Harold E. Hofmann, although Councilwoman Nancy Marthens 
captured a large number of votes in a last-minute write-in campaign. Incumbent 
Larry Rudolph was reelected to City Council, and retired office manager 
Virginia M. Rhodes won an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Marthens was a serious write-in opponent, Hofmann said his victory 
speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," said Hofmann, his voice barely a rasp due to a sore throat. "I 
feel very good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marthens said the fact that she drew 409 votes to Hofmann's 829 proves 
that many Lawndale voters are unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a write-in candidacy this is a very respectable showing and I'm really 
not at all displeased with it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In her campaign, Marthens warned voters that Hofmann, Rudolph and candidate 
Bruce R. McKee would vote in a bloc, limiting debate and stripping the other 
council members of power. Rudolph won an easy reelection bid, but McKee lost by 
a slim margin to Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," Rhodes said. "I think a definite statement was made to 
this council -- that the three-man bloc is not what people are looking for." 
LOMITA 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where no incumbent has lost for 20 years, all three incumbents up 
for reelection were ousted.  
</P>
<P>
 Voters bumped Councilmen Robert Hargrave, Peter J. Rossick and Chuck Taylor in 
favor of challengers David Albert, a manufacturing executive, Lawson Pedigo, a 
property manager, and Ben Traina, an aerospace contract manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The new councilmen said the city needed new leadership because of problems 
with crime and graffiti. And all three favor term limits. Incumbents opposed 
that idea, saying residents could vote them out of office if they were 
dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people were getting restless in Lomita and weren't getting the 
changes they wanted," Pedigo said. "Now, we'll get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The new majority also is looking to cut council pay, health benefits and 
travel allowances. Albert sent out literature showing that council members were 
applying money that was intended to provide medical coverage to life insurance 
policies that can be cashed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of people being made aware of what's going on in City 
Hall," Albert said. "I think my letter got to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents argued that they were entitled to the benefits as employees of the 
city. Travel allowances, they said, enabled them to meet with lawmakers in 
Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers "all worked really hard on their campaigns," said Rossick, who 
has been on the council for eight years. "Some of them worked much harder than 
I did." MANHATTAN BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Connie Sieber was the only incumbent running in the race for two 
seats, but voters passed over her in favor of lawyer Joan Jones and retired 
account executive Jack Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 Sieber came in fourth behind lawyer James A. Shalvoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's just time for a change," Sieber said. She was seeking a third 
term, which she deemed a controversial move in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was an uphill fight," she said. "But I thought it was incumbent on 
me to offer a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Cunningham had been characterized as pro-business and received 
strong backing from local firms, but said they were just as supportive of 
homeowners groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The election "will change the competence level of the council," Jones said. 
The council will "focus more on issues than on personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of problems with the automatic vote-counting machines, final results 
could not be counted until early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first machine, supplied by the Anaheim election consulting firm Martin and 
Chapman, failed shortly before the polls closed at 8 p.m. A backup machine 
arrived from Anaheim more than an hour later, but it didn't work, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has failed us," said Assistant City Clerk La Vonne Harkless. By 
the time a third ballot-counting machine arrived shortly after 11 p.m., the 
crowd had dwindled to a few dozen. PALOS VERDES ESTATES 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Rosemary Humphrey and Michael Moody were easily reelected, and 
attorney William A. Finer won the council's open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Massoud JavaDiZadeh vowed to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to run against an establishment, but we gave them a good 
run," JavaDiZadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finer said he wants to ensure the Palos Verdes Homes Assn. and the city work 
together so residents understand that their homes have to meet building and 
aesthetic codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things Massoud played off was that people were discontented" in 
dealing with the homeowners association and the city, Finer said. ROLLING HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 In this tiny, gated community, it wouldn't be tough to know if voters wanted 
to throw out their elected officials. That's why Gordana Swanson was so 
surprised at her loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here can believe it," said Swanson, who has been on the council since 
1976. "In a community this small I would know if there was a dissatisfaction 
with the job I was doing. There wasn't a sense that anyone wanted to boot me 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters elected venture capital investor B. Allen Lay and businessman Frank 
Hill. Councilwoman Jody Murdock won reelection. Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh 
did not run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not devastated by this in the least," Swanson said. "It's the first time 
in 20 years I will have time to dedicate to my family and to making money 
without the demands of public service." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill "made a point of term limits and it apparently struck a sympathy note 
with some of the voters," Lay said. "Gordana has done a very good job for a lot 
of years and has been a positive influence for the city."

CITY THREATENS PER-BARREL REFINERY TAX IN LATEST BATTLE WITH MOBIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON and MARY GUTHRIE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Mobil Corp. and Torrance City Hall are at odds.  
</P>
<P>
 In March, the city ordered Mobil to come up with $1.7 million for unpaid 
utility taxes on natural gas pumped into the refinery. Mobil refused -- and 
filed a lawsuit over the issue on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's response this month: a proposal to tax Mobil $.028 for each barrel 
it refines. The tax would raise an estimated $1 million in revenue to help 
offset a $5.3-million deficit in the city's 1994-95 budget, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city has filed suit against the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and Mobil, challenging a permit the district gave to Mobil 
to expand its production of reformulated fuels. State law requires that only 
the cleaner burning gasoline be sold in California by March 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil officials object to the proposed per-barrel tax, saying the city should 
not try to balance its books on the back of one taxpayer. But city officials 
see it as making up for lost utility tax income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the city is looking at a way to even it up again," said Mayor 
Dee Hardison. Four years ago, it seemed as if Mobil and city officials had 
patched things up. The city settled a lawsuit it filed against the oil giant 
after a 1987 hydrogen fluoride spill caused an explosion and 15-hour fire at 
Mobil's Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil has since stepped up its public relations campaign, including opening 
the refinery for tours, which have been taken by more than 10,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company started a newsletter for residents, and replaced a 
taped emergency message center with a number that connects callers to an 
environmental foreman, on duty 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with a much different refinery now," said Councilman Dan 
Walker. "It is safer and better run. They have made some great improvements. 
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't have the refinery tax and eliminate hydrogen 
fluoride." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the explosion, hydrogen fluoride has been monitored closely by city 
officials. The chemical, one of many used at the refinery, forms a toxic cloud 
at room temperature that can travel several miles and cause respiratory, eye 
and skin ailments. As part of its settlement with the city, Mobil agreed to 
quit using the chemical by 1997 unless a safer form was developed by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mobil plans to use hydrogen fluoride in its reformulated gas production, 
although the company said tests on a safer form have yielded positive results. 
In its lawsuit, the city also charges that Mobil will use more of the chemical 
than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD has allowed a project "which is designed on the basis of an 
unquestioned and unexplained assumption that the current use of (hydrogen 
fluoride) will continue," according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials have not responded to the city's suit, but a spokesman said 
that all refineries have to come up with reformulated gasoline production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit of the cleaner gasoline will outweigh the impact (by the 
refinery)," said AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly. "You have a trade-off, but there's 
a net benefit from doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who sponsored an unsuccessful initiative in 1990 that would have 
restricted the storage and use of hydrogen fluoride at the refinery, said the 
air quality agency misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AQMD does not live in Torrance," he said. "Most refineries are not 
sitting in the middle of a metropolitan area with tens of thousands of people 
close by."  
</P>
<P>
 Maness, however, said that residents should not be alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Mobil has spent $45 million researching a hydrogen fluoride additive 
that prevents the acid from vaporizing. Company officials are encouraged by 
tests using the additive at a plant in New Jersey and hope to use the formula 
at the Torrance facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the company's use of hydrogen fluoride will not increase 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say its lawsuit will make sure Mobil fulfills the terms of the 
settlement. "That's a risk that we're trying to minimize," Hardison said. "We 
can't back away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal challenges have been expensive. The city has spent $1.6 million in 
legal fees since 1989 on disputes with Mobil over the safety of hydrogen 
fluoride, city officials said. Mobil would not disclose how much it has spent 
on legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 But, refinery manager Joel Maness said, Mobil, which employs more than 900 
people, pays more than $15 million per year to local, state and federal 
governments, Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we feel we're paying our share of taxes? God, yes!" Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials don't agree. In 1992, the city hired a consulting firm to 
review Mobil's tax records. That is when it discovered that Mobil owed the city 
$1.2 million in the unpaid utility taxes on natural gas. With interest and a 
25% penalty, the figure comes to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Maness said after the company's Dallas office reviewed the tax records, they 
advised against paying. In fact, Mobil sent a bill of its own to the city: 
$860,231 for overpayment of past taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a matter of the company saying 'Sue the city', " Maness said. "They 
said 'You don't owe the tax.' Our corporate philosophy is . . . if there's a 
tax due we pay it. It doesn't mean we're going to pay every demand that comes 
our way."

HARMAN SPEAKS TO OPPONENTS OF SHELTER IN SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro community leaders and local politicians have enlisted Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Marina Del Rey) in their fight to stop a large homeless shelter from 
being set up in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is expected to open on a 27-acre site at Taper Avenue after the 
Navy moves out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of about 50 homeowners Saturday, Harman said she may introduce 
amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. The legislation 
gives homeless programs priority on surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the act ought to be changed and I will work with the (Los Angeles) 
mayor and others to get it changed, but that doesn't do anything for this 
particular issue," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first meeting with the San Pedro community since controversy over 
the shelter began last month. More than 1,000 protesters gathered at several 
meetings to oppose a project they say would dramatically change their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman brought with her Department of Health and Human Services representative 
Judy Breitman, who reviews applications for surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitman fielded questions about how a South-Central Los Angeles homeless 
advocacy group, Turner's Technical Institute, was given permission to use the 
Taper Avenue site and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the group had shown suitable experience and the ability to apply for 
program funding and "we had no reason to disapprove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not unique to San Pedro, she said. Other communities are angry 
about bases being transferred under the McKinney Act because the law does not 
allow for public discussion of the applications. Approval of the shelter does 
not mean it will be on the site forever, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under department regulations, Turner's must have its program running in a 
year, provide a written report to the department every year and undergo on-site 
checks every three to five years, Breitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some properties that have come back to us because they 
couldn't get the funding or couldn't overcome the opposition," Breitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Rae Brown told the audience that Turner's homeless 
program cannot begin until it meets city zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's planning process requires public hearings. You have at that time 
the chance to bring forward your concerns again," Brown said. Turner's has not 
yet applied for a zoning permit, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to approve four recommendations by Councilman 
Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro, when it meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, agreed to unanimously at a meeting of the council's 
Intergovernmental Relations Committee last week, would allow the city to join 
lobbying efforts to ensure that the community is consulted on future decisions 
about federal surplus land. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Housing and Urban Development Department, which approves sites 
as suitable for use by the homeless, is assessing the site for a second time on 
information that it does not meet to determine whether it meets legal 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Two privately owned tanks containing millions of gallons of aviation fuel are 
within 2,000 feet of the site's 24 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although opposition to the project is growing, Turner's has no plan to give up 
its application, director John Marzet said. However, Turner's will continue to 
work with Svorinich's office to find an alternative site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are looking for any avenue to kill the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you suffer from economic disaster in your life, we don't want you to live 
next door to us -- that's what they're saying," Marzet said recently. "It's 
discrimination."

DRIVEN TO SERVE -- AND TO COMMUTE FROM LESS PRICY AREAS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: A 
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF SOUTH BAY POLICE OFFICERS CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN -- OR 
EVEN NEAR -- THE COMMUNITIES THAT EMPLOY THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They wear badges, carry guns and face greater on-the-job hazards than most 
people. But in at least one respect, many South Bay police officers are no 
different from a lot of people in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long drive from where they live to where they work. In some cases it's 
a really long drive -- all the way from Chino, Redlands, Oceanside or Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of several South Bay police departments showed more than 
half of the officers live outside the city that employs them. In Inglewood, the 
rate is more dramatic: Fewer than 1% -- two of the 211 officers -- live in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 No law requires police officers to live in the city where they work, or even 
within a certain number of miles of the city. Such residency requirements were 
abolished in the 1970s. But last month, the American Civil Liberties Union 
released a report indicating 83% of Los Angeles Police Department officers live 
outside the city they serve. The ACLU charged that the LAPD is an "army of 
occupation," composed of officers who live in predominantly white suburbs.  
</P>
<P>
 Many South Bay police officers, particularly those who work in the upscale 
beach communities and on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, said they don't live where 
they work because they cannot afford to. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, for example, nine of the city's 59 police officers reside 
in the city. The primary reason, said Sgt. John Zea, is the economics of 
housing and salary. 
</P>
<P>
 A beginning Manhattan Beach police officer, Zea said, receives a base salary 
of about $3,000 a month gross. U.S. census statistics from 1990 showed the 
median homeowner cost in Manhattan Beach to be about $2,000 per month, and the 
median monthly rent slightly more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gladly live here if the city would buy me a house," said Zea, who owned a 
home in the city early in his police career but now lives in Orange County. "I 
think a lot of our officers would like to live here. But living costs are 
pretty high. . . . Our younger officers, especially, have to go for affordable 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The only residency requirement for the city's police officers is for members 
of specialized units, such as K-9 police dog handlers, who must live within a 
45-minute "response time" of the city. Motorcycle officers can live wherever 
they want, but to minimize the mileage on the motorcycles, officers aren't 
allowed to drive them home if they live farther away than a city such as 
Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Zea said living outside the city doesn't affect the way he and other officers 
perform their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel any less of a sense of community with Manhattan Beach just 
because I don't live here now," Zea said. "I have a lot of emotional investment 
in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same story in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our officers would like to live here but can't afford it," said Lt. 
Stephen Gilliam, human resources division commander for the Torrance Police 
Department. Gilliam said 44% of Torrance's 236 police officers live in the 
city. Among the out-of-town residents, Gilliam said, is Torrance Police Chief 
Joe De Ladurantey, who lives on Balboa Island in Orange County, his residence 
before he took the Torrance job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam said beginning Torrance officers earn a base salary of about $3,200 
per month. According to census figures, median monthly homeowner costs in 
Torrance were about $1,300 in 1990, and the median rent was about $800. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam said the vast majority of Torrance's K-9 and SWAT officers live in the 
city or adjacent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Jeff Cameron of the Redondo Beach Police Department agreed that the reason 
68 of his department's officers live outside the city, while only 39 live in 
the city, is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closer you get to the water the more expensive it is," said Cameron, a 
25-year department veteran who lives outside the city. Like other South Bay 
police departments, Cameron said, the Redondo Beach department requires K-9 and 
SWAT officers to live nearby in order to reduce "response time" in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just out of our price range," Lt. Ed Jaakola said of the city where he 
works -- Palos Verdes Estates, where only four of the city's 23 officers, 
including Chief Gary Johansen, live. And those officers are able to live there, 
said Jaakola, because they rent houses the city owns as a result of a legal 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pay for a Palos Verdes Estates police officer is slightly above 
$2,800 per month, Jaakola said. But 1990 median homeowner costs in the city 
were about $2,000 per month, and median rent was just over $1,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the South Bay cities, Inglewood has the lowest percentage of its 
officers living there. Chief Oliver Thompson said he is one of the department's 
two officers who live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said that while money is a factor for some, many of the officers are 
worried about living in the same community as the people they arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real fear, for example, that if they go to the market and they 
happen to see someone they've arrested for robbery, that somebody will harass 
them and find out who their wife and children are," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thompson said he is not worried about security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for two years and never made a secret of my address," 
Thompson said. "It's never been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish more officers lived in town. But it's a free country." 
</P>
<P>
 As elsewhere in the South Bay, finances for Inglewood officers are a 
consideration, Thompson said, noting that his mortgage in Inglewood is higher 
than what he was paying in Riverside. Starting pay for an Inglewood police 
officer is about $3,100 a month, while 1990 median monthly homeowner costs in 
the city were about $1,000 and median rent was about $600.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; IN SEMINAR, EMOTION'S A TOOL TO REDUCE BIAS

 They were basically strangers, but they expressed emotions that came from deep 
inside. Angry people lashed out at each other. Tears were shed. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Gardena resident Margaret Dacut, the volatile environment at a recent 
human relations training course proved to be one of the most positive, 
inspirational experiences of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were free to express their emotions; they were crying and said, 'I'm 
angry at what's being said,' " Dacut, 38, said. "It stirred up tensions, but 
also allowed people the opportunity to speak openly and safely in an 
environment where they can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Using games mixed with frank, personal and often emotional discussion, the 
human relations course offered by the National Conference of Christians and 
Jews attempts to teach community members to reduce prejudice and stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the five-week program is to help people in management, guidance or 
leadership positions learn to intervene when racial or ethnic tensions arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants, who come from all over Southern California, meet one evening a 
week for four weeks at the National Conference's Downtown-area offices at 1055 
Wilshire Blvd., and spend one weekend in a retreat at a Glendale camp. The 
program is offered every six months and costs $125, with financial aid 
available. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: FIRM TO AID RUSSIAN NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Gardena construction firm is helping disarm Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next month, G&C Equipment, which sells and leases construction 
equipment, will send machinery and two employees to Russia to help that nation 
dismantle its nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Defense awarded G&C a $3.1-million contract to supply 
the heavy construction equipment and send employees to train Russian workers on 
how to use the machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Hale, president of G&C, said he will ship eight pieces of equipment to 
Russia next month. Two employees will spend three months training equipment 
operators to use the excavators that will dig the nuclear missiles out of the 
ground, the cranes that will lift and move the weapons and the machinery that 
cuts up metal. 
</P>
<P>
 G&C also will provide training manuals translated into Russian, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, a Gardena resident, is proud that his minority-owned company was awarded 
the defense contract. "I think it's interesting that we're a black-owned 
company that bid for the contract, and the Department of Defense awarded it to 
us," said Hale, who serves as chairman of the Greater Los Angeles African 
American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian project is the 13-year-old firm's first major international 
contract. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; PETITION DRIVE AGAINST OIL DRILLING LAUNCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several Hermosa Beach residents opposed to oil drilling have begun a drive to 
put an anti-drilling initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based MacPherson Oil Co. holds a lease from the city to dig 30 
wells at a slant under the city, in some cases reaching beneath Santa Monica 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Three residents recently notified the city they plan to circulate a petition. 
Rosamond Fogg, a proponent of the petition, said the project would threaten 
Santa Monica Bay and the health and safety of residents and would precipitate a 
series of similar projects along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents must collect 1,454 signatures by May 25 to get the initiative on 
the November ballot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company engineers expect the wells to produce 27 million barrels of oil 
over the next 25 years, generating as much as $104 million for the city under 
the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was endorsed by the State Lands Commission last month and requires 
the approval of the California Coastal Commission. Donald MacPherson Jr., 
president of the oil company, said he hopes the company can begin work on the 
project by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa voters approved two pro-oil initiatives in 1984. Fogg said voters were 
swayed by a gasoline crisis at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today oil prices are in the basement and the quality of the oil here is low," 
she said. JAMES BENNING

<P>
 Recent violent crime has prompted the city of Rancho Palos Verdes to organize 
a public forum on crime prevention in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Steven Kuykendall will host the South Bay Law Enforcement Forum on April 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police and victims' rights representatives will join a panel of mayors 
from nine other South Bay cities to answer questions about current and planned 
public safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall said the recent slayings of three police officers in the South Bay 
has raised the consciousness of area residents that no city is immune from 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 People need to be reassured that authorities are tackling crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have a sense that they're safe in their community. We have to 
let them know what's going on and let elected officials and law enforcement 
speak about how we can help them be safer," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Torrance Cultural Art Center, 3330 
Civic Center Drive. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; MERCHANT'S GIFT ALLOWS RESCHEDULING OF PARADE 
</P>

<P>
 Kiwanis Club officials in Hawthorne said they will stage a parade that had 
been canceled for lack of city funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A $5,000 donation from a local auto dealer will allow the club to hold its 
47th annual parade on Hawthorne and El Segundo boulevards and Prairie 
Avenue.The event, scheduled for July 30, was canceled last month when the city 
did not approve the club's funding request. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the city has divided the cost of the parade with the Kiwanis. 
This year some council members expressed concern that the city could not afford 
the expense. A 2-2 vote by the council March 14 denied the club's request. 
Mayor Larry Guidi, a Kiwanis member, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials canceled the parade, then reversed their decision after Guidi 
successfully appealed to a local auto dealer for a donation. South Bay Ford of 
Hawthorne gave a $5,000 check to the club on April 6, parade chairman David M. 
York said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city will not pay for the parade, it will provide free police and 
maintenance services for the event, which includes a fair April 27-31 at 
Hawthorne Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, providing those services cost the city up to $18,000 annually, 
City Manager James H. Mitsch said. This year, Mitsch said he expects the cost 
to be $2,000 or less because many employees are volunteering or preparing for 
the parade during normal work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we've gotten groups to participate from all over Southern 
California," York said. "Now, we're going to have fill the parade with more 
local groups and more youth groups." SCOTT SANDELL

SURFERS PAYING A HIGH PRICE FOR THEIR YEARS OF FUN IN THE SUN; HEALTH: AS THE 
BABY-BOOMER INNOVATORS OF THE SPORT GROW OLDER, MANY ARE ALSO SUFFERING A 
TROUBLESOME ARRAY OF MALADIES. 
</P>

 Johnny Fain was Malibu's golden boy of surfing in the late 1960s. Known for an 
aggressive surfing style of quick, slashing turns and "hang-ten" riding (10 
toes over the nose of the board), Fain became one of the world's top surfers, 
and was rewarded with endorsements and years on the professional surfing tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The only child of "Lassie" screenwriter Jeanne Bartlett, Fain grew up in 
Malibu Colony and parlayed his blond good looks and surfing prowess into small 
movie and stunt parts in such cult classics as "Muscle Beach Party," "How to 
Stuff a Wild Bikini" and "Beach Blanket Bingo." 
</P>
<P>
 But during years of rough-and-tumble surfing and prolonged exposure to the 
elements, Fain also racked up a litany of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen cancerous and precancerous skin lesions and moles have been 
removed from his face and body. He has endured three ear operations and four 
surgeries to remove growths from his eyes, and hundreds of stitches from 
surfboard collisions. And now a recent operation to repair a hip eroded from 
years of battering has left Fain on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to believe you're invincible to reach a high level of surf 
expertise," said Fain, 50. "You have to go beyond what a normal person thinks 
of as a human limit. I am paying a price for that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, are many other surfers, enthusiasts and their doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing, with an estimated 500,000 Southern California devotees, has always 
radiated images of fun and health, of bronzed bodies, youthful good looks and 
pristine beaches. But as the baby-boomer innovators of the sport grow older, 
some of them say a troublesome array of maladies has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "As opposed to the blunt trauma of a football injury, many surfers suffer from 
a series of cumulative ailments," said Steve Hawk, editor of Surfer Magazine. 
Hawk, 38, who has been surfing for more than 20 years, has suffered from 
chronic back, ear and nasal problems. "It's almost death from a thousand cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say it is difficult to determine the extent of surfer 
illnesses and ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have such a file," said Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of the acute 
communicable disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services. "Some surfers don't go to a doctor and if they did, doctors 
have an abysmal rate of reporting routine diseases and illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, surfers tend to be a fit bunch with strong muscles and lungs 
derived from hours of grueling paddling against the tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many surfers and their doctors say plenty of anecdotal evidence attests 
to the sport's health consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-aged surfers in particular say they must cope with a growing history of 
skin ulcers, reef cuts, lacerations from surfboard fins and surfer knots and 
craters -- bumps and cuts slow to heal from constant paddling and water 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, San Francisco physician Mark Renneker co-authored "Sick Surfers," 
a book that outlines a comprehensive list of surfer maladies. Renneker founded 
the Surfer's Medical Assn. in 1986, a Northern California-based international 
organization of roughly 700 members, including 400 medical professionals, who 
are dedicated to improving the health of surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Renneker has chronicled such surfer ailments as chronic neck and back 
problems, fungal infections from wet suits, fatty growths on the rib cage from 
paddling and so-called "ice-cream headaches" -- migraines brought on by dunking 
under huge waves in frigid water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book also attempts to answer surfer queries about angioedema -- the 
swelling of the extremities in cold water -- and even the consequences of 
ingesting surf wax, which is used to improve the grip on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most common maladies, however, is "surfers' ear," or exostosis. 
</P>
<P>
 It is caused when excess water in the ear canal evaporates in windy conditions 
and chills the ear. The body responds by growing extra bone in the ear canal, 
obstructing hearing. The affliction is treated by drilling away the excess 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must get two to three surfers a month who have to have their ears drilled 
out with a high-speed diamond burr -- it's very painful," said Dr. Justin 
MacCarthy, a partner in a Pacific Palisades practice. "I try to tell them to 
wear ear plugs, but they won't do it. They say it affects their sense of 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers have their own descriptions of the pain of the operation and its 
aftermath. "It's like a cherry bomb going off inside your head, but you're 
still living," said Fain. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposure to the sun also has taken a toll. Many dermatologists are reporting 
increased cases of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as malignant 
melanoma.  
</P>
<P>
 Veteran surfers also suffer from pterygiums, a tissue growth over the cornea 
of the eye caused by exposure to wind and ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hearne, 45, regional director of the Surfer Foundation, a nonprofit 
environmental organization, has cataracts on both eyes from sun exposure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to wear ski-glasses with a leash, but it's a hassle in big surf 
when you're duck-diving under waves," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from infirmities caused by the natural elements, many veteran Los 
Angeles-area surfers believe water pollution is eclipsing the sunny elements of 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid uncertainty in the scientific world over whether toxins in Santa Monica 
Bay are making people sick, surfers believe they are unwittingly helping to 
establish a link between the water and certain illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're the canaries in the coal mine -- we've got this young 
healthy group of people that keeps getting sick," said David Saltman, former 
executive director of the Surfrider Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Rainwater washes untreated sewage, trash, debris, animal waste, pesticides and 
motor oil into concrete rivers and storm drains that empty into Santa Monica 
Bay. In August, the American Oceans Campaign, a nonprofit environmental group, 
completed a two-year study that identified 160 toxic chemicals flowing into the 
bay from Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Bay surfers say they suffer from a range of illnesses that could 
be related to pollution, such as stomach flu, skin rashes and sinus and ear 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of pollution increases dramatically after storms -- bad news for 
surfers, as that is when the waves are best. 
</P>
<P>
 And the prime surfing spots are near storm drains, which dump sediment onto a 
series of points, reefs and beach breaks. Better-shaped waves are produced as 
swells peel over the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 To many medical experts, storm surfing is a horrific combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "When diving under a big wave you're getting worked over pretty good," said 
Dr. Gordon LaBedz, a member of the Surfer's Medical Assn. and a Seal Beach 
resident. "Bacteria-laden water is being forced into your sinuses. (It) sits in 
little hollow areas of your skull, which if it runs down, can cause an 
upper-respiratory infection." 
</P>
<P>
 An extreme and controversial medical case involves surfer Eric Villanueva, 22. 
In May, 1992, Villanueva came down with flu-like symptoms after surfing near 
Malibu Lagoon in the wake of a storm. Within a month he had congestive heart 
failure, and two months later he received a heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors found high levels of antibodies in Villanueva's blood caused by the 
coxsackie B virus, a strain found in human feces that can attack and weaken the 
heart. Public studies have located coxsackie B in Malibu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go out there after the rains, or after the berm is breached, you're 
gambling with your life," said Villanueva, who had to have a second transplant 
11 months after the first one because of complications. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts cannot say for sure where he contracted the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that someone could get the virus while surfing in the bay," 
said Dr. Michele Hamilton, co-director of the UCLA cardiomyopathy program, 
which is treating Villanueva. "However . . . it could have been poor hygiene, 
family contact or a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Many surfers are aware of the problems associated with the sport, but 
addiction to the waves overrides their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after surfer Jeff Estep came down with hepatitis A shortly after surfing 
at Malibu, he remembers going surfing with his sons and walking past a sign on 
a Malibu beach warning of possible unsafe water. "I told my boys to check for 
any open wounds, and to just spit a lot, keep spitting. Then out we went." 
County officials recommend staying out of the water when such signs are 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 But most surfers don't stay out of the water for long. Johnny Fain regularly 
and painfully swims a mile in the Pepperdine University swimming pool to 
rehabilitate his hip -- and to get ready for his inevitable return to the surf: 
"I'm a gladiator. "I'll be back out there within eight months."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FILIPINO WITH A FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Filipino restaurants in the South Bay tend to be little cafeterialike 
places where you select prepared dishes from a steam table. For a more formal 
Filipino dining experience, you have only a few choices, the most notable being 
Pinausukan in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 The comfortable dining room is decorated in shades of green, accented by 
imported Filipino bamboo chairs with flowered seat pads. White lace curtains 
frame a row of windows and one wall is adorned with modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the appetizers at this six-year-old establishment are kilawing hipon 
($6.95), a spicy shrimp sauteed with onions, vinegar, ginger and hot pepper, 
and lumpia Shanghai ($4.95), the familiar Filipino egg rolls with ground pork 
and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 The soups include sinigang ($8.95), tart with tamarind and made with chicken 
or fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Guisadong talong ($5.75) is Japanese eggplant sauteed with tomatoes, onions, 
garlic and small shrimp. It's a popular accompaniment to crispy pata ($11.95), 
otherwise known as deep-fried pig's knuckle. Pata may sound about as appealing 
as a flat tire on the Cross Bronx Expressway at midnight, but slice away the 
thin outer layer of fried fat and you'll find loads of tender pork meat. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of the menu is devoted to seafood. The ginataang mix ($12.95) 
features mussels, squid, shrimp, clams and crab sauteed in coconut milk with 
ginger. Pinausukan hito ($11.75) is a grilled catfish with okra and eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, daily specials are offered such as a heaping plate of pancit bihun 
($4.95), thin rice noodles sauteed with pork, shrimp and shredded vegetables. 
The Canton pancit is similar, but with thicker noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinausukan is at 1828 W. Rosecrans Ave., Gardena. (310) 323-7354. Open Sunday 
through Thursday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 
11 a.m. to midnight. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

EXHIBIT TRACES A CENTURY OF TRADITIONS AND TRIALS; MUSEUM: DISPLAYS FOCUSED ON 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REVEAL THE DIFFICULT PATH JAPANESE AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE 
FOLLOWED IN THIS COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Many of the first Japanese American women came to the United States as 
"picture brides," kimonoed women brave enough or desperate enough to spend a 
month at sea traveling to marry men whose faces they knew only from 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughters -- the generation known in Japanese as nisei -- thought of 
themselves as citizens like any other. But when the Japanese bombed Pearl 
Harbor, thousands of Japanese American citizens found themselves robbed of 
their possessions and shipped off to harsh detention camps because of the color 
of their skin.  
</P>
<P>
 The third generation, called sansei, includes women such as Kristi Yamaguchi, 
who won a skating gold medal for the United States at the Albertville Olympics 
in 1992. More than 50% of sansei marry non-Japanese men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strength & Diversity: Japanese American Women 1885-1990" is the subject of an 
award-winning exhibit running through May 30 at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with 50 Japanese American women, the show was originally 
organized by the National Japanese American Historical Society and the Oakland 
Museum, where it opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because Japanese American soldiers, many fresh from the camps, fought 
so heroically during World War II, the story of Japanese American men has been 
told before. But as Rosalyn Tonai, one of the show's Bay Area organizers, 
points out, this is the first exhibit that tells the story of Japanese American 
women, often in their own words. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes this show from other ethnic exhibits, even groundbreaking 
ones, is that, as it travels around the country, the show is customized to 
reflect the local experience. "It was very different in Hawaii than it was in 
Portland, Ore.," Tonai said. Southern California has the largest concentration 
of Japanese Americans in the country -- more than 130,000 in Los Angeles County 
alone. Working with the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, the 
Autry has tapped this rich community resource to give the show a local spin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Michael Duchemin, curator of history at the Autry, the traveling 
portion of the show includes photographs, text -- much of it taken from oral 
histories -- and dozens of objects that document the journey of Japanese 
American women from immigration to their varied roles in contemporary culture. 
The era of the picture bride, for instance, is vividly evoked by the kimono, 
the iko, or kimono rack, and the Japanese wicker suitcase that accompanied one 
hopeful woman across the Pacific. Local additions flesh out the show and allow 
visitors to see in detail how their Japanese American neighbors fared during 
almost a century of tradition, trial and change. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II, Japanese American women had even fewer job opportunities 
than Japanese American men. Many could get jobs only as domestic servants or at 
vegetable stands. But during the 1930s, some local women attended the Gardena 
Dressmaking College. The show includes a photo of the class of 1936, plus a 
diploma and a program for the ceremony that marked them as full-fledged 
seamstresses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, some of the most powerful material involves the notorious 
"relocation centers." As a result of the exclusion order of 1942, many Japanese 
Americans were, in the words of writer Eugene V. Rostow, "sent to concentration 
camps on a record which wouldn't support a conviction for stealing a dog." 
Locally, many internees were held temporarily at the Santa Anita racetrack in 
Arcadia before being moved to internment camps. At Santa Anita, children did 
their school lessons in the grandstand in front of the parimutuel windows 
because their mothers did not want their education interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tonai, whose mother was a teen-age internee in Rohwer, Ark., many 
people, however guiltless, were ashamed of being interned and never spoke about 
their camp experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes such eloquent objects as an oil painting titled "Family 
in Camp Room," done in Rohwer. It shows how internees tried to brighten the 
small, barracks-like spaces where they suffered marriage-testing lack of 
privacy and other indignities. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit also bears witness to the achievements of contemporary women. In 
the exhibit is a robe worn by Fumiko Hachiya Wasserman as a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge. "It brings the story up to the present," Duchemin said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Strength & Diversity: Japanese American Women 1885-1990" through May 30 at 
the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, 4700 Western Heritage Way, next to the 
Los Angeles Zoo. Open daily except Monday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $7 
for adults, $5 for senior citizens and students with valid ID and $3 for 
children 2 through 12. Information: (213) 667-2000. For a list of related

 BACK TO ROOTS: Ever get the idea that people like to attend conventions in 
Anaheim just to get a company-paid trip to Disneyland or the beach? Not so when 
thousands of California dentists converge on the Anaheim Convention Center 
today for a four-day session. . . . Sponsors say at least 100 dentists must buy 
equipment or X-rays from the 550 exhibitors to replace goods damaged during the 
Northridge earthquake. Says a spokeswoman: "They need to get their offices back 
in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 LOOK-ALIKES? Students often wear uniforms in private schools. But in public 
schools? The Huntington Beach Union High School District adopted a new dress 
code this week (B2) to control the tank tops and T-shirts featuring lurid 
pictures or words. . . . But the code also lets any of its high schools opt for 
wearing uniforms. None have such plans so far, but some say it may happen. The 
school board's stated dress-code goal: "To foster student success in a positive 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 NO SINGING ANGEL: It isn't likely any ballplayer would try this approach 
today: Country music star Charley Pride, who used to play semipro ball, writes 
in his new autobiography that when he failed in a tryout with the Angels as a 
youth, he approached owner Gene Autry on a hotel veranda. Pride pleaded: "Mr. 
Autry, don't let them cut me. Just let me stay and I'll pay my own expenses." . 
. . Autry told him he left baseball decisions to others. But Autry loves 
country music, and later became a huge fan of Pride's. 
</P>
<P>
 GABE & BOB: In another autobiography, "Uncommon Knowledge," former actress 
Judy Lewis reveals that she is the product of her mother Loretta Young's fling 
with Clark Gable. Lewis also discloses that one of her beaus in the early 1950s 
was none other than local Congressman Robert K. Dornan, then a Loyola 
University student. . . . Loretta Young not only approved, Lewis writes, but 
"she once said to me: 'Bob will either become a charming bum or a tremendous 
success.' "

 NO SURPRISE: School bond issues, requiring a two-thirds mandate, have proven 
tough to pass. So it figured Burbank's $100-million bond referendum to upgrade 
public schools would fail -- despite a majority of voters approving it. About 
90% of local bond issues in the state have failed. The last success locally was 
the Saugus Union School District in June, 1993. . . But Burbank officials say 
they'll try again (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 NAIL BITER: Think your vote doesn't count? In Santa Clarita on Tuesday there 
were 10,452 ballots cast, and when all the counting was done only eight votes 
separated City Council incumbent Jill Klajic and challenger H. Clyde Smyth 
(B1). . . . The final outcome depends on the 175 absentee and 25 provisional 
ballots yet to be verified and counted. 
</P>
<P>
 SAVIORS: They work without pay, collecting only gratitude. And they certainly 
deserve plenty of that. They are Mennonites (above), a Christian denomination. 
In three months since the quake, they have helped rebuild about 80 
quake-damaged Valley dwellings (B1). . . . There are about 200,000 Mennonites 
in the United States, including four congregations in the Valley.

 DYNAMIC DOUGH: Batman can obviously do a lot more than fight crime. The caped 
crusader can also generate cash. So far, the Batman ride, which opened March 
26, has done big wonders for Six Flags Magic Mountain, near Valencia. . . . "We 
open a new ride every year," said a park spokeswoman, "and this compares to 
Viper, which opened in 1990." In all, about 350,000 have taken the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 INSURANCE: More bad news for quake victims. Many complain they can't cash 
insurance checks because they were made out to mortgage lenders as well. . . . 
There had been hope that Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi would rectify 
that problem. But faced with the threat of a lawsuit, he decided Wednesday not 
to order checks to be written to policy holders only (D3). Michael Arkush

POLICE CONFIRM DRUG ARREST OF COBAIN'S WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In an ironic twist to the suicide of Nirvana star Kurt Cobain, police on 
Wednesday confirmed that about the same time he is believed to have shot 
himself to death in Seattle, his wife was being arrested on drug charges in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock musician Courtney Love, 28, the mother of a 19-month-old girl, was 
arrested last Thursday at the posh Peninsula Hotel after hotel officials called 
police to report that they believed one of their guests had overdosed on 
heroin, Beverly Hills Police Sgt. Robert Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles to go over final details of the release of a new album by her 
band, Hole, Love had spent much of the week searching frantically for Cobain, 
who had unexpectedly walked out of a drug-treatment program at Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital in Marina del Rey and disappeared, according to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said she was taken into custody under the name Courtney Michelle Cobain 
and taken by paramedics to Century City Hospital. But she was not admitted, and 
at noon she was booked into Beverly Hills jail on suspicion of possession of a 
controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a 
hypodermic syringe. 
</P>
<P>
 She posted $10,000 bail and was released Thursday afternoon with arraignment 
set for May 5, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours later, the body of her husband, Nirvana's lead singer, was 
found by an electrician at their Seattle home. Seattle authorities said Cobain, 
killed by a shotgun blast to the head, had been dead about a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout their fast-rising careers, Love and Cobain had been known as much 
for the Angst and upheaval of their personal lives as for the music that so 
moved their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors about their drug use were rampant. In one infamous moment, Love was 
quoted in Vanity Fair as saying she took heroin while pregnant with their 
child. She later insisted that she had not known that she was pregnant at the 
time and that she stopped using the drug immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain, meanwhile, admitted in a 1992 interview with The Times that he had 
used drugs, including heroin, but then said he was drug-free. At the time, he 
explained that he did not want his daughter to be told by someone else that her 
parents were addicts. But there were other reasons as well: A Los Angeles 
County agency, apparently alarmed by the Vanity Fair report, had threatened to 
take custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple prevailed, and the drug scandals died down until last month, when 
Cobain was hospitalized in Rome in a drug-and-alcohol induced coma. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times three days before her arrest and Cobain's 
death, Love seemed sobered by her husband's close call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accepted the fact I was a drug addict, and I go to the . . . meetings," she 
said, displaying a Narcotics Anonymous handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I am aware I am not above it. I realize drugs can floor me."

JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATIONS IN KING LAWSUIT; TRIAL: HIS ATTORNEY SAYS CASE 'IS 
ABOUT RACE' AND COMPARES HIM TO FIGURES IN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. SIDES ARE 
FURTHER APART THAN EVER ON ISSUE OF MONETARY AWARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in Rodney G. King's lawsuit against the 
city after closing arguments in which both sides indicated they were further 
apart than ever on the issue of how much money King should receive from the 
city for his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, King's lead attorney, asked jurors to award $15 million in 
damages for the injuries King received in the beating that involuntarily thrust 
him into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X -- these people were all in the 
civil rights movement voluntarily," Grimes said. "Mr. King is a symbol 
involuntarily, but no less a symbol." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent argued that race was not a factor in the 
beating. He said jurors should consider only the injuries King sustained during 
the confrontation with police in Lake View Terrace on March 3, 1991, in 
determining damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city accepted responsibility for the injuries to put this case behind 
us," he told the jury, asking it to award King $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures reflect how far apart the two camps have become now that the jury 
will determine how much King will receive. During settlement negotiations 
before the case went to trial, Grimes asked for $9.5 million and the city 
offered $1.25 million.  
</P>
<P>
 initial,3 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers wrapped up their arguments in the first phase of the trial after 
three weeks oftestimony and 38 witnesses. After jurors determine the amount the 
city should pay for King's injuries, a second phase of the trial will address 
individual liability of officers and other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 During his summation, Grimes said King was beaten because he is black. "This 
case is about race," Grimes said. "We don't want to talk about race . . . we 
want to shoo it under the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said King contributed to the confrontation with police by leading 
officers on a high-speed chase while he was intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incident, King has undergone medical treatments costing about 
$200,000 for such injuries as facial and leg fractures, Grimes said. King still 
suffers from flashbacks, dizziness, blurred vision and numbness in his face 
from multiple baton blows, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pulverized the bones in his face," Grimes said. King's emotional scars 
are even worse, causing him to rarely venture out in public without a bodyguard 
and to wear a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no life," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the beating, King was humiliated by officers who used the 
racial epithet "nigger" to taunt him, his lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said a sound expert had isolated the racial slur on a soundtrack of the 
beating videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said he could not hear the word on the tape but he suggested that if 
jurors do hear it, they should consider the conditions under which it was said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make the judgment it was said, think about the emotion of those 
officers," said Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Vincent said, "This is not a case about a word, this is not a case about 
racial slurs. . . . If it was said, what is a word worth?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent questioned whether King suffered blows to his head. He said such blows 
from a baton would have lacerated his skin, and there were no such lacerations. 
</P>
<P>
 He also brought up King's several run-ins with the law before and after the 
beating, including arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol. He told 
the jury about a robbery conviction in 1989, a paternity suit for child support 
and a confrontation with police when King was accused of picking up a 
transvestite in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said that King's injuries have largely healed and that he has been 
enjoying celebrity status since the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Salzman, who represents former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, told jurors that 
Grimes' comparisons to civil rights leaders were misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. King is a symbol of himself," Salzman said. "It's not black America 
versus the city of Los Angeles or the NAACP versus the city of Los Angeles."  
</P>
<P>
 John Burris, another attorney for King, accused the city of "blaming the 
victim" by attempting to use King's checkered past to show that he is not 
worthy of a large award. 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were tried in King's beating and acquitted of most charges in a 
state case, sparking three days of rioting in Los Angeles in 1992. Laurence M. 
Powell and Koon were later convicted of violating King's civil rights and are 
serving 30-month sentences in federal prison.

DDT CLEANUP MAY MEAN MORE MOVES; ENVIRONMENT: FEARS ESCALATE AS HIGHER LEVELS 
ARE FOUND. THE EPA DELAYS DIGGING AND SAYS OTHER FAMILIES MAY BE SENT TO 
HOTELS. 
</P>

 Confronted with growing neighborhood unrest, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has temporarily postponed its excavation of DDT-tainted soil from two 
back yards near Torrance, and officials say it is possible that the agency will 
agree to move more families during the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the dispute is a community group's request that the EPA relocate up 
to 17 families while the soil is removed. Three families already were moved 
temporarily from their homes to hotels Monday at federal expense. Two families 
have refused to sign agreements allowing the EPA to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the excavation has been planned for weeks, neighborhood fears 
increased sharply with the news last week that DDT levels in the two yards 
along West 204th Street east of Torrance city limits were more than seven times 
higher than previous tests showed -- and as much as 45 times higher than levels 
considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a whole new ballgame here. More testing needs to be done 
before they start digging that up," said community leader Cynthia Babich, who 
as of Wednesday night still had not signed the agreement because of questions 
about the project's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich's back yard is one of two scheduled to be excavated because high levels 
of the banned pesticide were found in them this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal environmental officials said they will address public concerns at a 
meeting starting at 6 tonight at the Vandeene School Auditorium, 829 Javelin 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA had hoped to break ground for the two-week project by today but now 
says the work will be postponed at least until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich said she and other residents negotiated a truce with the EPA on 
Wednesday that calls for the project to be halted while the federal agency 
addresses community concerns about safety. Two key issues, she said, are 
whether the EPA will agree to relocate more families and to build what she 
called a "wind-screen" around the project to contain the DDT-contaminated soil 
during the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Aguirre, Babich's next-door neighbor, who also has refused to sign 
an agreement with the EPA, on Wednesday praised the agency for postponing the 
project and for what he called a more cooperative stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Donohue, an EPA spokeswoman, said it is "perfectly possible" that 
more families may be relocated to hotels temporarily but that no final 
decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA also has agreed to the concept of building a wind-screen but must 
first study the screen's design and technical aspects, Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being postponed, not only because two families have not signed 
agreements, but because of neighbors' questions, Donohue added. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a widely used pesticide, DDT was banned for most uses in the United 
States in 1972. It damages the reproduction of wildlife and is suspected of 
causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials recommend taking precautions when DDT concentrations exceed 
100 parts per million, and they consider 260 p.p.m. grounds for immediate 
cleanup. Based on earlier testing in the mid-1980s, the EPA had concluded that 
DDT levels in the area did not threaten public health. But the agency decided 
to remove the soil after tests this winter detected unusually high DDT levels 
-- 245 p.p.m. in Babich's back yard and 606 p.p.m. in Aguirre's yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests made public Friday revealed even higher levels of the pesticide, 
reaching 4,509 p.p.m. in an area near Babich's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have said the excavation does not pose a health hazard and that 
the three families have been relocated so that they are not inconvenienced by 
the excavation work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although agency experts say the DDT found on West 204th Street may simply be 
an isolated deposit or "hot spot," some residents suspect the substance may 
have traveled from the nearby site of the former Montrose Chemical Corp., where 
the pesticide was manufactured from 1947 to 1982. Montrose is now a federal 
Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the EPA announced plans for expanded soil testing in the yards of 
up to 100 more homes in the area to assure that DDT contamination is not 
widespread.

A MOTHER'S DAY GIFT FOR INMATES AND FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of families split apart because their loved ones are in prison will get 
a rare chance to reunite on Mother's Day, thanks to an unusual program backed 
by the Los Angeles Police Department and bankrolled by a local businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family ties are the most positive factor that we can have in rehabilitation," 
LAPD Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker said Wednesday at a news conference called to 
announce Operation Family Reunion. "We are very excited about the program. We 
don't think it's a cure-all, but we have a fundamental belief in the family and 
its positive effect on people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, 40 mothers and wives will get a free trip to San Quentin 
over the Mother's Day weekend next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Theus, who heads the HELP Public Service Foundation, dreamed up the idea, 
and Tom Nix, president of a check-cashing business, put up the money. Although 
the Police Department is not providing any funds, Kroeker brought Theus and Nix 
together and endorsed the project, which he and the other sponsors said could 
benefit law enforcement and the community by ensuring that inmates return home 
with stronger bonds to their families and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can help these people now," Theus said, "or they can help themselves to us 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, mothers of two inmates tearfully thanked the sponsors 
for a program that will give them the opportunity to visit their sons in the 
faraway penitentiary, located north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want (my son) to know that when he comes home, he comes home to a family 
that loves him and a church that's still behind him," said Catalina Weaver, 
whose son has been convicted of murder and is on Death Row at San Quentin. "He 
needs to see my face." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, whose son was arrested the day before Mother's Day in 1992, said she 
has occasionally been able to visit but only with the help of her family and 
church. "Every time I go, I have to find the funds," she said. "It's always a 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Theus said he is convinced Operation Family Reunion will soften prisoners' 
antipathy toward police and ease their return to society once they are freed 
from prison. Visitation, according to Theus and police officials, is one of the 
strongest elements of rehabilitation: Prisoners who get more frequent visits 
are far more inclined to resist the temptation to return to crime when they get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prisoners who receive visitors generally behave better behind 
bars, prison experts say. That is because visitation is a privilege that can be 
taken away, so inmates who have visitors tend to follow rules lest they 
jeopardize their privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus raised all those issues with Kroeker when the two first met several 
months ago. Kroeker said he quickly agreed that the program had merit, so he 
called Nix, who has contributed to a number of causes, and asked for his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pleased to step up to the plate," said Nix, the president and founder 
of Nix Check Cashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nix is supplying enough money to pay for the Mother's Day bus, which will 
leave on May 6. Funding for future buses still has not been arranged, but Theus 
said he hopes contributions will make it possible to run buses regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason that a bus like this couldn't go every week," Kroeker said. 
"The more the visitation, the better the re-entry." 
</P>
<P>
 For Geneva McClintock, whose 32-year-old son is serving 15 years to life at 
San Quentin, that prospect is the only thing that sustains her hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son needs us to visit so that he knows we love him," said McClintock, who 
added that that neither she nor her husband have a job, making it difficult for 
them to pay for trips north. "These people are letting us go."

A SCHOOL ASKS WHY; SHOOTING: 10-YEAR-OLD BOY'S ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AT FRONT DOOR 
OF SCHOOL LEAVES PARENTS, OFFICIALS AND STUDENTS SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even in a city where life often ends young, this is not supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth-grade boy is not supposed to be carrying a gun. He is not supposed to 
be crying at 7:30 a.m. He is not supposed to stand at the front door of his 
elementary school and shoot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a fifth-grade boy did. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes before the morning bell rang at 49th Street Elementary School 
in South-Central Los Angeles, this sobbing youngster pulled a .380-caliber 
semiautomatic pistol from his backpack, then pressed it against his temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun was owned by his father, who kept it stashed under a mattress. The 
ammunition was stored separately, on the top shelf of a bedroom dresser. The 
boy, police said, had searched out the weapon and loaded it himself. As his 
classmates filed into school, he fired a single round. 
</P>
<P>
 His 10-year-old body fell to the pavement, not far from a sign that warns, "A 
Safe School: Everyone's Responsibility. Report Weapons on Campus." A pool of 
blood spilled out, leaving large red droplets on the ground even after a 
custodian tried to hose it down. After more than four hours of surgery, the boy 
remained in extremely critical condition late Wednesday, hooked to life-support 
machines in the neurosurgical intensive-care unit at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at loss for words," said Los Angeles Police Detective John Garcia, who is 
investigating the shooting. "It just kind of makes you shake your head." 
</P>
<P>
 This corner of South-Central is no stranger to gunfire. The 49th Street 
School, in fact, was turned into a battlefield 10 years ago when a deranged 
neighbor opened fire on the campus, killing two people and wounding a dozen 
others before turning the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the distraught parents who came to pick up their children Wednesday, 
news of the apparent suicide attempt was as inconceivable as it was sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ay, this poor little boy," said Alicia Sanchez, as she headed home with her 
kindergarten-age daughter. "I don't understand how he could have the capacity 
to do something so horrendous. At that age, they're minds are still so clean, 
so pure." 
</P>
<P>
 The only possible clue to the boy's grief, police said, was a one-day 
suspension he had received Tuesday from one of his teachers. A classmate, 
11-year-old Steve Navarrete, said it was for using profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher said: 'Don't come to school tomorrow,' " the classmate recalled. 
"He was kind of sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Lemuel Chavis said the boy, who did not have a history of 
disciplinary problems, had been given a note asking his parents to come to 
school Wednesday to discuss his behavior. Although the note may have urged the 
youngster to stay home for a day, Chavis said, it was not considered a formal 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me to fathom that a note like that would create this kind 
of anxiety, unless there was something else bothering him in his personal life 
or home life," Chavis said. "I certainly didn't see this coming, and I don't 
think the teacher did either." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the boy never told his parents about his trouble in class. As 
usual, the boy's father dropped him off at school Wednesday morning. At the 
family home, police said, they saw no signs of physical or emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just seemed like any other ordinary family," Garcia said. "And he just 
seemed like any other ordinary 10-year-old boy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a ritual that has become all too common at Los Angeles schools, crisis 
counselors for both students and staff were called in shortly after the 
shooting. A psychologist who serves as a suicide-prevention consultant for the 
Los Angeles Unified School District also was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, nervous parents gathered outside the schoolyard, 
complaining about what they perceived as a lack of security. Cristino Palacios, 
the father of a first-grader, circulated a petition demanding increased patrols 
during the hours when youngsters arrive and leave the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just really did something to me," said Pat Smith, the aunt of two 49th 
Street students, whose own son attended the school during the 1984 sniper 
attack. "First, these kids get shot by the people who live across the street. 
Now one of their own classmates tries to take his life. It's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Few children as young as this ever go to such extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,055 suicides in Los Angeles County last year, more than 90% were 
committed by adults. In only one case, a coroner's spokesman said, was the 
victim younger than 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Romero, the mother of a first-grader and third-grader at 49th Street 
School, hopes she never sees another so young. On Wednesday, she struggled to 
choke back tears as she described seeing this boy's body sprawled in a puddle 
of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked so precious," she said. "So tiny to be taking his own life."

CITY STILL IN HAZE ON LAWS ON SMOKING; CAMARILLO: RESIDENTS PACK A HEARING. 
OFFICIALS UNDECIDED ON WHETHER TO OK A SWEEPING BAN OR LESS RESTRICTIVE 
MEASURE.

<P>
 A near-capacity crowd of about 200 Camarillo residents packed a public hearing 
in the City Council chambers Wednesday night to speak on two proposed laws that 
would restrict smoking in public places in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By late evening, however, the council still had not reached a decision on 
whether to approve either ordinance. The tougher of the two laws would 
effectively ban smoking in all public places in the city except bars, tobacco 
shops and private residences. A less restrictive version would allow smoking in 
most public places provided there are separate nonsmoking areas with separate 
ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The council initially considered the stricter version at a meeting in 
February. But after an outcry by smokers' rights advocates and owners of small 
businesses, council members decided to send the ordinance back to a committee 
for reworking. 
</P>
<P>
 A less restrictive ordinance would allow smoking in restaurants and nonprofit 
bingo operations in the city provided the establishments offer completely 
separate nonsmoking areas and have separate ventilation systems. The 
alternative ordinance would also exempt restaurants with seating capacities of 
35 patrons or less. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the majority of the speakers early in the evening favored some 
form of a smoking ban, while other speakers opposed any sort of restriction on 
the grounds that it would infringe on personal freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are talking about is liberty and justice, and slowly but surely these 
things are being taken away from us," resident Gloria Scott said. "Anti-smoking 
people aren't out for justice, they are out for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Clay, an employee at Two Plus Two Restaurant on Pickwick Drive, also 
spoke against both proposals, saying she feared that, as written, the laws 
would keep restaurant customers away, causing business to suffer and 
restaurants owners to lay off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many restaurants cannot comply with the restrictions (the council) is 
thinking of putting on us," Clay said. "If this passes, this will put people 
out of work and shut down businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of a smoking ban wore stickers on their clothing emblazoned with 
large red hearts and the words, "The Heart is a No-Smoking Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bob Church said he favored the more restrictive of the two proposed 
laws. "Does my neighbor or her daughter have to die as a result of a lenient 
policy? When you vote, please, I beg you, vote for life." 
</P>
<P>
 And resident Donald Anderson compared the controversy over the city's proposed 
ordinances to that sparked by the state motorcycle helmet law. He argued that 
both issues were more than just matters of personal choice, but affect the 
broader public concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I've heard tonight is about the rights of business owners, but the health 
of the general public is at stake here," Anderson said. "Please vote for the 
most restrictive ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the meeting, smokers went out for cigarette breaks in the courtyard 
outside council chambers. Many wore "Commie-rillo" T-shirts as an expression of 
their concerns about restrictions on personal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, who first proposed adoption of a citywide 
nonsmoking ordinance in the city, said she wants to get a smoking ban on the 
books because it is a health matter and out of concern for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws restricting smoking have been adopted by four other Ventura County cities 
-- Moorpark, Ojai, Thousand Oaks and Ventura -- as well as by the county Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview before the meeting, Dorothy Walden, owner of Dorothy's 
Chuckwagon, a small cafe on east Ventura Boulevard, said approval of the less 
restrictive ordinance would mean that she would not have to bear the expense of 
creating separate nonsmoking areas or installing separate ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said she stands to loose a large portion of her customers if the more 
restrictive ordinance had been passed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the early mentions of a possible smoking ban in the newspapers made me 
lose customers," Walden said. "I figure that when this whole the started I was 
losing $100 a day and for a restaurant of my size, that's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said she would prefer an ordinance that would effectively let business 
owners decide for themselves whether to allow smoking, and then hang an 
appropriate sign outside the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Camarillo resident Linda Butcher, who is also a school nurse for the 
Oxnard Union High School District, said before the meeting that the only way to 
assure nonsmokers that they will not be affected by second-hand smoke is 
through the council's passage of the tougher ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a law should include imposing complete bans on smoking in restaurants and 
in bingo parlors, because many nonprofit groups use school facilities for bingo 
fund-raisers during off hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is appalling that smoking is allowed to take place on public 
school campuses," said Butcher, a member of the Camarillo Voters for Health 
Coalition. "It does not matter how much money is raised in bingo, it's the 
message we are sending to the students."

ELECTIONS / COUNTY AUDITOR; STRATTON TO APPEAL RULING ON QUALIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeal court on Wednesday upheld an earlier ruling that Simi Valley Mayor 
Greg Stratton lacks the educational qualifications to run for county auditor, 
but Stratton said he will file an appeal today with the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've got something significant enough to tickle the fancy of the 
Supreme Court," Stratton said. "So we're going to go up and give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Stratton said Wednesday that he would not file an appeal with the 
state Supreme Court because he feared it might delay the county from printing 
sample ballots next week for voters to review before the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 But he changed his mind after learning that county election officials had 
planned to wait until 3 p.m. Friday before ordering the printing to proceed in 
the event of a higher court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura denied Stratton's 
petition of mandate challenging a ruling handed down earlier by Superior Court 
Judge William L. Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck ruled that Stratton's master's degree in business administration from Cal 
Lutheran University does not qualify him for the job because it was not earned 
at an accounting school. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton said that the 1957 state law outlining the requirements for 
auditor was vague and that the issue should have been left "for the public to 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's more to it than just a little race in Ventura County, like the 
bigger issues of what's fair and what's right," Stratton said of his decision 
to go ahead with another appeal. "Maybe there's really something here that the 
state Supreme Court would be interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 William Baker, a certified public accountant and one of five other candidates 
for auditor, filed the lawsuit challenging Stratton's qualifications. He said 
he believed the state Supreme Court would also rule against Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he feels that strongly about it, he should appeal," Baker said. "But my 
attorneys tell me the farther you go up the ladder the less likely you will 
prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for county auditor, state law dictates that a candidate must either 
be a certified public accountant, have served as county auditor controller or 
deputy auditor controller for at least three years, or possess a certificate or 
diploma from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no more schools of accountancy in California, Stratton 
argued that his master's degree in business administration -- including 14 
units in accounting -- was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Peck said while Stratton might have a strong background in 
accounting and business administration, he nevertheless did not meet the 
literal requirements for the job as outlined in the 1957 law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton said he believed that the courts are still wrestling with the 
interpretation of the law. He said that the 2nd District Court of Appeal last 
year overturned a lower court decision eliminating a candidate in the race for 
Santa Barbara mayor. In that case, the court ruled that a legal challenge of 
the candidate's qualifications must occur after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state Supreme Court needs to clarify this issue" Stratton said. "The 
courts just can't say different things every six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robert R. Orellana, assistant county counsel, said the printer 
responsible for printing the county's sample ballots is ready to go, and is 
"just awaiting word from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The county needs to start printing sample ballots by Monday in order to meet a 
state mandated deadline for mailing samples to voters, Orellana said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the June 7 election, voting officials are required to mail sample ballots 
to the county's 350,000 voters between April 28 and May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "The printer has two plates ready," Orellana said, "one with Stratton's name 
and one without."

ON TARGET; 11 OF THE 25 RECRUITS JOINING SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ARE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a new class graduates Friday from the Ventura County Criminal Justice 
Academy, it will be a historic moment for women in the male-dominated Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A record number of female deputies -- nearly half of the 25 deputies hired 
this year -- will receive their diplomas and join a department that has been 
criticized by county officials in recent years for not hiring enough women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treated the same as the guys, and that's important," said Michelle 
Skaggs, 24, of Ventura. "I like competing with guys. I like to prove that women 
can do the same job as men." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ventura County law enforcement agencies, the Sheriff's Department has 
the most women, partly because they are needed to watch over female inmates at 
the county's Ojai Jail Honor Farm, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have women, so we will actively seek them," said Sgt. Stephen 
DeCesari, who is in charge of training at the academy. The 14 men and 11 women 
joining the department will first be assigned to the Ventura County Jail and 
later rotated out to patrol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Friday, a dozen male officers will graduate from the academy 
and join the Oxnard Police Department, which has one of the poorest track 
records in the county for hiring women. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six of the department's 147 officers are female. Oxnard Police Sgt. Gary 
Amar said the department has historically had a problem recruiting officers -- 
male and female. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just hard to get people to come work here," Amar said. "They have this 
image that the city has the worst crime rate in the county. It's an image that 
we can't live down. We would love to have more women come out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Amar said Oxnard officials had extended a job offer to a woman last year, but 
she rejected it because she became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being admitted to the academy, all students must already be hired by 
local police departments or the Sheriff's Department. Each department has its 
own hiring policies and does its own screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's graduating class will be the first entry-level hires the Sheriff's 
Department has made in two years, DeCesari said. Because of budget cutbacks, 
new recruits have not been hired since January, 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCesari said three women dropped out of the class before the 22-week training 
period was up, including one who suffered physical injuries. He said he did not 
know why the other two left. 
</P>
<P>
 The next class, scheduled to begin in May, will have two women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Female deputies said having other women in the class helped them survive five 
months of basic training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just different for girls to talk to girls," said Michele Olmstead, 22, 
from Westlake Village. "When I went through the L.A. County Reserve Academy, I 
was the only woman. It helps a lot to have more women in with you. You don't 
feel so intimidated by everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmstead said she was drawn into law enforcement because of her father, a 
retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. Her father will present Olmstead 
her diploma Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandra Pugh, 31, of Camarillo, said some of the men thought the female 
students were weaker, even though the women were required to pass the same 
physical tests as the male deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the guys did, we had to do," Pugh said. "It means we have to try harder 
to keep up with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Male students said they had no problem training next to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any difference to me," said Mitchell Jan, 35, of Santa 
Barbara. "I think having a higher percentage of women makes for more variety." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Crowe, 22, of Granada Hills, said she felt pressure to do well because of 
her gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think women have gotten a bad rap," Crowe said. "I don't want any special 
breaks, and I don't want to be hired because I'm female." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department's affirmative action policy requires that women and 
minorities be selected first for the training academy if they are equal to or 
better qualified than their competitors. Eighty-one of the department's 588 
deputies are female. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a county report criticized the lack of women and minorities in 
Ventura County government's top executive and law enforcement jobs. The 
department has been accused by women and minorities of being insensitive, and 
11 of the department's 15 African-American deputies have sued for 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Kathy Kemp, the highest-ranked woman in the department, said she still 
encounters some chauvinism, but calls the Sheriff's Department one of the most 
progressive in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said women still have to work harder than men to earn respect in the 
department, but acceptance is becoming easier. When Kemp graduated from the 
academy in September, 1979, she was one of three women in a class of 42. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times are changing," Kemp said. "We need to see that our department is 
reflective of the community we serve." FYI 
</P>

ceremonies at 2 p.m. Friday at the Camarillo Community Center, 1605 E. Burnley

RECONSIDERATION OF LANDFILL LEASE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn is urging his fellow board members to 
reconsider their decision to extend the lease of Bailard Landfill, saying his 
environmental concerns about the Oxnard dump have not been adequately 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who will ask his colleagues Tuesday to set up another hearing on the 
extension, contends the board cut short a March 1 public review before voting 4 
to 1 to keep the landfill open another three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that a fair and open public hearing was not provided," said 
Flynn, who cast the only vote against the dump's continued use. "I was neither 
given the time to identify all the significant issues nor offer a resolution to 
the problems. I had to hurry my presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, Flynn's request for another hearing has received an icy 
response from his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason to put people through this again," Supervisor Susan K. 
Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Supervisor Maria VanderKolk: "He is just trying to beat a dead horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But his senior 
administrative aide, Rosann Gallien, said Flynn is concerned that the continued 
use of the dump -- situated above the Oxnard aquifer -- could contaminate the 
city's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been bothering him and he has been talking about it a lot," Gallien 
said. "He decided he wanted to go back over this and address the water quality 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But VanderKolk said the county has conducted extensive studies to make sure 
the dump will not contaminate the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It absolutely has been addressed," she said. "There has been a lot of testing 
done and everything has shown it to be safe. John just doesn't believe the 
reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Whitney, general manager of the Regional Sanitation District, which 
operates the dump, said Flynn is only grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have any issues of substance to put forth to get a 
reconsideration," Whitney said. "He is simply attacking his colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's discontent over the dump is nothing new. For years Flynn has been 
fighting to close the facility, which is in his district, claiming there are 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have also accused him of inciting a group of nuns who live 
near the landfill into criticizing the extension because of health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March 1 hearing, nearly two dozen nuns of the Sister Servants of Mary 
argued that the noise, odor and dust from the facility were making them ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors requested that officials from the Regional Sanitation District 
meet with the nuns to address their concerns by April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I can tell you is that we've tried to negotiate," said Mother 
Mary Purificacion, adding that so far talks have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Flynn told the sisters at the convent that he planned to ask his 
colleagues to reopen the issue. But the nuns will consult their attorney before 
deciding to speak out on Flynn's request at Tuesday's meeting.

DEPUTY D.A. FACES ARREST COMPLAINT; JURISPRUDENCE: THE WIFE OF A MAN ON TRIAL 
WAS APPREHENDED LAST WEEK AS SHE WAITED TO TESTIFY. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE 
CITES CHILLING EFFECT ON WITNESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County deputy district attorney has been accused of prosecutorial 
misconduct after a witness was arrested last week as she waited in a courthouse 
hallway to testify in her husband's drug trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence Kilbride appeared at a hearing before Superior 
Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. on Wednesday to answer the complaint by the 
public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 6, Kilbride directed a Sheriff's Department law clerk to check 
whether there were outstanding arrest warrants for Kara Crecelius, an Ojai 
woman who had come to the Hall of Justice to testify in the drug-possession 
trial of her husband, John Crecelius, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The check turned up two warrants against Kara Crecelius for failure to pay 
traffic tickets. Kilbride informed the clerk that Crecelius was at the 
courthouse and, when the woman was not immediately arrested, he phoned the 
Sheriff's Department on the matter a second time, the clerk testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that she is still here, and that no one has picked her up," testified 
clerk Ruth Feagans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara Crecelius was arrested moments after Kilbride's second call and spent 
several hours behind bars before Campbell ordered her released to testify in 
the drug case. In her trial testimony, she described the circumstances 
surrounding her husband's Dec. 19 arrest in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, the jury convicted John Crecelius of possession of 
methamphetamine for sale and being under the influence of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 After the afternoon hearing on the misconduct complaint, Campbell said he will 
make a ruling May 11, when Crecelius is scheduled for sentencing. Crecelius' 
attorney wants Campbell to order a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint against Kilbride raises questions about what actions, if any, 
should be taken by prosecutors and other court officials when people wanted by 
the law show up to testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Todd R. Howeth, who accused Kilbride of misconduct, 
said defense witnesses will be too frightened to testify if prosecutors have 
them jailed on misdemeanor warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kara Crecelius' case, she admitted at Wednesday's hearing that she had 
failed to pay $307 in fines from tickets in 1989 and 1991. Campbell ordered her 
to straighten out the bill. "I would like to get them cleared up within the 
next month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth said of the woman's arrest, "The reason this is remarkable is both the 
prosecutor and the investigating officer said this has never happened in their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case law says unless there are absolutely compelling reasons, the D.A.'s 
office is not to arrest defense witnesses," Howeth said. "It does send a bad 
message in these cases that when you call witnesses, they could go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbride -- a former Ventura school board member -- declined to comment, 
saying the case has not been resolved. Other officials in the district 
attorney's office said Kilbride was asking the Sheriff's Department to arrest 
Kara Crecelius only after she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said the prosecutor's office has no 
specific policy on the matter. Unlike peace officers, prosecutors are not 
legally bound to alert authorities when they come across someone wanted by the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are prohibited from doing anything that would chill a defendant's 
right to present evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, from where I sit, this appears to be a kind of allegation that 
public defenders are making more and more frequently, and perhaps doing so for 
tactical reasons," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy, who represented Kilbride at Wednesday's 
hearing, called the complaint against his colleague disgraceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy also accused the public defender's office of staging a "dog-and-pony 
show for the press." Only one news organization covered the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a witch hunt, and I think to subject Mr. Kilbride to this 
type of abuse is offensive," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is harassment. . . . I think it's time to say enough ," he said. "There 
was no misconduct here. There's nothing here except a chance for our public 
defender's office to do what it loves to do. And that is to smear the 
prosecutor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy urged Campbell to rule that Kilbride had not conducted himself in an 
inappropriate manner. He said the focus should be on John Crecelius and his 
felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's sentence the crook," Hardy suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courtroom, Hardy was still fuming. He said the complaint is a 
defense maneuver to help get John Crecelius off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no wonder that the people have no faith in lawyers," he groused. "It's 
disgraceful and makes me ashamed that I decided to become a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth, however, defended his complaint. He said he hopes Campbell grants his 
client a new trial on grounds of witness intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I'm doing is litigating the facts," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MICHAEL 
JACKSON PROBE NEARING END, GARCETTI SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michael Jackson child molestation investigation is nearing an end and 
prosecutors expect to decide this month whether to file criminal charges, Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties have been investigating 
the child sex allegations since Aug. 17, 1993, in what Garcetti described as an 
exhaustive probe "that is not that unusually long." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're nearly there," Garcetti said during his monthly office meeting with 
reporters. "I think we will have a decision on the Michael Jackson case by the 
end of the month, that's my hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti again dismissed reports that prosecutors in both counties had already 
decided not to prosecute the pop star. Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty. Thomas 
Sneddon Jr. said Monday that the investigation is active. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began last summer when a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson, 
35, of seducing him into having sex during a five-month relationship. The 
teen-ager filed a civil suit against the pop star. It was settled out of court 
for a reported $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was scheduled to meet with Sneddon this week, and the current 
session of the Santa Barbara County grand jury, scheduled to expire this week, 
was extended to hear more evidence in the Jackson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson defense attorney Howard Weitzman has condemned the lengthy 
investigation, saying his client is innocent. "I'm confident there is no 
evidence that indicates Mr. Jackson has committed any crimes," he said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; APPEAL OF JURY'S MAKEUP TO BE HEARD

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks death-penalty defendant's appeal of the Ventura County grand 
jury's racial makeup will be heard April 22 in Santa Barbara County Superior 
Court, a Ventura County judge said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Mark Scott Thornton want charges against their client thrown out 
on the grounds that the 19-year-old defendant was indicted by a grand jury that 
systematically excludes Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thornton is white, his attorneys argued he still has the right to a 
jury that is representative of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath disqualified himself 
from hearing the issue because he helps select county grand jury members. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter was reassigned to Santa Barbara County Judge Bruce W. Dodds, who 
asked that concerned parties appear in his courtroom to settle the matter. 
Originally, Dodds was scheduled to hear the case in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, McGrath, who will still hear the death-penalty trial, ordered 
Ventura County sheriff's officials to transfer Thornton to Santa Barbara County 
on April 22 for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is accused of kidnaping and fatally shooting Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan, the mother of a young boy, on Sept. 19. DWAYNE BRAY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ALONDRA PARK; NEWBORN 
GIRL FOUND DEAD IN TRASH CAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A newborn girl was found dead in a trash can in Alondra Park near the city of 
Lawndale on Monday night by a man searching for aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified infant, who investigators believe had been born only a few 
hours before she was found, was wrapped in a size 18 or 20 long-sleeved woman's 
shirt and stuffed into a white plastic garbage bag before being put in the park 
trash can.Her umbilical cord was still attached. Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson 
said the 8-pound infant showed no obvious signs of trauma, but the cause of 
death has not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said the baby was found about 7:30 p.m. Monday in the northeast 
corner of the park near Manhattan Beach Boulevard. The shirt she was wrapped in 
was white with rust-colored stripes with "Venezia" printed on the label. Anyone 
with information about the infant is asked to call the sheriff's homicide 
bureau at (213) 890-5500.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
DETECTIVES ARREST SUSPECT IN 1983 SYLMAR SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Work by homicide detectives in the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Division has led to an arrest in a 1983 murder, the second old case to see a 
recent breakthrough.  
</P>
<P>
 Just a week after helping track down a Seattle-area man wanted for a 
19-year-old Pacoima homicide, detectives arrested a suspect in a Sylmar murder 
who was in hiding for 11 years, authorities said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the last six years, they said, suspect Richard Label Hill was 
living in the San Fernando Valley under several assumed identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 28, was arrested in the 1983 murder of a Sylmar teen-ager. Hill was 
taken into custody as he visited his North Hollywood parole agent, who thought 
he was someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Hill's case came after authorities tracked down Richard Leos, a 
murder suspect in an unrelated case, and had him arrested by a multi-agency 
task force operating in the Seattle area.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COALITION CALLS FOR 
CHARGING GROCER WHO SHOT BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of Latino and African American community organizations demanded 
Wednesday that prosecutors charge a Lynwood grocer who shot and critically 
wounded a 14-year-old boy he suspected of shoplifting a bag of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kim, the owner of Charlie's Market in the 3200 block of Martin Luther 
King Jr. Boulevard, told authorities he shot the teen-ager during a 
confrontation April 2 because he thought he was reaching for a weapon in his 
waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting has outraged many Latinos and African Americans in Lynwood and 
nearby communities who see it as a racially motivated attack. The teen-ager who 
was shot is Latino; Kim is Korean American. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded boy was one of five youths who entered the store, according to a 
Sheriff's Department report. Three of the boys bought items, but two others 
allegedly left without paying for cookies they took, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim chased those two s several blocks in his car. He told deputies that one 
drew a knife when he was confronted. The other motioned as though he were 
reaching for his waistband, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocer said he shot the youth who reached for his waistband and then drove 
him back to the store to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim had time to think and plan the shooting," Virginia Reade, an activist in 
the Mexican American community, said Wednesday at a press conference outside 
the courthouse in Compton. "We demand the sentence suit the crime. Anything 
less could lead to further shootings by Koreans and a race war far worse than 
the King rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is continuing its investigation and will not make any 
recommendation about charges until the middle of next week, said Mike Botula, a 
spokesman for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Reade said Wednesday's press conference was held outside the Compton 
Courthouse because "it is symbolic of the kind of judicial injustice Africans 
and Mexicans get in this judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also chose Compton, Reade said, because that courthouse is where 
grocer Soon Ja Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death 
of African American teen-ager Latasha Harlins during a dispute over a bottle of 
orange juice. She was sentenced to probation by Superior Court Judge Joyce 
Karlin, a decision that angered much of the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have a greater sanctity for human life," said Danny Bakewell, 
representing the Brotherhood Crusade at Wednesday's press conference. "There 
needs to be equal justice under the law." EDWARD J. BOYER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; CRITICS FAULT 
AIRPORT NOISE IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Airport is expanding its system for monitoring aircraft noise 
levels, but residents say it does not go far enough to reduce the annoying buzz 
of airplanes and helicopters over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Beard, noise-management manager for the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports, said the mostly complete, $1.3-million expansion of the airport's 
noise monitoring system is allowing the facility to track large airplanes' 
flight paths and identify their type and ownership, in addition to measuring 
their noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, Beard and other airport officials explained the new system's 
capabilities to an advisory group -- made up of homeowners, pilots and members 
of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council -- that is concerned with 
noise issues.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; SHE'S DIFFERENT BUT SURELY 
NOT HANDICAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every now and again, someone will stare at Maria Lices Ramirez and a question 
will pop into their head and then pop right out of their mouth. Usually, the 
question hasn't lingered long enough in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll look at Ramirez, who answers to Lices, and look at the nub where 
her right hand used to be, at the place where the fingers of her left hand once 
were attached and at thescars on her pretty face. And they wonder how she 
manages without hands. 
</P>
<P>
 She manages just fine, she tells them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, people asked me, 'Who combs your hair? Who puts makeup on you?' 
" Ramirez said, clearly amused at the notion. "I do it myself. Nobody is going 
to get up at 5 or 6 in the morning to dress me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, Achiever of the Year for Goodwill Industries of Southern California, 
works full time as a secretary for Goodwill's rehabilitation department in its 
Downtown offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disabled, right?" said the Burbank resident. "But this is me. This is no 
big deal for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was born to a farm family in Cheran, a village in the Mexican state of 
Michoacan. Her home had no electricity, so candles lit the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ramirez was 17 days old, one of those candles fell and started a fire in 
her room. Her right hand was burned so severely it had to be amputated. The 
fingers on her left hand burned. So did portions of her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember if there was pain," she says now, 25 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 For her mother, there was worry -- worry that the child wouldn't get along in 
life, that she would be handicapped by her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she was 9 months old, Ramirez began to balance a drinking cup between 
her arms and bring it to her lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she would grasp a piece of chalk the same way so she could imitate her 
brothers and sisters, who were learning to write in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to write on every single wall of the house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's mother, afraid that her child would be teased for her differences, 
would not let her start school. Eager to learn, Ramirez would sometimes sneak 
to class with her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother relented and let the child start school when she was 7 years 
old. And the teasing never came. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13, Ramirez came to the United States for plastic surgery. She spent seven 
months at Shriners Hospital, a time she remembers fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun. It's not like normal hospitals," she said. "You get up every 
morning, you go to school, you have people who are playing with you. You play 
basketball. I love basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting Mexico again she returned to Shriners, living with hospital 
sponsor families until about three years ago, when she rented a home of her own 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Ramirez has the same concerns as many Southern Californians. She wants to 
save money, spend more time with her 17-month-old son and eventually go back to 
school to earn a degree in counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help other people. There are people who are frustrated with their 
life. They have a little problem and they make it into a major problem," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to talk to them and tell them to be glad. They should be glad they 
have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez believes maybe she had an easier time with her differences because she 
learned from the beginning to work with what she had. She can file, she can 
type, she can change diapers -- just like anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because she doesn't have fingers, she makes up for it in every other 
way. She's excellent," said Denise Sherman, project manager for Goodwill's 
rehabilitation program, one of the people for whom Ramirez works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm like this because my family treated me like everyone else. I wasn't 
different. I don't feel different at all. I'm super-great," Ramirez said, 
smiling at her boldness. "You have to say, 'This is me and I like myself.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is my arm, I accept my arm the way it is," she said, holding up a 
limb. "You have to accept yourself." 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CAL LUTHERAN CELEBRATING LATINO 
CULTURE 
</P>

<P>
 Whirling flamenco dancers, Spanish movies and Mexican politics are all on 
campus at Cal Lutheran University this week as the Festival de Encuentros 
celebrating Latino culture begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which translates loosely to an encounter, or bringing together, 
is part of the university's effort to promote multiculturalism, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to highlight the various Latino communities in Ventura 
County," festival Chairwoman Rosa Moreno said. "It's really a bringing together 
of two worlds, a chance to share our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Some faculty members require attendance by students in lectures, theater 
performances and movies. But Moreno said most students are more than willing to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they attend one event, then they realize it's the best thing they've 
done all week and they go back for more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All festival events are free and open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to see some of the great contributions Latinos have made to 
culture and politics," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Navarro, professor of ethnic studies and a member of the Ernesto 
Galarza Think Tank at UC Riverside, will lecture on the Chiapas uprising in 
Mexico and immigration laws at 10 a.m. Friday in the Preus-Brandt Forum on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Misa Flamenco trio performed in the chapel, and tonight 
Fuego Flamenco, featuring dancer and director Roberto Amaral, take to the stage 
in Preus-Brandt Forum. The performance begins at 8, but Moreno advises people 
to come early. MARY F. POLS

 A Simi Valley police car broadsided another car Wednesday morning, critically 
injuring the other driver outside a Metrolink Station parking lot on Los 
Angeles Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the police car, Officer Rick Rinehart, a 12-year veteran, was 
not hurt, police said.But Peggy Sphar, 45, of Simi Valley apparently was not 
wearing her seat belt and was thrown from her car and suffered head injuries, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar, who works as a nurse at Simi Valley Hospital, was taken to the hospital 
shortly before 8 a.m. and underwent surgery, hospital spokeswoman JoLynn de la 
Torre said. Sphar was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Sgt. Mike King said detectives are still investigating the 
accident. Both Sphar's station wagon and the patrol car received moderate 
damage, King said. Rinehart was on routine patrol at the time and was not 
responding to any calls at the time of the accident, King said. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB VANDALIZED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vandals broke into the Simi Valley Boys & Girls Club over the weekend, 
splattering paint and scrawling obscenities on the walls, floors and furniture 
and stealing a tether ball and four fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at the club's temporary home on Kadota Street on Sunday, 
Executive Director Becca Merrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a string of mishaps to befall the club, which serves 
about 2,000 Simi Valley youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago the club was forced out of its permanent building after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake caused $100,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's vandalism was the second such incident since the club moved into its 
temporary quarters, Merrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago vandals knocked over shelves and dumped paint on the floor, 
Merrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're just getting one hit after another," Merrell said. "Some of 
the kids really feel upset, like 'Why us? We didn't do anything wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An estimate for Sunday's damage is still being compiled, Merrell said, because 
she is trying to determine whether a pool table that was coated with paint can 
be salvaged or needs to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects, said Sgt. Mike King of the Simi Valley Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the club is seeking donations of board games, balls and 
markers, crayons and other arts and crafts materials. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a donation, call the club at 527-4437. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RENTERS ALLOWED TO KEEP 4 CARS AT 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six adults living with two children in a rented home on Calle Tulipan will be 
permitted to keep four cars -- but only if they keep them off the street, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council decided. 
</P>
<P>
 When landlord Nidal Barakat first requested permission to rent his 
four-bedroom home to an extended family with four cars, the council deadlocked 
on a 2-2 vote with Councilman Alex Fiore absent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council reopened the public hearing Tuesday night and Fiore returned 
to the dais. He broke the tie and cast his vote in favor of the landlord, 
arguing that the family's four working adults need four cars to get to their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The second vote, although allowed under city law, sparked a minor protest from 
one nearby resident and an objection from Mayor Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that another 2-2 deadlock several weeks ago at the Janss Mall 
public hearing was allowed to stand. That tie vote effectively denied the Janss 
Corp.'s request to install free-standing signs bearing Mervyn's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent hearing ending in a tie was also allowed to stand because the 
absent council member that night, Frank Schillo, had a conflict of interest and 
could not vote on the proposal to build a drive-through McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the inconsistency, Councilwoman Judy Lazar said that no council 
member had felt passionate about the Mervyn's sign issue, so the group as a 
whole "was willing to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Fiore had asked specifically to vote on the car issue, and said 
he watched the entire public hearing on television after leaving the Janss Mall 
meeting on his doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking a new vote, the council listened to more than an hour of 
testimony from residents concerned about overcrowding and overflow parking at 
the Calle Tulipan home. STEPHANIE SIMON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAKEWOOD; PROTEST OF 
OCTOPUS DEATH URGES OFFICIAL TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal activists held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night outside the home of 
the director of exhibits at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, where Octavia the 
octopus was found dead on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Yandell, founder of Education and Action for Animals, said the activists 
were upset because "a magnificent animal was taken from the sea, instead of 
returned to the ocean. . . . She was so beautiful, so magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of four animal rights groups staged the vigil at the home of Mike 
Schaadt to call for his resignation in light the death of the octopus. But 
Schaadt said he would not be home for the protest because he was taking his son 
to a Little League game.  
</P>
<P>
 The red female octopus was found dead in her 600-gallon tank after pulling a 
drain plug, releasing the water.  
</P>
<P>
 Schaadt had said the staff of the San Pedro aquarium on Stephen White Drive 
did everything it could to save the octopus. "It was near death when we got 
it," Schaadt said. "It spent three hours on the deck of a boat. It was sold as 
food, and rather than cut it up, the owner of a fish market bought it and 
decided it would be a good exhibit, so he donated it to us."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SOME 
REFORMS UNREALIZED, LAPD LEADERS TELL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community-based policing, an approach to law enforcement that the Christopher 
Commission encouraged the Los Angeles Police Department to adopt two years ago, 
remains largely unrealized despite some steps toward implementing it, LAPD 
leaders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been here since August, and I'm asked about community-based policing 
almost weekly," said Gary Greenebaum, president of the civilian Police 
Commission, whose members were appointed in August."I think there's a lot of 
confusion, and I think it leads to the sense that the department is not 
entirely serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum said he was convinced that the LAPD was serious about implementing 
the reforms, but that they will take considerable time to complete. Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams agreed, adding that the department has recently laid 
plans to hold focus groups to assess community service needs and has already 
begun forming police advisory boards in the LAPD's far-flung areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting of the Police Commission was repeatedly interrupted by a 
citizen who called the commissioners "thugs" and demanded that they adopt new 
rules for members of the public to address the board. Commissioners asked the 
man to leave, saying he was interrupting the meeting. "I'm not leaving, you 
have to arrest me," the man responded. He was arrested and taken from the room.

CONTINUES FOR JEWELRY MART ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A search continued Wednesday for three men who robbed merchants in Torrance of 
an estimated $350,000 worth of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Police Sgt. Mike Paolozzi said the three gunmen -- dressed in Army 
fatigues and wearing masks -- sneaked into the Torrance Jewelry Mart at the 
Torrance Promenade shopping center at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and forced 
employees to open several safes. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering the employees to the floor, the robbers scooped up the jewelry, 
Paolozzi said. By the time police responded to a silent alarm the robbers had 
fled, detectives said.

UNHAPPY RETURNS; HOW GOVERNMENT DISSECTS FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where does it all go? It's a common question this time of year, with Friday 
looming as the deadline for filing income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years some tax-payer groups and politicians have suggested modifying 
our tax structure. In 1992, for example, presidential candidate Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown proposed replacing the current tax brackets with a 13% flat tax 
and a 13% value-added tax, which would effectively be a national sales tax. All 
tax deductions would be eliminated except for home mortgage interest, rent and 
charitable donations. The idea was so simple, he said, that anyone's taxes 
could be figured on a postcard. The idea got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Washington-based Tax Foundation each year continues to 
designate "Tax Freedom Day," the day when the average American would have 
earned enough that year just to pay his federal, state and local taxes. In 
1950, the group estimated, the average person had to work until April 3 to pay 
his taxes. Last year, the day came on May 3 for workers nationwide and May 7 
for those California because of the state's relatively high state and local 
taxes. The foundation is keeping Tax Freedom Day 1994 a secret until Thursday. 
Until then, we can only keep working. The Cost of National Defense The federal 
dollars devoted to national defense have fluctuated over the past 50 years, 
reflecting the Vietnam War years and the end of the Cold War. Currently, the 
United States spends 18% of its budget on defense. 1940: 17% 1950: 30% 1960: 
49% 1970: 39% 1980: 23% 1990: 24% Getting Help Need help with tax returns? Or a

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HISTORIC RANCH HOUSE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A century-old ranch house near Simi Valley built and owned by a pioneering 
Ventura County family was demolished Wednesday because of irreparable 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Edwards and Ellen Leyland Gillibrand built the sprawling wood-frame 
structure in 1888, after moving from Manchester, England, to California to run 
a cattle ranch, said Juanita Brooks, a granddaughter who lived in the house 
during her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks described the house as a one-story, ranch-style building with a porch 
that wrapped around the house. An adjoining building, which once housed the 
kitchen and dining area and had been converted into a separate apartment, is 
all that remains of the house, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Jan. 17 earthquake, walls buckled and two doubled-sided fireplaces 
collapsed, sending bricks crashing through the roof, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really special place with a lot of memories," Brooks said. "But they 
didn't have the same building standards then and the damage was just horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the earthquake, Brooks' cousin, Michael Boyle, lived in the house with 
his wife, Shelly, and their two children, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boyles could not be reached for comment on the demolition of their home, 
situated in Gillibrand Canyon on Tapo Canyon Road north of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have been living in a trailer on the property since the 
earthquake, plan to build a new home on the site, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley historian Patricia Havens said the demolition of the Gillibrand 
home robs the area of a trove of information on its past as a ranching 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gillibrands were one of the most colorful families that lived here," 
Havens said. "They came over from England lured by the call of the American 
West and played a big role in the ranching world." SARA CATANIA

COUNCIL RAISES HIRING GOAL FOR WOMEN OFFICERS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE LATEST 
TARGET, WHICH IS NOT BINDING, AIMS TO MAKE EACH POLICE ACADEMY CLASS 43% 
FEMALE. CHIEF SAYS RECRUITING WILL HAVE TO BE INTENSIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reiterating its desire to boost the ranks of women police officers, the Los 
Angeles City Council on Wednesday set an annual female hiring goal of 43% and 
bolstered its recruitment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is under a 1981 federal consent decree to increase women's 
representation to at least 20%. Women now make up about 14% of the force and 
legislators view the Los Angeles Police Department expansion pushed by Mayor 
Richard Riordan as an ideal opportunity to hire more women. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the federal mandate, officials have come to view women officers as an 
integral part of good policing. The Christopher Commission, which reviewed 
department practices after the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King, found that women 
officers are less prone to violence and often can de-escalate volatile 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women may not look like the officers we're used to seeing on 'Dragnet' or 
'Adam 12' but we have to break that stereotype," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
said. "Women can do a good job and will make this a better police department." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the council set a long-term goal of 43% women on the force and 
increased the annual hiring goal from 25% to 30%. The latest target, which is 
not binding, raises the annual goal still further, directing the LAPD to 
attempt to fill each class of Police Academy recruits with 43% women -- the 
same percentage of women in the area work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams said he supports the goal but cautioned that he will 
not be able to get 43% female classes until recruitment efforts are stepped up 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a general goal and it's, 'Chief, do the best you can without 
impacting quality,' then I can live with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams acknowledged that some male officers remain resistant to a 
substantial increase in women on the force. But he said he as chief supports 
the idea and will be responsible for bringing it about. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 12,000 people who applied to become officers last year, just 
under one-quarter of them were women, according to city records. Of those 2,800 
women applicants, about one-third were admitted to the academy and roughly 80% 
of those graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel officials said those statistics show that they need to attract 
hundreds more women applicants in order to hire 43% female officers without 
altering standards. Assistant City Atty. Robert Cramer warned the council that 
hiring women at a much greater rate than men in the applicant pool might be 
viewed as discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized $250,000 to expand recruitment efforts but officials 
conceded that it will take much more money in the next city budget to reach the 
goal. A new task force that includes police officials, city recruiters and 
women's advocacy groups is working to come up with more aggressive outreach 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude had urged his colleagues not to set a firm 43% goal 
because he said doing so would obligate Williams to hire women who were 
underqualified. He suggested that the council support the concept of more women 
officers without setting an annual goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have to lower the quality in order to admit more women to the Police 
Department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg argued that the 43% goal was not binding and 
did not call for the reduction of any standards. It does send an important 
message, Goldberg said, that the city is serious about hiring more female 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new goal does not alter LAPD hiring standards, council members 
have raised questions about possible discrimination against women in the oral 
interview and physical abilities test. The six-foot wall that all applicants 
must scale in order to enter the academy has come under particularly harsh 
criticism. Women fail to climb the wall at a significantly higher rate than men 
and some experts have questioned whether the test is useful. 
</P>
<P>
 City personnel officials are reviewing the application process to ensure that 
it is not discriminatory. But making the test fair, officials said, is 
different from watering it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We specifically have stated that we don't want standards reduced," 
Yaroslavsky said. "Women can do this job and the hiring of women has nothing to 
do with the diminution of standards."

MANY INCUMBENTS OUSTED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS; VOTING: LONG BEACH MAYOR IS AMONG 
LONGTIME OFFICIALS WHO LOSE. SEVERAL CITIES SEE POWER TRANSFERRED TO LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In cities ranging in size from Long Beach to Lomita, Los Angeles County voters 
Tuesday ousted longtime mayors and council members, dramatically altering the 
local political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities -- including Maywood, South Gate and Cudahy -- saw power 
transfer to Latinos, the ethnic group that comprises the majority of their 
populations and now controls the city councils. But in Monterey Park, the 
prospect of having California's first Asian American majority on a council did 
not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the anti-incumbent fervor was striking. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, Mayor Ernie Kell lost a bid to remain the only mayor the city 
has known since voters began electing their top official in 1988. Kell, 65, 
placed a distant fifth among 13 candidates in a race that will result in a June 
runoff between former Long Beach City College President Beverly O'Neill and 
Councilman Ray Grabinski. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Rolling Hills, longtime Councilwoman Gordana Swanson, who forced 
County Supervisor Deane Dana into a runoff two years ago, was ousted from her 
city office after 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Beverly Hills, Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, the top vote-getter in 
two previous elections and a 1992 candidate for district attorney, was 
unseated. He finished third in a field of eight for two council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend was evident throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the San Gabriel Valley, 14 of the 44 city council incumbents seeking 
reelection were unseated. In fact, voters elected at least one new face in 19 
of 21 cities holding elections. In some cases, the newcomers made history. In 
La Puente, Sally Ann Holguin-Fallon was the first women elected to the council 
in the city's 38-year history, while South El Monte has its first all-Latino 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Bellflower, all three incumbents were defeated. Elsewhere in the county's 
southeastern section, at least one current officeholder lost in each of the 
following cities: Norwalk, Whittier, Santa Fe Springs, Artesia, Pico Rivera, 
Paramount, Signal Hill, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, South Gate, Maywood and 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the South Bay, voters ousted seven incumbents in four local elections, 
including three council members in Lomita and two in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 * And on the Westside, three incumbents, including Tanenbaum, were unseated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have that many cities with this kind of a pattern, it has to mean 
more than someone is upset with a specific city policy," said Larry Berg, 
director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the sentiment for change, the politics of race also loomed 
significant Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the gains made by Latinos in South Gate, Maywood and Cudahy, 
runoffs in Long Beach could give that city its first Latino council members. 
Former Long Beach school board member Jenny Oropeza will face Dianne McNinch, a 
community organizer, for the 1st District seat. In the 3rd District, Tonia 
Reyes Uranga will square off against Mike Donelon, a general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the expected political gains for the San Gabriel Valley's growing 
Asian American community failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, Sheng H. Chang became not only the city's first Asian American 
councilman, but its first ethnic minority to win a council seat.  
</P>
<P>
 But in Monterey Park, where 53% of residents are of Asian descent, all three 
Asian American candidates, including Councilman Samuel Kiang, were routed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American council candidates also lost in San Marino and Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE RETURNS ARE IN 
</P>
<P>
 Final Southland election returns will be found in appropriate suburban 
sections.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; MOVIE OFFERS YOUTHS LESSON ON HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 25 Ojai high school students spent a sunny spring break afternoon 
Wednesday in a darkened theater for a glimpse into the history of the Holocaust 
at a special no-cost screening of Steven Spielberg's award-winning film, 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Although three Ojai youths walked out of the Ojai Playhouse at the end of the 
3 1/2-hour film complaining that "there wasn't enough action," six teen-agers 
stayed an extra hour to participate in a discussion of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came because I wanted to know more about the Holocaust," said K. C. Murphy, 
a sophomore at Nordhoff High School. "I stayed for the discussion because I 
wanted to know even more about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff senior Shannon Gulden agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought I should see it," she said. "All we learn in school is the 
numbers -- 6 million dead. We never hear stories about Jews. I think it's 
important for everyone to learn at a personal level." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was provided at no cost to the students by theater owner Khaled 
Alawar, who wanted to educate Ojai Valley youths about the extermination of 6 
million Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very strongly that it is a movie that everybody should see so we're 
all aware of something that happened in history," Alawar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's screening was not part of the Schindler's List Project, which 
offers free screenings to high school students in 37 California school 
districts, including Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School students will see the film later this month, said 
district Assistant Supt. Susan Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 High schools students in Oakland made newspaper headlines in January when they 
laughed during a scene in the film and were ejected from the theater. The event 
touched off a campaign to educate youths about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a Roper poll found only half of American high school students knew 
what the word Holocaust means. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai resident Adelle Chabelski, vice president of Second Generation, a Los 
Angeles County-based organization for children of Holocaust survivors, asked 
Alawar in December about providing a screening of "Schindler's List" to educate 
local students. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we translate the lessons (of the Holocaust)?" Chabelski asked. "Well, 
Spielberg organized the material by doing it through the story of Oskar 
Schindler. He also gave us the hope that one man could stand up to a system."

<P>
 Former President Gerald Ford will host a fund-raising barbecue dinner tonight 
for Brooks Firestone, a candidate for the 35th Assembly District seat that 
includes portions of western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted to give Brooks a hand," Ford said in a statement."He's a 
straight-talker and he's dedicated to fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who is uncontested in the Republican primary in June, said he was 
honored by Ford's endorsement. He said the two are longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising event will be held on the grounds of the Firestone winery in 
the Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly in 1982, will face the 
winner of the Democratic primary in November. Competing for the Democratic 
nomination are Bob Ream, a former aide to state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara), and Mindy Lorenz, an art history instructor at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35th Assembly District encompasses Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and most of 
Santa Barbara County. The seat is now held by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria), who is running for Hart's seat in the state Senate. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY TO STUDY LEGALITY OF LANDFILL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council authorized its attorney Tuesday night to explore legal 
options to keep an initiative off the November ballot that would bypass county 
supervisors and authorize a dump at Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The council questioned the legality of a move by Taconic Resources of San 
Diego County to put the issue up for a countywide vote and asked City 
Atty.Monte Widders for a report April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this represents a significant challenge for Ojai's efforts to 
prevent construction of a landfill," City Manager Andrew Belknap said. But he 
also asked the attorney to investigate whether the city has the right to 
campaign against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and residents have fought to keep a dump out of Weldon Canyon, 
which is about five miles south of Ojai. Residents fear that a landfill there 
would increase traffic on California 33 and cause air pollution and health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taconic Resources representatives said that ballot initiatives have been 
used elsewhere for similar purposes and that the process is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to find anything to invalidate it," said Richard 
Chase, general partner of Taconic. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic, which is negotiating with Waste Management Inc. to take over a lease 
on the land at Weldon Canyon, is now working to get petition language approved 
so that it can secure 18,753 valid signatures before June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The few Ojai residents in attendance Tuesday night pledged their support to 
fight the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do whatever is necessary to fight this initiative," said Andrew Stasse, 
a member of the Coalition for Environmental Education, formerly known as the 
Coalition to Stop Weldon Canyon Dump.  
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we're firing up the engines again." TRACY WILSON

QUAKE HURTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District suffered a 3.6% enrollment decline 
this spring because of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, with losses at two of 
its San Fernando Valley colleges much higher, district officials reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit among the district's nine campuses was Mission College in Sylmar, 
which has 10.1% fewer students than had been expected before the 
earthquake.Next were Valley College in Van Nuys, with a 6% drop, and Los 
Angeles Trade-Tech, with a 5.1% decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment had been expected to drop even without the earthquake, from about 
106,000 students last spring to a projected 103,941 this spring. But officials 
estimated that the quake alone caused enrollment to fall to 100,145. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles and four other Southern California community college 
districts, the issue of trying to identify the impact of the earthquake -- as 
opposed to other factors -- on their enrollment could become an important 
financial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges in California get most of their funding from the state 
based on the number of students they enroll. But for this fiscal year, the 
state Assembly has passed and the Senate is scheduled to consider urgency 
legislation to shelter the five districts from state funding cuts resulting 
from earthquake-related enrollment losses.

NO BUILDING CAN BE MADE ENTIRELY QUAKE PROOF, EXPERTS WARN; THOUSAND OAKS: 
FORUM BY STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS, ARCHITECTS, TILE MANUFACTURERS AND CONTRACTORS 
EXPERIENCES A POSSIBLE AFTERSHOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Experts check everything from soil stability to plywood quality during the 
construction of new homes, but even after dozens of inspections, they cannot 
guarantee that a building will withstand major earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dozen presentations designed to reassure Thousand Oaks residents, local 
structural engineers, tile manufacturers and contractors described the myriad 
steps they must take before certifying a home as stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tremendous number of safety factors built in here," architect Gary 
Heathcote said during a three-hour public forum before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "But expecting buildings to come through absolutely unscathed . . . is beyond 
what a building can accomplish," Heathcote said. "Each seismic occurrence has 
its own thumbprint. You can't find a single quake and say, 'Ah, that's how this 
building will always react.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the experts testified, the council chamber vibrated slightly as though 
from a minor aftershock late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech and the National Earthquake Information Service had no information 
about a late-evening tremor in Thousand Oaks, but council members said the 
shaking jolted them as they sat at the dais. 
</P>
<P>
 The swaying did not faze speaker David Carpenter, however, who continued his 
testimony on improving the business community's earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing backup power generators and ice-making machines for food 
refrigeration, business owners could be ready to respond to a major disaster, 
he said. Residents, too, should be ready to endure up to three days on their 
own: Pack an emergency kit and keep a supply of cash and checks on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But tips for future quakes did not much interest Michele Relkin, who was 
focused on the damage wreaked by January's disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling not to cry, Relkin pleaded with the council to help her finance an 
estimated $75,000 in damage to her Woodside Drive home. The Relkin home, 
perhaps the hardest-hit residence in Thousand Oaks, shook so much that walls 
shifted, the fireplace crumbled and all the windows blew out. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff has so far helped Relkin navigate the maze of red tape to receive 
federal and state grants. And next week, the council will consider freeing 
redevelopment money and federal block-grant funds to aid the Relkin family and 
others whose homes are severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, redevelopment housing money can be used only to assist low- and 
moderate-income families. But in the disaster's aftermath, city staff can now 
open the coffers to help any resident, regardless of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to bend over backward to do whatever we can to help people, even if 
that means having to bend or stretch a few rules," Councilman Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will also consider using $501,000 in federal block-grant 
money to rebuild walls on private property that tumbled or tilted during the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to two hours of testimony from residents and experts, council 
members agreed to confer with homeowners living in a few tracts that 
experienced widespread problems, including collapsed chimneys and damaged 
roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a dozen or more homes built by the same contractors suffered similar 
losses, city staff will investigate potential legal action against the 
developer or builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know, how did these type of defects manage to evade detection?" 
asked Susan Gulbrandsen, whose home on Cedarwood Street sat in one of the 
damaged pockets. "I want some answers." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the city's director of building and safety, Barry Branagan, noted 
that Thousand Oaks inspectors perform only spot checks and cannot evaluate 
every home in every tract. 
</P>
<P>
 With fireplaces, for example, city inspectors examine the base to make sure 
it's attached to the foundation, then check to make sure that the chimney is 
supported by four steel bars. After the builder meets those tests, the city 
usually stands back, Branagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we've done in the past is trusted that these people know what 
they're doing," Branagan said. "The city does not warranty, insure or otherwise 
guarantee the plans or the construction work."

STAFF PREPARES TO REOPEN LIBRARY; QUAKE: THOUSAND OAKS FACILITY HAD $2.5 
MILLION IN DAMAGE AND HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY HOUSED AT NEWBURY PARK BRANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 April's Vogue is displayed on the magazine shelves, many reference books are 
neatly filed away and the computers are all plugged in, back where they belong 
in the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that most of the ceiling is missing, the carpets are all gone and 
the fountain near the entrance is dry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, nearly three months after the Northridge quake caused $2.5 
million in damage to the main library at Janss Road, the staff left their 
temporary home in the Newbury Park branch and began moving back in. 
</P>
<P>
 Both libraries will be closed through the weekend so that the staff can finish 
restoring order. In the meantime, books can still be returned through door 
slots, and employees are directing anyone desperate for a library to the one in 
Westlake Village until Monday at 9 a.m., when the two Thousand Oaks libraries 
will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going really smoothly," said Susan Odencrantz, head of circulation, as 
she directed a moving man carrying a plastic garbage bag full of furry puppets 
toward the children's section. "It's not going to be pretty for a while, but 
it's going to be organized." 
</P>
<P>
 The core reference books, most of the periodicals, videos and many computers 
were moved to Newbury Park gradually after the quake. Staffers used their cars 
and borrowed vans to move things bit by bit. On Wednesday, two large moving 
trucks and a moving crew arrived for the move back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is luxury," Odencrantz said, watching as workers rolled carts of books 
into the building. "After the quake we took everything over in our cars." 
</P>
<P>
 As 75 staffers and volunteers began the task of putting everything back, the 
atmosphere at the library alternated between bustling activity and joyful 
reaction to the sight of old objects returning to their rightful homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh good, the garden is here," one staffer joked as another walked by with two 
trays of potted plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxygen, oxygen!" said Brad Miller, who oversees the library's special 
collections and also functions as informal computer guru. 
</P>
<P>
 "I unplugged yesterday, I'm plugging in today," he said, leaning on a cart 
full of computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the roof remained intact, the metal ceiling beneath it was completely 
torn out by the force of the quake, carrying the lighting system with it. On 
the way down, the sheets of metal sheared off sprinkler heads, starting a 
deluge that destroyed 10,000 volumes in the children's section alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it avant-garde industrial," said Steve Brogden, the library's deputy 
director, looking up at the exposed pipes and gray roof speckled with white 
repair patches. "The lights are kind of like basketball court lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said the most urgent repairs include replacing the ceiling 
and installing new lighting. Installing new wall-to-wall carpet throughout will 
probably have to wait until fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, library staffers are putting on rubber-soled shoes before they go 
to work in preparation for standing all day on bare concrete floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the water-damaged volumes have already been replaced. One publisher 
donated 41 boxes of children's books. The only ones that haven't been replaced 
are out-of-print volumes, which staffers hope to find in second-hand stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government and insurance payments should cover most of the 
earthquake damage, with the city chipping in an estimated $250,000. To meet 
those costs, the Library Restoration Committee has been holding fund-raisers, 
including bake sales and "mock-stock sales," where shareholders receive stock 
certificates and get their name printed on any book in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance worker Jose Murillo, the only person who was in the library at the 
time of the Jan. 17 quake, on Wednesday returned to the reference section where 
he had been at work wiping tables when disaster struck. Windows broke around 
him and metal sections of the ceiling rained down on his head as he ran for the 
exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Other staffers were amazed that he made it out of the building in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'What happened, what happened?' " Murillo said Wednesday as 
he dusted off books in the reference section. He waved at the crews around him 
getting the building into shape. "This is much better now."

$4.9 MILLION SOUGHT FOR COUNTY PROJECTS; WATER: THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE REQUESTED 
BY REP. GALLEGLY TO COVER SUCH ONGOING WORK AS HARBOR DREDGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) this week requested $4.9 million for 
several continuing federal water projects in Ventura County during the next 
fiscal year, including the maintenance and dredging of the Channel Islands and 
Ventura harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who represents most of Ventura County, asked for the funds in 
written testimony delivered Tuesday to the House Appropriations subcommittee on 
energy and water development. He said approval of the money for the Army Corps 
of Engineers "would have the dual effect of providing flood control and 
economic development benefits for Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly made precisely the same pitch last year when he requested $7.4 
million. Congress appropriated $7.28 million for Ventura County projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Gallegly's specific requests were included in President Clinton's 
proposed budget. The lone exception was $300,000 for an engineering and design 
survey of several Ventura Harbor jetties that were damaged when the Northridge 
earthquake seriously displaced armor stones. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriations panel's deliberations represent the first congressional 
step in the budget process for the 1995 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The 
deliberations will culminate in a massive energy and water development spending 
bill next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest sum on Gallegly's list is $2.42 million for the operation, 
maintenance and dredging of Channel Islands Harbor. An additional $1.2 million 
is sought for routine maintenance and dredging of Ventura Harbor's navigational 
channel. The harbor generates more than $30 million annually in direct and 
indirect benefits, the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress allocated $4.8 million last year to complete a breakwater expansion 
to make Ventura Harbor safer as well as $1.2 million for annual dredging. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is seeking another $500,000 to allow the Corps of Engineers to 
complete a study of Santa Paula Creek. This would enable the corps to finish 
planning, engineering and designing specifications for a project designed to 
eventually provide flood protection to a large portion of the central business 
and residential areas of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly also requested $205,000 for operation and maintenance of the Port of 
Hueneme and $300,000 for a continuing study of the feasibility of widening and 
deepening the harbor entrance to accommodate larger vessels. Over the past two 
years Congress has approved a total of $600,000 for the port expansion survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The port has attracted considerable new business since it was designated a 
port of entry by the U. S. Customs Service two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, port officials announced an agreement with Del Monte Fresh 
Produce Inc. to build a $3-million cold-storage warehouse on the port's south 
terminal. Del Monte guaranteed at least $600,000 in annual tariff charges.

EX-SOMIS COUPLE HELD ON BANKRUPTCY FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura County couple, forced to declare bankruptcy after losing a 
lawsuit, were arrested Wednesday on federal indictments charging them with 
lying in bankruptcy court to shield $1 million in embezzled funds and $9.5 
million in furs and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and June Dubin, former residents of Somis, face charges of bankruptcy 
fraud and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Robert Dubin, 52, is charged with filing false income tax 
returns. Prosecutors say he failed to mention more than $1 million they believe 
he embezzled from one of his accounting clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dubins, who now live in Palm Springs, were each released on $25,000 bail 
and are awaiting trial. They could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indictment paints a vivid picture of a couple scrambling to protect 
their most valuable assets after losing a lawsuit over a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The story begins in 1987, when June Dubin was involved in an accident that 
left another motorist dead, said Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Jay 
Katzman. After a civil trial two years later, the Dubins were ordered to pay 
$4.4 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after the court ruling, the Dubins declared bankruptcy. But the 
lawyer for the other party suspected they had not disclosed all their assets to 
the court, Katzman said. The lawyer contacted IRS and FBI agents, who launched 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictments, the agents charge that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Dubin, an accountant operating in Hollywood and Encino, embezzled 
more than $1 million from a client, Arrow Highway Steel. He did not report this 
income in bankruptcy papers or on tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * June Dubin, 54, moved jewelry, coins and crystal to her mother's house and 
failed to list these valuables as assets in the bankruptcy proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dubins failed to include 10 fur coats, worth an estimated $42,400 in 
their statement of net worth. 
</P>
<P>
 * The couple transferred $82,000 to a corporation, made up of their children 
and stepchildren. The corporation then bought the Dubins a home in Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The couple opened new bank accounts to conceal some $234,800 in expected 
income. The income was not included in the assets listed for the bankruptcy.

<P>
 Katzman said the suspected embezzlement came to light because of the 
bankruptcy investigation. Since embezzlement is not a federal crime, 
prosecutors are charging Dubin with making false statements. Altogether he 
faces nine counts of conspiracy, bankruptcy fraud and making false statements.

PAIR IN SUSPECTED STOLEN CAR HELD AFTER 4-COUNTY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 California Highway Patrol officers early Wednesday laid down a bed of spikes 
and then rammed a stolen car on California 118 east of Ventura to stop the 
vehicle after a chase through four counties, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt during the pursuit, which began near Lake Elsinore about 10:40 
p.m. Tuesday, authorities said.Jason Lee Mitchell, 20, of Lake Elsinore and a 
17-year-old juvenile were arrested on suspicion of auto theft and evading 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers chased a 1987 Honda Accord from Riverside County through Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, said CHP Officer Mike Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The car entered Ventura County northbound on the Ventura Freeway, and officers 
pursued it into Ventura, reaching speeds of 80 m.p.h. Just south of California 
126, they pulled out a spike strip on the road, about 20 feet long and 6 feet 
wide, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two left wheels of the car were punctured and lost air slowly, Martin 
said. The car then exited at Seaward Avenue, and Ventura police followed it to 
Saticoy Avenue, where the chase moved to eastbound California 118. Near 
Vineyard Avenue, the car nearly hit California Transportation Department 
employees working on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Martin said, he rammed the stolen vehicle from the side with 
his patrol car and sent the Honda spinning. After it stopped, officers arrested 
the pair, he said. The suspects did not appear at the time to be under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol, Martin said.

RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY KEY CANCER GENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key gene that normally suppresses cancer has been identified by researchers, 
offering an important new focus for treating the disease, scientists reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of the gene was detected in a broad range of cancers, including 60% of 
breast cancer cases and 82% of one type of brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very close to the action of cell division. When it's broken, destroyed 
(or) mutated, cell division is left out of control," said Dr. Mark Skolnik of 
the University of Utah Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly identified tumor-suppressing gene, called p16, appears even more 
significant than the previously identified p53 gene, which is believed to be a 
major factor in fighting colon, breast, liver and other cancers, said Alexander 
Kamb of Utah-based Myriad Genetics Inc., who helped lead the p16 research. 
</P>
<P>
 The p16 gene controls the production of an enzyme that inhibits cell growth in 
cancer genes and p53 does not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer researchers are increasingly turning their attention to suppressor 
genes, which brake uncontrolled cell division. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to these suppressor cells -- by chemicals in cigarette smoke, 
ultraviolet light, radiation or other carcinogens -- may be the chief cause of 
cancer, Kamb said at the annual meeting of the American Assn. for Cancer 
Research, in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 P16 may not be the "magic bullet" that ties all cancers together, but it is a 
major step, Kamb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks really promising as a major player in human cancers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the p16 gene -- called MTS1 by the Utah team -- was first 
announced by David Beach of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah team researched the gene's role in fighting tumors and is publishing 
its findings in the Friday issue of Science.

LAKERS ROUTED BY SUNS, THEN RIPPED BY MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is how bad things have gotten for the Lakers: 
</P>
<P>
 They were routed by the Phoenix Suns, 117-88, before 19,023 at America West 
Arena as Charles Barkley had 20 points and 20 rebounds and Cedric Ceballos had 
29 points in only 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that wasn't even the biggest scorching of Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 That came afterward, when Coach Magic Johnson ripped most of the starters as 
quitters who have taken an early vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One team (Phoenix) is in the playoffs and going for a world championship, and 
another team is already on vacation," Johnson said after the Lakers' fourth 
consecutive loss, their longest skid since Jan. 9-18. "And they played like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've quit already. As a matter of fact, we had done that the last couple of 
games. As soon as we didn't win versus Denver, we kind of packed it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it's going to play in my decision (to return as coach). This 
is just tough for me to handle and deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elden (Campbell), Vlade (Divac), all them, if they don't want to play, fine. 
They won't play. . . . I'm disappointed in all five of them in their effort and 
the way they came out and approached this game. This is natural. Every time we 
get hit with a right hook, we submit. It's over. We go into the tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson later amended his statements to find praise for the starting guards, 
Tony Smith, who had 22 points to lead the Lakers in scoring for the third 
consecutive outing, and Nick Van Exel. The frontcourt players should just be 
happy they weren't cut on the spot. Johnson threatened them with reserve roles 
against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, saying the likes of Dan Schayes, 
Kurt Rambis, Antonio Harvey and Doug Christie deserve the minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Divac: "It was really tough. But I think we will come out strong the 
next game." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all their other problems, the Lakers played without James Worthy, 
who was suspended by the league without pay and fined $5,000 for his fight the 
night before with Golden State's Chris Gatling. Gatling was fined $4,000 but 
did not have to miss any games because NBA Vice President of Operations Rod 
Thorn ruled he tried to retaliate while Worthy instigated the scuffle and 
connected on a punch. 
</P>
<P>
 The total damage for the Laker forward was about $27,811 -- $22,561 for the 
missed game, $5,000 for the fine and $250 for the ejection. He accompanied the 
Lakers to Phoenix on their late-night charter flight Tuesday, only to return to 
Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon after news of the suspension because he 
would not have been able to attend the game, even as a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Laker loss, combined with Denver's victory at San Antonio, dropped the 
Nuggets' magic number to clinch the final playoff spot to two. . . . There is a 
downside for the Lakers having Magic Johnson as coach after all. Witness the 
comments from Chris Webber after collecting 25 points, 10 rebounds, nine 
assists and three blocked shots, all better than his season averages, to lead 
Golden State to a 128-117 victory Tuesday at the Forum. Asked about playing in 
front of Johnson, the Warrior rookie said: "It made me want to play harder. I 
want to beat him, even in all-star games, and tonight was no different. You 
look over and you see your idol over there and it makes you want to play 
harder. . . . There is nothing like using what he taught you against him." 
Johnson said the two Michigan natives have been friends since Webber was in 
eighth or ninth grade. And of the most recent comments? "I want him to get 
pumped up," Johnson said. "I want my team pumped up, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are guaranteed back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 
1974-75 and 1975-76. . . . The Lakers will commemorate the 10th anniversary of 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer with a halftime 
ceremony at Friday's game against Portland. Abdul-Jabbar passed another former 
Laker center, Wilt Chamberlain, on April 5, 1984.

BO STEALS SHOW, NOT THE GAME; BASEBALL: JACKSON'S THREE-RUN HOMER IN THE NINTH 
GIVES ANGELS A TIE, BUT INDIANS WIN, 6-5, IN 10TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleveland right fielder Wayne Kirby had three hits and drove in two runs. 
First baseman Paul Sorrento had two towering home runs. Starter Charles Nagy 
retired 13 in a row at one point and yielded only four hits in eight innings. 
And Kenny Lofton hit a 10th-inning home run that gave the Indians a 6-5 victory 
and their first sweep at Anaheim Stadium in almost two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bo stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the fact Cleveland won. What the crowd of 16,682 -- and undoubtedly 
including many who were listening in their cars on the way home -- will be 
talking about this morning is their version of Bo's blow, a three-run homer in 
the bottom of the ninth that sent the game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, it will be described as a "rocket" and a "blast," but in reality it 
was a slicing fly ball to right field that barely cleared the 362 sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who last swept a series here in July, 1975, appeared headed for 
their sixth victory in seven games this season in the ninth when Tim Salmon 
looped a one-out single to right. Chili Davis followed with a walk and that 
brought on Jackson for that one not-so-mighty swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans may have been dancing in the aisles, but Jackson was less than 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fighting back doesn't get the job done," he said. "You can have six of seven 
numbers in the lotto, but if you don't have that seventh number, you don't get 
jack. And we got swept. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I sound crabby, bear with me. I hate to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive game in which Jackson came to the plate 
representing the tying run in the ninth inning, and this time he charmed. 
Jackson had been hitless in 11 at-bats before slapping a single to right in the 
seventh inning, including three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the bitter with the sweet when you play Bo Jackson," Angel Manager 
Buck Rodgers said. "We've just been pulling up short. Dramatics are great when 
you win, but not when you lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Angels' moment of glory was extremely short lived. Lofton opened 
the 10th inning with a home run to right off Scott Lewis, who got the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sweep, the Angels feel as if they showed they can compete with a 
team such as Cleveland, if they could just figure out a way to handle whoever 
the Indians decide to drop into right field and the No. 9 spot in the batting 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 During Monday's home opener, it was Manny Ramirez. Rodgers said he didn't know 
who "the masked man in right field" was, but would be sure to remember his name 
after Ramirez had two home runs and five runs batted in. Tuesday night, Ramirez 
failed to get a hit, but he walked with the bases loaded and the Indians won by 
one run, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night it was the feared Kirby batting last and playing right field. 
Predictably, Kirby had a big night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels grabbed an early lead when Davis bumped his average up to .500 with 
a second-inning single that caromed off diving shortstop Omar Vizquel. One out 
later, Eduardo Perez gave the Angels a 2-0 lead with a home run well beyond the 
386 sign in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland responded with a run in the third inning when Kirby lined a single 
to right and then scored on a hit-and-run double down the left-field line by 
Lofton. Angel starter Phil Leftwich averted further trouble, however, when he 
caught Lofton straying too far off second, and the Indian center fielder was 
tagged out by third baseman Damion Easley after a rundown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels maintained their one-run margin until the fifth when the Indians 
again ran themselves out of what might have been a big inning. Sandy Alomar Jr. 
opened the inning with a single to right and then stole second base. Leftwich 
caught Jim Thome looking at a third strike, but Kirby ripped his second 
line-drive single to right to drive in Alomar and tie the game, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagy, a 1992 all-star who spent most of the 1993 season on the disabled list 
after undergoing shoulder surgery, cruised after Perez's homer. He retired 13 
in a row, and only two Angel hitters managed to get the ball out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians took the lead in the seventh. Leftwich, who had recorded a number 
of warning-track outs, yielded a bases-empty blast to Sorrento. When Thome 
doubled to right one out later, Rodgers had seen enough and went to Craig 
Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts was no match for Kirby, who slapped his third consecutive single to 
right and Cleveland led, 4-2. Sorrento made it 5-2 with another homer in the 
ninth.

KINGS' WIN HELPS SOLVE ENTRY DRAFT QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, what's left for a King fan in the dog days of April? 
</P>
<P>
 Watching a hockey game at the Forum is almost like being an Angel fan at 
Anaheim Stadium in September or a Ram fan in December. It seems like a game, 
sounds like a game, but really, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
 For the Kings, there was really only one suspenseful question on Wednesday: 
Would they get the sixth or seventh pick in June's entry draft at Hartford, 
Conn. The issue was decided with a 6-4 victory over the Calgary Flames at the 
Forum before 14,444 as right wing John Druce picked up the second hat trick of 
his career and added an assist. It was the Kings' third consecutive non-sellout 
after recording 16 straight sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 With a loss, the Kings could have played for last place in the Pacific 
Division in tonight's season finale against Edmonton. Last place means the 
sixth selection in the draft and second-to-last means the seventh. There is 
talk the Oilers are thinking about picking Brett Lindros, Eric's younger 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lindros would probably be welcomed in silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kings put it away with two third-period goals. Druce finished off the 
hat trick with a shorthanded empty-netter with seven-tenths of a second 
remaining. They were Druce's 12th, 13th and 14th goals of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Druce said. "A hat trick is hard, especially for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Oilers tied the Sharks, 2-2, in San Jose on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (27-45-11) have 65 points, and the Oilers (25-45-13) have 63. But 
even with a victory tonight, Edmonton would still finish last in the Pacific 
Division because the Kings have more victories, which is the first tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first Kings' victory at home since March 19 when they beat San 
Jose. They had lost four consecutive games overall and seven of their last 
eight before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring the other King goals were Dixon Ward (his 12th), Kevin Todd (eighth) 
and Luc Robitaille (43rd). Robitaille added two assists. Two Flames hit the 
40-goal mark on Wednesday -- center Robert Reichel and right wing Theoren 
Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Coach Rick Dudley has left the King organization to join the expansion 
Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League. He will be the Vipers' 
general manager and coach. Dudley started the season as the Kings' director of 
pro scouting and replaced Tim Bothwell on Jan. 31 in Phoenix, the Kings' minor 
league affiliate. Under Dudley, the Roadrunners went 21-10-3 but missed the 
playoffs. Phoenix has missed the playoffs three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Several team awards were handed out Wednesday: outstanding defensive player 
(Jari Kurri), best newcomer (Robert Lang), outstanding defenseman (Rob Blake) 
and most valuable player (Wayne Gretzky). Los Angeles media members voted on 
those four awards. King players also named most inspirational player (Pat 
Conacher) and unsung hero (Kelly Hrudey). The club's front office gave the 
community service award to Dave Taylor, and Gretzky was voted most popular 
player by the fans. . . . There will be a brief ceremony honoring Taylor before 
tonight's game, the season finale. Taylor will then take the opening faceoff.

NHL ROUNDUP; ISLANDERS ARE JUST IN TIME TO GET PLAYOFF SPOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Islanders got to playoff form three weeks before the playoffs, 
about the same time that the Florida Panthers began playing like an expansion 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off for the Islanders, who beat the Tampa Bay Lightning, 2-0, 
Wednesday night at St. Petersburg, Fla., to wrap up the final Eastern 
Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't even have to travel when the playoffs open Sunday because they 
begin play against the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Thomas scored twice and Ron Hextall made 30 saves for his fifth shutout 
of the season for the Islanders, who finished the regular season 5-0-3 at the 
same time the Panthers were going 0-4-4 and falling from contention. New York 
made up nine points on Florida in the closing weeks of the season to move into 
eighth place, the final playoff position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very exciting in our last eight games," New York Coach Al Arbour 
said. "We've been finding ways to win. Early in the year we were finding ways 
to lose. Now we have to keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 9, Montreal 0 -- Ray Sheppard, Keith Primeau and Shawn Burr scored 
twice and Bob Essensa made 24 saves as the Red Wings won at Detroit to clinch 
the Western Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-goal margin equaled the worst loss in Montreal's 77-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 8, Ottawa 0 -- Vincent Riendeau recorded his first shutout of the 
season and Bryan Smolinski scored twice as the Bruins won at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 2, Edmonton 2 -- The Sharks' Arturs Irbe made 22 saves at San Jose 
and established a league record for minutes played in a season, 4,407.

 Mike Brown, general manager of the Cincinnati Bengals, said he is not 
concerned about reports that the team's practice field is contaminated with 
lead and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a safety risk unless you are on the property," he said, "and only 
then if you are down on the ground and eat a yard and a half of soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Well, the average 
Bengal lineman eats that much dirt before noon." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the last Dodger to win the National League batting 
championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance man: Lou Tepper, Illinois football coach, is urging linebacker 
Dana Howard to skip a photo session with other members of Playboy magazine's 
All-American football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Dana that if he boycotts that event, he'd still be an All-American and 
he'd have a lot more women respect him," Tepper said. "Personally, I feel 
Playboy magazine is an affront to women. But my values differ from others." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute: The inaugural voting for the USC athletic Hall of Fame 
identified Jon Arnett and Frank Gifford as the first inductees in the pre-1960 
football era. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford was a full-time starter at tailback for only one season, 1951. His 
fame came later with the New York Giants. Overlooked were such famous Trojans 
as Morley Drury, Jess Hibbs, Ernie Smith, Cotton Warburton, Orv Mohler, Gus 
Shaver, Aaron Rosenburg, Harry Smith, and Grenny Lansdell, who were standouts 
for more than one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up: Winners on the professional beach volleyball tour in 1966 were

NEWSWIRE: RYPIEN CUT; MOON, KOSAR MOVE ON 
</P>

From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesday was the day of the quarterback shuffle in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Going is Mark Rypien, the Super Bowl most valuable player only two years ago, 
who was released by the Washington Redskins because of injuries, a plummeting 
quarterback rating and the NFL's new salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving is Warren Moon, to the Minnesota Vikings from the Houston Oilers in 
trade. Houston reportedly will receive two draft picks from Minnesota -- a 
fourth-rounder this year and a conditional third-rounder in 1995. One reason 
for the deal is that Moon will earn $3.25 million next season, and the Oilers' 
salary cap can't stand that. 
</P>
<P>
 Going home is Bernie Kosar, signed by the Miami Dolphins to back up Dan 
Marino. Kosar played at the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins are undergoing a major remake under first-year Coach Norv Turner 
and said they would re-sign Rypien at $1.5 million, about half his salary. He 
told them he would rather be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner has made it clear he wants to use the Redskins' No. 1 pick, the third 
overall, to draft a quarterback -- preferably Tennessee's Heath Shuler or 
Fresno State's Trent Dilfer -- and the Redskins also have talked with some 
lower-priced free-agent veterans -- Rodney Peete of the Detroit Lions, Chris 
Chandler of the Arizona Cardinals and John Friez of the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon had said he preferred to stay in Houston, but quarterback Cody Carlson 
has already signed an extension at a lower salary and the Oilers are moving 
away from the run-and-shoot offense under new coordinator Dick Coury. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosar led the Miami Hurricanes to their first national championship 10 years 
ago and became a free agent after backing up Troy Aikman last season with the 
Dallas Cowboys. He and Marino are neighbors in South Florida. 
</P>

 The NFL's salary cap went up by another $400,000, to $34.6 million per team, 
after the latest audit by the NFL Players Assn. Under the labor agreement 
reached in 1993, the cap is set at 64% of defined gross revenue.

 Update on Ila Borders, the freshman left-handed pitcher for Southern 
California College: She is 2-3 with a 3.20 earned-run average, has been bombed 
only once and is attracting attention from pro teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I would do it all over again and will if another lady comes around with her 
ability and attitude," said Coach Charlie Phillips, who took some heat when he 
awarded Borders a partial scholarship to the NAIA school in Costa Mesa that 
doesn't give full athletic grants. "In fact, her sister Leah looks like a 
prospect, a right-hander who is pitching well in Little League." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said he has received calls from independent teams "who would sign Ila 
in an instant." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But he would like to see the 5-foot-10, 165-pound, 19-year-old develop upper 
body strength and pitch another two or three years in college. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'm confident she would be able to compete professionally," Phillips 
said. . . .

 Thumbs up to Donna Candiotti, who was seen on television practicing the lost 
art of scorekeeping during husband Tom's victory over the St. Louis Cardinals

 One reason so many ballclubs have changed cap styles is that it gives them 
another merchandising opportunity. . . . Highest average ticket price in the 
major leagues is $14.44 at Yankee Stadium. Lowest is $7.90 at Mile High Stadium 
in Denver. Anaheim Stadium is third lowest ($8.06) and Dodger Stadium ninth 
lowest ($9.68). . . .

<P>
 If the Minnesota Twins' slide continues, look for them to dangle closer Rick 
Aguilera as trade bait. . . .

 This is as deceiving as time of possession: Boston and Kansas City each got 15 
hits Tuesday. The Red Sox got twice as many runs, 22-11. . . .

 Three sophomore defensive players -- inside linebacker Jeff Ruckman, outside 
linebacker Phillip Ward and free safety Paul Guidry -- have been impressive 
during spring football practice at UCLA. . . .

 When Norm Andersen graduated in 1975, he ranked fourth on the all-time Bruin

tournament April 25 at Industry Hills are a gold basketball uniform that Don

 Most fighters dread going to training camp. Oscar De La Hoya is so eager to 
begin work at Larry Goossen's Gym in Big Bear that he will leave town Sunday

 "I'm running five miles a day, but I want to get started sparring again," said 
De La Hoya, who will make the first defense of his World Boxing Organization 
junior-lightweight title against Giorgio Campanella of Italy May 27 at the MGM 
Grand in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card are Roy Jones Jr. and Rafael Ruelas, but the scene stealer 
could be 19-year-old flyweight prospect Danny Romero of Albuquerque. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who will make his local debut May 5 at the Olympic, is 15-0 with 13 
knockouts, but says, "My main asset is defense." . . .

 "It's not about world titles for me anymore," Pernell Whitaker said after

ELECTIONS; IN BITTER FIGHT, WALLACH WINS REELECTION AS EL MONTE MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Patricia A. Wallach overcame an intensive campaign by city police 
against her to pull off a reelection victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte Police Officers Assn. went door-to-door during the campaign in an 
attempt to defeat Wallach because she had voted against increasing police 
patrols, arguing that the city could not afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, Wallach defeated association-backed candidate Terry Keenan, as 
well as Councilman Ernest G. Gutierrez, who had hoped to become the city's 
first Latino mayor. The final tally showed Wallach with 1,866 votes, compared 
with Keenan's 1,743 and Gutierrez's 1,403. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents also retained the two City Council seats at stake, with 
Councilwoman Maria F. Avila and Councilman Jack Thurston both defeating their 
nearest challenger, Gregory B. Griffith, by more than 250 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to be back with the same old group," said Thurston, noting that the 
lineup of the council remained the same despite the election. "But hopefully we 
can unite the council. We definitely need to see some unity here over the next 
four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Unity was nowhere to be found during the campaign as the battle for votes 
polarized candidates on three fronts. Wallach, Griffith and George Williams ran 
on a slate that promised no new taxes, while Keenan, Thurston and Avila vowed 
to beef up the police force and make the city streets safe at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle was Gutierrez, who was striving to become the first 
Latino mayor in a city where 73% of the residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The war between Wallach and the association stems from the mayor's opposition 
last year to hiring 10 more police officers and raising the utility tax from 3% 
to 7% to provide funding for the public safety budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Though both measures were passed by the council, the association slammed her 
repeatedly throughout the campaign as a mayor who jeopardized the safety of the 
citizens of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign mud really started to fly late in the campaign when Richard Ruley, a 
transient, alleged that the president of the association, El Monte police agent 
George Hopkins, had paid him to destroy Wallach's campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach filed a police report against Hopkins. The muck thickened when Ruley 
fled the county to Victorville and El Monte detectives -- who were assigned to 
the case despite the apparent conflict of interest -- found two witnesses who 
said Ruley told them Wallach had paid him off to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties deny any wrongdoing, with Wallach denouncing the incident as 
dirty politics and the association asserting that Ruley is a heroin addict with 
a felony record who would take any opportunity to slander the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, the current and future mayor said she hopes she can wash 
the mud from the campaign and make a clean start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already talked to some police officers, and I want to sit down and 
straighten things out," Wallach said during a break in her victory celebration.

ELECTIONS; ASIAN AMERICANS' EXPECTED GAINS FAIL TO MATERIALIZE; A NOTABLE 
EXCEPTION IS SHENG CHANG'S COUNCIL VICTORY IN ARCADIA. ALL THREE CANDIDATES IN 
MONTEREY PARK ELECTION ARE DEFEATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for a historic victory in Arcadia, the anticipated political gains for 
the rapidly growing Asian American community in the San Gabriel Valley failed 
to materialize in Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Asian Americans suffered a surprising loss of political ground in 
Monterey Park with the defeat of Councilman Samuel Kiang. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, Sheng H. Chang will become not only the first Asian American, but 
the first ethnic minority council member when he is sworn into office. Chang 
was the top vote-getter among 11 candidates vying for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kuhn and Mary B. Young also won election to the City Council, while 
incumbents George W. Fasching and Joseph C. Ciraulo were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in 91 years an Asian or minority has been elected to 
the City Council and I hope more Asians and minorities will now contribute to 
this community," said a jubilant Chang, 52, a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Monterey Park, where 53% of residents are of Asian descent, all three 
Asian American candidates, including incumbent Kiang, were routed. Kiang could 
not be reached for comment, but some city political observers theorized that 
pre-election publicity about the possibility of the state's first Asian 
American council majority may have worked against those candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters elected incumbents Marie T. Purvis, Fred Balderrama and challenger 
Francisco Alonso over Kiang, Peter Chan and Mitchell Ing. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderrama was the top vote-getter, followed by Purvis and Alonso. Kiang ran 
fourth, 639 votes behind Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Chu, whose seat was not up for election this time, will be the only Asian 
American member on the five-member council. And Chu will be leaving the council 
if her bid for a state Assembly seat is successful later this year 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American candidates also fared poorly in two other San Gabriel Valley 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, challengers Allan K. Yung and Alex Tse lost to incumbent Paul 
C. Crowley and contractor Vince Fulitze. In Rosemead, challenger Dolly Leong 
was easily defeated by incumbent Gary A. Taylor and Jay Imperial, a former 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Monterey Park's Asian American candidates agreed with those who 
speculated that the publicity over the possibility of an Asian-majority council 
hurt their chances by highlighting the racial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the voting was along racial lines," said Peter Chan, 45, an 
accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan also said many Chinese Americans did not vote after a consultant for a 
development company that had wanted to build a card club in the city last year 
sent out a mailer recently highlighting election rules and penalties for voter 
fraud in Chinese and English in an effort to discourage voting. Kiang had taken 
a leading role in repelling the proposed club. The secretary of state's office 
has asked the district attorney to investigate the leaflet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese Americans didn't come out and vote because they were intimidated," 
said Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ing said too much was made the idea of the first Asian American majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that scared people because of the coverage and attention it was 
receiving nationwide," the 30-year-old banker said. "I think the attention was 
the reason for the loss of Asian Americans on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's now the possibility if Judy Chu wins her bid for state Assembly, 
there won't be an Asian representation on the council," he added. "I think this 
is a rude awakening for the Chinese who don't go out and vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Marino, Allan Yung looked at his defeat as a steppingstone for future 
Asian American candidates in a city where one-third of the residents are of 
Asian descent but no member of a minority has served on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later, it will be time," said the 53-year-old ear, nose and throat 
surgeon who lost a second bid for a council seat. "I have a lot of Asian 
friends who are very capable." 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Arcadia, that time came Tuesday for Chang. He emphasized that 
it took more than an Asian American bloc to elect him, saying that more than 
half of his support came from non-Asians.

ELECTIONS; WEST COVINA VOTERS USHER IN 2 LANDFILL OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The West Covina council race boiled down to a longstanding and politically 
volatile question: when should the BKK landfill shut down? Voters sent City 
Hall a clear answer Tuesday; they want the trash trucks off their streets by 
November, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what the election's victors, incumbent Steve Herfert and 
candidate Michael Touhey, have vowed to achieve. Their votes on the five-member 
council, plus at least one other from Councilman Brad McFadden, who is 
committed to closing BKK next year, will likely ensure that the city will 
continue its costly legal battle aimed at forcing BKK's closure in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 No compromise, Herfert said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Touhey, the 31-year-old owner of a drive-through dairy in West Covina, 
each led their opponents, Mayor Richard Jennings and Stuart York, by more than 
1,000 votes. Jennings and York had argued during the campaign that the city 
can't afford to lose BKK, the town's largest tax-revenue producer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, people want the landfill to close soon and they won't let a major 
corporation buy an election in their city," Herfert said, referring to BKK's 
intense advertising blitz during the campaign. "It was an election about the 
future of a city. The choices were continued dependency on a landfill or 
closing it in 1995 and moving on." 
</P>
<P>
 In full-page newspaper ads and cable television commercials, BKK painted 
Herfert and Touhey as irresponsible financial managers while touting the 
company's revenue and charitable contributions to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who is retired, and York, a city planning commissioner, wanted the 
city to negotiate a compromise closure date with BKK, whereby the dump would 
cease operation between 1995 and 2006, the year BKK's city-issued operating 
permit expires. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, BKK signed a memorandum of understanding with the city, promising to 
close the dump in November, 1995. But BKK officials argue the two parties also 
agreed that BKK would need an alternative source of revenue, such as an 
industrial park, at the site before it could afford to close the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has set aside $1.3 million to fight BKK in court this fiscal year, 
arguing that BKK never got serious about developing anything on its land except 
creating more landfill space. Jennings and York maintain that the city, which 
is struggling to wean itself off $3 million to $4 million in annual tax revenue 
from BKK, needs more time to find alternative revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina is facing an estimated $2.3 million deficit in the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome of this election means perception is larger than reality," 
Jennings said early Wednesday after final vote tallies were released. "This 
election doesn't mean the dump will close in 1995.

CLASSES WILL START ANYWAY, AT TEMPORARY SITES. BACKERS SAY A LEGAL DISPUTE WITH 
ALHAMBRA DISTRICT MADE VOTERS UNEASY.

 A $29.9-million bond issue that would have funded construction of a new high 
school in San Gabriel was defeated in Tuesday's election, but San Gabriel 
Unified School District Supt. Gary E. Goodson said the high school will open 
this fall anyway, in temporary facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure fell far short of the two-thirds majority it needed to pass. 
Despite vigorous efforts by bond supporters to rally support among San Gabriel 
voters, the measure did not garner even a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure HS would have paid for a two-story structure to house Gabrielino High 
School on the site of Jefferson Intermediate School and for expansion of the 
district's elementary schools to accommodate the displaced intermediate 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school will begin in the fall as planned, Goodson said, although 
construction of a permanent facility will not. Intermediate school students who 
would have gone on to San Gabriel High School in the Alhambra High School 
District will form the first freshman class at Gabrielino High School. 
</P>
<P>
 A $1.5-million bond, approved March 21 by the school board, will provide 
temporary classrooms for seventh- and eighth-graders who will be moved to the 
site of what is now Madison Elementary. Temporary buildings will also be added 
at Roosevelt Elementary to house elementary students relocated from Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's bond proposal defeat, the measure's supporters say they will 
try again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the children and the future to think about," said Barbara Bauld, 
school board president. "We will try again, probably in November. And we learn 
with each election what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure's defeat is the latest setback to the fledgling district, 
which was created through a unification election in April, 1992. Before then, 
San Gabriel was only an elementary and intermediate school district. The 1992 
vote authorized it to provide high school education as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But a similar bond measure to build a high school failed in March, 1993. And 
last June, the Alhambra district filed a lawsuit contesting the validity of the 
unification election by arguing that Alhambra voters should have been included 
in the contest that created the new district. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling on the lawsuit March 22, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne said the exclusion of Alhambra voters violated their constitutional 
rights to equal protection. Alhambra then asked the judge to invalidate the 
unification election. But at the time of Tuesday's vote, the judge had not yet 
done so, creating uncertainty about the district's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal controversy may have scared away San Gabriel residents from voting 
for the bond, Goodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawsuit was the real problem for us in this election," he said. "I think 
it confuses people, and when you're asking people to spend their money and 
they're a little confused, they say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Crawford, the district's assistant superintendent for business services, 
said the bond would have been financed with a property tax of about 47 cents 
per $1,000 of property value. Thus, the owner of a $100,000 home would have 
paid about $47 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 James Moss, of the Save Our Homes Committee, a group that worked against the 
measure, said he thinks many voters decided to oppose it after homeowners near 
the proposed high school site voiced fears that their homes would be destroyed 
to provide more space for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first (San Gabriel residents) wanted a high school, but when they heard 
there would be homes demolished, and found out what it would cost in taxes, 
they didn't want to take those homes for an unnecessary school," Moss said 
Tuesday night.

ELECTIONS; COALITION FAILS TO MAKE CLEAN SWEEP IN AZUSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hopes for a sweep by a three-candidate coalition ended Tuesday night when 
Azusa mayoral candidate John Dangleis was narrowly defeated by fellow council 
member Stephen J. Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander received 1,253 votes and Dangleis 1,123. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangleis waited for the final vote count at 9:30 p.m., hoping to join in 
celebration with Diane Moritz-Beebe and David Hardison. The two winners beat 
out eight others for the council seats that Dangleis and Alexander vacated to 
run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said his top priority is to reopen the political process for public 
participation and criticized the outgoing council for placing time limits on 
speakers at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to take downtown revitalization out of the hands of the 
redevelopment agency and use zoning, code enforcement and planning to 
revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The redevelopment agency needs to be restructured and eventually gotten rid 
of," Alexander said after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoarse from campaigning, the 38-year-old lawyer criticized redevelopment 
projects as he spoke Tuesday night at a victory celebration. He blasted the 
redevelopment agency for selling a downtown plot of land at Foothill and San 
Gabriel boulevards to a developer for $250,000 after the city paid $6 million 
to acquire the land and raze buildings on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to run the city like a business," Alexander said. "I don't think 
many businesses would be buying something for $6 million and selling it for 
$250,000." 
</P>
<P>
 For Moritz-Beebe and Hardison, their celebration was dampened somewhat by 
Dangleis' defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bittersweet victory," Hardison said. "We were running, not on a 
ticket, but there was one mayoral candidate we thought was going to win and 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa's reputation has been damaged by perennial political infighting that 
recently has seen council members squaring off against one another over the 
future of the Azusa Rock Quarry and the goals of the redevelopment agency. With 
no discernible coalition created by Tuesday's election and a mayor-elect who 
has often sided with the minority council vote, the city's legislative body may 
continue to wrangle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dangleis said he had faith in the incoming council to be productive, 
he regretted what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad for the city," he said. "If I was elected mayor, we'd have a 
great working coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardison, however, said that Azusa's needs are great enough to catapult the 
new council into action.

 Health Fair Expo '94 will make the rounds in Southern California through April 
23 at six locations in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Each location will feature a day of free health screenings, including blood 
pressure, height, weight, vision and health histories. Blood chemistry scans 
will be available for $25 and will measure levels of glucose, cholesterol, both 
high- and low-density lipoproteins and other factors. Men older than 40 can 
have their blood screened for prostate cancer for an additional $25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really promoting that people take responsibility for their health," 
said project coordinator Linda Swift, who is running the Expo for all of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six San Gabriel sites will offer a variety of specialized, free 
screenings in addition to the basic screenings performed at all the expos. 
</P>
<P>

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; A GROWING CONCERN; LANDSCAPING: AS A RESULT OF LAST 
YEAR'S DISASTROUS FIRES, AREA HOMEOWNERS SHOW RENEWED INTEREST IN USING 
FLAME-RETARDANT PLANTS TO BEAUTIFY AND TO PROTECT.

 With planting season here, local nurseries are offering the following words of 
wisdom for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas: 
</P>
<P>
 Pittosporum, Dietes, Lantanas, Myoporum Parvifolium -- botanical names for a 
few of the fire-retardant plant species available at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, hot subject right now," said Wendy Persson of Persson's Nursery. 
"Every day, somebody calls or comes in asking us for a list of fire-retardant 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
 The nursery, which lies right below the hills where the Altadena fire blazed, 
is getting a lot of business from householders planning fire-resistant gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Persson's list includes oleander, jasmine and yucca. She said she had noticed 
that some of the burned areas included untouched patches of ice plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice plant isn't as popular as rye grass at the Altadena Nursery, said employee 
Duane Higuchi. The nursery ran out of the fast-growing rye grass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He considered ice plant a good anti-flame plant: "It's like a big, wet 
sponge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Rippens, the L.A. County Fire Department's chief of forestry, has 
reservations about the heavy succulent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like ice plant," he said, warning that residents have to be careful 
of varieties whose leaves grow too large, pulling down the soil on hillsides 
and causing mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be careful on steep slopes," he said. Altadena gets alluvial sand 
from mountain runoff as well as decomposed granite and rock, imparting some 
instability to the soil. Therefore, vegetation with deep roots -- such as oak, 
ivy and rye grass -- are among the best choices for keeping the soil stable, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller-leaved ice plant varieties such as delosperma alba and red apple get 
better reviews, but they are by no means the only options suggested by fire 
officials and nursery owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Teller of Dawson Landscaping, which he said has received about 100 calls 
for advice on planting for fires, recommends fescue, rye grass and California 
poppy for fire-retardant and soil-erosion planting. Some people rely on 
hydroseeding -- aerial spraying of a mixture of seeds that sprout on the 
hillsides -- or netting to stabilize steep slopes while the vegetation grows, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burkard Nurseries gives customers the fire department's 10-page list of 
fire-hardy plants. It includes familiar names like aloe vera, chrysanthemums, 
jasmine and oleander. That may be comforting for residents resurrecting their 
gardens because it gives them many options for replanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Cremer, Forest Service landscape architect, said citrus trees seem to 
resist fires well and honeysuckle provides good ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing is fireproof. Cremer saw ice plant that burned in the Altadena 
fire. "Anything will burn if it's in the right place at the right time." she 
said.

 BALDWIN PARK: A chemical reaction caused an explosion that blew out the 
windows of the bedroom of a Baldwin Park home where police found the remains of 
a methamphetamine lab. Officers responded to the explosion in the 4200 block of 
Stewart Avenue about 9 p.m. Friday and arrested Patrick Lee Igoe, 19, on 
drug-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
 BRADBURY: Corwin Larson, a 47-year-old former Bradbury man with a history of 
mental disorders, was sentenced Tuesday in Pasadena Superior Court to 15 years 
to life in prison for the 1992 strangulation death of his psychiatrist wife, 
Agnes Larson Kulcsar, 44. Larson, who was found guilty March 21 of 
second-degree murder, also was sentenced to an additional year for slashing his 
wife with a razor during the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: A man threatened to blow up his girlfriend's apartment complex and 
left a fake bomb at her doorstep last Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of 
about 65 residents. The bomb squad was sent to 13705 Sunkist Drive shortly 
after 1 p.m., but the metal canister left on the porch contained a 
non-explosive chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE: A Wells Fargo Bank branch at 2079 Bonita Ave. was robbed Monday 
afternoon by a woman who threatened a teller with an unseen handgun and escaped 
with an undisclosed amount of cash, police said. Officers said the robbery 
occurred about 12:45 p.m. The woman is described as white, in her 30s, with 
blond hair pulled back into a ponytail and dark blemishes on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: Police pursued and arrested two men after neighbors reported seeing 
them trying to open a locked door at a residence in the 300 block of West 
Central Avenue about 9:30 a.m. last Thursday. Arrested were William Rouss, 44, 
of Los Angeles, and Juan Trenco, 27, of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A 31-year-old Pasadena man was arrested Sunday for allegedly raping 
a former neighbor, police said. Officers responded about 11 a.m. to calls from 
neighbors on East Howard Street who heard screams and glass breaking. They 
arrested Luis Castaneda on suspicion of rape, attempted rape and burglary. He 
is being held in the County Jail.  
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A man with a gun disrupted Sunday services at St. Joseph's Church at 
1150 W. Holt Ave. when he stormed into the congregation about 12:15 p.m. and 
began yelling religious slurs and waving a handgun. Several church members were 
able to restrain the man until police arrived. The man, whose name was not 
released, is being held in the city jail. The gun was found to be unloaded, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Three men pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Pomona Municipal Court in 
connection with the April 1 home invasion robbery of a Diamond Bar family and 
the rape of a 13-year-old girl at the residence, the district attorney's office 
reported. Clint Jacob, 18, Gilburt Galves, 23, and Owen Lino, 20, each were 
charged with residential robbery, rape in concert, oral copulation, assault 
with intent to commit rape, grand theft auto and attempted robbery. A 
17-year-old juvenile was arraigned last week on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A father and son driving to work were struck and killed by a suspected 
drunk driver early Monday morning, police reported. James Henry Specht, 58, and 
his 27-year-old son Michael Henry Specht were killed in the accident at Valley 
and Temple boulevards. Arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and felony drunken 
driving was John Michael Mechekoff, 29, of La Puente.

TOPICS / CRIME; ROBBERY SUSPECT FAILS TO ELUDE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A youth who allegedly robbed two convenience stores and a woman at a fast-food 
restaurant temporarily escaped police last Thursday morning by jumping into the 
Little Dalton Wash, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 His luck apparently ran out, however, when officers saw a young man climbing 
out of a curbside drain a few yards from where a police command post had been 
set up to coordinate the search for the robber, said Glendora Police Officer 
Brian Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers saw him coming up through a culvert on the curb and sort of 
walked over and helped him out," Summers said. "He didn't put up much of a 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old, whose name was not released because of his age, burst into a 
7-Eleven store in West Covina about 1 a.m. armed with a .22-caliber 
semiautomatic pistol and demanded money, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth took $80 and then drove with a friend to Glendora, where he held up 
the clerk at an AM/PM Mini-Mart and fled with $100 about 3 a.m., Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way back to his car, the youth allegedly attempted to get more money 
from a woman in her car at a Del Taco drive-through. When she took too long 
rifling in her purse for the money, he gave up and drove off, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa police heard a radio report of the robberies and pulled over two young 
men in a car that matched the description given Glendora officers. They 
arrested the driver, Shane Lindsey, 20, of Baldwin Park, but the 17-year-old 
fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers said police chased the youth until he jumped over a fence and into the 
wash near Azusa and Paramount avenues. They nabbed him as he climbed out of the 
storm drain a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey and the youth were each charged with two counts of robbery and one 
count of attempted robbery. Lindsey was in custody at Glendora jail in lieu of 
$50,000 bond. The 17-year-old is being held at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in 
Downey, Summers said.

COVER STORY; ONE CASE THAT HASN'T CLOSED; KENNETH SHEAREN, ACCUSED OF USING 
EXCESSIVE FORCE, IS BATTLING TO REJOIN THE BALDWIN PARK POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When former Baldwin Park Police Officer Kenneth Shearen talks about the job 
from which he was fired, he leaves out arrests, high-speed chases and bullets 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he recalls the elderly woman he took home after finding her exhausted 
on the curb beside her groceries, the convulsing baby he revived with 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and the burglarized homeowners he calmed with home 
security advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like a warrior thing," he said of his two years with the then 
55-officer department. "I got out there and helped people. . . . That was my 
goal, every day to make a difference in somebody's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet accusations of warriorlike behavior -- including the police-baton beating 
of a burglary suspect -- led to Shearen's dismissal three years ago. A criminal 
trial on the beating charges ended in a hung jury in February; a federal 
investigation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that any person can get frustrated and lose control," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. David Sotelo, who prosecuted Shearen. "What causes problems is 
police officers unwilling to recognize that they've made an error and exceeded 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Park Police Chief Carmine Lanza said although the jury did not convict 
Shearen, the city's internal investigation had concluded he was culpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time, there are no plans to bring him back on the police 
force," Lanza said. "We would like to put (the incident) behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, the 39-year-old father of three is trying to get back on the 
department. He insists the beating never occurred and blames his troubles on 
troubled times. 
</P>
<P>
 His firing came at the height of inflamed passions over the videotaped Los 
Angeles police beating of Altadena motorist Rodney G. King. That controversy 
led authorities to believe false allegations against him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His prosecution came six months after the looting and burning that struck Los 
Angeles when the four officers in the King beating were acquitted of most of 
the charges against them in a state trial. That violence, he believes, caused a 
panicked district attorney's office to file a case against him that he contends 
was weak from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those who lost lives and businesses during the riots, Shearen counts 
himself among the victims. Three years later as an electronics repairman 
working out of a windowless Hawthorne warehouse, Shearen is struggling to 
recover the life he once loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe a lot of people think I'm a troublemaker, but all I want to do 
is the best job I can . . . as a police officer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearen lost his prized job over a minor burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, 1991, he and fellow officer Louis Price were among those called at 
11:49 p.m. to the 3600 block of Baldwin Park Boulevard after two thieves stole 
a few cases of beer, cartons of cigarettes and a roll of nickels from a gas 
station mini-mart. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect was nabbed quickly. But a second man, Gilbert Gutierrez, hid in 
nearby bushes for more than 20 minutes until he was found by Price and Shearen. 
</P>
<P>
 When the officers delivered Gutierrez to the police station later that night, 
he had a fractured rib, a gash in the side of his head and a black eye. The 
injuries, the officers said, came after Gutierrez fled and was tackled and fell 
onto a pile of metal rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident would have ended there, Shearen and his attorneys said, but for 
the videotaped beating of King three weeks later on March 3. That snippet of 
blurry tape, replayed again and again on television, became a symbol of the 
everyday violence many claimed has been endured by racial and ethnic minorities 
at the hands of abusive police. 
</P>
<P>
 About three weeks after the tape hit the news, Baldwin Park Police Officer 
Steven Julian came forward with allegations that Price and Shearen had used 
excessive force during the burglary arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Julian, who also was at the burglary arrest, reported to superiors that he had 
heard a thud and turned to see Price swinging a flashlight and Shearen a baton 
to strike something on the ground. Although Julian said his vision was obscured 
by a tabletop and a 3-foot hedge, he could make out the figure of a man. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers stopped, Julian said, only when Sgt. Robert Curtis yelled out, 
"All right, that's enough. Cuff him up." 
</P>
<P>
 An internal police investigation followed. Curtis admitted telling the 
officers to stop. He said he could see Price and Shearen struggling with 
Gutierrez but couldn't tell whether they had struck the man. Curtis later 
refused to testify in the criminal case, citing his right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the investigation, Lanza dismissed Shearen in June, 1991, while 
the King controversy still raged. Price, a new officer on probation who had no 
right to appeal, resigned rather than risk being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can imagine the chief was listening and watching the TV every night," 
Shearen said. The former officer believes Lanza acted swiftly to avoid being 
accused of having a Rodney King-like problem in his city. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearen unsuccessfully appealed to the city's personnel commission and to an 
arbitrator. Gutierrez, who was convicted of burglary in the case, filed a claim 
against the city that was settled two years later for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district attorney's office began investigating. Based upon 
reports by doctors and two eyewitnesses, criminal charges of assault, excessive 
force and filing a false police report were filed against Shearen and Price in 
October, 1992 -- six months after the Southland had erupted in violence over 
the acquittals in the first King beating case.  
</P>
<P>
 "All those things pressured the DA to file what was essentially a stupid 
case," said attorney Howard Price, who defended Shearen's partner, Louis Price. 
(The Prices are not related). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that the charges would not have been filed but for the 
impetus of the Rodney King incident," attorney Price added. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the King videotape, police officers rarely faced criminal charges, he 
said. But after King, the pendulum seemed to swing dramatically in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, a 38,000-member police 
officers group that paid Shearen's legal expenses, affirms that trend. In 1992 
-- the year of the first King trial -- the PORAC Legal Defense Fund saw a 46% 
increase in the number of criminal cases filed against its officer members, 
from 75 cases to 117. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an aberration of what we have seen in the past," said George Yamamoto, 
chairman of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Sotelo insists the district attorney's office was not 
influenced in the Baldwin Park case by the Rodney King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case was filed on its own merits," Sotelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearen's career began in 1986 after he volunteered as a reserve officer in 
Montebello. He was surprised to find himself gabbing about his volunteer 
weekend job much more enthusiastically than about his weekday job as a product 
manager for a Carson company that made two-way radios. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reserve officer, he earned commendations for racking up 686 volunteer 
hours in a year, for working with neighborhood watch programs and for helping 
evacuate residents fleeing a chlorine gas spill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year electronics industry veteran earning up to $52,000 annually, Shearen 
threw it all aside for a pay cut: the patrolman's salary of $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many police departments hire only job candidates with good vision, 
Shearen underwent eye surgery to correct his nearsightedness and told his 
electronics co-workers about the planned switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at me and said, 'You're nuts,' " Shearen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Park Police Department hired him in December, 1988, when he was 
34. When he enrolled in the Rio Hondo Police Academy, colleagues placed bets 
that the balding, pudgy, cigarette-smoking family man wouldn't make it through 
the grueling 17-week training alongside candidates in their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was literally a bruising time for him, he said. He injured his ribs the 
first week. The third week he got pneumonia and the seventh week he sprained 
his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he donned a uniform in May, 1989, he felt his years were an asset. 
Because police work involves personal skills, his marriage and child-rearing 
abilities stood him in good stead when he was called to handle domestic 
disputes, he said. He welcomed overtime hours and told his fellow officers, 
"You guys don't know how lucky you are to be doing this job." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shearen's wife, Esther, 33: "He didn't care what time he had to get up, 
5:30 a.m. or 6 a.m. . . . He would get up, no problem, come home happy and he 
was never upset. Sometimes he would wake me at night to tell me all the things 
that happened at work." 
</P>
<P>
 For Shearen, losing his job was a shock that caused sleepless nights, 
especially since he was fired when his wife was pregnant with their third 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was devastated, absolutely devastated," said longtime friend Bill Cody, a 
Montebello police reserve lieutenant. "Everybody had told him, 'You don't want 
to go to Baldwin Park.' He ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time with 
the wrong department." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shearen said he agonized when his eldest son, Jonathan, then 7, asked if 
television reports about his father beating Gutierrez were true. After the 
televised report, a half-dozen people phoned his home saying they were glad 
that white officers were now in trouble, Shearen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hours he would have spent playing with his children, he then spent working 
on his defense, often until 4 a.m., his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the case came to trial two months ago, attorneys for Price and Shearen 
contended that Julian, who has since left police work on a stress disability, 
was inspired by the furor over the King beating to concoct false allegations 
and get a lifetime disability pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian had been demoted in January, 1991, a few weeks before the Baldwin Park 
burglary, and had been trying to leave the department, said Darryl Mounger, 
Shearen's defense attorney. Knowing he would be ostracized for bringing 
accusations against fellow officers, Julian deliberately lied to get out of 
police work with a guaranteed income, Mounger told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But Julian told jurors his only motive for coming forward was his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Sotelo also dismissed the disability scenario as unlikely. Instead, 
he said Julian became a victim himself when he exposed a police cover-up, was 
ostracized and lost his own career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem comes in the cover-up," Sotelo said. "The public ends up paying 
in these lawsuits and the integrity of the police department becomes 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez testified that he had been hit, but said he blacked out after the 
first alleged strike and that he did not remember having any bruises or other 
signs of injury afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury failed to reach a decision and a mistrial was declared Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotelo's request for a retrial was denied by Superior Court Judge Jan Pluim, 
who said, "Even as described by Mr. Gutierrez, there are no bumps, welts or 
bruises to his head or otherwise to his body. The physical evidence to Mr. 
Gutierrez does not support the testimony of Mr. Julian. The court, therefore, 
puts little credibility in the testimony of Mr. Julian." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearen called the judge's action a vindication and hopes it will help him get 
his job back. PORAC's legal defense fund, which Shearen estimated spent as much 
as $150,000 on his defense, is deciding whether to pay for civil legal appeals 
to get Shearen reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Lanza remains opposed to Shearen's return. An internal investigation, 
personnel hearings and appeals all concluded there were sufficient grounds to 
fire Shearen, Lanza said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the federal file on Shearen and Price sits in a Department of 
Justice office in Washington, where it was forwarded for a decision on 
prosecution after FBI agents completed their work. Justice officials there 
declined to comment on the case, except to say that the request for an 
investigation came from Justice Department officials in Washington after a 
complaint was received. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, who was released from prison in 1992 on the Baldwin Park burglary 
charges and received his $75,000 settlement a year later, was sent back to 
Chino state prison in March on a new, unrelated burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Former officer Price works as a private investigator. He said the accusations 
and criminal trial were only an annoyance to him, a single man, for whom 
working as a police officer was simply a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shearen vows to get his dream job back again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought too hard to let it go," he said. "It's going to be pretty hard to 
get it back, but I'll get it back one of these days."

 GO WEST 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't everyday when a touted basketball recruit picks Loyola Marymount over 
Notre Dame. In fact, Willie Jones could be the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a 6-foot-5, 230-pound forward from Mt. Carmel High in Chicago, was 
expected to sign a letter of intent this week to attend Loyola. He chose the 
Lions over hometown favorites Notre Dame and DePaul, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked it out there," said Gloria Jones, Willie's mother. "He liked the 
college, he liked the coach, he liked everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Curta, the Mt. Carmel coach, credited Loyola Coach John Olive with doing 
the best job of recruiting Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to Coach Olive making him feel the most comfortable," Curta 
said. "I've been overwhelmed by the amount of support (Olive) has shown." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones helped Mt. Carmel to a 25-4 record last season, averaging 11 points, 
seven rebounds and three blocks a game. Two other Mt. Carmel players will 
attend Kentucky and Syracuse on scholarships, Curta said. 
</P>
<P>
 A physical player who excels near the basket, Jones was named All-Chicago and 
All-Illinois honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would describe Willie as a warrior," Curta said. "He is tremendously strong 
and a great leaper. He attacks the ball in the paint. He plays way (taller) 
than some people think he can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was one of two prep standouts expected to sign with Loyola this week. 
The Lions received an unwritten commitment Sunday night from Terryl Woolery, a 
6-3 shooting guard from Fairfax. Woolery, who averaged 16.5 points last season, 
is the brother of John Woolery, who played for Santa Clara and set the school 
single-season assist record last season as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives Loyola four incoming freshmen. The Lions signed Ben Ammerman, a 6-7 
forward from Jesuit High near Sacramento, and Calvin Patterson, a 6-2 shooting 
guard from Fremont, in November. GOLF AND STUFF 
</P>
<P>
 Reid Guille likes to golf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morningside High math teacher thought the students at the school should 
have an opportunity to play too. 
</P>
<P>
 So he started a golf team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding a golf program at Morningside for the first time since 1975, however, 
has been no easy chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting players was Guille's first task. He now has eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf is considered a wimp sport here with all the state championships from 
track and baseball," Guille said. "I had to go after players who were never 
involved in sports and tried to convince them to give golf a try." 
</P>
<P>
 Securing equipment required more ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Guille, 47, lends his clubs to one player and Debbie Gordon, the lone girl on 
the team, uses his daughter's clubs. Two others had clubs at home. Donations 
and fund-raising efforts have supplied the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Honing his player's skills has been a gradual process. Juniors Caleb Gordon 
and Irving Minera have been the Monarch's top players. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the team members had played on a golf course until the first match of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which was outfitted with uniform golf shirts last week, practices at 
the driving range at Hollywood Park and plays its home matches at the Chester 
Washington course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (1-10) lost their opening nine matches of the season, but edged 
Culver City, 265-269, Friday. The winning streak was short-lived. Morningside 
lost to Chadwick, 195-282, in a Pioneer League match at home Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guille has invested about $500 into the program to help cover $120-a-week 
green fees and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we have a team," Guille said. "None of the kids ever had a club 
in their hands until January. We never expected to win a match this season. We 
only wanted to improve each week and have fun." NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Ibarra hasn't had many players come out for the softball team at Mary 
Star in five years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's team has 10 members. But Ibarra is optimistic about the Stars' 
chances for a share of a fourth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star, which has won 36 of 37 league games over the last four seasons, is 
11-1-1 and 5-0 in Camino Real League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior catcher Karen Papadakis, a four-year starter, is batting .560. 
Papadakis drove in two runs and scored twice in a 12-2 nonleague victory over 
Gateway Christian Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars have three freshmen in their lineup: pitcher Julie Gonzalez, third 
baseman Kristina Arendain and right fielder Marisa Torrez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is 7-1 with a 0.35 earned-run average and has struck out 66 batters 
in 46 innings. She had 12 strikeouts, and had a triple and drove in three runs 
in a 6-0 league victory over St. Genevieve on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't usually start the season with more than 10 players, but we've been 
real fortunate in league," Ibarra said. "But whether its grades or injuries, 
God only knows if we'll have nine players by the end of the season." ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Thomas, Felisha Williams, Tai-Ne Gibson and Joronda White combined to 
win the 1,600-meter relay in 3 minutes 43.71 seconds at the Arcadia 
Invitational Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The time eclipsed the school record of 3:44.16 run by the 1990 state champion 
team and ranks third among California schools this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams won the seeded 100 meters in 12.06 and ran on the Monarchs' 400 relay 
which placed fourth in 46.79. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morningside boys won the seeded 1,600-meter relay in 3:17.63. Phil Fonua 
of Mira Costa placed second in the shotput with a heave of 57 feet, 6 inches 
and Molly Mehlberg of Peninsula was third in the 3,200 at 10:45.40. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino College track team will compete in the Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterlin Langford is the Southern Calfornia leader in the 400 at 47.52. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,600-meter relay team of Dorlisa Good, Dorneisha Lewis, Toneshia Hodges 
and Cynthia Glenn has run 3:45.44 and Sawako Nakamura has timed 17:50.9 in the 
5,000 for El Camino. Both times rank as the second-fastest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 STAR AMONG STARS 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi McKinney of Peninsula High scored a team-high 21 points for the West team 
in a 96-69 defeat against the East in the inaugural National High School 
Coaches Assn. East-West all-star game at the Omni in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-10 guard made seven of 14 shots from the field and grabbed seven 
rebounds, playing against the country's top seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney, a Cal-Hi Sports all-state first-team selection, has taken recruiting 
trips to Virginia, Auburn, Washington and Arizona. MAKING RECORDS 
</P>

MISALIGNMENTS FOUND IN NEW SUBWAY TUNNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of the subway tunnels under construction between Downtown Los 
Angeles and Hollywood are misaligned, and some segments will need to be 
re-excavated, transit officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials also acknowledged that the 
$165-million tunnel job -- the largest in the brief history of the 
multibillion-dollar Los Angeles subway -- is nine months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for tunnel boring machines to go off alignment during 
construction," said MTA project manager Joel Sandberg. "However, the excavation 
of these tunnels has experienced more problems than we consider to be 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has begun to pay for extra engineering services to cope with the 
tunneling misalignments, which range up to two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The alignment problems are the latest difficulties to beset the project and 
threaten to push it tens of millions of dollars over budget. Flooding beneath 
Hollywood Boulevard shut down work for six months during the past year. And 
excavation was halted last month for three weeks after a construction accident 
that injured three workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Top MTA officials have repeatedly stated that much-publicized problems with 
earlier subway construction Downtown have been rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to inquiries from The Times, the agency issued a statement 
Wednesday regarding the new alignment problems, which cover more than a mile of 
the Red Line extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corrective measures must be taken at the contractors's expense, not at the 
taxpayer's expense," Edward McSpedon, president of the MTA's construction 
staff, said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McSpedon and other officials said in interviews that the contractor, 
Shea-Kiewiet-Kenny, has not agreed to bear all or even most of the added 
expenses. The officials said it is not clear what percentage will be paid by 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, a joint venture led by the J.F. Shea 
construction company, a veteran tunneling contractor, declined to discuss the 
misalignment problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody from SKK is going to talk to you about any of that stuff," said the 
contractor's on-site project manager, Robert Gordon. "We don't talk to the 
press." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Parsons-Dillingham, the construction management firm hired by 
the MTA to inspect the tunneling work, said the misalignments were "minor" and 
typical of such projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed in 1997, the tunnels will run about 4.5 miles along Vermont 
Avenue and end at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon and Sandberg said in an interview that about 7,700 feet of the 24,000 
feet of the twin tunnels surveyed are out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said that 5,700 feet are less than six inches off line, 1,020 
feet are six to 12 inches off line and 944 feet are 12 to 24 inches off line. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 10,000 linear feet of tunnels have not yet been examined 
thoroughly enough to assess their alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Misalignment in tunneling typically occurs when the boring machine, called a 
shield, strays horizontally or dives or climbs off the specified grade. The 
progress of the 20-ton machines, which resemble tin cans, can be affected by 
the composition of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea-Kiewiet-Kenny had contended that unexpectedly hard earth caused some 
alignment problems. Last month, a dispute review board concluded that the MTA, 
not the contractor, is mostly responsible for problems related to the hard 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg and McSpedon said that the MTA has until April 30 to decide whether 
to abide by or reject the arbitrators' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the misalignment is part of that hard-ground claim," Sandberg said. 
"And so, of course, he (Shea-Kiewit-Kenny) is disputing that he is responsible 
for that part of the misalignment." 
</P>
<P>
 Although concrete has not yet been poured for the tunnels to Hollywood, one 
effect of misalignment can be tunnel walls that do not meet design 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous areas of tunnels now in service between Union Station and Pershing 
Square were constructed with thin walls -- and the contractor, Tutor-Saliba 
Corp., said misalignment was part of the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor-Saliba and the agency's construction management firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham, agreed in February to make and pay for repairs to those 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 A consulting firm retained by the MTA found that Parsons-Dillingham had fallen 
short of "acceptable industry practice" in its inspections and six other areas 
of performance on the Downtown subway. McSpedon and representatives of 
Parsons-Dillingham have said subsequently that the firm has improved 
dramatically in its oversight of the subway construction to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Villaraigosa, an appointee to the MTA board of directors, said 
Wednesday that he is trying to determine why the new alignment problems were 
not caught earlier in the construction by Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need an open airing of how we got to this situation," said Villaraigosa, 
an appointee of county Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa first voiced his concerns this week in a letter to the MTA's 
chief executive officer, Franklin E. White. "Is this yet another question of 
failure of construction management?" Villaraigosa asked. "I thought we had been 
led to believe that problems had been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 In its press release, the MTA noted that Parsons-Dillingham "replaced its 
engineer who was responsible for overseeing the work," a development reported 
last month by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham and other firms now are seeking a new $80-million contract 
to oversee extension of the subway to the Eastside and Mid-City areas of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone questioning the alignment problems . . . does not understand tunnel 
construction or has other motivations," said Ron Wildermuth, a spokesman for 
the firm.

VATICAN OKS USE OF GIRLS AS ALTAR SERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER and WILLIAM MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a break with tradition, the Vatican has officially approved girls serving 
at the altar during Roman Catholic Masses but stressed Wednesday that the 
decree is unrelated to the church's opposition to women priests. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's decision was not unexpected. Bishops in the United States have 
long voiced support for girls serving at the altar. Indeed, many U.S. Catholic 
parishes have had altar girls for years, but their status has been clouded and 
a cause for disagreement among the faithful. The Vatican agreed to consider the 
issue a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By unambiguously granting girls the same privileges as boys to assist priests 
at Mass -- the central act of Catholic worship -- the Vatican has all but ended 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Altar servers, generally ages 8 to 14, assist the priest by lighting altar 
candles, participate in the ritual washing of the priest's hands, and present 
the bread and wine to the priest to be consecrated as the body and blood of 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, president of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops, called the decision a welcome one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone will accept it. They'll have to accept it," said Father 
Charles Miller, who teaches homiletics and liturgy at St. John's Seminary in 
Camarillo. "No one wants to say little girls are inferior or little girls don't 
deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was dissent. Women for Faith & Family, a conservative Catholic lay 
group based in St. Louis, called the decision a "pastoral error" that would 
cause further confusion and unduly raise hopes that women would eventually be 
ordained as priests. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of Catholic parishes in the United States have had both 
altar boys and altar girls since the mid-1980s, including some in the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 These parishes relied on a change in canon law in 1983, which, unlike previous 
church codes, no longer specifically forbade altar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Altadena. Father Richard 
Prindle, the parish's pastor, said Wednesday that the Vatican announcement may 
come as a surprise to his altar servers. "I think they're probably completely 
unaware there was ever an issue," Prindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parishes, however, have awaited an explicit authorization from the 
Vatican before allowing girls to serve. "There was a feeling that maybe some 
had jumped the gun," said Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the issue has been clarified, Coiro and Miller said, tensions should 
ease. They said much of the opposition was not related to girls serving at the 
altar as such, but to allowing the practice before the Vatican had clarified 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minds of some people, it was sort of a litmus test of how loyal you 
were to the Holy See whether you allowed female altar servers or not," Coiro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval, announced Wednesday by papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro, came in 
a letter by the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of 
the Sacraments that was approved by Pope John Paul II. In 1992, the 
Congregation for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts had said there was 
nothing in canon law to forbid altar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Permission for the use of altar girls does not represent a major innovation, 
Navarro said, but rather an interpretation that church statutes concerning lay 
altar servers are equally applicable to both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the authorization, local bishops have the last word on whether to 
authorize altar girls in their dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Msgr. Frank Maniscalco, spokesman for the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops, said that before local bishops implement the changes 
involving altar girls they would confer among themselves at their national 
conference in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles archdiocese, the nation's most populous, will introduce 
guidelines next week, Coiro said. The guidelines, among other things, ask 
parish priests to fully explain the changes to parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the laity, including women, have long served as lectors, reading 
the appointed Scriptures during Mass and assisting the priest in dispensing the 
Sacraments to parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican sources were quick to insist that there was no prospect of any change 
in the Vatican prohibition against women priests. The Pope has been unbending 
in his opposition to women priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the issue of altar girls, the ordination of women goes to the heart of 
Catholic theology, which holds that because Jesus was a male and chose only men 
as his disciples, the church has no right to admit women to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision has nothing to do with ordained ministry, which has a different 
juridical and doctrinal nature," Navarro said. "It would be wrong to interpret 
this as the first step toward woman priests." 
</P>
<P>
 Stammer reported from Los Angeles and Montalbano from Rome.

VICTIMS OF FUMES STILL ILL, AND STILL SEEKING ANSWERS; MYSTERY: A DOCTOR AND 
NURSE ARE BATTLING AFTEREFFECTS OF POISON THAT FELLED EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF IN 
FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mystery fumes are still extracting their toll. The unidentified poison 
that sickened the emergency room staff at Riverside General Hospital nearly 
eight weeks ago still will not loosen its grasp on Dr. Julie Gorchynski and 
nurse Sally Balderas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old doctor underwent surgery Wednesday to try to save her knees. 
The bones that make up the joints are dying for lack of blood circulation, she 
said -- a condition that Gorchynski blames on whatever happened that night in 
February that affected her and five other emergency room workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether doctors can restore the circulation to her knees or will end up having 
to replace them with artificial joints is just one baffling question in the 
medical mystery. During her hospital recovery, Gorchynski suffered from 
chest-seizing muscle spasms and breathing lapses that necessitated use of a 
respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, she is unsure if she will ever be able to breathe normally again 
because the mystery agent that invaded her body somehow seems to have affected 
her lungs. She has been unable to draw a full breath since Feb. 19, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frustrated," said Gorchynski, who returned to work April 1 but continued 
for just a week before the pain in her knees became excruciating. Now she can 
walk only with crutches. "We still don't know what those chemicals were, and we 
can't foresee these kinds of complications." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Balderas remains off work too, her body racked by conditions caused by 
the same mystery fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 She has pounding headaches and often doubles up from abdominal pain. She is 
still vomiting. She cannot sleep for much more than an hour at a time -- and 
when she does doze off, her mother, father and husband take turns watching over 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gorchynski, Balderas became afflicted with sleep apnea, a disorder in 
which breathing temporarily stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows anything," Balderas said, sounding tired and resigned. "It's so 
frustrating still not knowing what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski and Balderas were the two most seriously injured by the mystery 
fumes the night that cancer patient Gloria Ramirez, a 31-year-old mother of 
two, was wheeled into Riverside General, complaining of nausea and breathing 
difficulties. She was in cardiac arrest and died 36 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who tended to Ramirez said her blood, drawn into a syringe, had 
a foul smell that sickened them. A couple of people said the blood smelled like 
ammonia. One doctor said it seemed to contain white crystals; another doctor 
said he noted yellow specks. One witness said Ramirez's skin looked oily. 
</P>
<P>
 Two doctors, two nurses and two respiratory therapists fell sick. Some just 
got dizzy. Others collapsed outright, including Gorchynski, who was 
hospitalized for two weeks, and Balderas, who was hospitalized for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly eight weeks later, authorities say they still are not sure what 
happened, despite an autopsy of Ramirez's body to determine whether she was the 
source of the toxin or was a victim of the same poison that affected the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there are no answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to make progress in their investigation this week, when a group 
of medical experts and scientists are to discuss what they have learned so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly one of the most complex cases, if not the most complex case, 
we've ever faced in this county," said Tom DeSantis, the Riverside County 
government's public information officer who has served as spokesman for the 
county agencies involved in the case, including the county-operated hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting today, experts assigned to the case "will focus on bringing all 
the pieces of this puzzle together, so we can start assembling them," DeSantis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ramirez's body, still not embalmed, remains sealed inside a body 
bag within an airtight, gray metal casket in a chilled storage room at the 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Ramirez family plan to seek a court order today that would 
allow a family-retained pathologist to conduct an independent autopsy on the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Schwartz, a Newport Beach attorney who specializes in environmental 
cases, also wants the county to turn over its investigative files so the 
pathologist can learn what is known so far. Schwartz also wants to get 
depositions from the coroner's staff. The county is resisting, saying the 
requests would compromise its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz suggests that the county is involved in a cover-up. He contends that 
it wants to disguise the fact that something went amiss in the emergency room 
that makes the county, not Ramirez, liable for what happened. Schwartz wants a 
grand jury to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is destroying the single most important piece of evidence," 
Schwartz said. "They're destroying Gloria Ramirez's remains by having delayed 
things this long." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly disturbing to the family, Schwartz said, is a condition by the 
county -- supported by Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency -- that the casket 
not be opened, even to confirm the identity of the body inside it, until 
authorities are sure it no longer poses a public health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are suffering, the family is suffering," said Maggie 
Garcia-Ramirez, Gloria's sister. "We just want a normal burial, but we don't 
even know if it's her body in the casket." 
</P>
<P>
 The casket has been opened twice -- once for the initial autopsy six days 
after Ramirez's death, when pathologists donned protective suits and worked 
inside a specially constructed and ventilated area, and a second time last 
month when, wearing just oxygen masks and protective clothing, the coroner's 
staff took additional tissue samples for further analysis, then prepared the 
body for burial. The family did not learn of the second procedure until two 
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither time did the county say whether the body was emitting toxic fumes, but 
DeSantis explained the elaborate protocol as a necessary precaution because of 
the uncertainty over the source of the fumes in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, county officials have insisted that no details of the continuing 
investigation be revealed, even to the Ramirez family. Like other law 
enforcement agencies, the coroner's office must work in secret until something 
conclusive can be announced, DeSantis said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis refused even to confirm that the syringe containing the suspect blood 
has been analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This investigation," he says, "isn't as simple as testing a hypothesis by 
checking for the presence of a particular chemical. We're dealing with a 
complete unknown, so it's been a process of deductive reasoning. The testing 
that is being performed is designed to rule out the thousands of possible 
chemical compounds and to narrow the focus of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the focus had been been narrowed, he said: "I can't give you anything 
on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting the county on its investigation is Dr. Anna Maria Osorio, chief of 
the state Department of Health Services' division of environmental and 
occupational disease control in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA is conducting its own investigation and studying whether the hospital 
itself may have been the source of the mystery fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a possibility we may never find out what happened," said Cal/OSHA 
spokesman Rick Rice. "That's particularly troublesome, but, in fact, that 
happens quite a bit, especially if you're dealing with airborne contaminants." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that answers are not forthcoming frustrates Sally Balderas, who has 
weekly checkups with her neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderas said she is eager to return to work, but is not healthy enough yet. 
"There's nothing I can do but sit down a lot," she says. "I get so short of 
breath." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski said what concerns her most is the possible onset of more 
complications, because she does not know what chemicals have contaminated her 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a lot of support from my family and friends," Gorchynski said. "I 
used to deal with stress by surfing, but now that luxury is taken away from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all still waiting to see what might come from the autopsy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a 70% chance, she said, that her knee surgery will prove successful. 
She wants to return to emergency room work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize more than ever," she said, "how fragile life and health can be."

ROBERTI SEES VICTORY AS LIFTING GUN FOES' FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gun control advocates on Wednesday hailed state Sen. David A. Roberti's 
victory in a bitter recall election as a major setback for the National Rifle 
Assn., while Roberti quickly sought to use it to gain momentum in his campaign 
for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a crushing defeat for the NRA," said Richard Aborn, president of 
Handgun Control Inc., of Tuesday's recall election results, which showed 
Roberti, author of a controversial 1989 ban on assault weapons, taking 59% of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, speaking at a news conference, said his victory should assure 
lawmakers nationwide that they can vote against the NRA on gun issues and 
survive. "It's important to get the message out to other legislators that they 
can vote their conscience, not their fears," said the Van Nuys Democrat, who 
spent more than $650,000 contesting the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NRA and others supporting the recall said they were content to have 
damaged Roberti by costing him so much money to defend himself. "We bled him," 
said Russ Howard, a leader of the recall movement. "He'll never be able to get 
elected treasurer after this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti camp was optimistic Wednesday that the high-profile recall 
election would prove a boon to Roberti in his bid for the Democratic Party 
nomination for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 His ability to stand up to a powerful special interest, such as the NRA, "says 
something about my character," Roberti said. "I'm a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Reilly, Roberti's campaign consultant, predicted that the recall 
victory will give his cash-strapped client "enormous momentum" going into the 
treasurer's race. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Roberti basked in his victory Wednesday, Phil Angelides, Roberti's 
opponent in the Democratic primary race for treasurer, was already on the 
attack. Angelides refrained from attacking Roberti during the recall campaign 
because he said he agreed with the senator's gun control stand. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Angelides, a Sacramento developer and former chairman of 
the state party, assailed Roberti as a profligate who presided over a system of 
waste and perks in the state Senate. Roberti "created a system that wasted 
millions of dollars," Angelides charged in seeking to define the issue in the 
treasurer's race as cutting waste and creating jobs, not fighting the gun 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 During Roberti's 13-year reign as president pro tempore, the annual budget for 
the state Senate rose from $17.8 million to $61.9 million, Angelides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides, whose candidacy is identity-poor but cash-rich, with $1.1 million 
in campaign contributions in the bank, also unveiled a TV ad that says Roberti 
was the architect of a perks system that provided chauffeured cars, tax-free 
income and free laundry pickup services for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now facing term limits, this career politician wants to be state treasurer, 
so he can keep his hands on your tax money," the ad concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti did not provide a detailed rebuttal Wednesday, but expressed 
confidence that the growth in the Senate budget "stayed within the parameters 
of the general state budget," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Berg, the top aide to the president pro tempore of the Senate, accused 
Angelides of misrepresentation. Drivers are available, largely to pick up 
members from the airport, but they also do other work, Berg said, and the 
laundry service does not cost the taxpayers money. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that Angelides himself was a member of the state Assembly staff, 
Berg said: "I don't recall him making an issue of these things then." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) doubted that 
the outcome of the Roberti recall would encourage an avalanche of new support 
for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think members of both houses are pretty much solidified on the issue," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris 
(D-Oakland) predicted that Roberti's showing could prompt some legislators to 
support firearms restrictions. Several Democratic lawmakers donated money to 
Roberti's effort. Petris and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) 
flew to Los Angeles to walk precincts for their colleague on election eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Metaksa, the NRA's chief lobbyist in Washington, noted that Roberti 
spent $650,000 to get 30,000 votes and said, "I think Sen. Roberti paid a 
terrible price." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really too bad that the senator is more concerned about bashing the NRA 
and depriving law-abiding citizens of their rights than he is of protecting his 
constituents from crime," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days of the campaign, the NRA spent $50,000 on the recall, mostly 
to contact voters through a phone bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti acknowledged all along that the recall was a two-edged sword. The 
national and statewide attention he gained as the champion of gun control was 
to his benefit, while the depletion of his campaign war chest hurt him. "It's 
used up all my money," said Roberti, who is now embarking on a fund-raising 
frenzy that included a $1,000-a-plate dinner at Rex Ristorante in Downtown Los 
Angeles on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti quickly moved to capitalize on his celebrity as an NRA survivor. On 
Wednesday he flew to San Diego for a second news conference about his recall 
experiences and was joined there by a Handgun Control official and by leaders 
of the Mexican American Political Assn., which has endorsed his bid for 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Roberti goes to San Francisco to hold another news conference on the 
same theme. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first recall election against a state lawmaker in 80 years, Tuesday's 
vote was a landmark event and closely watched nationally as a plebiscite on gun 
control. Before it was over, the race had been featured on network news shows 
and had been covered by the New York Times, the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour and 
National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti cast himself as the target of "assault weapons extremists" who were 
seeking revenge because he had authored a 1989 ban on military-style 
semiautomatic weapons. His opponents disputed this characterization, saying 
they were also opposed to Roberti as a soft-on-crime liberal, a carpetbagger 
and a big spender. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from Tuesday's election showed that 30,743 votes were cast against the 
recall, representing 59.1% of the vote, while 21,276 votes, or 40.9%, were cast 
for the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dominguez, a systems analyst who organized the recall drive, got the most 
votes of the five candidates seeking to unseat Roberti if the recall measure on 
the two-part ballot had succeeded. Dominguez received 12,010 votes; Dolores 
White, a real estate broker, 8,573; Al Dib, a retired grocer, 5,909; Randy 
Linkmeyer, a Canoga Park gun store owner, 5,297, and Larry Martz, a contractor, 
1,289.

COLUMN ONE; A FIRM FOCUS ON DIVERSITY; WHEN IT COMES TO LAWYERS, THERE'S A 
WIDESPREAD PRESUMPTION THAT BLACKS AND BLUE-CHIP DON'T MATCH. BUT ARNELLE & 
HASTIE HAS PROSPERED BY CONCENTRATING ON CORPORATE CLIENTS FROM THE START. 
</P>

<P>
 The plaintiff, an elderly black man, got in trouble at work and was fired just 
before retirement. He accused his employer, a big corporation, of race and age 
discrimination. Defending the company was an up-and-coming law firm named 
Arnelle & Hastie. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fired man's actions had jeopardized the safety of other workers, 
the company's lawyer, William Hastie, feared that the court might sympathize 
with the plaintiff against the rich corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told our client, 'You don't want to push this.' We made a generous 
settlement offer. But opposing counsel said he was gonna whip our butt. He 
insisted on going to trial, and the (plaintiff) did not get one nickel." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hastie, an African American who used to be on the other side of such 
cases, the outcome was poignant -- but legally sound. And his role in defending 
the company is a measure of society's progress in the vital matter of 
assimilating minorities into the professions and the corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
 The advancements have been insufficient in general, perhaps. But the 
phenomenon has reached full expression at Arnelle & Hastie. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle & Hastie was founded nine years ago by Hastie, a former public 
interest lawyer, and by seasoned, imposing San Francisco trial lawyer Jesse 
Arnelle. It is the largest minority-owned law firm on the West Coast and the 
second biggest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it stands apart even from the larger Lewis, White & Clay of Detroit 
because, at a time when minority attorneys are battling for access to the 
business world, its clientele has been corporate America from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue-chip but black," was the idea, Hastie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority lawyers traditionally handle public sector law, criminal defense 
cases, civil rights work and other cases that often involve plaintiffs suing 
deep-pocket companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnelle, now 60, and Hastie, 46, determined that their firm would rise or 
fall on its ability to attract corporate clients. In effect, they proposed to 
represent the white business Establishment despite the widespread presumption 
that black and blue-chip don't match. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, from offices in San Francisco and in Los Angeles, New York, 
Philadelphia and Cherry Hill, N.J., Arnelle & Hastie's 31 lawyers work for 
dozens of America's biggest corporate names. A few examples: Shell, Arco, 
Levi-Strauss, Johnson & Johnson, Chrysler, Pepsico, United Airlines, Lockheed, 
Coca-Cola, DuPont, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, First Interstate, McDonald's, 
Burger King and Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
 By hiring experienced attorneys who know their way around a courtroom, the 
firm has established a first-rate track record in litigation -- a foreign arena 
to many corporate lawyers but one that accounts for 70% of Arnelle & Hastie's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good, solid firm," says Robert Williams, managing corporate counsel 
of Chevron's corporation law department. "They're not all things to all people. 
But they've tried a lot of cases, that's one of their selling points." 
</P>
<P>
 To get through the corporate door in the first place, the firm has seized 
every opportunity that the American Bar Assn. and other groups have created to 
encourage the hiring of minority lawyers. As such, they seem to provide 
real-world evidence that racial quotas can work. In fact, Hastie says 
unapologetically, the firm's racial and ethnic diversity was a clear advantage 
in winning the initial corporate assignments. The firm currently includes 
whites, Latinos and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have to prove yourself," he says, "and that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers at Arnelle & Hastie are passionate about the advancement of 
minorities in the legal profession. But practicing law often makes for strange 
bedfellows, especially for minorities representing white economic interests at 
a time when economic rights -- as distinct from social rights -- have become a 
civil rights battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Arnelle & Hastie got its first big infusion of cash in the late 1980s 
by defending R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in numerous lawsuits in which plaintiffs 
claimed that their cancers were caused by cigarette smoke. The tobacco industry 
has been vilified by black activists for marketing strategies that target 
African Americans, who suffer disproportionately from smoking-related diseases. 
The industry has also lavishly supported black politicians and organizations, 
linking the right to smoke with civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastie is philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be fairly thick-skinned if you want to represent major 
corporations," he says. "Sometimes their interests are going to be different 
from your own. Am I going to refuse to represent someone who is allegedly on 
the other side of black people? I can conceive of such cases. But that is a 
broad restriction I am not prepared to put on myself or the firm. I mean, we 
are lawyers. If we are not able to do that, we are doing something different 
than lawyering, definitionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Minority lawyers representing white corporate clients against minority 
plaintiffs face no more of a personal dilemma than any lawyers who represent 
clients they might disagree with, says Linda Mabry, a law professor at Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start with the premise that everyone is entitled to effective counsel. 
It's marvelous and long overdue that minority lawyers are getting a chance to 
represent mainstream clients," says Mabry, an African American ex-partner of a 
leading San Francisco firm. "The other point is that issues (in a lawsuit) are 
not that clear-cut. It's never black and white when you're representing any 
client, pardon the pun." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle & Hastie is not crossing this unfamiliar terrain alone, but there 
aren't many others. Though the number of minority attorneys has doubled since 
1980 -- to about 56,000 -- Black Enterprise magazine last year could turn up 
just 36 black-owned law firms with 10 or more lawyers and some corporate 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine identified 12 of those as having significant corporate practices. 
In addition to Arnelle & Hastie, they included Wilson & Becks of Los Angeles 
and McGee, Lafayette, Willis & Greene of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector is an all-important destination for minority barristers 
because that is where wealth is traditionally generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers interested in business and corporate law have traditionally had two 
realistic choices: joining the staffs of in-house attorneys employed by 
corporations or latching on to the countless large private law firms that the 
corporate world turns to for most legal help. Chevron Corp. alone uses about 
500 outside law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority-owned firms, meanwhile -- including many of those identified by Black 
Enterprise -- have tended to hitch their wagons to the political firmament. 
Their biggest growth came with the ascension of blacks to mayoralties and other 
top state and municipal positions. Like most politicos, they awarded legal 
business, notably municipal bond underwriting contracts, to their friends and 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle followed a different path. He spent 15 years in an eclectic one-man 
practice in San Francisco handling "whatever came in the door." But like many 
men, he says he was professionally restless as his 50th birthday neared in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he had anything more to prove. The gracious, accomplished Arnelle 
seems an embodiment of traditional American virtues and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the housing projects of New Rochelle, N.Y. Raised by parents who made 
him stand and salute in the living room when the national anthem came over the 
radio. Mentored by hard-nosed teachers. Football and basketball star at Penn 
State, almost a Los Angeles Ram. Law school. Peace Corps. Husband, father, 
college trustee, climber of Mt. Kilimanjaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," the white-haired, 6-foot-6 Arnelle says with a laugh, gazing at a 1980 
photo of himself atop the mountain, "it's the highest peak in Africa. Every 
black kid ought to climb the highest peak in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Hastie, whose father, the late William H. Hastie, was a noted jurist and the 
nation's first black federal appeals judge, had a comfortable middle-class 
upbringing that included Amherst College and UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of 
Law. He co-founded a public interest law firm in 1971 and focused on employment 
discrimination, suing various companies that today are clients. When Arnelle 
called in 1985, he was struggling as a solo practitioner and part-time 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall of Hastie's cluttered office is a snapshot of him with his sister, 
Karen, at a dinner with Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall shortly before 
Marshall's death last year. Karen Hastie Williams, a civil rights attorney 
under President Jimmy Carter, eulogized Marshall at the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Berkeley days, Hastie says, he was a radical. But he disdains today's 
"lock-step climate" and the "Nazi overtones" of political correctness. Although 
the firm mostly supports Democratic candidates, its commercial instinct -- to 
win public bond business, for example -- is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We supported both Giuliani and Dinkins," the bearded Hastie chuckles, 
referring to New York's white Republican Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and David 
Dinkins, the black Democratic incumbent he defeated in November. 
</P>
<P>
 And the virtue of blacks arguing the case for corporate America? 
</P>
<P>
 Hastie recalls an epiphany of sorts when he was serving as an attorney for 
U.S. Leasing Corp., a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. He found himself in heated 
closed-door negotiations in Chicago with the general counsel of GE Capital 
Corp., a black attorney named Winston Lowe, while their white staffs looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a moment of reflection. I got this chill up my spine," he says. "I 
thought, 'Isn't this something.' Here we were going at each other so hard, the 
only blacks in the room. I thought, 'Isn't this what lawyering is all about?' 
It sends a narrow but hopeful message about opportunity and making it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Arnelle and Hastie got together, the conservative political climate was 
hardly pressuring corporations to hire black lawyers. But there were other, 
friendlier things going on. Attitudes and generations were changing, the first 
big wave of minority law students from the 1970s was gaining legal experience 
around the nation, and cost-conscious corporations were taking a hard look at 
their big, expensive law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hired for the RJR cases on the recommendation of a black corporate 
counsel at another big company, illustrating why minority attorneys attach such 
importance to contacts and networking. The cases were among many tobacco 
liability lawsuits that never went to trial, but preparations kept the young 
firm busy for three years and pumped in cash, enabling it to add lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 After showing an initial willingness to accept tiny assignments from skeptical 
corporations tossing bones to minority lawyers, the firm soon grew to become 
the attorneys of choice for bigger cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle's world view seems to be that people, including those in corporations, 
want to do the right thing. He says the business world deserves more credit 
than it gets in such matters, and he does not feel "used" when the firm is 
retained partly because a plaintiff or key witness is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the same kind of value judgments I would have made: 'Where can I 
best use the talents of this firm?' " Arnelle says. "That's logical, good, 
lawyer-like reasoning. I don't look on that as disparaging at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason for our existence is to provide quality legal service for our 
clients . . . and the rewards are demonstrable: It helps you raise a family, 
build a house and educate your kids, and gives you tremendous professional 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 With the RJR Tobacco experience under its belt and the firm having grown to 10 
lawyers, it was ready to exploit new corporate minority programs being pushed 
by the black bar's National Bar Assn. and then by the American Bar Assn., which 
leaned on corporations to hire minority attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle & Hastie also ventured into the public sector to take advantage of one 
of the biggest windfalls for lawyers in years: the great savings and loan 
scandal. It triggered thousands of lawsuits by and against the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and the newly created Resolution Trust Corp. Again, the young 
firm was at the table as public agencies set out to fill quotas for using 
minority attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has since handled about 350 related cases, including a 50-50 joint 
venture with one of California's top firms, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, in the 
most complex West Coast case of all. A team from Arnelle & Hastie spent nearly 
three years successfully defending the FDIC, as bankruptcy trustee, against a 
claim by American Savings & Loan that the government had caused its financial 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job. They played a very big role," says Al Karel, litigation 
partner and FDIC specialist at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison's Los Angeles 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle & Hastie will not divulge its total billings, but last year the firm 
billed the RTC alone for $1 million. Hastie says savings and loan work -- 
chased by countless majority-owned firms, such as Little Rock's Rose Law Firm 
-- is "a significant portion of our revenue but nowhere near half. And it has 
given our attorneys exposure to serious commercial matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle & Hastie's ranks have fallen from a peak of 40 because of the 
recession, an expired contract with the state of California and raids by other 
firms seeking minority lawyers. For example, its first woman partner, Joann 
Russell, is now associate general counsel at Levi-Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the firm is painstakingly diverse: There are 21 African Americans, 
seven whites, two Latinos and a Native American. Nine of the lawyers are women. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is a magnet -- increasingly so as it attracts attention nationally. 
There was a flattering profile last year in the New Yorker magazine. And the 
firm's prominence in the Black Enterprise article was eye-opening to minority 
law students around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students didn't even know there were minority firms doing corporate 
work," says Arnelle & Hastie's only rookie, African American Stephanie Johnson, 
the daughter of a government patent attorney and a recent law graduate of the 
University of North Carolina. "Now I hear from friends almost every day who 
yearn to work at a place like this." 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of three attorneys hired in the last nine months, and all say they 
were attracted by the unique feel of the place because of its minority 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelio Grillo, a 1985 graduate of Harvard Law and son of Afro-Cuban and 
Italian parents, spent eight years at white-owned corporate law firms before 
finally tiring, he says, of a constant presumption of incompetence. He was 
recruited by Arnelle & Hastie. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a certain sympatico in the practice of law," says Grillo. 
"There is a shared experience here, and we are not second-guessing each other. 
We've all gone to good schools and done well and there is a presumption of 
competence about each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it hurt to have a role model like Arnelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesse Arnelle is a good lawyer who is impressive under any circumstances," 
says Robert McNew, senior counsel who oversees U.S. litigation for 
Cleveland-based Eaton Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, a $4-billion-a-year industrial manufacturer with no minority attorneys 
of its own, investigated Arnelle & Hastie five years ago and liked the results. 
Over the years, it has hired the firm for product liability cases, asbestos 
lawsuits and environmental matters. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a local electrical contractor in the small, mostly white northern 
California town of Santa Rosa sued Eaton for $6 million last year because a 
large Eaton-built electrical transformer fell and permanently injured him, the 
company ignored conventional wisdom and sent in Arnelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Large, distant corporations accused of maiming small-town folks are advised to 
use local lawyers, or at least have one sitting next to the big shooter from 
the city. And if the big-city lawyer is absolutely necessary, he should at 
least be the same race as everyone else in town. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-day trial, the jury awarded the injured man nothing.

EL PASO BLOCKADE HOLDING FAST ON ILLEGAL CROSSINGS; BORDER: INFLUX OF 
IMMIGRANTS ALONG THE PATROLLED 20-MILE AREA IS DOWN 73%. CRIME ALSO HAS EASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Determined to get through the blockade, the 10 Mexican men climbed into a 
Santa Fe railway grain hopper in Ciudad Juarez one night, closed the hatch and 
waited for delivery in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The car made it across the Rio Grande. But instead of moving on to 
Albuquerque, where a friend planned to let them out, they sat idle all the next 
morning on a sidetrack in El Paso. The sun rose and the heat topped 100 degrees 
inside the metal container. By late morning the young men from Zacatecas and 
Guanajuato were pounding on the sides for help. 
</P>
<P>
 A railway yardman heard their cries. He opened the hatch, but first called law 
enforcement. And the illegal immigrants who had hoped to find work in the 
United States came coughing and gagging into the custody of the U.S. Border 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't believe what we'd heard about the blockade," said 26-year-old Jamie 
Salazar, later cooling off in a Border Patrol detention cell. "But when I get 
home, I'm going to tell people not to come here any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a year after federal agents set up a human blockade along the 20-mile 
border sector here, the line is holding fast. But perhaps more important, it 
also is dramatically changing the face of this international community, where 
illegal immigrants once marched northward in record numbers, past a Border 
Patrol operation unable to stand in their way. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Border Patrol officials, the number of illegal crossings has 
continued to drop since the blockade was thrown up in September -- down 73% 
over the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 El Paso crime statistics also are down, officials said, most notably in auto 
thefts. And complaints against the Border Patrol have dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, local public opinion -- which once derided the Border Patrol 
-- appears to have swung to the side of the agents. Even their most vocal 
critics, an angry group of students and teachers at an El Paso high school next 
to the border fence, have dropped allegations about harassment and settled a 
federal lawsuit against the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a local human rights coalition, which would rather see El Paso and Ciudad 
Juarez declared a "free zone" that would open up the border, concedes that the 
Border Patrol's initiative is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the blockade, agents sit quietly all day and all night at more than 100 
spots along the border. Sitting in patrol jeeps along the levee, they read 
paperback books, study home college courses and drink Thermoses full of black 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Their steady presence has turned back most of those who once came over on 
crude skiffs or plastic life rafts, through holes in the fence or in drainage 
canals, in the backs of trucks and the trunks of cars . . . even those who 
brazenly walked across the three river bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon, unlike anything in the decades-old game of border policing, 
means one of two things: Either those trying to enter the country illegally 
have all but conceded the popular El Paso crossing to the U.S. authorities, or 
they are going around to smaller locations in New Mexico or Texas. Indeed, 
officials said some smaller border towns have begun experiencing increases of 
up to 200% in illegal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Chief Agent Silvestre Reyes pledges to maintain the line as long 
as he remains in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a chaotic border," Reyes said of what he found when he was 
transferred here last July. "It was totally out of control. It was wide open. 
It was commonly known in Mexico and as far away as Los Angeles that El Paso was 
the way to cross over." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the current situation along the border as tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
 "People wonder why this wasn't done before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, immigration officials are reviewing the feasibility of other 
blockades along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 But Verne Jervis, an INS spokesman in Washington, said that the San 
Diego-Tijuana area -- the nation's busiest entry point for undocumented workers 
-- is not conducive to such a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis said the canyons and rough topography there, and the lack of a natural 
obstacle such as the Rio Grande, would make a human blockade too costly and 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, officials are reviewing other options for the San Diego 
area, such as new technology and a 40% increase to the 1,000-agent contingent 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at more lights and fencing and sensors and television 
monitors. And also new strategies of moving people around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Paso had been ranked the second-most porous border in the country. Today, 
it has dropped to No. 4, after San Diego, McAllen, Tex., and Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 When Reyes shut down the El Paso border last fall, he dubbed his effort 
Operation Blockade. But amid the initial clamor came the cry that the word 
"blockade" was offensive, recalling confrontations in Cuba and Haiti. Bowing to 
those concerns, Reyes changed the name to Operation Hold the Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the human wall settled in, the public gradually began to accept the 
change. Last month, for instance, an exit poll of voters in a Democratic 
primary election found that 84% of them favored the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 James Gonzalez, a 16-year agent with most of his career in El Paso, recently 
drove through a riverfront barrio known as Chihuahuita, explaining how the 
neighborhood once was overrun with undocumented workers and the gangs who 
preyed on them. But now a neighborhood park is cleaned up and elderly residents 
sit outside on their porch stoops. New graffiti on a tenement wall proclaimed: 
"We're all for the blockade." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez also recalled the frustrating days of chasing illegal immigrants 
around town, of complaints from local residents about undocumented workers who 
bothered motorists by trying to wash their windshields to earn tips. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, he said, illegal immigrants seemed to be everywhere. "People 
were popping out of manholes in the middle of the street." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bowie High School, students and teachers once complained about agents 
tearing through the campus in search of illegal immigrants, and often as not 
stopping the wrong people. The school is 99% Latino. They sued the Border 
Patrol to stop the harassment, and then dropped the legal action after the 
blockade took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they stopped me and once they put a gun to the head of our assistant 
football coach," said Grace Hernandez, the school secretary. "They thought he 
was transporting illegals or carrying drugs across the border or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "That went on all the time, for many years," Hernandez said. "But now this has 
helped us tremendously. We don't see them on campus any more. They don't stop 
our kids any more. The harassment has stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Paso Police Department, Sgt. Lalo Balderrama said auto thefts in the 
downtown area have dropped 34% in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the sergeant added: "The majority of the illegal aliens are not going to 
commit a crime. They don't want to break into a house or rob people. They come 
over to look for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a small percentage who are criminals. But this blockade has stopped 
those who are coming over here for not always good intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kamoroff, administrative director of El Paso's Downtown Development 
Assn., said merchants at first feared that the blockade would cost them 
business. He has heard stories of scattered retail failures, including the 
stores of one woman who sold inexpensive household gifts and of a man who for 
10 years sold costume jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the merchants have not seen an appreciable change in retail sales, 
Kamoroff said. "I guess it's proved that most of those who were sneaking over 
were not shoppers anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Border Rights Coalition, coordinator Suzan Kern questioned whether the 
blockade will last much longer. As long as it goes on, she said, it merely 
moves the problem to remote desert areas where people battle heat and 
exhaustion to make it into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not stopping it; they're just shifting it," she said of the new 
blockade. "There are 50-year-old women getting up at 4 in the morning now to go 
around and climb the mountains to get here. These are not criminals. These are 
women who want to come here and work cleaning our houses and watching our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Her group recently conducted its own poll on the blockade, focusing on its 
impact in the Chihuahuita barrio. They found that about one-third of the 
residents believe crime is the same there, convincing them that local residents 
-- not illegal immigrants -- are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crossers don't have time to steal," one resident told the pollsters. 
"They don't bother us. They cross through. They don't stick around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government also is cautiously watching the situation, after first 
predicting that the blockade would not last. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. Border Patrol agents used to return illegal immigrants to Ciudad 
Juarez, Mexican officials now walk over the bridge themselves to escort them 
back. On the return trip, they can't help but see the graffiti painted on the 
Mexican side of the concrete levee. 
</P>
<P>
 Warnings like "No Mas Bloqueos" and "Denuncie Abusos de las Migras" angrily 
call for an end to Operation Hold the Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Gonzalez and the hundreds of other Border Patrol officers can read the 
slogans from their vantage points along the El Paso levee, too. Every day they 
can see them, and every day the blockade continues to hold.

DESERT PROTECTION ACT CLEARS SENATE; ENVIRONMENT: LEGISLATION WOULD PRESERVE AN 
ADDITIONAL 6.3 MILLION ACRES AND CREATE THREE NATIONAL PARKS IN CALIFORNIA. 
BACKERS PREDICT SWIFT PASSAGE IN HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping eight years of contentious debate, the Senate overwhelmingly passed 
legislation Wednesday to preserve 6.3 million more acres of the California 
desert, an action that virtually assures the sweeping environmental measure of 
becoming law this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Desert Protection Act would create 74 wilderness areas and 
three new national parks, including the 1.2-million-acre Mojave National Park, 
and place vast portions of fragile desert ecosystems off limits to off-road 
vehicles, mining exploration and new livestock grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for the National Park Service, a great day for the 
California desert and a great day for California," said Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt. "The action of the United States Senate today moves us 
substantially closer to filling one of the most obvious missing links in the 
landscape of America's national parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, hailed the complex bill as "one of the most significant pieces of 
environmental legislation" in the 103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation now moves to the House, which approved a similar bill in 1991. 
Senate passage makes desert protection "our highest priority," said Rep. George 
Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. He 
predicted House approval "in a very swift fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill would become the largest public lands act of its kind in the 
continental United States. It enjoys the strong support of the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's 69-29 vote marked an impressive accomplishment for first-term Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who made desert protection her top legislative 
priority. She solicited 48 co-sponsors and succeeded in getting 16 Republicans 
to support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is promises made, promises kept," a beaming Feinstein told supporters at 
a festive news conference after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said the bill would create tourism opportunities while preserving 
diverse desert terrain, from 600-foot-high sand dunes to historic underground 
mining sites. Environmental leaders said passage of desert protection 
legislation this year would push the nation's wilderness system over 100 
million acres during the 30th anniversary of the federal Wilderness Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "There couldn't be a better time to protect California's one-of-a-kind 
resource," said Norbert J. Riedy, a policy analyst with the Wilderness Society 
in San Francisco. "The Mojave Desert is world known and now it will be 
preserved for generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican opponents, led by Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and backed by 
California Gov. Pete Wilson and the four House members who represent the desert 
area, criticized the bill as a financial burden on the National Park Service 
and a hardship on the California economy that would reduce mining and ranching 
jobs. Wilson predicted the desert bill would "do more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
 The California desert comprises 25 million acres, mostly tucked in the state's 
southeast corner. Environmentalists regard the territory as a national treasure 
with its 90 mountain ranges, more than 100,000 archeological sites, waterfalls, 
wetlands and 760 species of wildlife. The region is home to the oldest known 
living organism, an 11,700-year-old creosote ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's bill covers 9 million acres in all, including existing Park 
Service land. It would expand the combined boundaries of Death Valley and 
Joshua Tree national monuments from 2.65 million acres to 4.2 million acres. 
Death Valley and Joshua Tree are already managed by the National Park Service 
but do not currently have national park status. The change is mostly cosmetic; 
visitors will notice little difference in the new parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The crown jewel of the legislation is the East Mojave National Scenic Area, 
which would become the Mojave National Park. Located east of Barstow, the 
Mojave consists of three distinct ecosystems: the Sonoran Desert, the high 
elevation Mojave Desert and the Great Basin Desert. The landforms include 16 
mountain ranges, 6,000-foot peaks, cinder cones and the second-highest sand 
dunes in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment to prevent the Mojave from becoming a national park was defeated 
soundly, 62-35, on Tuesday. Under the Feinstein proposal, the East Mojave would 
be transferred from the Bureau of Land Management to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert legislation was first introduced in 1986 by Democratic Sen. Alan 
Cranston, but was held up for six years in disputes with the state's successive 
Republican senators, first Wilson and then John Seymour. The stalemate was 
broken in 1992 with the election of Democrats Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both 
ardent supporters of desert protection. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cranston's request, Feinstein agreed to offer the legislation early last 
year and predicted it would sail through the Senate in a matter of months. But 
Feinstein met resistance from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
and was forced to make extensive modifications to meet concerns of her fellow 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Tuesday, Feinstein agreed to 10 new amendments, bringing to 60 
the number of changes to the Cranston legislation. These include concessions to 
accommodate the military, law enforcement, utility companies, mining interests, 
cattle grazers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 While embracing the entire package, environmental groups said they will seek 
three major changes in the House version -- reinstating the scenic, 
290,000-acre Lanfair Valley to the proposed Mojave Park, limiting grazing 
rights to 25 years and placing some minor restrictions on military overflights. 
</P>
<P>
 The House sponsor, California Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-North Fork), said he 
needed to scrutinize the Feinstein bill before considering any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans were highly critical of the desert bill because it would add 
the acreage equivalent of two Yellowstone National Parks at a time when the 
National Park System is cutting back visitor center hours, unable to provide 
adequate housing for rangers and scheduled to lose 3,700 positions over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to operate the proposed Mojave National Park is to take 
something away from existing parks," Wallop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who is seeking the Republican 
nomination to challenge Feinstein in November, issued a statement Wednesday 
saying that he will vote against the desert bill because of the economic impact 
and drain on other park budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pointed attack on the cost of the legislation, Sen. Robert C. Byrd 
(D-W.Va.) noted that agencies within the Interior Department have a backlog of 
$6 billion in maintenance and repair needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having three new beautiful national parks will be nice. . . ," said Byrd, a 
Feinstein nemesis on the Appropriations Committee and the only Democrat who 
opposed the bill. "But we in this chamber have to come to grips with the 
realities in the age in which we live. One does not go out and buy a Cadillac 
when one cannot make payments on the family Ford." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Babbitt said that a "historic opportunity" to protect the 
California desert should not be missed due to fiscal constraints. He added that 
Interior has the necessary fiscal and personnel resources to manage a new 
national park in the East Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we can't afford not to have this park," Babbitt said.

ANC SUPPORTERS ROUT CANDIDATES FROM SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Escorted by dozens of army troops and election monitors, candidates from 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's ruling Nationalists and four other parties 
brought their political campaigns to the rutted roads of this violent "no-go" 
black squatter camp on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than half an hour later, too frightened even to deliver their 
three-minute speeches, the candidates piled into armored personnel carriers and 
were driven back out of town, past an angry, jeering crowd of African National 
Congress supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 And Operation Access, the fledgling effort of the Independent Electoral 
Commission to force the national campaign into South Africa's most troubled, 
violence-prone spots, suffered its first defeat, reflecting the shadow of 
political intolerance that hangs heavily over the run-up to this country's 
first free elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see people suppressing other parties' right to be heard, it almost 
makes you want to cry," said Bob Mabena, coordinator for Operation Access in 
the Phola Park region, as he rode one of the army's armored vehicles in 
retreat. "We were ambushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Xolani Gumede, a 23-year-old black man and the National Party's candidate, 
added: "It's a sad turn of events. Two weeks before the election and we still 
have this kind of attitude. We've still got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation in Phola Park, an often violent ANC stronghold of more than 
30,000 people southeast of Johannesburg, was a blunt reminder here of the 
growing levels of intimidation that have characterized the campaign for the 
elections, set for April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 It also indicated clearly that a strong current of intolerance runs among 
supporters of Nelson Mandela's ANC, the likely winner of the elections. And 
that has caused many in South Africa to begin questioning the ANC's 
often-stated commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the candidates were fleeing Phola Park, Tony Leon, a Democratic Party 
leader, was being hounded from a stage at the University of the Western Cape by 
ANC supporters who drowned out his speech, hollering, "To the gate! To the 
gate!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time the ANC leadership accepted that its ranks are swelled by noisy and 
intolerant thugs, and took measures to educate its supporters on the meaning of 
democracy and free speech," Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at a news conference in Pretoria, De Klerk's National Party accused the 
ANC of a "massive intimidation campaign" that has jeopardized free elections. 
And an electoral appeal panel in Pietersburg on Wednesday ordered the ANC to 
stop interrupting National Party meetings and intimidating the party's 
supporters in northern parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Japha Chuwe, national coordinator of Operation Access, said the commission 
will continue to escort candidates into "no-go" areas, many of which have been 
created by ardent ANC supporters. But Chuwe and other officials were clearly 
disturbed by the Phola Park incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the right to speak and the right not to listen," said Chuwe, 
interviewed as the candidates drove past the shouting, waving residents, many 
carrying ANC campaign posters. "But you don't have the right to prevent others 
from listening." 
</P>
<P>
 For the candidates, the day had begun optimistically. Dressed mostly in sport 
coats and ties, with party buttons pinned to their lapels, they said they had 
accepted the electoral commission invitation to participate in Operation Access 
in hopes that they could campaign, however briefly, in Phola Park and 
neighboring Thokoza township. 
</P>
<P>
 Those communities, long flash points for violence, have been relatively calm 
since army troops replaced police in the region. But campaigning by any party 
other than the ANC has been impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the black-based Pan-Africanist Congress had an office in the region, 
Mosothe Petlane, the party's 26-year-old candidate, just laughed. "It would be 
burned in less than five minutes, my friend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the National Party, dogged by the legacy of apartheid created by De 
Klerk's predecessors, and even the liberal Democratic Party had been afraid to 
campaign there. But party representatives thought Operation Access might give 
them the chance to carry their message to township residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a wife and kids, and I don't want to jeopardize their future by 
campaigning there," explained John Barrington, 48, a white businessman 
representing the small Federal Party. "But I'm here today because I want to do 
something to help their future too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered in one van on the drive to Phola Park, the candidates held a loud, 
impromptu and friendly political debate. Then the convoy drove slowly through 
Thokoza and the candidates, remaining inside vans, delivered their brief 
messages over loudspeakers. Most promised better housing and living conditions 
for residents, who lined the road where hundreds have died in internecine 
fighting over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to get out of your shacks, vote PAC," Petlane said over the 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 William Mnisi, the Democratic Party candidate, promised new houses too. "And 
we'll see to it that people get a living wage," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A few spectators shouted "Go away!" but most, like Dora Mamphati, who emerged 
from her house with her eight children to watch, listened quietly. "This is a 
good thing," she said. "I watch the candidates on television, but I like this 
campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the convoy arrived at Phola Park, a militant shack settlement where 
Winnie Mandela's firebrand politics is warmly embraced, the mood changed. 
Several hundred ANC supporters were waiting and grew angry when they learned 
that the ANC had turned down its invitation to join the convoy and that 
National Party candidates were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that this place was created by apartheid and that there was no way 
they could allow the National Party or any other party to campaign here," Chuwe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Told by army officers that their safety could no longer be guaranteed, the 
candidates chose to leave without making their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a symptom of the problems we have when one party has gained 
control of an area," said Helen Suzman, a respected liberal South African and 
member of the electoral commission. "We are trying to break that down. We don't 
want any 'no-go' areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Barrington, the Federal Party candidate, "What happened today was a 
disgrace to democracy."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: ROBERTI RECALL BID BACKFIRES ON GUN LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To quote from a long strategy memo that the Roberti recall organizers sent the 
National Rifle Assn. 14 months ago: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to engage the enemy, to work the enemy, to get in so close we can 
smell 'em. We need to break his will to fight us. . . . As an old infantry 
motto goes, 'God is our point man and Satan's bringing up the rear. If they 
don't see the light, they'll see hell. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 "Producing political pain by bleeding our targets is what brings us great 
pleasure and satisfaction. . . . The beast is wounded. It's time to go for the 
kill before he can run (statewide)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On election night Tuesday, this is how the target, state Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys), felt the pain and suffered hell: 
</P>
<P>
 There were seven TV mobile units outside his victory party in the San Fernando 
Valley -- surely more than ever have recorded his utterances in a 28-year 
political career. Some units went live as the senator arrived under a flood of 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the 1989 Stockton schoolyard massacre that inspired his 
authorship of legislation banning semiautomatic assault weapons -- the bill 
that prompted the irate gunners' recall attempt -- Roberti told viewers: "They 
care more about their convenience than screams of little children. They have a 
screw loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still going to fight them every inch," he vowed. "They're going to have 
to know that you can't shoot at someone and not get some fire back. They picked 
the fight. . . . They've been as mean, as down and dirty, as anybody can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The small Italian restaurant was packed with perhaps 300 supporters, political 
leaders, reporters and TV crew members. The story was good for two separate 
Roberti victory appearances before a dozen cameras and several radio 
microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NRA has pledged they're going to ruin my political career. Well . . . ," 
Roberti paused for the laughter, "enough said. I think they're going to ruin my 
political career like they recalled me. . . . Here I am all in one piece. And 
maybe their worst nightmare will come true and I'll win a statewide office and 
be your next treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, every other sentence seemed to be about assault rifles and the 
courage he had shown in taking on the gun lobby in 1989. And all of it, in the 
parlance of political pros, was "free media" -- in contrast to costly TV ads. 
It was in prime time in a media market that includes at least 40% of the 
state's voters. Further, it was the best kind of "free media," focused on a 
popular issue: gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 The free media was a gift of the gun lobby, whose fire had ricocheted on 
itself. In the end, it wasn't clear which was bigger: Roberti's landslide 
victory or the gun lobby's debilitating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the NRA and its allies couldn't win this recall, it's hard to imagine one 
that they might. As the inflammatory memo noted, Roberti was "wounded." The 
senator had no longtime ties to the district, which he moved into only in 1992 
and won with just 43% of the vote. (On Tuesday he got 59%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), nobody -- at least 
nobody who hasn't served prison time -- symbolizes the vilified Legislature 
more than Roberti, simply because he was the Senate leader for 13 years. And he 
is one of the most unphotogenic politicians of the modern era, with a shrill 
voice to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gun lobby vastly underestimated Roberti. Despite the voice pitch, he 
is an articulate, effective orator. He is tenacious and a scrapper. He 
aggressively pushed a popular Valley issue last year: breakup of the Los 
Angeles school district. And regardless of what opponents implied -- they 
tastelessly called this son of an Italian immigrant "the godfather of political 
corruption" -- Roberti's personal record is spotless. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Roberti easily outwitted the gunners and aimed his campaign where 
they were most vulnerable: at themselves and their "extremist," uncompromising 
obsession with firearms. A Times poll of Roberti's district showed that every 
demographic group overwhelmingly favored stricter gun controls. Even a majority 
of conservatives and a plurality of gun owners favored it. A separate statewide 
poll echoed similar support. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's doubtful the gun lobby's defeat will have much immediate impact on 
the myriad of pending firearms legislation. "Voting patterns are fairly 
well-established," says new Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward). 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's campaign for state treasurer, however, certainly has benefited. His 
statewide name identification has been enhanced. His posters and buttons have 
one message: Roberti's "the man who banned assault weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Next time the bully gunners are tempted to recall somebody, they would be 
advised to unload -- and shred their smoking-gun memos.

PANEL REJECTS MANDATORY QUAKE INSURANCE PLAN; GOVERNMENT: PROPOSAL TO REVIVE 
STATE-RUN COVERAGE FAILS BY ONE VOTE IN AN ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AS THE VOTE 
SPLITS ALONG PARTY LINES. IT WILL BE RECONSIDERED NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Assembly committee narrowly rejected legislation Wednesday to revive a 
state-run earthquake insurance program to help homeowners repair damage caused 
by major temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 The party-line vote by the Housing and Community Development Committee was 5 
to 3, one short of the six required for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure's author, Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), a candidate 
for state controller, expressed confidence that he will obtain the needed vote 
when the measure is reconsidered next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big One is in our future," Areias said. "It is intelligent public policy 
to plan ahead for the disasters that we know will occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The mandatory insurance program would provide homeowners with up to $15,000 to 
repair homes damaged by earthquakes. It would cost the average homeowner $25 to 
$75 a year, depending on seismic zones and types of home construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who refused to pay would face liens that could not be foreclosed by 
the state until the home is sold. Mobile homes and condominiums would not be 
covered. County tax collectors would collect the fees and the state Department 
of Housing and Community Affairs would administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Zaucha, a spokeswoman for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., objected 
that "the fee is really a tax increase that doesn't require a vote of the 
people." The former state earthquake insurance program, created after the 1989 
Loma Prieta earthquake, was repealed in 1993 after critics claimed it was 
bordering on insolvency and was giving the public a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program had been in place when the Northridge quake struck, Areias said 
it would have contained about $350 million, enough to give each of the 
estimated 60,000 to 70,000 Los Angeles-area homeowners who had damage a check 
for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry prefers a national natural disaster insurance recovery 
plan pending in Congress that would cover damage caused by earthquakes, 
hurricanes, tornadoes and volcanoes. It is sponsored by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta 
(D-San Jose). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't quarrel with the insurance industry wanting federal legislation," 
Areias said. "But they know and we know it's not going to happen. This is only 
a foot-dragging technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Berte, director of the state Consumer Services Agency, disagreed with 
Areias, saying the Wilson Administration is optimistic that the federal bill 
will become law. Deputy State Insurance Commissioner Masako Dolan said her 
boss, John Garamendi, a Democratic candidate for governor, also prefers the 
federal approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias' bill was defeated when five Democrats voted for it and three 
Republicans voted against it. Two Democrats and one Republican were absent when 
the vote was taken. Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills), whose 
district was hard-hit by the Northridge quake, cast one of the "no" votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As good as this bill sounds, I also support a federal program," Boland told 
her colleagues. "I don't think California can afford to do this alone. This 
bill would be fooling the public."

NEIGHBORHOOD UPROAR SPROUTS FROM TREE DISPUTE; SCENERY: NEW BOARD OF HOMEOWNERS 
ASSOCIATION ABRUPTLY ORDERS CUTTING OF 200 EUCALYPTUS THAT BLOCKED SOME OCEAN 
VIEWS. DEPUTIES ARE CALLED AFTER PROPERTY OWNERS' ANGER BOILS OVER. 
</P>

<P>
 A four-year dispute over blocked ocean views in a posh hilltop neighborhood 
has escalated into a mini-war after 200 eucalyptus trees were abruptly cut down 
by a homeowners association this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies responded Tuesday and Wednesday to reports of unrest in the 
151-home Potomac Landing community, where tree crews say they were shoved and 
threatened with a shotgun and where insults were exchanged between members of 
the Potomac Landing Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid for myself and my children," said Debra Marcus of Broadhorn Drive, 
who supports the tree removal. "There have been threats made by people around 
here. . . . There is an atmosphere of fear in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has long divided the community. Homeowners who say they paid 
up to $100,000 extra for distant ocean views -- which slowly disappeared as the 
trees grew to heights of 30 feet -- argued to have the trees cut down. 
</P>
<P>
 While people on the heights wanted the trees gone, residents living below 
reveled in the park-like atmosphere that the eucalyptus provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees were scattered along several streets, slopes and on people's 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 As is standard with homeowners groups, the association can perform maintenance 
on members' private property, association officials said. But some residents 
said the tree-cuttings went far beyond normal maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis boiled over when crews, under orders from the association, began 
felling the trees on Tuesday. The work was finished Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Pash, a Lanteen Circle resident, said her 10-year-old son came home from 
school Tuesday, crying. "I asked him what was wrong, and he said, 'My trees, my 
trees are gone.' They cut down his favorite climbing tree and did it 
deliberately in a way so nobody had a chance to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock between Potomac Landing homeowners was broken in February when a 
new homeowners association board was elected. The new majority decided to 
eliminate the trees quickly and quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threats of lawsuits had been made in the past," association President John 
Kay said Wednesday. "We thought this would be in the best interests of 
everybody, not just the select few who are upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay said the trees were cut down because they cost $9,000 annually to trim, 
many were rotting and considered a fire hazard, and "thirdly, blocked the views 
of a lot of people who paid a lot of money for those views." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay was accused by pro-tree residents of holding a clandestine gathering, but 
he said the board "had a closed-door meeting, not a secret meeting." He 
acknowledged that notices of the board session were not sent to association 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant number of the eucalyptus trees will be replaced by acacia 
saplings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new trees will grow, time will heal the wounds here," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, as Kay was being interviewed by a reporter, he was verbally 
accosted on the sidewalk by a group of angry residents who demanded an 
explanation for the mass tree removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just wanted to get rid of our trees behind our backs," one woman angrily 
told Kay. "Don't lie to us." 
</P>
<P>
 When Debra Marcus and her husband, Alan Marcus, came up behind Kay to speak in 
favor of the restored views and about increased hostility in the neighborhood, 
pro-tree residents redoubled their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have been threatened? Good, you should be threatened," a woman resident 
told Debra Marcus. "You lose what I've lost, then you can talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners were in tears on Wednesday over the fallen trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't see my decks before," said Judy Frugard, who now has 14 stumps 
on her property. "It was like living in a park setting. I hope this is illegal, 
what they have done, because if not, it's definitely immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Frugard said the first workers showed up mid-morning Tuesday "and five seconds 
after I noticed them, the first tree was gone. I went out there to stop them 
and they ignored me. We had absolutely no notice about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the neighborhood, other homeowners saw their trees disappearing and 
tried to halt the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Robinson, 68, said when he ran outside to protest, one of the workers 
approached him with "a vicious look and his chain saw running. I got scared, so 
I ran inside and grabbed my shotgun and went back out. But they knew it wasn't 
loaded because I pumped it a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
 A foreman for B & J Tree Service of Tustin had a different account of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, (Robinson) kind of wrapped himself around one of the trees," said the 
foreman, who asked not to be identified. "He went in his house and came back 
with the shotgun and started waving that around. He pointed that thing at me 
and I said, 'Hey, man, I'm just doing my job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Joe Davis confirmed that deputies had responded to a disturbance 
at the scene. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Former association board member Sheila Longerbone said she would have 
advocated "street by street removal, not all at one time. I didn't realize it 
would be so drastic a change here with all the trees gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Although morale "has gone to hell in a handbasket out here," she said, "two 
years from now, the neighborhood will be better off."

COUP BACKERS MAY HAVE 'HATCHED' U.S. HAITI PLAN; CARIBBEAN: THE POLICY, SINCE 
DISCARDED, CUT ARISTIDE'S AUTHORITY, LEFT MILITARY INTACT. U.S. ENVOY DENIES 
LINK TO PLOTTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 A controversial plan once pushed by the United States to settle the Haitian 
crisis by forcing major concessions from exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide was designed by supporters of a leader of the coup that overthrew him, 
say diplomats and political experts here. 
</P>
<P>
 In embracing the plan, which has since been discarded, the Clinton 
Administration and the United Nations threw over their previous policies on 
restoring Aristide to office, including much of the U.N.-brokered Governors 
Island agreement between Aristide and the military that ousted him. 
</P>
<P>
 That July, 1993, pact had called for the resignation of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
and his high command, reform of the military and separation of Haiti's army and 
police forces before Aristide returned. It foundered when the military 
repudiated it three months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan to break the ensuing stalemate "was hatched in early February" 
during a meeting at the home of coup supporter Fritz Mev, according to a 
Haitian political expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Mev's family backed the September, 1991, coup that overthrew Aristide and has 
since provided financial support to the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the meeting were key advisers to Port-au-Prince police 
chief Michel-Joseph Francois, who led the uprising against Aristide: his 
brother, Evans Francois, and Sen. Robert Monde, whom diplomats and other 
foreign officials describe as "a virtual employee" of the Mev family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian political expert said Monde drafted the plan, while Mev and Evans 
Francois made suggestions. The source's account was confirmed by another 
Haitian who knows what took place at the meeting; by diplomats and other 
foreign officials, and by U.S. officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But their account was disputed by President Clinton's special envoy on Haiti, 
Lawrence Pezzullo, who said in a telephone interview: "I would suggest that it 
does not reflect the events of the time. It just didn't happen that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The American ambassador to Haiti, William Swing, declined to respond to 
requests for an interview. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said he had no 
knowledge of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a senior State Department official, while not denying that a meeting 
involving the Mev family, Monde and Evans Francois took place, said such a 
discussion would have been just one step in a long and complicated process. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that the proposal originated at the meeting. Instead, he argued 
that it became clear as far back as October, when the Governors Island 
agreement was not implemented on schedule, that something had to be done to 
broaden the government in order to persuade the military and anti-Aristide 
forces to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, the official said, the process moved in fits and starts until 
February, when the proposal was finalized. He insisted that until it was made 
public, Aristide had agreed to its concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian and diplomatic sources say the Monde-drafted plan -- labeled a 
bipartisan Haitian legislative initiative -- was forcefully championed at the 
State Department by its chief expert on Haiti, Michael Kozak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozak knew where the plan had come from and about the involvement of police 
chief Francois' supporters, but he approved it in spite of that, the sources 
say. The senior State Department official did not challenge that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wonder what was really at work in Washington," said one diplomat 
from a country closely involved in the effort to restore Aristide to office. 
"Here is Kozak, who has spent a lot of time here and presumably knows that the 
military can't be trusted, accepting a proposal even when he knows it betrays 
such crucial needs as reforming the military." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Kozak apparently made his case well. President Clinton and U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali eventually adopted the plan virtually 
as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy not only failed to set a date for Aristide's return from exile 
but also called for him to make several major concessions that would have 
seriously reduced his governing authority. And it would have left most of the 
military, including Francois, in place and unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, who is widely considered the de facto co-leader of the current 
military regime along with Cedras, the army commander, was a key figure in the 
coup and acquired greater power afterward. U.S. officials have held him 
responsible in the past for running massive smuggling operations, including the 
narcotics trade, and for organizing and directing armed civilian groups that 
terrorize the population, particularly Aristide supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide quickly rejected the new policy. The dispute climaxed his acrimonious 
relationship with both the George Bush and Clinton administrations over the 
best way to restore democracy and return him to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Aristide announced that he was abrogating a 1981 treaty 
allowing the United States to board Haitian ships and to turn back their 
passengers immediately; diplomats said his decision was a result of his anger 
over the February proposal. The sources also blame the failure of a later, less 
drastic plan on the same furor. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption of the plan also ignited smoldering resentment and frustration within 
the U.S. Embassy here. Disagreement about both political and immigration 
policies prompted charges of disloyalty and an angry demand by a high-ranking 
diplomat that officials in the mission be punished for news leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. officials here who have expressed discontent, like the foreign 
diplomats and pro-democracy Haitian civilians who feel dismay over Washington's 
policies, blame Kozak's role in the affair. The Haitian political expert 
described it as "duplicitous." Another Haitian source said that at best Kozak 
gave the Haitian military yet another reason to discount American resolve to 
restore Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created a moral equivalency between Aristide and the military," said this 
Haitian critic, referring to Kozak's remark during the battle over the plan in 
February that "extremists on both sides" were scuttling it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That put Aristide on the same level as the killers," the Haitian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to explain U.S. acceptance of a plan that made so many concessions to 
the Haitian military, some officials say Kozak and other U.S. policy-makers 
decided that the only way to end the impasse was to exploit or create divisions 
within the military, to play Francois off against Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source, Francois agreed to force Cedras to leave if Aristide 
was pushed to drop his demands for the police chief's own removal and reform of 
the military, to name a new prime minister acceptable to his opponents and to 
extend amnesty to most military officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the February plan did not include those demands, and the United States 
and the United Nations stopped talking about them, even in private 
conversations with reporters, as vital conditions for restoring Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the fallout from the now-discarded plan seems to be another 
change in U.S. policy, or at least its public face. 
</P>
<P>
 After the loud failure of the plan and its even louder denunciation by 
Aristide, the U.S. Black Congressional Caucus demanded changes, particularly 
Pezzullo's resignation. Two leading human rights organizations accused the 
special envoy of developing a policy that put the Clinton Administration in 
league with "a murderous armed force." 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter to Clinton, Americas Watch and the National Coalition for 
Haitian Refugees said the Administration's recent policy "has tarnished your 
presidency and discredited your stated commitment to democracy and human rights 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Pezzullo, the letter said, has made "constant concessions to the Haitian 
military." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pezzullo said he knows of no plan to replace him, his departure could 
come at any time, officials say. His successor is likely to be Donald McHenry, 
a professor at Georgetown University in Washington and former ambassador to the 
United Nations.

WOMEN'S SCHOOL IN APPALACHIA LIGHTS A BEACON OF HOPE; ONE WOMAN'S PLIGHT HELPED 
LAUNCH THE NEW OPPORTUNITY SCHOOL IN KENTUCKY. IT BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM AND 
SELF-RELIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It started eight years ago with a personal crisis: a newly divorced woman 
desperately needed a fresh start. She had no money. She had no marketable 
skill. She had no confidence. And she had very little hope. 
</P>
<P>
 What she did have was a friend in Gurney Norman, a writer and English 
professor at the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1986, Norman related the woman's plight to Jane Stephenson at 
Berea College. Stephenson, the wife of Berea's president and an expert on adult 
education, went to work. Her efforts marked the beginning of the New 
Opportunity School for Women, which since has helped dozens of low-income women 
from southern Appalachia seize control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Cheryl Estep, who just completed the school's intensive 
three-week course in self-reliance and personal esteem: She is 35 and a 
grandmother. At 14 she dropped out of the eighth grade in Carter County, Ky., 
got married and had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 When she began working for a high school equivalency certificate in 1992, she 
hid her books so that her disapproving husband would not know she was studying 
and hoping to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But two days after enrolling at the New Opportunity School in January, Estep 
-- feeling lonely, out of place and frightened -- packed her belongings and got 
ready to go home. A telephone call from a friend convinced her to stay. By the 
end of the session, she says, she was a changed woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she was at the Carter County Adult Education Center studying again. 
"My husband is having a hard time right now accepting the change in me," she 
said. "But I can't go back to the way I was. I never will. I'm going on to 
school, and nobody is going to stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the New Opportunity School opened its doors with a grant from the 
Educational Foundation of America, 152 women -- nearly three-fourths of them 
from families with an income of less than $10,000 a year -- have completed the 
course. At last count, more than 70% of them had gone on to find jobs or enroll 
in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Estep's story is typical. One woman who earned $2 an hour folding clothes in a 
laundry before she went to the school is now a respiratory therapist in a 
hospital. She no longer receives food stamps, and she has moved out of public 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Young of Grayson, Ky., who was "digging ditches and painting fences" two 
years ago, is studying biology at Ashland Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann Hall, who went to the New Opportunity School after being widowed in her 
mid-50s, operates a state center preparing students for high school equivalency 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Azee was unemployed and living with her parents when she entered the New 
Opportunity School at the age of 29. She went home and spent a year and a half 
studying for college admission; now she is a sophomore at Berea and a member of 
the Student Senate. She entered her third semester with a 3.3 grade point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went home from the New Opportunity School a very, very different person," 
Azee said. "I felt like I could conquer the world." More than anything else, 
the course is designed to resuscitate this kind of confidence and self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The school day begins at 6:30 a.m. and ends after midnight. There are group 
and individual sessions with a counselor, lectures on the careers of exemplary 
mountain women, writing exercises, a daily class in Appalachian literature and 
an introduction to computers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoons, the students report to offices and businesses in the 
community to work as interns. On weekends, there are visits to museums in 
Cincinnati and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the women spend hours talking among themselves -- 
time, they say, when they come to share their innermost feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual, Stephenson says, for women to come to the New Opportunity 
School in the face of discouragement. While children are usually supportive, 
mothers and husbands often object. And some marriages are too frail to survive 
the wife's transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, who runs two sessions a year, has explored the possibility of 
exporting her program to urban settings across the country. And word of the 
program's success has brought inquiries from activists interested in emulating 
the Appalachian program for poor women of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip.

TEXAS LAW STEEPED IN FRONTIER TRADITION TAKING SOME SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a warm August evening in 1888 when distillery owner John Laws shot dead 
a man he caught stealing two bottles of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws was convicted of murder. But a Texas appeals court overturned the verdict 
under a state law that allows residents to kill to protect their property at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 A Houston grand jury, relying on the century-old law, refused last month to 
indict a homeowner who fatally shot a man who appeared to be stealing his truck 
in the middle of the night. The slain man, wrecker driver Tommy Dean Morris, 
was in fact attempting to legally repossess the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying touched a nerve in Texas, the only state that gives citizens such 
wide latitude to kill to protect not only life but also property. The question 
-- asked by Morris' widow among others -- is whether a frontier-era law 
intended to corral cattle thieves has a place in modern society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we have to shoot before we ask questions or risk becoming a 
victim," says Pam Lychner, president of Justice for All, a victim's advocacy 
group in Houston. "The police can't protect us all, so you have to be prepared 
to protect yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 But such shoot-first thinking, critics argue, allows deadly force to counter 
such minor property crimes as criminal mischief or theft at night -- in effect, 
capital punishment for a relatively minor infraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone can take the hood ornament off of my car, or write a socially 
unacceptable word on my mailbox at night, and I can kill him," says Robert 
Schuwerk, a University of Houston Law Center professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law made sense 100 years ago when, if someone took your horse, you could 
die in the middle of nowhere," says Neil McCabe, who teaches criminal law at 
South Texas College of Law in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Texas isn't a frontier state any more. You don't have to take matters 
into your own hands. The Legislature really needs to re-weigh the competing 
values of property versus life." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Texans, such arguments are a hard sell amid continuing crime fears. 
Supporters of the law are so legion that when legislators revamped the Texas 
penal code last year, the section on deadly force remained untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall it getting any discussion at all," said one of the code's 
authors, state Sen. John Whitmire of Houston. "It's a time-honored Texas 
tradition to protect yourself at home at night." 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary who works in Huntsville, where the state prison is located, seems 
to speak for many when she says: "We don't molly-coddle robbers down here. 
Shoot, I worked all my life to get what I have, and I'm going to protect what's 
mine. Someone comes on my property and tries to take something, I'm going to 
shoot them." 
</P>
<P>
 A month before Morris was killed, Scottish tourist Andrew De Vries became lost 
late one night in an upscale Houston neighborhood. He climbed over a fence and 
began shouting and banging on the door, frightening homeowner Jeffrey Agee. 
</P>
<P>
 Agee killed De Vries with two shots from a .25 caliber pistol. A grand jury 
refused to indict him for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a civilized world, you can't just shoot people you find in your yard," 
says Dallas lawyer Windle Turley, who is representing De Vries' widow in a 
civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas law not only allows deadly force to prevent a theft at night, but also 
to kill the fleeing thief -- if the owner believes the stolen goods cannot be 
recovered any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, by contrast, deadly force may only be used in life-threatening 
situations, and never to merely protect property. 
</P>
<P>
 But with crime listed in opinion polls as one of America's top concerns, Texas 
legislators are not likely to revise the controversial statute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a siege mentality, a feeling that crime is omnipresent, it could 
happen to any one of us at any time," says law professor Schuwerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repo case flares up and people say, 'That's a shame, the innocent repo 
man died.' " But as in war, when a church is bombed instead of the artillery 
emplacement, says Schuwerk, "people tend to consider it collateral damage."

SERB SOFTENING SEEN IN VISIT BY MEDIATORS; BOSNIA: RUSSIA'S SPECIAL ENVOY IS 
ALSO RECEIVED. HE SAYS REBELS PROMISED TO END THE SIEGE OF GORAZDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the first signs that Bosnian Serbs may relax their campaign of belligerence 
that followed NATO air strikes, two Western mediators were received by rebel 
leaders Wednesday, and Russia's special envoy said he had won a Serbian promise 
to end the siege of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin clattered in a grimy armored 
personnel carrier between this government-held capital and the rebel stronghold 
in Pale, 10 miles to the east, in an effort to get Bosnian peace talks back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've got a commitment from the Serbs that it's not their intention to 
resume fighting, to attack, to take Gorazde or to shell the town," Churkin said 
after briefing U.N. military and Western diplomatic officials on his talks with 
Serbian leaders in Pale. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin was the only foreign mediator allowed across rebel siege lines a day 
earlier, when Serbs angered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombings 
of their tank positions in Gorazde put up booby traps and barricades around 
U.N. encampments to make hostages of the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 After long talks with Serbian leaders in Pale, Churkin spoke optimistically 
about the prospects for a cease-fire in Gorazde and added that he could also 
foresee a truce covering all of Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow the Muslim-led 
government and Serbian nationalists to work out details of an ethnic division. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite describing the situation in Gorazde as tense, the Russian special 
envoy to the Balkans said there was understanding on both sides of the conflict 
"that in order to move onto other fronts, on other issues, we need to be sure 
about the situation in Gorazde." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say whether Serbian rebel leader Radovan Karadzic or the 
hard-line military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, was willing to withdraw to the 
lines they held around Gorazde before this latest offensive, as ordered by U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs have captured about 15% of the U.N. "safe haven" since March 30 in an 
offensive that torpedoed cease-fire talks and prompted the U.N. commander for 
Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, to call for NATO air strikes on Sunday 
and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs have threatened to shoot down NATO warplanes and have condemned the 
U.N. mission as an enemy. A marked increase in sniping from Serbian positions 
was also noted Wednesday; at least four large-caliber shells detonated in 
Sarajevo, representing the worst cease-fire violations in nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.N. officials and Charles Redman, the U.S. special envoy, had planned 
to visit Pale on Tuesday to discuss the standoff with the Serbian leaders but 
were informed by telephone that they would not be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But two diplomats who spent 16 months trying to broker a peace settlement in 
Geneva were allowed across the armed checkpoints that separate government and 
rebel territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know us. I think they want to keep peace negotiations going," said Lord 
Owen, the European Union mediator for the mothballed Geneva talks. Owen and his 
U.N. partner in the peace talks, former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, planned to return to Sarajevo today after overnighting in Pale. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 Bosnians, mostly Muslim civilians, are dead or missing due 
to fighting and "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gorazde, Fahrudin Bazic, a local official reached via ham radio from 
Zagreb, Croatia, said the situation remained desperate. But he said residents' 
spirits were lifted after the NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are absolutely satisfied with air strikes and want more air strikes as 
long as tanks are on the outskirts of town," he said, adding: "The mood among 
the people is that they are prepared to defend, to the last, what they've got. 
There had been some doubt before any sort of NATO intervention. But in the last 
two days, the two interventions improved the mood of the people in the city. 
Trust has returned (in) the world community and the world order, the U.S. and 
the rest."

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.N. FACEOFF WITH SERBS IS A HIGH-STAKES GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In military doublespeak, almost 5,000 troops of the U.N. Protection Force are 
trapped at their patrol sites by "an administrative matter." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the peacekeepers and all other foreigners here are being held 
hostage by Bosnian Serb rebels who have been angered by NATO air strikes and 
emboldened to test the limits of the West's newfound resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has 
refused to make an issue of the blockade shackling his troops, gambling that, 
by brushing off the retaliation, he can compel the Serbs to back down without 
their losing face. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rose's career as a special forces officer is replete with successes in 
such volatile, high-stakes faceoffs, diplomats and aid officials more familiar 
with the psychology of the Serbian rebellion fear the general's 
business-as-usual strategy may be playing straight into the rebels' plans. 
</P>
<P>
 To the question of who can hold out longer, the hostage peacekeepers or the 
disgruntled Serbs, few here doubt the ability of the rebel gunmen to bear 
hardship, especially when buoyed by the propagandistic message of their leaders 
that the West is afraid to strike again. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after bombs were dropped on Serbian tank units attacking the 
U.N.-designated "safe haven" of Gorazde, Rose and other top U.N. officials took 
pains to characterize the air strikes as moves to protect U.N. troops rather 
than the embattled and outgunned people of the mostly Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 All top U.N. officials here have expressed the hope that no further resort to 
"air support" will be needed; Rose ruled it out completely as a means of 
breaking the blockade of nearly half his troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the air strikes Sunday and Monday, the rebels have detained U.N. troops 
and observers and isolated at least 4,700 soldiers by mining their patrol 
sites, sealing off Sarajevo and posting gunmen outside the barracks of smaller 
units to keep the soldiers under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic pulled back 
heavy weapons in February after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
threatened to bomb any artillery left within 12 miles of the capital. But the 
rebels, still armed with machine guns, grenades, mines and mortars, remain 
deployed in a strangling cordon around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a sharp increase in small-arms fire late Wednesday, and at least 
four large-caliber shell impacts underscored the rebels' anger at having been 
targeted for air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and the hard-line Bosnian Serb military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
have proclaimed the U.N. mission an enemy of the Serbian people and threatened 
to shoot down NATO planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our agreements so far, and our good manners which we displayed out of our 
trust in you, are now a thing of the past, since we are forced to regard the 
behavior of (the U.N. peacekeeping troops) as a potentially hostile force," 
Karadzic wrote in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 After accusing the international community of intervening on behalf of the 
Muslim-led government, he informed the U.N. chief: "You will understand that we 
can no longer cooperate with this (U.N. force) command which ordered the 
bombardment." Karadzic sought to justify the blockade as necessary to contain 
an adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from reacting with threats of further punishment, both military and 
civilian U.N. officials have allowed Serbian leaders in nearby Pale to call the 
shots as to whom they will talk with and what steps need to be taken to reopen 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After the commander of U.N. forces in the former Yugoslav republics, French 
Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, and the chief U.N. civilian official, Yasushi Akashi 
of Japan, were rebuffed when they attempted to call on Karadzic on Tuesday, two 
mediators who earlier brokered a plan that would allow the rebels to keep half 
of Bosnia and one day join with a Greater Serbia were summoned back to the 
diplomatic fore. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall of European Union mediator Lord Owen and his U.N. counterpart, 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, risked sending a signal to the Serbs that they can 
dictate the terms of a settlement from their commanding position of having 
already conquered more than 70% of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers here, particularly those in Rose's command, see the brash 
statements and behavior as bluster. They count on time and the revised 
diplomatic roster to persuade the Serbs that their best interests will be if 
they resume negotiations on an overall peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But others worry that banking on self-interest and logical behavior may be a 
formula for disaster in a war sparked by vitriolic propaganda, which has 
demonized all non-Serbs and created a nationalist mind-set that life for Serbs 
will be secure only in an ethnically pure state. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen boast that they would rather be reduced to eating grass and 
living in squalor than share land and citizenship with the Muslims, Croats and 
Albanians who they claim endanger them throughout the former Yugoslav 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of bombs dropped by NATO warplanes are unlikely to terrify the 
rebels into knuckling under at the paralyzed peace talks, one Western diplomat 
here noted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, he said, unless the United Nations and NATO are prepared to 
inflict serious damage on the Serbian war machine, an endless series of 
military adventures can be expected against the scattered and poorly protected 
Muslim enclaves.

AFL-CIO TO FIGHT RENEWAL OF CHINA TRADE BENEFITS; LABOR: LANE KIRKLAND SAYS 
UNION WILL BACK REVOCATION OF BEIJING'S MOST-FAVORED-NATION STATUS. STATEMENT 
COMPLICATES ADMINISTRATION'S DILEMMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a serious new complication for the Clinton Administration's China policy, 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland indicated Wednesday that organized labor will 
strongly oppose renewal of the Beijing regime's preferred trade benefits when 
they expire this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration needs the support of organized labor to win enactment of 
its health care plan and other elements of its domestic agenda. As a result, 
the White House may be reluctant to run afoul of the AFL-CIO on China policy, 
as it did last year when President Clinton lobbied hard for support of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are losing jobs to China," Kirkland said at a news conference. The 
$20-billion-a-year U.S. deficit in trade with China "is a measure of the 
dimensions of that," he said. "But jobs is not the touchstone issue in itself. 
The issue with us is how our brothers and sisters in China who work for a 
living are treated." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by organized labor was the second development in the last two 
weeks that appears to make it more difficult for China to win an unconditional 
extension of its most-favored-nation trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Chinese authorities rounded up some prominent dissidents, thus 
undercutting arguments that the human rights climate inside China is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two weeks, the Administration has been quietly studying four or 
five options on trade benefits for China next year. They range from wholesale 
renewal or revocation of the trade privileges to a possible intermediate step, 
in which the benefits would be preserved for private enterprises but ended for 
products of Chinese state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Any country with most-favored-nation trade status is entitled to export its 
goods into the United States under the same low tariff rates as other countries 
with MFN status. China, which has had these benefits since 1980, now exports 
more than $30 billion a year in goods to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beijing government has said that if China loses the benefits, it will 
retaliate against American companies that sell to China or do business there. 
As a result, many U.S. firms have warned that cutting off China's trade 
privileges could, in the end, lead to a loss of jobs for American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Kirkland -- whose influence in Washington was demonstrated when 
he was seated next to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the President's 
State of the Union address -- angrily denounced the American business community 
for making these claims about China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that American corporations give a tinker's damn about jobs 
in the United States, and any representations they make about their deep and 
dying concerns over American jobs ought to be taken with a ton of salt," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear that the soft underbelly of freedom, American corporate 
enterprise, is doing its level best to serve the interests of the dictators and 
the totalitarian regime in China. . . . There are lobbyists lobbying hard on 
China's behalf for the sake of their own narrow pocketbook interests and for 
the right to continue to abuse and exploit labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Since China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tian An Men 
Square, the AFL-CIO has been increasingly active in China policy. Organized 
labor opposed the George Bush Administration's efforts to reconcile with 
Beijing, and it has helped support those dissidents trying to organize Chinese 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Kirkland made it plain that labor's opposition to MFN renewal 
for China this year will go beyond its past efforts. "We intend to participate 
aggressively in that debate" over China's trade benefits, he said. He 
maintained that China "has not met the most minimum conditions for satisfying 
the requirements of the granting of MFN treatment to their country." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Clinton imposed a series of specific human rights conditions that 
China must satisfy before Secretary of State Warren Christopher will recommend 
renewal of MFN status. These conditions cover issues such as the use of forced 
labor in Chinese prisons, jamming of Voice of America radio broadcasts, release 
of political prisoners and China's treatment of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's trade benefits for 
another year. At the same time, he must decide what the rules should be for any 
further extensions of MFN status next year.

SETTLEMENTS BLOCK PEACE, ARAFAT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Addressing a packed chamber of European lawmakers, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 
said Wednesday that lasting Middle East peace is impossible as long as Israeli 
settlements remain in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israeli settlements have always been . . . a major obstacle on the road 
of peace," he said. "Today, and I say it with regret, they have become an 
alternative to peace. Peace cannot be achieved . . . as long as these extremist 
hotbeds lie at every corner of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 But at a news conference after the speech, the leader of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization seemed to step away from his formal remarks, 
concentrating his criticism on the expansion of existing settlements, which he 
said violates last September's agreement on the terms of limited Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want an accurate, honest implementation of the (agreement), and that means 
no increase in the number of settlements, no enlarging of settlements," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 130 Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, home to 
about 120,000 Israeli nationals. Tension between Israeli settlers and 
Palestinians has been extremely high since the peace agreement was signed and 
since the Feb. 25 massacre by an extremist settler of about 30 Palestinians in 
a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron temporarily halted the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat said further delays in implementing last September's peace accords 
would be "catastrophic. . . . Leaving things to move as they did since last 
September will lead us all to a catastrophe which will kill any remaining hope 
(Palestinians) . . . might still have in the peace process itself." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments Wednesday came on the date agreed to last September in Washington 
for completion of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town 
of Jericho, the first two areas to receive a degree of Palestinian self-rule. 
The failure to meet this deadline is a clear setback for Arafat; he admitted 
that here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is April 13, and what can I say to the Palestinian people today?" he 
asked rhetorically during the question period. "It's this delay which gives the 
extremists the opportunity to have good reasons to act." 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke only hours after six people died in a bombing attack in the northern 
Israeli town of Hadera. It was the latest in a series of terrorist attacks that 
have shaken, but not yet derailed, the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of a 50-minute speech and half an hour of questions, Arafat 
often referred to "extremists on both sides" and used the word "regrettable" to 
describe the Hadera attack. "I don't know who carried it out, but it was 
carried out against innocent Israelis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were made to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, 
a 32-nation organization with little direct political power that, in the 
post-World War II period, has nonetheless been a leading defender of human 
rights. The assembly is made up of more than 450 elected representatives from 
the member states' parliaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention to Arafat's appearance was distracted in part by the presence of 
another controversial political figure in the chamber -- Russian 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, visiting as part of an observer 
delegation from his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what might appear to be shared anti-Jewish sentiments, the two seemed 
to have little interest in each other. At a reception Tuesday evening at the 
Russian Consulate, Zhirinovsky dismissed the PLO leader, stating, "Arafat is a 
terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
 As Arafat entered the parliamentary chamber before his speech Wednesday, 
Zhirinovsky was virtually the only person in the room who remained seated. He 
then walked out for about 10 minutes shortly after Arafat began speaking.

NEWS ANALYSIS; NUMBING ATTENTION TO DETAIL BEHIND STYMIED PROGRESS ON 
ISRAEL-PLO PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed their historic 
agreement for Palestinian self-rule last September, it envisioned a full accord 
to implement the plan by Dec. 13. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat started checking 
real estate, announcing he would move his household goods into the West Bank in 
January. Israel's last troops were to pull out of Jericho and the Gaza Strip by 
what then seemed a distant April deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 It came and went Wednesday without the signing of a final accord or the 
hoped-for withdrawal of Israeli soldiers. An agreement is still at least weeks 
away, both sides agree. And Arafat, who hasn't moved his headquarters from 
Tunis, Tunisia, is left fretting. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? Whose fault was it? 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiators wind up six months of talks without an agreement on Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, both sides are looking uneasily to what lies 
ahead for peace in the Middle East: If Jericho is this hard, what will happen 
when the discussions move to Jerusalem? If negotiators can't agree on zoning in 
the Gaza Strip, what will they do about Jewish settlers in the West Bank? 
</P>
<P>
 From the promising beginning of a handshake on the White House lawn, the 
Middle East peace negotiations have turned into a nightmare of detailed, 
point-by-point arguments that have stretched into the wee hours and made the 
talks last for weeks and weeks. Their numbing complexity and sludge-like 
progress -- even as violence erupts daily and blood continues to spill in the 
occupied territories -- point up, say those closest to the talks, the 
unprecedented nature of the negotiations and the fact that their outcome, for 
both sides, is a matter of political survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of how delegates took months to negotiate international border 
crossings into Gaza and Jericho from Egypt and Jordan shows the excruciating 
detail that has stymied progress on a final Israel-PLO agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel from the beginning said it should retain total control of international 
borders. The PLO said Palestinians should not have to go through Israeli border 
guards to get into their new autonomous areas. 
</P>
<P>
 What about terrorists sneaking in? Israel asked. Let Israeli guards watch a 
video monitor or stand behind a glass window, the Palestinians countered. Then 
came the debate: What color should the glass be? 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent a long time on that one," said one diplomat ruefully. "Then 
toilets were mentioned. Whether there would be separate bathrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides tend to blame each other for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with all the blood that has been shed in Israel and the occupied 
territories since the talks began -- including the Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 
Palestinians praying in a Hebron mosque and Wednesday's bomb attack on a bus in 
northern Israel that killed five Israelis, the second such incident in a week 
-- it is, perhaps, remarkable that the talks, scheduled to resume on Sunday, 
continue at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts now say it was unrealistic to expect that such a 
mind-boggling array of detail could be resolved in the few months envisioned in 
the September Declaration of Principles. The negotiations themselves are 
unprecedented, involving not state-to-state negotiations over a clearly defined 
piece of occupied territory -- as in Israel's talks with Egypt and now Syria -- 
or even the South African example of new rights for a distinct population 
within the borders of a single state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us two years to negotiate with the Israelis, and there were no gray 
areas," said an Egyptian official of Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. 
"These negotiations are much more difficult because they really have to resolve 
fundamental insecurities on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, negotiators and diplomats following the talks said the 
fundamental stumbling block has been the different perceptions that Israel and 
the Palestinians took to the bargaining table from the outset: The PLO saw 
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho as a steppingstone to an independent 
Palestinian state. Israel did not, and has insisted, in the name of security, 
on maintaining a measure of control over virtually every facet of Palestinian 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been continual head-butting -- and not only on major security 
issues like the size of the Palestinian police force or of the Jericho area 
that would come under Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the talks exploded on the issue of refrigerators. Seeking to 
work out a customs agreement, Israel wanted to impose quality control 
restrictions to prevent cheap refrigerators from flooding into Gaza and Jericho 
and making their way into the Israeli market. Palestinians said their citizens 
couldn't always afford nice refrigerators and that their government should be 
able to decide what is imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Water is also in dispute, primarily because of a wellhead owned by a Jewish 
settlement in Jericho. That gave rise to all sorts of questions: Will the new 
Palestinian authority have control of the well? Can the Palestinians cut off 
the water? What authority collects the fees? 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties are even more acute because the delegations sometimes can't 
even agree among themselves; they spend hours formulating negotiating positions 
before launching talks with the other side. Talks have been further set back 
when the delegations have reached an accord, only to see either Arafat or Rabin 
nix it when it was put in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the tentative agreement spanned 150 pages of details. Since 
then, the two sides have cut it down considerably and drawn up annexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the delays have been due 
primarily to Israeli "overprotectiveness" on security issues related to Jewish 
settlements and any sign of Palestinian sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues really have to do with our insistence on what we consider the 
minimum rules of self-government," he said. ". . . They can put it the other 
way around by saying we are stonewalling. . . . But to us these are minimum 
demands that, if they don't respond to, we will not be able to make any sort of 
proper government." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has from the beginning emphasized that it is more important to reach a 
good agreement as opposed to a speedy one.

TERROR ENGULFS RWANDA'S CAPITAL, FEAR RADIATES ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One week after Rwanda's president died in an apparent assassination, this 
Central African country has become a horrifying study in self-immolation. 
Terror has taken over on the streets of Kigali, the capital, and across the 
rolling green countryside where streams of refugees are fleeing the carnage 
that has claimed thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Kigali remains the terrifying domain of swaggering young men with the 
arrogance of youth, plenty of weapons and, often, cheap liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most daring citizens venture into the streets to seek out food, which 
is fast running out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Red Cross has worked feverishly to dispose of hundreds of 
corpses, bodies were scattered along the capital's thoroughfares Wednesday. 
Machete-wielding gangs followed by hordes of kids broke into shops and looted 
goods in broad daylight, sometimes right under the noses of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the approximately 15 miles leading to the city center, there were 
impromptu army roadblocks nearly every hundred feet. They were manned by men, 
young and old, in uniform or in ragged civilian clothes -- all armed with a 
variety of weapons, including machetes, knives, bows and arrows, automatic 
rifles and grenade launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 At many of these checkpoints, passengers of cars had been pulled out, robbed 
and often killed -- if their occupants were Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same road, heading away from Kigali, were thousands of poor refugees, 
their small bundles of belongings on their heads and backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, one man walked, clutching two cabbages, as his children trailed 
behind him carrying flimsy mattresses on their heads. Most refugees seemed to 
be less in a panic than in a daze. One man had his head wrapped in filthy 
bandages. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees trudged through a countryside of banana trees, coffee plants and 
sugar cane -- the almost surrealistically lush site of so much killing in the 
past three decades of Hutu-Tutsi feuding. RWANDA

GERMAN ADMITS FIREBOMBING THAT KILLED 5 IMMIGRANT WOMEN, CHILDREN; COURTS: 
UNEMPLOYED RIGHTIST APOLOGIZES TO FAMILY AS TRIAL BEGINS. CO-DEFENDANTS SNICKER 
DURING CONFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the opening day of his murder trial Wednesday, an unemployed German 
rightist confessed to a firebombing that killed five Turkish immigrant women 
and girls last year in the worst of a wave of hate crimes since German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 Markus Gartmann, one of four defendants in the arson and murder trial, told 
his victims' family in a halting voice that he was "very sorry" and "infinitely 
ashamed" for the attack in Solingen, a western German city whose name has since 
become synonymous with racist violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartmann's co-defendants shook their heads and snickered during his 
confession. Gartmann, a 24-year-old former member of the extreme-right German 
People's Union, added that "the slogans of the right lead to hate and 
inhumanity, and all of us (defendants) here are the result." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited trial began amid heavy security in a packed courtroom in the 
western city of Duesseldorf. The defendants were flanked by guards, and 
observers were frisked and combed with metal detectors upon entering the 
windowless court. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, demonstrators held banners saying "Ban All Neo-Fascist Groups" and 
"Don't Forget Solingen," but although officials had feared violence, none was 
reported. Extra police units had been put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Bonn, however, unknown assailants tossed another firebomb at the home of 
asylum seekers from Africa, Afghanistan and Turkey shortly after midnight 
Wednesday. The bottle of gasoline exploded on the steps of the home in the town 
of Windeck, but no one was injured in what police presumed was a racist attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solingen killings on May 29, 1993, set off protests by thousands of Turks 
in Germany and brought international condemnation to a country still struggling 
with its Nazi history. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-foreigner sentiment festered into a rash of attacks after reunification 
in 1990. Solingen was a copy of an attack in the northern city of Moelln the 
previous November in which a Turkish grandmother and two girls died when their 
home was torched. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors assert that the four Solingen defendants set fire to the Genc 
family home after they had attended a party in town and fought with foreigners 
whom they mistook for Turks. Two women and three girls, ages 4, 9 and 13, died 
in the fire. Three others, including a 6-month-old baby, were hospitalized with 
serious burns. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen relatives of the victims watched the beginning of the trial, 
often on the verge of tears. The Genc family had lived in Solingen for decades 
before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartmann, shaken in court, cut off his testimony before giving details of the 
assault and is scheduled to continue today. He already had confessed in a 
letter to the Genc family in January and faces life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant, Christian Reher, 17, earlier had confessed to the attack, 
but he refused to testify in court. He said he would give his name but not 
answer any questions. Reher and Felix Koehnen, 16, who maintains his innocence, 
are charged as juveniles and face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The 
fourth defendant, Christian Buchholz, 20, also has denied he took part in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Dirk Fernholz told the panel of judges that the defendants were 
rightists who committed the crime out of "hatred for foreigners, particularly 
Turks." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Fernholz said the defendants "saw themselves as 
rightists and associated with slogans such as 'Get Rid of Foreigners' and 
'Germany for Germans.' " He said they were drunk when they made the attack.

 Bank customers cleared out safe deposit boxes, businesses shut their doors and 
residents fled their homes in Valley Park, Mo., as the Meramec River flowed 
into the streets for the third time in a year.All across eastern and central 
Missouri, the spring of 1994 was beginning to look a lot like the summer of 
1993. Volunteers piled up sandbags, and evacuees camped out in churches and 
schools. Streams also were out of their banks from Oklahoma to West Virginia. 
Rescue workers in West Virginia carried a woman in labor a half-mile through 
high water. Six flood-related deaths were reported, four in Missouri.

 A millionaire investor and former Ross Perot adviser beat political brawler 
Jim Mattox to become Texas Democrats' candidate for the U.S. Senate. Richard 
Fisher will face Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in the fall.With all but 
three precincts counted, Fisher had 54% of the vote to 46% for Mattox. In other 
races, the GOP chose two U.S. House candidates: Jo Baylor and Bobby Ortiz; the 
Democrats picked Ken Bentsen, nephew of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. And 
Democrats in Houston rejected as Harris County party leader a transsexual 
ex-convict. Leslie Elaine Perez lost to David Mincberg. Perez came within hours 
of the electric chair for a 1961 murder conviction that was overturned because 
of suppressed evidence. Perez had a sex-change operation after her 1971 parole.

 The space shuttle Endeavour scanned Earth with powerful radar eyes for a fifth

even cities buried for centuries in sand. Endeavour was 138 miles high in the 
sky and circling the globe once every 89 minutes in pursuit of data on natural 
and human-induced environmental changes, NASA officials at the Kennedy Space 
Center said. During a pass over the Persian Gulf, the crew pointed the 
$384-million Space Radar Laboratory at southern Oman in hopes of imaging a lost 
city beneath the desert sands.

COOPER'S HEALTH PLAN WOULD BOOST DEFICIT BY $150 BILLION, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nearly completed analysis by the Congressional Budget Office indicates that 
Rep. Jim Cooper's health care bill -- the chief rival to President Clinton's 
plan -- would increase the deficit by at least $150 billion over six years, 
according to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the congressional agency that estimates the cost of legislation 
would be a major blow to proponents of Cooper's "managed competition" approach 
to health care reform.The agency also has found that about 25 million people 
could remain uninsured under his plan, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel strongly that our bill will not add to the deficit," Cooper said 
Wednesday night. "When has the federal government ever gotten the health care 
spending right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, said he had not seen the CBO draft and he 
believes a CBO analysis of an early version of his bill drastically 
underestimated the savings from the increased competition among doctors and 
hospitals that his plan would put in place.

TOBACCO EXECUTIVE WROTE HOW TO BOOST NICOTINE LEVELS; HEALTH: THE 1981 REPORT 
RELEASED BY A CONGRESSIONAL CRITIC CONTRADICTS INDUSTRY'S POSITION. THE AUTHOR 
SAYS AN ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION IS BEING DRAWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The war against tobacco escalated Wednesday with the release of documents that 
appear to contradict the industry's oft-stated insistence that it does not 
manipulate nicotine levels in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Capitol Hill's leading tobacco critic 
and chairman of a key House subcommittee, released a 1981 report written by a 
tobacco company executive describing how higher nicotine levels can be achieved 
in cigarettes by using specific blends of tobacco, and suggesting that these 
blends should be added to low-tar cigarettes to significantly enhance their 
nicotine content. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this same official, Alexander W. Spears, vice chairman and chief 
operating officer for Lorillard Tobacco Co., said in congressional testimony on 
March 25 that "we do not set nicotine levels for particular brands of 
cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been an especially controversial one because of the highly 
addictive nature of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again tobacco industry representatives have not only withheld 
information but they have misrepresented the truth," Waxman said at a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spears said in a statement that Waxman "made a serious error in reasoning 
after reading my 1981 paper -- that is, he assumed that cigarettes with higher 
concentrations of nicotine in the tobacco result in higher yields of nicotine 
in tobacco smoke. . . . That assumption is incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, after pressure from Congress, the tobacco industry Wednesday 
released a heretofore secret list of chemical additives in cigarettes. R.J. 
Reynolds, which disseminated the list on behalf of six major U.S. companies, 
said in a statement that the additives "are virtually the same as those found 
in many everyday foods and are not hazardous under the conditions of use." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim O'Hara, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration -- which is 
studying the issue of whether cigarettes should be regulated as drugs -- said 
that the industry was, in effect, "comparing apples with oranges" by saying 
that the ingredients were safe because they were routinely added to foods. 
</P>
<P>
 In foods, such additives "are not burned or inhaled," O'Hara said. "This 
doesn't say they are safe -- or unsafe," he added. "It just doesn't speak to 
the safety issue at all when these additives are used in cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been 
studying cigarette additives, said that the list is difficult to assess without 
knowing the specific amounts that are added or the recipes of individual 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the information we have, we can't come to any conclusions," said 
Kent Taylor, a spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears, who is scheduled to appear today with other high-ranking tobacco 
industry officials before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health 
and the environment, which is chaired by Waxman, was specific in his 1981 
article. He described how nicotine levels could be heightened in low-tar 
cigarettes by using more of the tobaccos with higher nicotine levels in the 
blending process. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman said that "the American people are entitled to know what's going on 
here. How do the tobacco companies maintain nicotine in tobacco at sufficient 
levels to sustain addiction? What other methods are used to control nicotine 
levels? The time for straight answers is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Spears on Wednesday disputed allegations by Waxman and by the FDA 
commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, that companies may be adding nicotine to 
cigarettes and called tobacco blending "a centuries-old process that is clearly 
documented in the published literature." 
</P>
<P>
 The claims made by Waxman are "based on misinformation and misunderstandings," 
Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the 1981 article was meant to analyze trends "occurring in the 
market at that time and concluded that nicotine levels were higher in the very 
low tar and nicotine-yield cigarettes on a sales-weighted basis and that this 
was occurring because of blending." 
</P>
<P>
 In releasing its additives list, the industry said that about 99% of U.S. 
non-menthol cigarettes, by weight, contain primarily tobacco, water, sugars, 
glycerin, propylene glycol, licorice, cocoa and additional flavors, with 
tobacco about 90% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Some specific ingredients that have come under question -- among them ethyl 
furoate, megastigmatrienone, maltitol and methoprene -- occur naturally in 
foods or have been approved by the FDA for use in foods, the industry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every ingredient on the list has been reviewed at the industry's request by 
an independent panel of expert toxicologists," R.J. Reynolds said. "Their 
finding was that . . . every one . . . (is) safe in the amounts used." 
Cigarette Additives 
</P>
<P>
 The eight chemicals among cigarette additives most questioned by tobacco 
opponents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Megastigmatrienone: a flavoring tobacco companies contend is found naturally 
in grapefruit juice and considered safe by the food industry. The Food and Drug 
Administration couldn't confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dehydromenthofurolactone: a flavoring tobacco companies say is found in 
peppermint and considered safe by the food industry. FDA couldn't confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethyl furoate: found naturally in coffee, kiwi and peanuts. FDA hasn't 
formally ruled on the issue, but said the food industry considers it safe. But 
a toxicologist last week said the chemical can cause liver damage in laboratory 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maltitol: a sweetener used in chewing gum and diabetic candy. The food 
industry considers it safe, but the FDA hasn't ruled on a petition questioning 
the safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sclareolide: a synthetic form of a naturally occurring tobacco element. The 
food industry considers it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco extract: used to boost flavor of reconstituted tobacco; companies 
say it does contain a small amount of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ammonia: a processing aid. FDA considers certain forms of ammonia safe in 
foods but couldn't comment on the type in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Methoprene: an insecticide that toxicologists say is biodegradable and works 
by stopping insects from growing to adulthood. Tobacco companies say FDA allows 
it in dried fruits, but FDA couldn't confirm that.

FORECASTING GOES A STEP AHEAD WITH WEATHER SATELLITE LAUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The decrepit U.S. weather satellite system got a boost Wednesday with the 
launch of the most advanced storm-watching craft ever sent into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting to go to work. We just couldn't have had a better start," said 
Tom McGunigal, program manager for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Images should start flowing in about a month, but the satellite's data won't 
go into regular use until after six months of testing. 
</P>
<P>
 McGunigal called the middle-of-the-night launch "a good omen for the rest of 
the work that we have to do." The first big step in orbit -- partial deployment 
of the solar electric panel -- was accomplished on cue Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The launch should have taken place five years ago, but technical and program 
setbacks led to several delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The $220-million satellite is the first in a series of five new Geostationary 
Operational Environment Satellites. The satellite, bigger and more 
sophisticated than previous models, is expected to allow more precise tracking 
of hurricanes and other storms than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets said he plans to start using the 
new GOES a few weeks into the 1994 hurricane season but won't rely on it until 
its six-month checkout is completed near the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, the National Weather Service and the hurricane 
center have had to rely on an aging GOES satellite for the Western United 
States and a borrowed European satellite for the East. Although working well, 
both spacecraft are well past their design lifetime and could stop working at 
any time. The new craft's expected lifetime is 8 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The five new GOES planned over the next 10 years are expected to cost $1.1 
billion, not including hundreds of millions of dollars in launch costs. The 
original cost estimate was $276 million.

 President Clinton on Wednesday implored top newspaper executives to give him 
some breathing room on Whitewater and let him "do the job I was hired by the

 In an otherwise colorless appearance before the American Society of Newspaper 
Editors, Clinton grew angry and defensive in response to a questioner who 
compared the President's shifting explanations on the Whitewater controversy to 
a schoolgirl's excuses for not doing her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you have total and complete recollection of every question that might 
be asked of you at any moment of things that happened 12, 13, 14 years ago," he 
snapped at the questioner, John Simpson, international news editor of USA 
Today. "You think I should have shut the whole federal government down and 
studied these things full time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Editors in the audience seemed surprised at how testy the President sounded. 
"I hear that is about as angry as he gets," said Craig Ammerman, a newspaper 
consultant from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started long," quipped Burl Osborne, editor and publisher of the Dallas 
Morning News, referring to the pacing of the President's address, "and he ended 
surprisingly short," alluding to the President's temper. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been embarrassed by a series of contradictory disclosures about 
the Whitewater real estate venture, in which he and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton were investors, and other aspects of their personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has been forced on several occasions in recent weeks to revise 
previous accounts of the couple's investments. This week one senior aide 
acknowledged that earlier explanations of Mrs. Clinton's commodities trading 
are now "inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you, sir, is I have done my best to answer the questions asked 
of me," Clinton told the editors. "But can I answer every question that anybody 
might ever ask me about something that happened 10, 15, 17 years ago on the 
spur of the moment and have total recall of all of that while trying to be 
President? No, sir, I cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the special counsel has a process for dealing with that, which would 
permit us to focus on the truly relevant questions and deal with it. And I have 
cooperated very well. I will continue to do that. I'll also do my best to give 
more information to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I would just like to point out that the people who asked for the special 
counsel asked for it and said: 'The President ought to do this so we can clear 
the air and he can go on and be President.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appearance began with a 30-minute address about the Administration's 
policies on strife in the former Yugoslavia and an outline of his now-familiar 
health care, welfare and anti-crime proposals. The 800 or so newspeople sat 
silently through the speech, in which the President urged the executives to use 
their newspapers to improve their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the question period that followed the speech, Clinton was asked how he 
would grade the press on its coverage of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could grade the press, I wouldn't. Especially not now," Clinton said, to 
the laughter of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that many in the media have questioned whether the Whitewater 
story was being overplayed. "If you have any doubts about it, then that's good 
because you ought to be having doubts about things like this," he said.

LATINO GROUPS SEEK UNITED PUSH FOR HIGH COURT HOPEFUL; JUDICIARY: EFFORT MAY 
INCLUDE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS. IT IS MEANT TO ADVANCE THE SUPREME COURT 
PROSPECTS OF FEDERAL JUDGE CABRANES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and several major Latino organizations have 
scheduled press conferences for today in an effort to coalesce behind the 
Supreme Court candidacy of U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut 
-- a move that could make him a clear favorite for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to come out of this thing all fragmented. That sends a 
negative signal," said Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) after a Hispanic 
Caucus meeting to discuss the high court vacancy. "There's a window of 
opportunity open to us now." 
</P>
<P>
 After a debate in which some members of the caucus voiced reservations about 
Cabranes, who is not well known to Latino political figures in the West and 
Southwest, the group agreed to put off a final decision until today. But 
sources familiar with the discussion said that Cabranes appears all but certain 
to win the group's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The members feel very good and comfortable with the decision. He's a 
distinguished jurist," said a congressional aide familiar with the caucus' 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the 14 members present voiced concern that Cabranes might be too 
conservative, but overall "they feel that right now he's the best Latino 
candidate," the aide said. "They were opposed to other people bringing up other 
names at this stage. Everyone said we have to solidify behind one candidate 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Public endorsements of potential high court candidates by members of Congress 
or outside groups are not uncommon, though most of the time such moves have 
little significance. In this case, however, a united plea could carry weight. 
White House officials have indicated that President Clinton would be strongly 
inclined to name the first Latino Supreme Court justice but would like to find 
a candidate who would generate widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for such an appointment improved greatly Tuesday when Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) took himself out of contention for 
the high court job, saying that he wanted to concentrate on getting a national 
health care reform plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell plans to retire from the Senate at the end of this year. In a related 
development, congressional sources said that Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) plans 
to announce today that he will not seek to replace Mitchell as majority leader, 
setting up a likely two-person race between Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a 
Mitchell protege who already has announced that he plans to seek the job, and 
Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee, who is expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the jockeying for the court job, Cabranes has been hampered by a lack of 
support among some civil rights groups, a feeling that appears likely to 
continue despite the expected endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights activists argue that, after years of Republican nominees, the 
court is skewed heavily to the right and needs a true liberal to restore 
balance. Cabranes, they argue, does not meet that test. 
</P>
<P>
 As a district judge in a relatively placid state, Cabranes has not had the 
opportunity to rule on many high-profile cases. In the 15 years since President 
Jimmy Carter put Cabranes on the federal bench, for example, he has never had 
to rule on any cases involving abortion or the right to privacy, noted one 
lawyer who has reviewed his work. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil rights cases he has handled have mostly been "garden variety," he 
added. As a result, "there are limits on how much people know about him. There 
just have not been a lot of cases that give him an opportunity to show what his 
views and experiences are." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabranes "just doesn't excite anyone," said an official of another major civil 
rights group. The official also noted that many are suspicious of Cabranes 
because the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations considered him in 
their high court searches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a positive development," the official said of the planned 
endorsements of Cabranes, conceding that the move would complicate efforts to 
get the White House to name a more clearly liberal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of Cabranes argued that, by searching for a candidate who 
pleases everyone, Latino groups might sabotage chances for a historic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to be a little realistic and pragmatic about this," said one 
Latino adviser to the Administration. "They may have an ideal in mind which 
does not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Latino groups will join the Cabranes effort. Wednesday, for example, 
the Latino Issues Forum, a think tank based in San Francisco, sent a letter to 
the White House urging nomination of former California Supreme Court Justice 
Cruz Reynoso, whom Clinton already has nominated to be vice chairman of the 
U.S. Civil Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials have indicated that Reynoso would not be a likely 
nominee, in part because of his age, 63, but also because of the 1987 election 
in which California voters, angered over court rulings against the death 
penalty, failed to retain him as a member of the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many analysts at the time thought that Reynoso lost the election 
solely because he shared the ballot with controversial Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird, Administration officials have been reluctant to reopen that 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Reynoso's example shows one reason for the support for Cabranes: a 
lack of clear alternatives. Relatively few Latinos have been appointed to the 
federal bench, from which recent presidents have drawn most high court 
nominees. And only recently have a growing number become involved in the sort 
of prominent activities in the bar and the legal community that lead people to 
appear on lists of Supreme Court prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights advocates have urged Clinton to consider Los Angeles attorney 
Vilma Martinez, the former director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, or the group's current director, Antonia Hernandez. But White 
House officials said that Clinton is more likely to turn to someone with 
judicial experience.

 An 11-year-old boy died Wednesday, a day after being shot in the head by a 
classmate on a crowded elementary school playground, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year-old boy upset over an argument the previous day at the Margaret 
Leary Elementary School fired a pistol three times Tuesday, police said. Jeremy 
Bullock, who was standing next to the intended target and about 10 feet from 
the shooter, died at St. James Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers reportedly did not see the shooting, but one confiscated the gun 
after hearing shots fired.

GUNMAN KILLS 2, WOUNDS 2 AT N.C. PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man stormed into a fiber optics plant Wednesday and opened fire with a 
handgun, killing two former co-workers and wounding two others. The gunman 
later killed himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked out over the plant floor -- we saw people just running at random. 
And it was just a pop, pop, pop. We never did see the guy," Sid Gregory, an 
employee at Sumitomo Electric Fiber Optics Corp., told WRAL-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated the building after the morning shooting and spent more 
than six hours searching the grounds of the Japanese-owned plant before finding 
the gunman's body behind cabinets on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, identified as Ladislav Antalik, killed himself, said Chief Deputy 
Walter L. Lawrence of the Durham County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting happened in the fiber optics inspection division just before 8 
a.m., while hundreds of employees were in the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the first shot, that's when I looked up, and I saw the guy with 
the gun in his hand and running, and I said 'Oh my God, he's going to shoot 
everybody in here' and I just took off running," Patricia Cardinez told the TV 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunned down at point-blank range were Antalik's former supervisor and a woman 
who had filed a sexual harassment complaint against him, said Bob Martin, an 
independent contract writer who was working at Sumitomo on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not confirm his account. The names of the dead were not 
immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Antalik had worked for Litespec Inc., based at the Sumitomo plant, for more 
than two years before quitting in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "He resigned on his own because he had some personal grievances with some 
other employees, that is his co-workers," said Basant Tariyal, chief executive 
officer of Litespec. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to detail the nature of the disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Tariyal said he did not know how Antalik got past security guards posted at 
the plant's main gate and locked doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a mystery," he said. "We normally take badges that would allow access 
into the building."

COUNCILWOMAN RECALLED OVER RACIAL REMARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rookie city councilwoman condemned by her colleagues for making disparaging 
remarks about Latinos, Asian Americans and gays has been recalled by voters in 
her district. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial results from Tuesday's election showed that 59.2% of the voters 
favored ousting Kathy Cole, making her the first City Council member to be 
recalled in San Jose history. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, 47, triggered a public uproar last May with remarks she made in a speech 
to a leadership seminar for African Americans. In the address, Cole, who is 
black, expressed frustration that African Americans had not achieved as much as 
other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 She referred to Latinos as "pit bulls" for their political persistence and, 
using her fingers to pull her eyes into slits, said of Asians: "If you get up 
and slant your eyes, you might get something out of the deal."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PANELS TO ADDRESS IMMIGRATION ISSUES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two local institutions will be hosting upcoming discussions about one of 
Southern California's most controversial topics: immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent professors and activists will talk about illegal immigration 
as part of a panel discussion this evening at Cypress College. Another 
discussion at Cal State Fullerton next week will feature an immigration 
attorney, a local Catholic vicar and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation hosted by Cypress College, "Xenophobia and the Scapegoating 
of Undocumented Workers, Families and Students: Chicano and Chicana 
Perspectives," will focus on illegal immigrants and their rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Participants include Rudy Acuna, Cal State Northridge Chicano Studies 
professor; Marta Lopez-Garza, a sociology professor at Occidental College in 
Los Angeles, and Susan Alva, an attorney for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant 
Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Luz Calvo, a Cypress College instructor, said she organized the panel in 
response to the furor over immigration and an ad in the school newspaper 
earlier in the year that read: "Illegal aliens are stealing your education." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something to have a more academic and scholarly discussion of 
it," Calvo said. The Cypress College discussion will be from 7 to 9 p.m. in 
Room 216 of the Lecture Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The second discussion will be Wednesday at Cal State Fullerton. Titled "The 
Human Side of Immigration," it will feature speakers such as Rusty Kennedy of 
the Orange County Human Relations Commission; Gary H. Manulkin, immigration 
attorney; Msgr. Jaime Soto, vicar for the Latino community in the Diocese of 
Orange, and Irene Martinez, executive director of the Delhi Community Center in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk is part of the second annual National Conference Forum on Diversity 
and Pluralism presented by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, 
Orange County region.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers invite the public to attend the forum at the Titan Pavilion in the 
University Center at 7:30 p.m. ALICIA DI RADO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit center for senior citizens will have a health fair this weekend 
that is designed to encourage older people to take advantage of regular, 
preventive medical checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want this to be a comfortable environment for them," said Laurell 
Detweiler, program coordinator for the Oasis Senior Center."We want (seniors) 
to become more aware of their health." 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Fair Expo will provide participants with free screenings for blood 
pressure, dermatology, lungs, hearing and vision. Free tetanus shots will also 
be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 For $25, seniors can receive a blood test that checks 28 different 
chemistries, including cholesterol, sugar and sodium levels. Prostate cancer 
screenings for men will be offered for $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Detweiler stressed that the medical workers at the fair will not diagnose 
conditions based on screenings. But they will suggest that seniors get medical 
attention if tests reveal any abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a test is out of a normal range, we will suggest they get it checked," 
Detweiler said. "If they have a blemish on their skin, we will tell them they 
need to get it checked." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will take place Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Oasis Senior 
Center at 5th and Narcissus avenues in Corona del Mar. The center is a 
nonprofit group.

DINNER, AUCTION TO RAISE FUNDS FOR AMERASIAN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Amerasian Program at St. Anselm's Cross Cultural Community Center will 
hold a fund-raiser Friday to benefit children who were born to American fathers 
and Vietnamese mothers during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The program offers services to children who grew up fatherless in a 
patrilineal society in Vietnam, where they often became victims of cultural 
shame and social harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 It tries to help educate and instill a sense of self-esteem in Amerasians by 
providing mentors, English training, job assistance, health classes and 
advocacy of women's issues, and it also helps in searches for fathers of 
Amerasians. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the program is in jeopardy because of dwindling funds, and they 
hope the fund-raiser will help keep it in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will sponsor the "Amerasians In Search of a Brighter Future in 
America," a dinner that will feature a silent auction, an art exhibition and 
musical entertainment. The event will begin at 7 p.m. at Lucky House 
Restaurant, 2158 South Bristol St. in Santa Ana. The Amerasian Program will 
accept tax-deductible donations.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; INVITATION TO ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westminster officials should be embarrassed by this week's release of an audit 
showing that Fire Department personnel racked up nearly $4 million in overtime 
in only the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-month review by independent accountants produced a detailed report that 
found Fire Department managers were "ineffective" in preventing excessive 
overtime by firefighters and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office has been investigating whether 
firefighters broke the law in getting overtime pay for shifts not worked. The 
firefighters' union insisted that no laws were broken. But even if that is 
true, officials should have been quicker to institute new procedures to cut 
overtime pay at a time when the city was facing cash shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 When city officials finally did cut the Fire Department's budget last year, 
the firefighters union launched a recall campaign to remove four council 
members. The June 7 recall is a bad idea; the time to remove elected officials 
one dislikes is at a regularly scheduled election. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the council must institute the reforms suggested by the auditors, 
including drawing up written policies for such matters as administrative time 
off. Make sure everyone knows the rules and see that supervisors enforce them. 
That is the only way to do business today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there seems little doubt that most in the 64-member department are 
honest workers performing a tough job, the informal practices of the past were 
an invitation to abuse.

PEREZ BEGINNING TO SHOW HE BELONGS ON FIRST; BASEBALL: FORMER OUTFIELDER HITS A 
TWO-RUN HOME RUN EARLY IN THE ANGELS' 10-INNING LOSS TO CLEVELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez has dropped the hints here and there, trying 
to justify his spot in the starting lineup and J.T. Snow's mailing address in 
Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, he dropped one of those hints over the left-center field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 His two-run home run might have hid in the shadows of teammate Bo Jackson's 
three-run shot in the ninth inning of the Angels' 6-5 loss to Cleveland in 10 
innings Wednesday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was an important early-season signpost for Perez, who's struggling to 
show he should be the Angels' first baseman of the present . . . and future. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was slated to start in left field this season, but his slow recovery 
from right elbow surgery in October convinced Angel Manager Buck Rodgers to 
move him to first base in place of Snow. Rodgers wanted Perez to get at least 
500 at-bats this season, a difficult task for an outfielder with a sore 
throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving Perez left Rodgers with one first baseman too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for starting pitching, the Angels shopped Snow around the league and 
were close to trading him to the New York Mets for starter Anthony Young. The 
deal fell through, and Snow, a former Los Alamitos High standout, is at the 
team's triple-A team in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that J.T. can be a solid first baseman in this league," Rodgers 
said. "But we believe Perez can be a real impact player." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez didn't do much to prove Rodgers right in the first week of the season. 
He was batting only .148 after Monday's home opener, but after two doubles 
Tuesday night and his two-run homer Wednesday night, things appear to be coming 
around for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, he hit Charles Nagy's 1-0 pitch over the left-center 
field fence, driving in Chili Davis, who had singled, and giving the Angels a 
2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After grounding to third in the fifth, he broke up a double play in the 
seventh, beating second baseman Carlos Baerga's throw to first. Cleveland 
Manager Mike Hargrove argued that Perez was out, and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's three-run homer in the ninth tied it, 5-5, but Perez, the next 
batter, flied out to right.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FIELDER SHOWS HE CAN HIT CHANGEUPS TOO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole pitchers have tried everything against Cecil Fielder, and not 
much has worked, so Jamie Moyer had an idea Wednesday in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget fastballs. Slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The times I've faced Cecil, I've had some success getting him out with my 
changeup," Moyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder went four for four, including one of three Tiger homers, and John 
Doherty pitched seven strong innings of a 6-3 victory over the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, his base hit to center field was a changeup off the end of the bat," 
Moyer said. "And his home run was a changeup that he was out in front of. The 
guy's a great hitter, and I have to go after him with what's worked in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the past. Fielder doesn't need a pitcher's fastball to help 
generate power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cecil is going to win a lot of games for you, just because he is a big, 
strong guy," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson said. "Cecil doesn't hit any 
cheapies." 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole Manager John Oates can attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cecil didn't need to show us how strong he is," Oates said. "We've known that 
since he hit the ball on the roof against us last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Phillips and Eric Davis homered in the seventh inning for the Tigers, 
helping Anderson earn his 100th victory against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty (1-1) held the Orioles to two runs and eight hits in seven innings, 
getting 16 outs on ground balls, five back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 9, Seattle 6 -- Dave Winfield had two hits to move into 16th place 
on baseball's all-time list, and the Twins got five runs in the sixth inning en 
route to ending a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield's two singles give him 3,024 hits, moving him past Lou Brock's 3,023. 
Rod Carew is next in view with 3,053. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Mahomes (1-0) gave up a home run to Eric Anthony, his fourth of the 
season, and to Reggie Jefferson, but the Twins battered Greg Hibbard (0-1) for 
seven runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 2, Boston 1 -- Rookie Bob Hamelin, who has replaced George Bett as 
the Royals' designated hitter, hit a two-run home run with one out in the ninth 
inning to beat the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City had not gotten a runner past first base before Hamelin homered 
into the right-field bullpen off reliever Jeff Russell (0-1). Dave Henderson 
reached on a throwing error by shortstop John Valentin, setting the stage for 
Hamelin's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, New York 0 -- Jason Bere (1-0) scattered four hits in seven innings 
and Julio Franco homered for the White Sox, who won at Chicago to stretch their 
winning streak to four. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Abbott (1-1) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and eight hits in 6 2/3 
innings in the Yankees' fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Esteban Beltre singled home the winning run through a 
drawn-in infield in the 10th inning, giving the Rangers their first victory in 
their new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris James led off the 10th with a pinch-single off Bob Scanlan (0-1) and 
took third on Ivan Rodriguez's single. Beltre, in his first at-bat with the 
Rangers after a spring training trade from the White Sox, singled to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henke (1-0) blew a 3-2 lead and save opportunity in the ninth inning, 
allowing a one-out triple to Alex Diaz and a game-tying single to Matt Mieske. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 8, Toronto 7 -- Mike Bordick's single bounced off relief pitcher Greg 
Cadaret, scoring Troy Neel from second base in the 12th inning at Oakland.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MCGRIFF'S HOMER WINS FOR BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wall along the left-field bullpen was just too close, and Barry Bonds 
sensed it when he pulled up while chasing Fred McGriff's foul ball in the 12th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball landed a foot inside the field. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff then hit a three-run homer to give the Atlanta Braves a 6-3 victory 
over the San Francisco Giants at Atlanta on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when Henry Aaron was honored for his historic 715th homer, hit 20 
years and five days before, McGriff, whose stall in the Braves' clubhouse is 
next to one reserved for Aaron, wasn't thinking in nostalgic terms, even when 
his homer hit near the 715 marker over the left-field fence in Atlanta-Fulton 
County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been swinging the bat too good, so the only thing I was thinking 
about was that I had finally gotten a hit," said McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta opened the 12th with a double from Jeff Blauser against rookie Tony 
Mendendez (0-1), then got a walk to Terry Pendleton before McGriff hit his 
second homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that situation, the one guy I didn't want to see at the plate was Fred 
McGriff," San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said. "It was a tough spot for 
Menendez, but we had no choice. We were down to our last pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Menendez was the sixth San Francisco pitcher. The only reliever remaining was 
Dave Burba, who had pitched three innings on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, Florida 2 -- Greg Swindell gave up five hits in eight shutout 
innings at Miami and remained unbeaten in four decisions against the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, San Diego 2 -- Al Martin tripled, doubled and scored the 
go-ahead run on third baseman Archi Cianfrocco's throwing error in the fifth 
inning as the Pirates won at Pittsburgh and sent the Padres to a 1-8 record, 
the majors' worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 12, Colorado 3 -- Darren Daulton drove in four runs and scored 
four as the Phillies won at Philadelphia to end a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Daulton went three for four with a two-run homer in the fifth inning.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CATCHERS STRUGGLING AT PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels had some concerns about the defensive liabilities of their catching 
platoon of Greg Myers and Chris Turner, but after both had impressive spring 
performances at the plate, the Angels figured to get some offense from the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, Myers and Turner have struggled. Going into Wednesday night's 
game, they had combined for four hits in 30 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers and Turner have have been splitting time behind the plate pretty equally 
so far, but Manager Buck Rodgers has made it clear that whoever hits will play 
the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be some self-inflicted pressure there," Rodgers said, "but 
there's not much we can do about that. There's always going to be pressure in 
this game, and maybe it's good that we find out right now and get rid of 
everybody who can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers hinted that if both Turner and Myers continue to have trouble with the 
bat, prospect Jorge Fabregas, now at triple-A Vancouver, might be called up 
sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina's batting average has hovered around .400 since 
opening day, and Rodgers says hitting instructor Rod Carew deserves some of the 
credit for DiSarcina's quick start. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Rod have worked hard at flattening out his swing," Rodgers said, "and 
he's really been able to stay on top of the ball. He's not trying to pull the 
ball, just going with the pitches. He tomahawked a ball (Tuesday night) for a 
hit off a pitch that he would have had no chance on last year." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina also had a quick start last season, when he hit safely in 11 of the 
first 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The American League has sent a directive to teams detailing a relaxed policy 
on the showing of replays of close calls as long as they are not used to show 
up umpires or incite the crowd. The Angels, however, plan to continue their 
policy of refraining from showing controversial plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some crazy people in the stands," Rodgers said. "We had an apple 
thrown at (Cleveland outfielder Kenny) Lofton the other night, and the fans in 
Anaheim are the most sedate in baseball." JOHN WEYLER

NBA ROUNDUP; DEFENSE MOVES DENVER CLOSER TO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Denver Nuggets picked a good time to tighten their defense -- about the 
time the San Antonio Spurs started missing shots -- and moved closer to 
clinching a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets got 18 points from Rodney Rogers, including a basket with 15 
seconds to play in an 83-78 victory at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the Lakers' loss to the Phoenix Suns at Phoenix, it put Denver 
five games ahead in the race for the final Western Conference playoff spot with 
six games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets took advantage of San Antonio's poor fourth-quarter shooting. The 
Spurs scored their last points from the field on Lloyd Daniels' jump shot with 
7:31 to play and made only three of 15 shots in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not playing like a team with a lot at stake right now," said San 
Antonio center David Robinson, who had 32 points and 12 rebounds. "We're just 
not creating anything on offense. There was not a lot of movement out there at 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman had 18 rebounds for San Antonio, but the Nuggets outrebounded 
the Spurs, 43-36. LaPhonso Ellis and Dikembe Mutombo grabbed 10 rebounds each 
for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Spur Coach John Lucas said his team simply isn't playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have two guys get all the rebounds -- David and Dennis had 30 
out of 36 rebounds -- that's a major problem. We've got some problems right 
now, but we'll get them solved," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it took a 6-0 run for Denver to take a 78-72 lead with 2:45 to play. 
And the Spurs came back on Robinson's free throws to within 78-76 with 34 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who has struggled all season, averaging only 7.9 points a game, then 
made a shot to give Denver control. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver's Robert Pack sealed the victory with three free throws in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a been a long and tough season, and I feel like I've learned a lot," 
Rogers said. "It's been a learning experience for me, and I still have a long 
way to go. But a game like tonight sure does help." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 96, Miami 90 -- Scottie Pippen scored 27 points and made a crucial 
defensive play at Miami to help the Bulls to their ninth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kerr hit two free throws to put Chicago ahead, 92-88, and Horace Grant's 
jump shot made the score 94-90. Pippen then blocked an attempted dunk by Grant 
Long with 40 seconds to play to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the competition for home-court playoff advantage, Chicago, the three-time 
defending NBA champion, has tied New York for second place in the East, half a 
game behind Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami lost its third in a row and 10th in 12 games. The Heat's magic number 
remained three for clinching its second playoff berth in franchise history. Any 
combination of Heat victories and Charlotte losses totaling three will put the 
Heat in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 110, Cleveland 95 -- Mookie Blaylock scored 19 points and ignited two 
14-0 runs in the first half as the Hawks took control early at Atlanta by 
making 23 of their first 29 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 109, Detroit 96 -- The Celtics used a 26-4 burst to turn a one-point 
game into a rout at Boston. Detroit has lost its last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 115, Philadelphia 87 -- Byron Scott scored a season-high 21 points and 
the Pacers established season highs for rebounds and assists at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 107, Milwaukee 105 -- Reserve Johnny Newman's jump shot with 1.3 
seconds to play at Milwaukee lifted the Nets past the Bucks and into seventh 
place in the Eastern Conference.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BASEBALL; TUSTIN BOUNCES BACK TO DEFEAT SEA KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trailing in the bottom of the seventh inning is not the best position from 
which to play, especially after enjoying a big early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the pressure of a first-place showdown, and things can get 
downright uncomfortable. The Tustin baseball team found itself playing out such 
a scenario Wednesday -- but the Tillers made the competition sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin scored two runs in its final at-bat for a 7-6 Sea View League victory 
over visiting Corona del Mar, enabling the Tillers to remain alone atop the 
league standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding run came on a single by pinch-hitter Rick Gonzalez, who drove in 
pinch-runner Jeff Stapleton from second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Stapleton was running for Julio Villalobos, who reached first base when Corona 
del Mar center fielder Bryson Groat dropped his high fly ball. Stapleton 
advanced to second on a base hit by Jeff Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt real confident we were ready to play today," Tiller Coach Tim 
O'Donoghue said. "I knew (Corona del Mar) would come back because they're a 
good team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been on the other end of a lot of these, and I knew sooner or later 
that would help us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, which is ranked eighth in Orange County, is 13-4, 5-0 in league play. 
The Sea Kings are 12-4, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiller starter Junior Silva (5-1) had his rough moments but kept battling. He 
pitched a complete game, allowing nine hits and striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he did a good job of keeping his composure," O'Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tustin -- which squandered a 4-0 first-inning lead -- trailing, 6-5, Ryan 
Winmill opened the bottom of the seventh by driving the first pitch from Corona 
del Mar's Jeff Bowman over the left-field fence for his fourth home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really focused," Winmill said. "I said to myself, 'I'm not going to sit 
back. If my pitch is there, I'm going to hammer it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who relieved starter Daniel MacMillan in the first inning, was yanked 
immediately following the homer. Loser Kevin Stuart (4-2) entered and struck 
out Jon Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters later, however, Gonzalez delivered the game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main characteristic of this team has been to battle back," Sea King Coach 
Matt Lundin said. "But we have to stop making those early mistakes that force 
us to battle back." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 10, University 2 -- Tony Torres had two hits and five RBIs to lead 
Saddleback (9-7-1, 3-2). Pitcher Erasmo Ramirez improved to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 8, Newport Harbor 3 -- The Warriors (7-10, 4-1) scored all their 
runs in the fifth and sixth innings. Chris Talbott pitched a complete game, 
striking out six.

PREP TENNIS ROUNDUP; SUNNY HILLS SUFFERS DOUBLES TROUBLE IN LOSS TO PALOS 
VERDES PENINSULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Steve White wanted to see if his doubles teams were ready 
for the big time -- or in this case, undefeated Palos Verdes Peninsula. So he 
kept them intact, rather than moving one of his top two singles players into 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 White learned the hard way Wednesday that his teams need a bit more seasoning. 
Peninsula won eight of nine doubles sets on its way to a 12 2/3-8 1/3 victory 
over previously undefeated Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his team missed a chance at an undefeated season, White said afterward 
that he would do the same thing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "These doubles teams need to find out what they can do," he said. "They need 
to experience this type of competition. The singles players get that experience 
all the time. The doubles kids don't get it and they need to get better too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad thing is that we lost. The positive is that we lost to a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula improved to 12-0 and has now beaten two of Orange County's top three 
teams, No. 1 Sunny Hills (10-1) and No. 3 University. 
</P>
<P>
 With doubles sets worth three more points than singles sets, Peninsula Coach 
Tom Cox moved his best singles player, Dennis Chang, into doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured they'd put (Joseph) Gilbert or (Kevin) Kim into doubles," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 White's gamble nearly paid off as his No. 3 doubles team of Jeff Hartl and 
Sean Harris led 4-1 in two sets, but they wound up losing each 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed in the way the doubles reacted to the pressure," 
White said. "I would have never thought my No. 1 team (Juno Kuan and David 
Farkas) would have lost all three sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills' No. 2 team of Hiren Bhavasar and Joey Springer took the Lancers' 
only set. Kim swept his sets, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, and Gilbert won his first two, 
6-0, 6-2, before defaulting his third because of bad back after learning 
Peninsula had clinched the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills' John Han, at No. 3 singles, won his first two sets, 7-6, 6-1, 
before losing 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In another nonleague match: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 14 1/3, Los Amigos 6 2/3 -- Greg Little swept at No. 2 singles, 6-1, 
6-3, 6-0, and Bret Hankey swept at No. 3, 6-0, 6-1, 6-0, to lead visiting Mater 
Dei (4-5). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Century League: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 16 2/3, Orange 4 1/3 -- Jack Huang swept his singles sets, 6-1, 6-1, 
6-0 and Rob Claus and Ryan Thompson won in doubles, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, for Foothill 
(13-1, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 14 1/3, El Dorado 6 2/3 -- Tim Wing swept in singles, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, 
and Tony Hughes andBrent Tsuda swept in doubles, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, for Cypress 
(6-3, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 17 2/3, Katella 3 1/3 -- Devin Lopez swept in singles, 6-0, 6-0, 
6-0, and Eric Chang and Dinesh Moorjani swept in doubles, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1, to 
lead Esperanza (7-7, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 12 1/3, Loara 8 2/3 -- Franco Trani and Marco Materazzi swept at 
No. 3 doubles, 6-0, 6-1, 6-3, for Los Alamitos (9-2, 3-0).

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: THIS TIME, TITANS HOPING THEY DON'T 
PANIC AFTER LOSING SERIES TO LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago when Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State got together for 
their no-holds-barred, in-your-face Big West college baseball series, the 
Titans were rolling along with a 14-1 conference record and were ranked second 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State came in with a 9-3 record, two games behind the Titans, but 
proceeded to sweep the series by scores of 13-6, 4-1 and 4-3. It marked the 
49ers' first sweep of the Titans and, in hindsight, had a pivotal impact on 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team lost only one more conference game that season, and the sweep turned 
out to be decisive. Long Beach won the Big West title with a 17-4 record and 
Fullerton finished second at 16-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach then went on to win the NCAA Eastern Regional and advanced to the 
College World Series semifinals, where the 49ers lost to eventual champion 
Louisiana State. The 49ers ended the year ranked No. 3 in the nation. Fullerton 
finished the regular season 35-19 and but was eliminated from the NCAA Central 
Regional in Austin, Tex., by two losses to a USC team the Titans had beaten 
twice during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way it turned out, that series had a bigger impact on us the rest of 
the way than we hoped it would," Titan Coach Augie Garrido said. "It went from 
a setback to something that we didn't recover from. We just didn't play as well 
the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton associate head coach George Horton added: "We never regained our 
confidence after that sweep. When things didn't exactly go our way in the tough 
situations the rest of the season, we responded with panic sometimes, not 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Fullerton and Long Beach meet on the baseball field, there is always a 
lot of comparing of the teams because the rivalry is so intense and the eams 
have won or shared six of the nine Big West titles since 1985, each with three. 
</P>
<P>
 This year was no different, but the bottom line is that the recent series 
could have gone either way. In Sunday's decisive third game, Fullerton appeared 
ready to put the finishing touches on a 2-1 victory, but the defense committed 
two errors in the eighth inning that gave Long Beach three unearned runs and a 
4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly a matter of one team dominating the other, although each team 
won one of the first two games decisively and, in each case, an ace pitcher was 
roughed up early. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Titans jumped on Long Beach's most consistent pitcher, 
right-hander Mike Fontana, who yielded eight runs, five of them earned, in 4 
2/3 innings of a 9-4 Fullerton victory. It was the first loss of the season in 
eight outings for Fontana, who had a two-hitter against Kansas in the 1993 
College World Series and was 9-3 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers were equally rough on the Titans' star, right-hander Mike Parisi, 
who gave up six runs, four of them earned, on nine hits in 3 1/3 innings. Long 
Beach went on to win, 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido was surprised each of the first two games was as one-sided as it was.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those first two games are not what you expect when these two teams play," 
Garrido said. "You don't expect them to be as one-sided. The third game was 
more typical of what you expect, a close game decided by a break or two, and 
that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garrido was disappointed by Sunday's loss, he was encouraged by the 
performance of senior right-hander Dan Ricabal, who gave up only five hits and 
one run in seven innings. Relief specialist Ted Silva came on in the eighth. 
Ricabal had been struggling before Sunday's strong effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game pointed out that Ricabal can beat any team in the country and he 
just needs to continue thinking that way," Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore right-hander Matt Wagner also continued to impress with his 
three-hit, complete-game pitching performance Friday that ran his record to 8-0 
and dropped his earned-run average to 1.39. 
</P>
<P>
 Another positive aspect of the series for the Titans was outfielder Dante 
Powell, a preseason All-American, showed signs that he's returning to top form 
as a hitter. Powell was three for five with three runs scored and three RBIs in 
Friday's game. He hit his sixth homer of the season Sunday. His average is up 
to .288 and he leads the team in RBIs with 31. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Garrido hopes losing the Long Beach series won't have the 
same detrimental effect on the Titans it had last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will because this group is older and more mature . . ." 
Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is fourth in the Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball national 
rankings this week. Long Beach State is ranked third by Collegiate Baseball and 
11th by Baseball America. Georgia Tech is ranked No. 1 by both. . . . The 
three-game Fullerton-Long Beach series set an attendance record for college 
baseball at Blair Field in Long Beach. The series attracted 1,638 on Friday, 
1,826 on Saturday and 1,448 on Sunday. The three-game series attendance of 
4,912 topped the previous high of 3,895 for the Long Beach-Wichita State series 
earlier this year. . . . Three former Titan softball players have made the 
roster for the Colorado Silver Bullets women's professional baseball team. 
Missy Coombs and Charlotte Wiley are listed on the roster as pitchers, and K.C. 
Clark is listed as an outfielder.

CORONA DEL MAR BEATS UNIVERSITY 
</P>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seniors Jed Weinstein and Paul Fruchbom, pairing up for the first time since 
they were freshmen, won three doubles sets to lead Corona del Mar to an 11-10 
victory over visiting University in a Sea View League boys' tennis match 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings, 15 2/3-5 2/3 losers to University the first time the teams met, 
won three singles and six doubles sets to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein and Fruchbom won 6-1, 7-5, 6-2. Roberto Intriago, who normally is 
paired with Fruchbom, joined Tyler Stonebreaker for a pair of victories, 7-5, 
6-2, and Doug Smith and Mike Feyka won, 6-4, for Corona del Mar (10-2, 7-1), 
which moved into a tie for first with University (9-2, 7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Because doubles victories are worth 1 1/3, Corona del Mar Coach Tim Mang 
shuffled his lineup and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping (University coach) Josh (Davis) would move Jason Meyers to 
doubles, giving our singles a chance," Mang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers, the Trojans' top player, ended up losing two doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sets went to 7-5 with Corona del Mar winning all three on service breaks 
in the final game. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 Esperanza, ranked seventh in Orange County, had little trouble defeating 
Valencia in three games in an Empire League boys' volleyball match Wednesday at 
Esperanza High. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Ryan Rex had nine kills and five blocks and Mark Alleman added eight 
kills for the Aztecs in a 16-14, 15-4, 15-0 victory.Esperanza improved to 7-2, 
3-0 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Valencia would be the team to challenge us in league this season," 
Esperanza Coach Kurt Kersten said. "It's nice to be ranked as high as we are, 
but right now our practices are tougher than our matches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs' top player, senior outside hitter Mike Allison, had only six 
kills. But Esperanza didn't need him Wednesday, although Valencia made the 
Aztecs sweat a little in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia's Joe Reynoza, a 6-foot-5 senior, had a match-high 11 kills and five 
blocks to help the Tigers (5-5, 1-2) rally from an 8-1 deficit in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Valencia drew even, 14-14, Alleman spiked through a block for a side 
out. Then Rex and Alleman scored on consecutive spikes to give Esperanza a 
16-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza limited the Tigers to four points for the rest of the match. MICHAEL

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: LONG BEACH OFFERS FESTIVAL OF RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell and defending champion Paul Tracy are among the 
Indy car drivers who will headline this weekend's 20th Toyota Grand Prix of 
Long Beach, but there will also be a strong supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sunday's Indy car competition, which is the third round of the 
PPG Cup series, there will be five races. Bridgestone Supercars, 
pro-celebrities and electric cars will race Saturday, along with final Indy car 
qualifying. The Firestone Indy Lights and Toyota Atlantic cars will be part of 
Sunday's program. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice and qualifying will start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the competition will take place on a nine-turn, 1.6-mile temporary road 
course laid out on streets next to Long Beach's Aquatic Park and Shoreline 
Village, across the channel from the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Gurney, who joined Chris Pook in founding the Grand Prix 20 years ago, 
will be grand marshal of the three-day racing festival. Gurney, the former 
Formula One and Indy car driver, will drive the original 1975 Toyota Celica 
pace car in a parade lap before the Indy car race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy Lights are Indy car Lola look-alikes powered by Buick V-6 engines and run 
on Firestone radial tires. Tracy, Mike Groff and Robbie Buhl are all former 
Indy Lights champions who are entered in the Indy car race. Tracy, the 1990 
Lites champion when the program was called the American Racing Series, moved up 
to the Penske team in 1992, and last year made Long Beach his first Indy car 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Moore, an 18-year-old from British Columbia, won the Lights opener last 
Sunday in Phoenix by leading every lap and setting a series record of 146.268 
m.p.h. for 75 miles. The performance was reminiscent of Tracy's, when he won 
his first Lights race at Phoenix in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Robertson of England, last year's Lights rookie of the year, and Eddie 
Lawson, four-time world motorcycle road racing champion from Lake Havasu, 
Ariz., are expected to be Moore's chief challengers. Robertson and Lawson drive 
for the Tasman Motorsports Group, directed by Steve Horne. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Herta, one of Horne's drivers last year, won the 1993 championship but 
is not defending his title in hopes of landing an Indy car ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-celebrity race -- in which professional racers, media, entertainers 
and a Toyota dealer compete in equally prepared Celica GT-S Liftbacks -- is 
annually one of the weekend's crowd favorites. Drivers will earn $2,000 each to 
be donated to "Racing for Kids," a national program that raises funds for 
children's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Regazzoni, winner of the inaugural Long Beach Grand Prix when it was a 
Formula One race, will drive in a Celica modified with hand controls. Regazzoni 
was paralyzed in a crash at Long Beach in 1980. Other drivers include: Brian 
Redman, winner of a Formula 5000 race at Long Beach that preceded the Grand 
Prix series; Cruz Pedregon, National Hot Rod Assn. funny-car drag racing 
champion, and Juan Manual Fangio II, the 1991 and '93 Camel GTP champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainers include David Alan Grier, Mark Curry, Sean Astin and Alfonso 
Ribeiro. Also expected to drive are former NFL quarterback Ken Stabler, Raider 
defensive end Anthony Smith and world jet ski champion Christy Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 Adail Gayhart's brother-in-law paid $28,500 in an auction for a ride in the 
race and presented it to Gayhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Newman will drive a Lotus Esprit in the 30-minute Supercar race, which 
features exotic sports cars and a four-door BMW sedan driven by David Donohue. 
Newman is part-owner of the Newman-Haas team that fields cars for Mansell and 
Mario Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-minute Exide Electric Grand Prix will feature formula racing machines 
that are silent, even while running in the 125- to 150-m.p.h. range. Cars will 
make a mandatory pit stop, which means swapping battery packs. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend will end with the Players Ltd. Toyota Atlantic race, following the 
Indy car main event. Another Canadian, David Empringham, is defending series 
champion but faces challenges from Richie Hearn of Arcadia and Greg Ray of 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- Roger Penske and Mercedes-Benz announced Wednesday in 
Indianapolis that a newly designed Mercedes-Benz Indy 500 engine developed by 
Ilmor Engineering of England will be used by Team Penske drivers Emerson

SANTA ANITA; VIVA EL CAPITAN HAS CONVINCED FANS IN ARCADIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who says there is no such thing as a sure thing at the racetrack has 
never seen Viva El Capitan run at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular local performers, the 5-year-old gelding is a neck 
away from perfection in 10 starts at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Maynard Davis and Charles Novak and trained by Bob Baffert, the 
Arizona-bred Viva El Capitan won his ninth race in Arcadia when he rallied to 
beat another professional, Pharaoh's Heart, by a half-length in Sunday's 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 His only loss came when longshot Giant Asset turned in a career-best effort, 
winning in 1:08 1/5 for six furlongs on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Viva El Capitan has won 12 of 18, and he should be 13 for 18 because 
he was disqualified in his first start, a $32,000 maiden race at Los Alamitos 
on July 30, 1991. A 13-1 shot, he won by 2 3/4 lengths in 51 4/5 for 4 1/2 
furlongs but was disqualified and placed eighth for interference on the 
backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually close to the pace, the son of Elegant Life broke seventh of nine from 
the rail on Sunday, was still seventh after a quarter of a mile, then began to 
move up under David Flores along the inside, swung to the outside entering the 
stretch and got up to win in 1:08 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his glossy record at Santa Anita, he was the 5-2 second choice in the 
$41,000 allowance race, primarily because he drew the inside post and Pharaoh's 
Heart, the 7-5 favorite, had the more comfortable outside. 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous victory (March 16 against $80,000 claimers), Viva El Capitan 
was on or near the lead every step of the way under Corey Nakatani, repelled a 
bid by each of the other four horses in the race and defeated Town Caper by a 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the quintessential racing warrior," said Eoin Harty, Baffert's 
assistant trainer. "He's probably (the barn favorite) because of his attitude. 
You just have to love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just loves the competition. David rode him perfectly (Sunday), and things 
opened up for him. The general public was afraid of the rail, too, because they 
let him off at 5-2. I think he would run well anywhere, so I don't think this 
track is the reason he has such a great record on it. I think he could win on 
the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put the bridle on him (on race day) and he knows he's going to war. He 
gets his game face on." 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaimed by Baffert for $16,000 Dec. 26, 1992, after the trainer had lost him 
for $25,000 a little more than three months earlier, Viva El Capitan has piled 
up victories despite having screws and pins in both ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, all his problems have been with his ankles," Harty said. "You name 
it and he's had it. He's gone through periods of soundness and unsoundness, but 
right now he's the soundest he's been in a long time, probably since he was a 
foal." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who has been aboard for two of his last three victories, is also a 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you move your hands on him, he responds," said Flores. "You don't 
need a whip. It's unbelievable the way he tries. He's something special. He 
always gives you everything he has." 
</P>

 Jockey Alex Solis will be sidelined for a week after cutting his right foot in 
an accident at his Glendora home. 
</P>
<P>
 Third in the standings behind Kent Desormeaux and Gary Stevens with 64 
victories entering Wednesday's program, Solis was injured when a plate dropped 
from the freezer, broke and cut his foot. He had a deep laceration and it was 
to be repaired with minor surgery on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye and Chris McCarron were also off their mounts Wednesday. 
Delahoussaye is day to day after having a wisdom tooth removed Tuesday. 
McCarron had the stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The dental work cost Delahoussaye three winners Wednesday. Chris Antley won 
the first with Prince Quick, Goncalino Almeida took the second with Uncanny Ann 
in the second and Desormeaux picked up fourth-race winner Tough Prospecter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Marconi, who would have been one of the favorites in Saturday's California 
Derby at Golden Gate Fields, will be sidelined indefinitely because of an ankle 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second Kentucky Derby prospect that trainer Gary Jones has lost 
this week. Game Coin, second in the Louisiana Derby and scheduled to run in the 
Blue Grass on Saturday, is sidelined because of what Jones calls "a halfway 
wrenched right ankle." 
</P>
<P>
 An impressive winner of a maiden race in his California debut on March 5, 
Marconi suffered a hind ankle injury during a workout Sunday. "I'm not sure 
what it is or how long he'll be out," said Jones. "The X-rays were 
inconclusive. We'll probably have to do a bone scan." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two weeks, Bob Baffert will be in Arkansas, where Flagship 
Commander will make his first start as a 3-year-old in the Bachelor Stakes on 
Saturday and Sir Hutch will run in the Count Fleet Sprint Handicap on April 21. 
. . . It looks as if the $750,000 Oaklawn Handicap will have 11 starters on 
Saturday, headed by The Wicked North. Kent Desormeaux will ride The Wicked 
North and Flagship Commander. Others in the field are Devil His Due, Hill Pass, 
Kissin Kris and Myrakalu. . . . In addition to the Oaklawn Handicap, Santa 
Anita will also simulcast the Blue Grass Stakes from Keeneland and the 
California Derby. . . . Soul Of The Matter, scratched from the Santa Anita 
Derby, will be shipped to Kentucky Tuesday and make his next start in the 
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland on April 24. . . . Wild Invader, another Santa 
Anita Derby scratch who was scheduled to make his next start in the Wood 
Memorial Saturday at Aqueduct, will run instead in the California Derby. He 
will be shipped today and be ridden by Goncalino Almeida.

BENNETT GETS SWING DOWN AND CUTS UP THOUSAND OAKS; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: HE 
HITS TWO HOMERS, INCLUDING SHOT IN SEVENTH THAT GIVES NEWBURY PARK A 6-5 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newbury Park High baseball Coach Gary Fabricius wanted his catcher, Jeff 
Bennett, to swing the bat and take level cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, Fabricius watched Bennett take too many fat pitches, 
and watched him take too many uppercut, slow-pitch softball swings when he did 
get the bat off his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett seems to have gotten the message. He hit two first-pitch home runs 
Wednesday, the second breaking a seventh-inning tie and giving Newbury Park a 
6-5 Marmonte League victory over Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we can use today as a clinic," Fabricius said. "We told him if you 
just hit line drives, the power will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 As for being aggressive at the plate, Bennett credited watching Atlanta 
Braves' rookie Ryan Klesko on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Klesko) doesn't get cheated," said Bennett, who has signed to play at The 
Master's College. "I was listening to the announcers talk about that, so now 
I've tried to be more aggressive, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett hit the first pitch relief pitcher Jay Wolfe (1-2) threw in the 
seventh inning over the center-field fence. As soon as he hit the ball, his 
teammates poured out of the dugout to greet him at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he hits them, you know they are gone," said Keith Smith, who started on 
the mound for Newbury Park but did not get a decision.  
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (12-4, 5-0 in league play), who are in first place in the 
Marmonte League, one-half game ahead of Simi Valley, needed Bennett's second 
home run because they had just blown a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park took a 5-1 lead when consecutive hits by Smith, Shawn Adams and 
Rich Adams drove in four runs in the top of the fifth, but Thousand Oaks (9-6, 
2-3) came back. The Lancers scored a run in the bottom of the fifth when Greg 
Manara circled the bases on a triple and an error. 
</P>
<P>
 They started the sixth with a run on three consecutive singles, chasing Smith 
from the mound in favor of Ray Clinton with the deficit reduced to 5-3. Quincy 
Samora scored on a wild pitch and Tim Baron squeezed home the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton retired Jason Earles on a fly out, sending the game into the seventh 
tied, and setting up Bennett's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bennett, who was three for three with a walk, gave Newbury Park a 6-5 
lead, the Panthers loaded the bases with one out. Thousand Oaks third baseman 
Greg Aguilar came in to pitch and induced Michael Amundson to hit into a 
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton (7-2) struck out Matt Elam and Brandon Highland to start the bottom of 
the seventh. After a walk to Aguilar, Clinton got Samora to pop up, ending the 
game.

CSUN'S BAER IS GOLDEN IN FIVE-GAME VICTORY; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: FORMER WAVE 
ENTERS IN SECOND GAME AND LEADS MATADOR RALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Already one of the crowd favorites among the Cal State Northridge faithful, 
Jon Baer's stock went through the roof of Matador Gymnasium Wednesday night 
when he keyed the Matadors' 7-15, 13-15, 15-11, 15-7, 15-11 victory over 
Pepperdine in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation volleyball match. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the sixth in the last seven matches for Northridge (16-9, 11-7 
in conference play) and clinched a berth in the conference tournament -- which 
starts April 23 at Stanford -- as well as a third-place finish in the Mountain 
Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was sweet revenge tonight," said Baer, who attended Pepperdine for a 
year after graduating from Fresno Bullard High in 1990. "I respect (Waves' 
Coach Marv Dunphy), but this is really sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Baer, a rock-solid 6-foot-5, 190-pound junior outside hitter, spent most of 
the season backing up freshman Jason Hughes, but with Hughes struggling, 
Northridge Coach John Price inserted Baer into the lineup late in the second 
game and the move immediately paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 With Northridge trailing, 13-9, and Pepperdine serving, Baer blasted a shot 
through a Wave block to force a sideout. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Baer, who had four kills in five attempts, the Matadors trimmed their 
deficit to 14-13 before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the momentum of the match definitely swung Northridge's way as the 
Matadors raced to a 12-5 lead in the third game. Pepperdine (12-8, 10-8) 
whittled the deficit to 12-11, but Northridge scored the final three points of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer, who had a career-high 34 kills -- with a .509 hitting percentage -- had 
11 kills in 18 attempts and only one hitting error in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors and Waves were tied, 7-7, midway through the fourth game before 
the Matadors scored the final eight points to force a fifth game, which was 
played on a rally-scoring basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge surged to a 9-5 lead in the final game, saw its advantage cut to 
11-9 by the Waves, but finished strongly to close out the match with a 15-11 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to play steady," said Baer, who was surrounded by well-wishers 
after the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to play my game, not try to do too much, and just let the sets 
come to me, and if they were good and the court was open, take a a good full 
swing at the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann had 21 kills for Northridge and Craig Hewitt added 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Dain Blanton led Pepperdine with 34 kills.

RIVERA STILL BIGGEST KID ON MISSION STAFF; COLLEGE BASEBALL: FRESHMAN EARNS HIS 
10TH WIN BY PITCHING HIS SEVENTH COMPLETE GAME IN 3-1 VICTORY OVER L.A. CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With six freshman pitchers on the staff, Mission College baseball Coach John 
Klitsner went into the season wondering who would step forward and become the 
team's ace. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for right-hander Ray Rivera to claim that title and he 
keeps proving that he deserves it.  
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, from San Fernando High, pitched his seventh complete game of the 
season Wednesday as the Free Spirit beat Los Angeles City, 3-1, in a Southern 
California Athletic Conference game at Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the third in a row for Mission (20-13, 12-6 in conference play) 
over L.A. City, allowed the Free Spirit to move within one-half game of 
first-place Cerro Coso (12-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera (10-2), who limited the Cubs to five hits, struck out four and walked 
none. He allowed only an unearned run, lowering his ERA to 2.22. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rivera) is as good a competitor as there is and, to go with it, he's a good 
pitcher," Klitsner said. "He loves to compete and in a big game he rises to 
that level of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while Wednesday, however, it seemed as if Rivera's competitiveness would 
be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit stranded 11 runners in the first six innings against 
right-hander Andrew Settle (5-6), including three in the first, and could not 
produce the key hit that would have made Rivera's life easier. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mission, trailing, 1-0, finally broke through with three runs in the 
seventh to chase Settle, who had managed to frustrate despite giving up seven 
hits, walking six and hitting four batters. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the seventh, left fielder Derrick Ornelas was hit by a pitch 
and center fielder Gary Matthews followed with a single to right field. 
Designated hitter Francisco Flores knocked in both runners with a long single 
to the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Settle then retired second baseman John Toven on a fly to center but shortstop 
Rene Rodriguez tripled down the right-field line to drive in Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Enrique Garcia walked the next two batters, catcher Joey Gandara and 
right fielder Jesus Perez, to load the bases. He was replaced by Marvin Cobos, 
who was bailed out of the inning by catcher Tony Aguilar and second baseman 
Ernie Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar caught Gandara straying too far from second base and threw to Diaz, 
who gunned the ball back to Aguilar when Rodriguez tried to score on the throw 
to second. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in four innings that a Mission runner was thrown out at 
home to end an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out and the bases loaded in the fourth, Toven tried to score from 
third on a fly ball to left by third baseman Dave Valdez but was nailed at the 
plate on a perfect relay throw from third baseman Brendan Cowsill to Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning later, first baseman Rob Wally tried to score from first base with 
two out when Victor Cortez dropped a fly ball by Flores but was out on another 
relay throw home by Cowsill. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City scored in the first when shortstop Al Watson led off the game with a 
single to left and reached second when left fielder Derrick Ornelas bobbled the 
ball. He moved to third on a groundout and scored on a sacrifice fly to left by 
Diaz.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: ST. JOHN BOSCO'S JELANI GARDNER GETTING AN ASSIST 
FROM HIS DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recruiting process has come full circle in the Gardner family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1963, Tom Gardner, a 6-foot-3 guard, was an all-state 
basketball selection as a high school senior in Columbia, S.C. With segregation 
still a fact of life for black athletes in the South, Gardner's college options 
were limited. 
</P>
<P>
 All-expenses-paid campus recruiting visits? Not in his wildest dreams. Phone 
calls at all hours from curious college coaches, fans and media? Get real. Fact 
is, Gardner had neither met the head basketball coach nor seen the campus the 
day he showed at Morgan State to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to the spring of 1994. On Friday afternoon, in the gymnasium at 
St. John Bosco High in Bellflower, Tom Gardner's youngest son, Jelani, a 
polished 6-6 point guard, will announce to an audience of family, friends, 
classmates and media his college destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who averaged 25 points per game this past season while leading St. 
John Bosco to its first Southern Section championship in any sport, was one of 
the most heavily recruited players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A natural ballhandler who shoots accurately from three-point range, he has 
proved to be a leader on the court.  
</P>
<P>
 He will choose from among three schools -- UCLA, Arkansas or California -- 
after also considering Syracuse, Minnesota, Arizona and Arizona State, among 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the process alone. A priority of mine was being there for 
Jelani," said Tom Gardner, who, along with his wife, Linda, and sports agent 
James Casey, a relative, has helped guide his son throughout the recruiting 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy he chose to sign late (instead of during the November signing 
period). He's seen a lot of different programs, been to a lot of schools, 
talked to a lot of players. I think he'll be very comfortable with whatever 
decision he makes." 
</P>
<P>
 Comfortable? Now that's a feeling Jelani Gardner hasn't enjoyed in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more confused than ever," he said by phone from his hotel in Troy, Mich., 
while preparing to play in last Sunday's Magic Johnson high school all-star 
game at The Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors are weighing on Gardner's mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Arkansas, which recently won its first national basketball championship, 
he could be a key performer on a deep and talented team capable of winning a 
few more titles. But his patience could be tested, too, because the Razorbacks' 
top three guards return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the nation's No. 1 fan, President Clinton, cheering the team on, and a 
sparkling new 20,000-seat arena, Coach Nolan Richardson's program is the 
hottest in the country right now. "I was really happy for the guys," Gardner 
says, "but them winning the national championship is not going to affect my 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * At Cal, he would probably inherit the starting point guard position as a 
freshman, replacing Jason Kidd, who decided to forgo his final two years of 
college eligibility to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as they did with Kidd, the Bears have made a strong late run at Gardner, 
who for a long time rejected Cal because of the expected media and fan scrutiny 
likely to follow Kidd's successor. But a factor favoring the Bears is 
30-year-old Coach Todd Bozeman, who is "like a big brother," Gardner says. "It 
would be nice to have that kind of relationship with your coach." 
</P>
<P>
 * At UCLA, it's the chance to play at home, in front of family and friends, 
for a school he admits has long been closest to his heart. "Coach (Jim) Harrick 
and I have had a friendship since he first saw me play in eighth grade," 
Gardner says. "In my mind, I signed my letter of intent with the Bruins back 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Gardner: "I know UCLA needs a shooting guard, Cal needs a point guard and 
Arkansas could use another guard, too. I think I can fit in very well at all 
three places." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski had a dual purpose in Southern California last 
weekend: accompany senior All-American Grant Hill to the John R. Wooden Award 
ceremonies Friday at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and pay a visit to the home 
of Ventura College forward Brandon Jessie. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown Coach John Thompson also dropped by to see the 6-6 Jessie last 
week. Jessie was scheduled to visit Duke this weekend, but that trip has been 
canceled and the Blue Devils are out of the picture, as is UCLA. He still plans 
to take official trips to Georgetown and Arizona State and may also take an 
unofficial trip to UC Santa Barbara. Jessie recently visited Utah and Nevada 
Las Vegas.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: EVANS BRUSHES BACK HER DOUBTS ABOUT ATTENDING 
ARIZONA 
</P>

<P>
 Nancy Evans was right where she wanted to be, even if she sometimes doubted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was such a good softball pitcher at Hoover High she could have accepted 
a scholarship from just about any college. She chose Arizona, not because it 
has eclipsed UCLA as the best program in the country but because she preferred 
its academics and environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave my verbal commitment before they won the national championship (in 
1993)," said Evans, whose teams at Hoover never got past the second round of 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity to win a national title is very exciting to me, but (I 
decided to go to where I would be) most comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, she often would look at the western horizon, think about her family 
and friends and wonder what she was doing in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of days where I just wanted to go home," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 She struggled with the new academic load and college's softball pitching 
dimensions. The extra three feet from the rubber to the plate diminished Evans' 
biggest weapon, her rise ball. Virtually unhittable when she was in high 
school, the pitch was either sailing too high or flattening out. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans longed for those days at Hoover when she twice was named state player of 
the year by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stuck it out here," she said. "I'm glad I did. It's tough being a freshman 
again. It's a big change. It's a challenge. But I'm having a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans carries an 11-0 record for the No. 1-ranked Wildcats (40-2). Her 
earned-run average might be her highest: 1.49. Her strikeout-to-walk ratio is a 
respectable 47-17 (in 62 2/3 innings), which pales in comparison to the 
phenomenal 45-1 ratio she posted last season at Hoover.  
</P>
<P>
 But she's still adjusting to a smaller ball and the longer pitching distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not completely satisfied with anything I'm doing," she said. "I'm very 
happy to be 11-0, but I owe a lot to my teammates. The rise ball is a hard 
pitch to perfect. It took a while to get my release point. At 40 feet in high 
school, it just jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's improved a lot since the beginning of the year. But now I need to make 
it work every time I use it. When my rise ball is working, the other team has 
difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 In 41 games, Evans (the designated player or right fielder when she's not 
pitching) has five home runs, 32 runs batted in and is batting .377.  
</P>
<P>
 That would have been an astronomical average five years ago and it is still 
very good with the smaller, harder ball. But she's actually batting lower than 
Arizona's team average (.391). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on getting my top hand through and my pitch selection," 
Evans said. "I would say I was pretty aggressive in high school. I would go 
after pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Evans accomplished a remarkable feat during a recent doubleheader. She 
hit three consecutive home runs against eight-time national champion UCLA. Two 
came against Bruin ace DeeDee Weiman. 
</P>
<P>
 Home runs are nothing unusual in Tucson. The Wildcats have hit 60, breaking 
the record set last year by Cal State Northridge (40). Arizona shortstop Laura 
Espinoza (Wilmington Banning) has hit an NCAA-record 22.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the one word to describe it is incredible," Evans said. "Everybody in 
our lineup has the potential to hit a home run. Never in my life have I seen so 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually enjoy not having to worry about carrying a team on my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Living on her own for the first time, the studies, the travel and the level of 
competition have provided enough stress. When she flew home for spring vacation 
recently and headed straight for a Hoover game, Evans ran out of gas. She fell 
asleep while watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out for two innings," she said. "It was relaxing. I needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Evans isn't the only local product contributing to Arizona's 
success. Former high school rival Jenny Dalton (Glendale, .419 batting average, 
eight home runs, 52 RBIs), Amy Chellevold (Thousand Oaks, .471, team-high 18 
stolen bases) and Krista Gomez (Alemany, .310) played on the national 
championship team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State senior shortstop Kim Maher (Buena) leads the Bulldogs in average 
(.439), hits (50), runs (31), RBIs (29) and home runs (five). She has 146 RBIs 
in her career, four short of the NCAA record set by Fresno State's Gina 
LoPiccolo from 1987-90. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, freshman second baseman Stacy Kleiner (Taft) of Nevada Las Vegas 
shares the team lead in batting with a .341 average but is out indefinitely 
because of a stress fracture in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Davis senior outfielder Jason Shapiro (Taft) is batting .360. He leads the 
team with 26 stolen bases and 44 runs. He has struck out only 11 times in 114 
at-bats. . . . UCLA junior first baseman Mike Mitchell (Rio Mesa) is batting 
.323 with 25 RBIs.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: MATTHEWS' BIG NUMBERS HINT AT BIG BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College outfielder Gary Matthews is one player who apparently made a 
wise move by not signing to play professionally after the San Diego Padres 
picked him in the 13th round of last year's June draft. 
</P>
<P>
 His market value might be considerably higher after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, a switch-hitter from Granada Hills High and son of the former major 
leaguer whose name he bears, led the Free Spirit with seven home runs (five 
left-handed) as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was second in batting (.359 average) among players with 100 or more at-bats 
and third in runs batted in with 26. Last season, he batted .320 with two home 
runs and 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is playing more like a man than a little boy," Mission Coach John Klitsner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres own the rights to Matthews until the June draft, but that hasn't 
discouraged other teams from scouting the sophomore. Matthews also was drafted 
by the Minnesota Twins in the 38th round out of Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of interest in him right now," Klitsner said. "He's our top 
professional prospect. He has gotten stronger and his bat has some juice to 
it." JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless Brahmas Roll 
</P>
<P>
 Operating without a place to call its own hasn't hampered the drive toward a 
possible state championship for the Pierce men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas, who have been forced to practice and play matches in neutral 
courts because the school gym was condemned after the Jan. 17 earthquake, are 
14-0 overall and lead the Western State Conference at 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is a very cohesive group," Pierce Coach Ken Stanley said. "They 
have not been very spirited in practices but they have done everything we've 
asked them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Stanley said, few people would be overly excited during 1 1/2-hour 
workouts that call for the players and coaches to gather at 5:45 a.m. at Valley 
College, where the Brahmas now practice and play their home matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to walk in that gym at that hour and be fired up," Stanley said. 
CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Wise Decision? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fine line separating fearless and foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might think Northridge right-hander John Najar straddled the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar, who broke a bone in his right forearm last weekend while throwing a 
pitch in a game against San Diego State, knew he had a hairline crack in the 
bone for three weeks. After experiencing extreme pain in the forearm all 
season, Najar finally had it examined after a victory over Cal State Sacramento 
on March 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it was determined the bone was cracked, Coach Bill Kernen offered to let 
Najar sit as long as it took for the problem to mend. Najar was told by 
physicians that if he continued to pitch, the bone might break completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar weighed the risks. Already sidelined by an arm injury was Keven Kempton, 
another member of the three-man starting rotation. Najar also hoped he might be 
drafted in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were running out of guys," Najar said. "I had to (step) up for the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Najar demonstrated an ability to pitch in extreme pain, which might 
be enough for some folks to question his sanity. But pitchers are a breed 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Najar: "It hurt like hell, but I wanted (the ball)." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the Northridge baseball team hit its high-water mark for the 
year. A stirring comeback capped a three-game sweep of nationally ranked Hawaii 
at Northridge as the Matadors jumped atop the Western Athletic Conference West 
Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared during the series, replete with an obscene gesture from a 
Hawaii infielder. Matador players wondered aloud how they would be received by 
fans in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Hawaii's nose dive continued. In fact, the Rainbows are dead last in the 
WAC West at 4-8, and so much for the much-anticipated showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, junior first baseman Jason Shanahan, who made the trip to Honolulu 
last year, said there probably wouldn't have been much venom from the Rainbow 
fans anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They mostly kind of sit back and eat their snack bar food until Hawaii gives 
them something to cheer about," Shanahan said. "It's not the loudest place we 
play. It's hard to say (how we will be received now)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Northridge won one of three games at Hawaii, which plays in 
4,300-seat Rainbow Stadium, considered one of the best facilities in NCAA 
Division I. It has a synthetic surface and measures 340 feet down the lines and 
400 to center. The outfield wall is 12 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it isn't exactly homer-friendly Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge yard," Shanahan said. "For the most part, you try to stay normal 
(with the swing), but we can't hit 15 flies a game and expect to win. You need 
line drives there; anything else doesn't turn out real well unless you 
absolutely cream the ball." CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 SparkySpeak 
</P>
<P>
 Has Marty Slimak been hanging around with Sparky Anderson too much? 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of a short interview this week, Slimak, Cal Lutheran's 
baseball coach, referred to one of his players as "short for his size" and said 
another was "young for his age." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, the Detroit Tigers manager and legendary abuser of the English 
language, lives in Thousand Oaks during the off-season. He is a regular at Cal 
Lutheran's benefit golf tournament. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There have been scouts aplenty at Cal Lutheran baseball games this season. The 
Kingsmen have at least two players worth watching. Jason Wilson, the team's 
center fielder and leadoff hitter, is batting .338 -- and .421 in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference -- and has stolen 16 bases in 19 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior from Sacramento is a right-handed thrower, a left-handed hitter, a 
deft outfielder and getting better all the time. "If someone ever gave him a 
(professional) shot, they would be very pleased," Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson reaches base in almost half his plate appearances and he knows what to 
do once he gets there. Said Slimak, who has been a coach at Cal Lutheran five 
seasons: "He is by far a cut above anyone who has ever run the bases here." 
</P>
<P>
 The knock on Wilson is his size (5-foot-10). "But his bat has pop," Slimak 
said. "He's as solid as a brick, has great bat control and has great hands for 
the bunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sebbo is the other player Slimak said might have a major league future. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 senior has taken root at one position for the first time in his 
college career, and his defense is vastly improved. 
</P>
<P>
 A utility player last season, Sebbo won the catcher's job this year but was 
subsequently moved to third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we moved him to third, he's been almost flawless for us," Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebbo has four errors in 20 games and has been his usual force on offense. He 
is batting .392 -- .429 in conference games -- with 26 RBIs, two homers and a 
team-high nine doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for Chris Fick, he'd be leading this team in almost everything," 
Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fick, the team's designated hitter, is batting a team-best .477 and leads the 
Kingsmen with 10 homers and 33 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What does a team have to do to earn a little respect? 
</P>
<P>
 When the NCAA Division III baseball ratings came out two weeks ago, Cal 
Lutheran was ranked eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Between then and Monday, when the poll came out again, the Kingsmen played 
twice -- defeating Division II Cal State Los Angeles, 9-5, and Division I Cal 
State Northridge, 2-1. So where did Cal Lutheran move in the polls? 
</P>
<P>
 Down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (18-4-1) are ranked 10th in the latest poll, much to the 
amusement of their coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polls are real strange," " Slimak said. "Anybody who lives and dies with them 
is going to be in trouble anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Slimak likes Cal Lutheran's perch. "Maybe we'll sneak up on 
some people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do the cities of Newbury Park and Salem, Ore., have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, both places produce some pretty good small-college softball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Kingsmen's top players are from Salem and two other standouts are 
from Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Stevens, a sophomore from Sprague High in Salem, has a record of 7-3 as 
a pitcher and a batting average of .408. Shortstop Aimee Snider, a sophomore 
from South Salem High, has scored 27 runs, slugged three home runs and is 
batting .408. Snider's identical twin, Bekkah, is playing third base and 
batting .318 with 16 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two players from Newbury Park are pacing the team in batting 
average. Tracy Little, a freshman second baseman, is batting a team-best .513 
and leads Cal Lutheran with 33 runs scored and six stolen bases. Laree 
Reynolds, a senior outfielder, is batting .507 with six doubles, three homers 
and 25 RBIs. THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 Beck Draws Scouts 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have the record to prove it, but Chris Beck, the Mustangs' pitching 
ace, has been throwing well enough to draw the interest of professional scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, a senior right-hander, is 4-5, but he has struck out 109 in 76 innings 
-- an average of almost 13 per nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck's best pitch is his curveball, one which a scout told Master's Coach 
Chris Harrison graded out as a 48 on a scale of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a very good curveball," Harrison said. "That's what gets the 
attention from scouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck also has an improved fastball. His pitches are routinely clocked in the 
mid-80s, a five-mile-an-hour improvement from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck already owns school career records for 26 victories, 311 strikeouts and 
327 1/3 innings. Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal Lutheran on Friday will play its first SCIAC baseball game in 41 days. 
During that span, the Kingsmen have played only seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 * With 10 Foothill Conference baseball games remaining, Antelope Valley 
(11-11, 5-8) already has equaled its 1993 victory total in conference games and 
has won five more games overall than last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * It may not have been conventional, but it worked. In Pepperdine's 18-4 
pasting of Northridge, the Waves three times removed pitchers after the count 
reached 2 and 0. All three times, the new pitcher retired the Northridge 
batter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge set a dubious team record Tuesday. Matador pitchers unloaded 
three wild pitches against Pepperdine to bring the team's season total to 53, 
breaking the single-season mark set in 1993 of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge enters a three-game series at Hawaii this weekend with an 18-19 
record. In his six-year tenure, only once has one of Coach Bill Kernen's teams 
lost more than 20 games. Northridge was 39-22 in 1990, his second year. Sixteen 
regular-season games remain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beth Burton of Cal State Northridge moved to fourth on the all-time Matador 
list in the women's shotput with a third-place effort of 47-7 1/4 in Saturday's 
meet against UCLA and UC Irvine. The mark exceeded the provisional qualifying 
standard (47-2) for the NCAA track and field championships at Boise State in 
June.

SCORE DUCKS' FIRST SEASON A BIG WINNER; SPORTS: HOCKEY TEAM WAS MIGHTY AT BOX 
OFFICE AND SOUVENIR STAND, AND PRETTY GOOD ON THE ICE TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, talk of an Anaheim hockey team brought guffaws and snickers. After 
all, Southern California was sunshine, Hollywood and Disneyland. But Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 But the year-old Mighty Ducks have become a sports phenomenon and the 
top-selling merchandiser in the National Hockey League -- if not all sports -- 
while posting a relatively sizzling 33 season wins, before Wednesday night's 
disappointing season finale, a record for a first-year hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a team that outraged hockey purists when Disney's President and 
CEO Michael Eisner decided on the name. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that not only have the Ducks earned a respectable fourth place in the 
Pacific Division of the National Hockey League's Western Conference, but their 
public persona, including the franchise name and nicknames, its home at "the 
Pond," and the goofy "fowl with a scowl" duck-billed cap, has transcended the 
game itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks have reminded all of us what sports is supposed to be all about, 
which is pure fun," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. "That's how I feel about the 
Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Kings may have the game's all-time leading scorer in Wayne 
Gretzky, but the Mighty Ducks were born of a movie that sent hundreds of youths 
outdoors playing street hockey, Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Angels baseball team gave the city economic vigor and national 
standing, the Ducks affirmed the city's $103-million gamble, with partner Ogden 
Entertainment Services, that if it built the Anaheim Arena, a team would come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected the team to be successful, but this is one of the most amazing 
success stories in sports," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' logo may become the biggest seller of merchandise in all 
North American pro sports, bigger than basketball's Chicago Bulls and 
football's Los Angeles Raiders, said NHL officials. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no league attendance ranking, the Mighty Ducks said they 
believe they are in the top five in the league. The stadium holds 17,174, and 
the team averages 16,979. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sold out tonight," Robert Scichili, a Mighty Ducks spokesman, said 
Wednesday before the Ducks' season-closing game against the Vancouver Canucks. 
(They lost, 2-1.) "We posted 27 sellouts in our first year out of 41 games at 
the Pond. . . . The last 25 were sold out. You can't have a sellout unless the 
suites are sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, there were fears that Orange County fans would sit on their hands 
in a deadly politeness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people said they were afraid that Orange County would produce a white 
wine and Ceasar salad bunch," said Judge William W. Bedsworth, who is both an 
Orange County Superior Court judge and home-game goal judge. "But fans have 
turned out to be fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 (Bedsworth added that his two jobs this year have earned him the nickname 
"Judge Judge" and greetings such as, "Your Honor Your Honor.") 
</P>
<P>
 Aided somewhat by the arena's electronic pyrotechnics -- a scoreboard that 
explodes in visual displays with each Mighty Duck goal -- Orange County fans 
have become quick learners, team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, we had some people who haven't been exposed to hockey until the 
Gretzky trade and when our franchise began," Scichili said. "Now, I've had 
people call me up and ask, 'Can you please explain a particular rule, like what 
is a goal-against average?' I always explain the answer to them because it 
shows they are really curious." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to all this enthusiasm is the Pond itself, which NHL officials 
have called a great arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team representative and NHL official has found some reason to come to 
this building and has just marveled," Bedsworth said. "It's a great building to 
see hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 For fan Gary Desrouchers of Villa Park, the whole season has been a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Desroucher, an L.A. Kings fan who nevertheless decided to invest in a 14-game 
Mighty Ducks package for the inaugural year, said he plans to do it again next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife the Ducks wouldn't win more than 10 games this year," he said. 
"And what have they won -- like 33? Plus, they lack talented players as 
compared to the Kings. These guys may end up in the playoffs next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and Gail Larsen of Corona were decked out Wednesday night in Mighty Ducks 
shirts, jackets and caps, and each had a duck call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came to the first game of the year, and I fell in love with it," said 
Gail, 32. "And you know what we just did? We walked up to the booth to get 
information for season tickets for next year."

VATICAN OKS USE OF GIRLS AS ALTAR SERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER and WILLIAM MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a break with tradition, the Vatican has officially approved girls serving 
at the altar during Roman Catholic Masses but stressed Wednesday that the 
decree is unrelated to the church's opposition to women priests. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's decision was not unexpected. Bishops in the United States have 
long voiced support for girls serving at the altar. Indeed, many U.S. Catholic 
parishes have had altar girls for years, but their status has been clouded and 
a cause for disagreement among the faithful. The Vatican agreed to consider the 
issue a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By unambiguously granting girls the same privileges as boys to assist priests 
at Mass -- the central act of Catholic worship -- the Vatican has all but ended 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Altar servers, generally ages 8 to 14, assist the priest by lighting altar 
candles, participate in the ritual washing of the priest's hands, and present 
the bread and wine to the priest to be consecrated as the body and blood of 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy of the Diocese of Orange has been to exclude girls from serving at 
the altar, said diocesan spokesman Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy of the diocese has been consistent with the policy of the Vatican 
until now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some local parishes have skirted the policy and allowed girls to 
serve at Mass, Baird said, none of the 23 Orange County parishes contacted 
Wednesday said they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, president of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops, called the decision a welcome one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone will accept it. They'll have to accept it," said Father 
Charles Miller, who teaches homiletics and liturgy at St. John's Seminary in 
Camarillo. "No one wants to say little girls are inferior or little girls don't 
deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was dissent. Women for Faith & Family, a conservative Catholic lay 
group based in St. Louis, called the decision a "pastoral error" that would 
cause further confusion and unduly raise hopes that women would eventually be 
ordained as priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tripoli, a onetime seminarian who supervises 22 altar boys at St. Mary's 
By-The-Sea Catholic Church in Huntington Beach, echoed the dissenters' 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a connection between altar boys and wanting to become a priest. 
Altar girls give people the false hope that girls will one day become priests," 
said Tripoli, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of Catholic parishes in the United States have had both 
altar boys and altar girls since the mid-1980s, including some in the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 These parishes relied on a change in canon law in 1983, which, unlike previous 
church codes, no longer specifically forbade altar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Altadena. Father Richard 
Prindle, the parish's pastor, said Wednesday that the Vatican announcement may 
come as a surprise to his altar servers. "I think they're probably completely 
unaware there was ever an issue," Prindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parishes, however, like many in Orange County, have awaited an explicit 
authorization from the Vatican before allowing girls to serve. "There was a 
feeling that maybe some had jumped the gun," said Father Gregory Coiro, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the issue has been clarified, Coiro and Miller said, tensions should 
ease. They said much of the opposition was not related to girls serving at the 
altar as such, but to allowing the practice before the Vatican had clarified 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minds of some people, it was sort of a litmus test of how loyal you 
were to the Holy See whether you allowed female altar servers or not," Coiro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval, announced Wednesday by papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro, came in 
a letter by the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of 
the Sacraments that was approved by Pope John Paul II. In 1992, the 
Congregation for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts had said there was 
nothing in canon law to forbid altar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Permission for the use of altar girls does not represent a major innovation, 
Navarro said, but rather an interpretation that church statutes concerning lay 
altar servers are equally applicable to both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the authorization, local bishops have the last word on whether to 
authorize altar girls in their dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether Orange County Bishop Norman McFarland would change the 
policy here. Baird said McFarland would not comment on the new Vatican decree 
until he had a chance to read it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles archdiocese, the nation's most populous, will introduce 
guidelines next week, Coiro said. The guidelines, among other things, ask 
parish priests to fully explain the changes to parishioners.

LAGUNA NIGUEL TREES FELLED, TEMPERS RISE; DISPUTE: MOVE BY HOMEOWNERS 
ASSOCIATION DIVIDES RESIDENTS IN AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A four-year dispute over tall trees and blocked ocean views has escalated into 
a mini-war in an affluent neighborhood here after 200 eucalyptus trees were 
abruptly cut down this week by the local homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies responded Tuesday and Wednesday to reports of unrest in the 
151-home Potomac Landing community, where tree crews say they were threatened 
with a shotgun, shoves were exchanged, and members of the Potomac Landing 
Homeowners Assn. were yelling at each other on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid for myself and my children," said Debra Marcus of Broadhorn Drive, 
who supports the tree removal. "There have been threats made by people around 
here. . . . There is an atmosphere of fear in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has long festered and deeply divided the tiered, hillside 
community near Niguel Road and Camino del Avion. Hilltop homeowners -- who say 
they paid up to $100,000 extra for distant ocean views, which slowly 
disappeared as the trees grew to heights of 30 feet -- wanted the trees 
eliminated. But residents living along the streets below reveled in the 
parklike atmosphere provided by the eucalyptus rising from the slopes behind 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis boiled over when crews, under orders from the homeowners 
association, began felling the trees on Tuesday. The work was finished 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Pash, a Lanteen Circle resident, said her 10-year-old son came home from 
school Tuesday, crying. "I asked him what was wrong, and he said: 'My trees, my 
trees are gone.' They cut down his favorite climbing tree and did it 
deliberately in a way so nobody had a chance to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The association's decision to act stemmed from a vote in February, when a new 
board was elected and the new majority decided to eliminate the trees quickly 
and quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Threats of lawsuits had been made in the past," association President John 
Kay explained Wednesday. "We thought this would be in the best interests of 
everybody, not just the select few who are upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay said the trees were cut down because they cost $9,000 annually to trim; 
many were rotting and considered a fire hazard, and "thirdly, blocked the views 
of a lot of people who paid a lot of money for those views." Kay's own house is 
among those on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused by pro-tree residents of making the decision during a clandestine 
session, Kay said the board "had a closed-door meeting, not a secret meeting." 
However, he acknowledged that notices of the session were not sent to 
association members. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant number of the eucalyptus trees will be replaced by acacia 
saplings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new trees will grow; time will heal the wounds here," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, as Kay was being interviewed by a reporter, he was verbally 
accosted on the sidewalk by a group of angry residents who demanded an 
explanation for the mass tree removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just wanted to get rid of our trees behind our backs," one woman angrily 
told Kay. "Don't lie to us." 
</P>
<P>
 When Debra Marcus and her husband, Alan, came up behind Kay to speak in favor 
of the restored views and about increased hostility in the neighborhood, 
pro-tree residents went further on the offensive.

<P>
 "You have been threatened? Good -- you should be threatened," a woman resident 
told Debra Marcus. "You lose what I've lost, then you can talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners were in tears on Wednesday over the fallen trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't see my decks before," said Judy Frugard, who now has 14 stumps 
on her property. "It was like living in a park setting. I hope this is illegal 
what they have done, because if not, it's definitely immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry tree advocates say they will attend today's association meeting in 
force, and they plan to investigate the possibility of recalling the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is not about trees, it's about views," said Frugard's husband, 
Gary, at a gathering of concerned residents Wednesday night. "We need to recall 
this board quickly and cut off their ability to spend our money." 
</P>
<P>
 The trees were scattered along several streets, slopes and on homeowners' 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 As is standard with homeowners groups, the association can perform maintenance 
work on members' private property, said association officials. But some 
residents said the tree cuttings went far beyond normal maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Frugard said the first workers showed up midmorning Tuesday "and five seconds 
after I noticed them, the first tree was gone. I went out there to stop them 
and they ignored me. We had absolutely no notice about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the neighborhood, other homeowners saw their trees being felled and 
tried to halt the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Robinson, 68, said when he ran outside to protest, one of the workers 
approached him with "a vicious look and his chain saw running. I got scared so 
I ran inside and grabbed my shotgun and went back out. But they knew it wasn't 
loaded because I pumped it a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
 A foreman for B&J Tree Service in Tustin had a different account of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, (Robinson) kind of wrapped himself around one of the trees," said the 
foreman, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "He went in 
his house and came back with the shotgun and started waving that around. He 
pointed that thing at me and I said: 'Hey, man, I'm just doing my job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Joe Davis confirmed that deputies had responded to 
a disturbance at the scene. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Former association board member Sheila Longerbone said she would have 
advocated "street by street removal, not all at one time. I didn't realize it 
would be so drastic a change here with all the trees gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Although morale "has gone to hell in a handbasket out here," she concluded, 
"two years from now, the neighborhood will be better off."

MANY LEGISLATORS RELIEVED AT RECALL'S FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before Election Day, Sen. David A. Roberti's chances of beating the 
recall started looking rosy to many of his Democratic colleagues in the state 
Capitol. Some, in fact, seemed to be sizing up the length of Roberti's 
coattails well before returns were tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, were wary of a chill that might have beset the Legislature if 
gun owners had managed to oust a lawmaker in retaliation for firearms control 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt all were glad that it was Roberti -- and not them -- who blazed a 
trail through the expensive, draining and possibly politically damaging recall 
process set in motion by activists angered over his 1989 assault weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few legislators will admit it publicly, seeing Roberti battle the 
first recall attempt against a state official in 80 years made them squeamish, 
Capitol observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was watching it, even if they were not talking about it," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 If Roberti's struggle was viewed as a litmus test of how the public feels 
about gun control, then his victory was regarded in Sacramento as a sign that 
perhaps the time had come to stand up to the gun lobby. Few, however, could 
ignore that the election had cost Roberti more than $650,000, a fact that was 
expected to temper enthusiasm for new measures. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three other Sacramento lawmakers have been targeted for recall 
attempts or Election Day defeats by firearms rights advocates left energized by 
the San Fernando Valley campaign, even it if did fail. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those targeted is Katz, who is convinced that fallout from the 20th 
Senate District recall attempt led to the defeat in January of his bill to 
increase penalties for carrying a concealed gun. Both he and Roberti believe 
that skittish lawmakers voted down the bill because they fretted about becoming 
recall targets themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 That worry may have some merit, to hear gun rights activists tell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the concealed-weapon bill is more wood for the fire," said Manny 
Fernandez, an original organizer of the Roberti recall attempt. "Richard knows 
that he's next. He knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, it does not necessarily follow that Roberti's defeat of the recall 
will open the floodgates on gun control measures in the Legislature, observers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 While Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) voiced concern that a 
successful ouster of Roberti would have added "a chill to the process of moving 
toward serious gun regulations in the state," he did not believe that a Roberti 
victory would encourage an avalanche of new support for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think members of both houses are pretty much solidified on the issue," 
Brown said, noting Tuesday that he was so optimistic Roberti would win that he 
had placed a bet on the recall's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz and state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) predicted Roberti's 
showing could prompt some legislators, particularly rural Democrats reluctant 
to support firearms restrictions, to clamber aboard the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll nudge them over the line on gun control," said Petris. "Those 
wondering what to do, or on the fence, this will certainly encourage them over 
the side to come out swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), who is running for state controller, 
voted against Katz's concealed-weapon bill in January but said he has had a 
change of heart and now plans to vote for the new version Katz reintroduced two 
weeks ago. What made the difference for Areias, he said, is an amendment he 
expects will protect duck hunters from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias said about 7,000 National Rifle Assn. members in his district 
circulated recall petitions against him after he voted for the assault weapon 
ban and a 15-day gun purchase waiting period that is now California law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members watching the recall are concerned with the tactics these powerful 
special interests use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris has also been fingered as a recall subject by Gun Owners of California, 
one of the groups that backed the attempt to unseat Roberti. In a recent letter 
urging members to send cash to help defeat Roberti, former Sen. H. L. (Bill) 
Richardson called Petris a "nerd" and "the most vocal bleeding heart liberal in 
the Senate." Richardson is a founder of the gun owners group and formerly 
served on the Senate Judiciary committee with both Roberti and Petris. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat, Petris says, merely serves to "sends us a message to fight back." 
Voters watching the Roberti recall may be left with the overriding impression 
of the senator as a fighter, Petris said, and other lawmakers may see the 
benefit of building that same public image. "I don't think recalls are going to 
intimidate anybody anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense that Roberti would pull out of the recall a winner seemed to spread 
in the Capitol days before the election. "Several persons have made the 
observation in the past week that if anything, this was going to help him," 
Petris noted. 
</P>
<P>
 That perception may have signaled to lawmakers that there was little political 
risk in signing up for a last-minute blitz to aid their colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democratic lawmakers donated money to Roberti's effort. Last week, 
Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) got two bills passed by a Senate committee 
to make it more difficult for "gun fanatics" to schedule recall challenges in 
costly, low-turnout special elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Petris and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), 
flew to Los Angeles to walk precincts for their colleague on election eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris, for one, wore the hat of a precinct worker, knocking on the doors of 
targeted loyal Democrats who hadn't yet voted as of 4 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said the outpouring of support from state legislators marked a 
turning point in the sensitive recall campaign, which Roberti's opponents had 
hoped would send a message to politicians that they are all vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the three months of the election (campaign), I have seen not a single 
elected senator or assemblyman stand next to Roberti," Fernandez said. "If they 
decide to come in at the last minute, it's very courageous of them. Now, we 
will know exactly who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 One exception is Katz, who was a visible supporter at Roberti's $250-a-plate 
fund-raising dinner at the Biltmore Hotel in March and whom the senator praised 
that evening for his gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Fernandez sees it, Katz astutely smelled a winner early on and -- 
sensing public support for gun control at a time of rising concern over street 
violence -- tried on the martyr's cloak that Roberti had figuratively wrapped 
himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard knows there's very little he can do to get off our list, so he's 
basically radicalizing himself, trying to see if he can get some of the support 
that is going to Roberti." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, just days after a Los Angeles Times poll showed Roberti soundly 
beating the recall, Katz held a news conference at Parker Center with Los 
Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams and other top law enforcement figures to 
announce the reintroduction of his concealed-weapon bill. If passed, the bill 
would enable prosecutors to charge people carrying guns without a permit with a 
misdemeanor or a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz insists his timing had more to do with showing his resolve than with 
opportunism. He considered waiting until after the recall to reintroduce the 
bill, he said. "But the reason I chose to do it earlier was I wanted to make it 
clear that regardless of what happened in the recall, we were going ahead with 
this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the Roberti battle, Katz believes, is that the curtain has been 
pulled back on the gun lobby, revealing its tactics and motives -- and also the 
myth of its power in shaping public policy.

BILL TO HELP COLORFUL FISH GETS HOOK AFTER PANEL HEARS IT ISN'T IN DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 An Assembly committee scuttled an Orange County lawmaker's efforts Wednesday 
to have the garibaldi, the flamboyant-hued fish that frequents Southern 
California waters, named the state's official saltwater fish and establish a 
six-year moratorium on its capture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Ways and Means Committee killed the measure by Assemblyman Bill 
Morrow (R-Oceanside) after hearing arguments from commercial collectors and 
aquarium hobbyists that the bright orange fish does not need protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill blamed the defeat on partisan politics. The 23-member 
panel voted 10 to 7, failing to achieve the 12 votes needed to push the bill to 
the Assembly floor. Democrats cast all seven votes against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am stunned," said Jim Hall, a spokesman for Ocean Futures, a Huntington 
Beach group pushing for protection of the garibaldi. "Apparently, some people 
couldn't see past their party politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, however, said the bill may have failed more because of circumstances 
than partisanship. The assemblyman, whose district includes parts of south 
Orange County, said he had enough votes but that several committee members who 
support the measure were busy in other hearings and failed to show for the Ways 
and Means hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reluctant," Morrow said, "to suggest this is some sort of partisan 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said the bill, which in March sailed through the Assembly Wildlife 
Committee on an 8-4 vote, was ripe for defeat because the garibaldi is not 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sound basis in science for protecting this fish," said Steve 
Robinson, owner of a Los Angeles firm that imports and exports aquarium fish. 
"The numbers of garibaldi are quite acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the market for the fish among aquarium aficionados is relatively 
limited, in part because the garibaldi is a "belligerent" creature that makes a 
bad tank companion for other species. "This is not a mass-market fish," he 
said. "The market demand is low enough to keep the collectors from taking too 
many." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the state Department of Fish and Game said they have no evidence 
that commercial collecting has seriously depleted the garibaldi population. A 
total of 104 aquarium permits were issued last year, with about 108 pounds -- 
approximately 462 adult-sized garibaldi -- reported legally caught. 
</P>
<P>
 But boosters of Morrow's bill contend that far more fish are being taken than 
the Fish and Game Department has recorded. Most, they suggest, are going 
overseas to fill private aquariums in Asia, where their brilliant color makes 
them prized as symbols of long life and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall also noted that a lobbyist for the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council 
weighed in on behalf of opponents of the bill. In addition, he questioned why 
collectors would lobby so hard against the measure if it is true that fewer 
than 500 garibaldi are taken each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were only taking a few hundred fish a year, we wouldn't be seeing the 
problems we're seeing," Hall said. "In some areas they're endangered right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow argued that depletion of the fish in Southern California waters could 
have an impact on the scuba industry. Scuba divers welcome garibaldi for their 
photogenic colors. The assemblyman said an outright ban on collection permits 
would cost the state only about $6,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian general who wore garish tunics, the 
fish stick to shallow waters off the coast of Santa Catalina Island, Laguna 
Beach and other spots along the Southland coast. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, state lawmakers have enacted legislation banning 
the collection of garibaldi off Catalina until the year 2000, when the western 
side of the island is to reopen to collection. Legislators also restricted 
collection during November, December and January and imposted stiff permit fees 
for collectors and wholesalers ranging from $330 to $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said there are only about three licensed collectors now working in 
Southern California waters. The fish are captured with a vacuum device.

TWO OTHERS SAY THEY WERE MOLESTED AS JUVENILES BY CAPTURED FUGITIVE; 
INVESTIGATION: THE MEN CAME FORWARD AFTER READING OF STANLEY JENSON'S ARREST IN 
A 1981 CASE. THE FORMER LA HABRA RESIDENT HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY.

<P>
 Two more men have alleged to police that they were molested as children by 
Stanley Jenson, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that he molested a 
boy 13 years ago and then fled to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men separately called La Habra police Tuesday night after reading news 
accounts about Jenson, 46, formerly of La Habra, and told Detective Kirk 
Lotzgesell that the molestation suspect also molested them as boys, Lotzgesell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson, an attorney who practiced in Brea, was charged in 1981 with 21 felony 
counts of misconduct with a minor. The charges involved a 13-year-old neighbor 
he had hired to mow his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotzgesell said that one of the men who came forward this week said he had 
been molested three times between the ages of 14 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whom Lotzgesell described as a North Orange County resident now in 
his late 20s, "told me he said that, obviously, he is relieved that Mr. Jenson 
is in custody, not so much because of what he did to him, but because this 
meant he will not do this to other little kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After news of Jenson's arrest appeared in the paper, the detective said, the 
man informed his family of the alleged molestations for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In North County Municipal Court Wednesday, Jenson's attorney, Mike McDonnell, 
entered a not-guilty plea and asked that bail be set at $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bottom line is," he said after the arraignment, "he was coming back here to 
surrender anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 But Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton, who heads the Orange 
County district attorney office's sexual assault and child abuse unit, 
disagreed. He said that because Jenson fled before, and as a lawyer knew the 
ramifications of the charges, he should be held without bail. And because there 
could be more than one victim, "it's a much more serious case," he said, asking 
that bail be set at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stephen J. Sundvold set bail at $2 million. A preliminary hearing was 
set for May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson, wearing an orange jumpsuit, said in a sonorous voice from behind a 
wire cage that he understood he was waiving his right to have a hearing within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the arraignment, Jenson's mother said she was not sure what to make of 
the case. Asked if she thought her son was innocent, she said, "I don't know 
for sure. I wasn't there" at the time and hadn't been with him constantly since 
he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she plans to visit him in Orange County Jail today and that she has 
been "keeping busy and trying to understand what happened." She said she has 
received hundreds of telephone calls since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson fled to Australia in December, 1981, a few weeks after molestation 
charges were filed. He began a new life there as a stage manager with a theater 
company, calling himself Stuart Thomas Allen, Middleton said. Jenson was aware 
then, his attorney said, that a warrant for his arrest had been issued in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson, who is single, stayed there until March 20, 1994, when he apparently 
learned that Australian officials planned to deport him because of his living 
there illegally, Lotzgesell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deportation effort began after Jenson was charged in 1992 with possession 
of marijuana. When Australian authorities ran his fingerprints, they found out 
he was there under an alias and contacted La Habra police. Australian officials 
"kept on it, knowing that we wanted him," Lotzgesell said, and in November, 
1993, they began the deportation paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson bought a ticket for South Africa, Germany and England, his attorney 
said, and went to South Africa on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 1, he was arrested in South Africa on an international arrest warrant 
and was in custody there until April 9, when U.S. marshals could bring him 
back, Lotzgesell said. La Habra police detectives took custody of him on April 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 He could face a 42-year sentence if found guilty on 11 counts of oral 
copulation, 10 counts of child molestation, and two counts of possession and 
distribution of marijuana in the United States. The sentence could be even 
longer, depending on whether charges are filed in connection with the men who 
called police this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson became a suspect in 1981 after he reported he had been burglarized and 
named several youths as possible suspects, including the 13-year-old. When 
questioned, the boy said Jenson had molested him, Lotzgesell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That person, now 26, wants to cooperate with the prosecution because "it's a 
chapter in life that needs to be closed," Lotzgesell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The man now lives in the Midwest with a wife and two children, Lotzgesell 
said.

IRS TARGETS PREPARERS IN FRAUD CASES; FINANCE: THE AGENCY IS KEEPING AN EYE OUT 
FOR THOSE MAKING BOGUS EARNED INCOME CREDIT CLAIMS ELECTRONICALLY FOR TAXPAYERS 
AND THEN KEEPING PART OF THE REFUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the deadline for filing tax returns approaches Friday, the Internal Revenue 
Service is lying in wait for a growing number of unscrupulous tax preparers who 
appear to be preying on low-income and non-English-speaking taxpayers -- making 
electronic claims for fraudulent refunds and then keeping part for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS discovered last year that in several areas of the country -- most 
notably Southern California, Chicago and Florida -- a number of people were 
falsely claiming to qualify for the earned income tax credit, a tax break 
intended for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about one in four such claims were rejected because of error or 
fraud, IRS officials said. Bogus earned income credit claims are expected to 
total $5 billion for the 1993 tax year, up from $3.4 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was so severe in Southern California that the Laguna Niguel 
district, which encompasses Orange County and four other counties, formed a 
task force last fall to look at the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 After its review, it found that most of those who falsely claimed the credit 
also were filing by electronic means to get a refund more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraudulent electronic filing throughout the United States doubled last year 
over the previous year, according to the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon further examination of the situation here, the IRS in Laguna Niguel found 
that a majority of those fraudulent cases involved the same groupings of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about those with low incomes, those who don't speak English and 
the low educated," IRS spokeswoman Judith A. Golden said. "Those are the people 
who are being victimized." 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, the local IRS began looking more closely at the earned income 
credit, freezing numerous refunds that relied on the credit in order to have 
money returned. Those tax preparers who filed more than 10 returns on behalf of 
clients in which the credit was claimed were sent letters warning them of new 
scrutiny to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tax preparers were suspended and told they could not file returns for two 
years. Others received "educational visits" by IRS officials explaining the 
regulations for taking the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials refused to say how many refunds were frozen or how many 
preparers were suspended, but said they can be liable for up to $1,000 in civil 
penalties for each false return if the IRS can prove a pattern of willful 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 An earned income credit can be taken if all of the following apply: a 
individual earned less than $23,050; had a job; and was single, widowed or 
married and filing a joint tax return. A child also must have lived with the 
taxpayer in the United States for more than six months of the year, and must be 
younger than 19, a full-time student younger than 24, or permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud involving earned income credit usually occurs when someone falsely 
claims to have children or has understated a child's age, has falsely claimed 
to have a job, or when married couples who make too much money claim to be 
divorced to qualify for the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit can translate into a refund of up to $2,364 per return, even if 
someone paid no federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden says the IRS has a new computer program that allows it to find out 
whether someone has children or a job. Less effective, officials say, is the 
means to check marital status. With its computer, the IRS can check the ages 
and Social Security numbers of dependents claimed on earned income forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of our biggest problems and it's a big chunk of money," Golden 
said. "Some of these returns have fallen into the 'abusive' category." Tax Time 
Tribulations 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers wanting an extension on filing their income tax returns can pick up 
the needed forms at the following locations: 
</P>
<P>
 Internal Revenue Service  
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Building, 34 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Building, 24000 Avila Road, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 Offices are open 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m., but forms will be available outside after 
hours.

TUSTIN PULLS ITS MONEY OUT OF COUNTY PORTFOLIO; FINANCES: CITY CITES WHAT IT 
CALLS RISKY INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. TREASURER ROBERT L. CITRON THINKS BID TO 
UNSEAT HIM IS MOTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move shrouded in politics, the city of Tustin has withdrawn about $4 
million from Orange County's investment pool since last month, citing overly 
risky investment strategies used by longtime county Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes in the midst of a political campaign in which Citron, now 
seeking reelection, has been criticized for his "aggressive" management of a 
$7.5-billion portfolio involving funds contributed by 187 public agencies 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the change because we just weren't comfortable with the risks that 
the county was taking," Tustin City Councilman Jeffrey Thomas said Wednesday. 
"If you've been following the bond market these days, you know that there have 
been a lot of people getting hammered." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is an ally of Citron's political opponent, John Moorlach, but he said 
the city's decision had nothing to do with Moorlach's campaign to unseat the 
six-term treasurer. It is the first time in 24 years that Citron has been 
challenged for his low-profile seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this will look very much like politics," said Thomas, a member of 
Moorlach's campaign finance committee, "but I don't mind it looking that way. I 
think the city will come out smelling like a rose because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged, Citron said Wednesday that city officials never expressed concern to 
him before pulling out of the county pool, and he added that Thomas' connection 
to the Moorlach campaign "speaks volumes" about the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult when you have the type of reputation I have to have some 
people attack your character . . . for purely partisan political purposes," 
Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Treasurer Ronald A. Nault said city officials had been contemplating 
the move for some months because of a growing concern for the county's use of 
"reverse repurchase agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the complex strategy, the investor typically borrows U.S. Treasury bonds 
against existing collateral and then sells them to invest in higher-yielding 
bonds. As long as the county borrows at a lower rate than the return on the 
security in which it invests, the strategy works. 
</P>
<P>
 But with interest rates on the rise and the stock market in flux, Nault said 
the city's audit committee advised officials last month to remove all the 
city's cash from the county pool, even though the city had earned about 
$100,000 during the eight months it was a member. 
</P>
<P>
 That amounts to an annual return of 3.75% on the city's investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nault acknowledged that the city saw a respectable return on its investment, 
but officials there were still wary and decided to pull their $4 million and 
reinvest it on their own.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council was not required to approve the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no reflection on Bob Citron or his ability, but the (investment 
strategy) was way beyond my ability to manage it," Nault said. "For lack of a 
better word, it was a risky proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Nault acknowledged that Thomas played an important role in the city's 
decision, but the city treasurer said "politics did not enter the discussion at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, a 38-year-old certified public accountant in Costa Mesa and 
financial planner, said he did not advise the city to pull out of the county 
investment pool. However, he did say that Thomas -- a friend as well as 
political ally -- became concerned about the county's activities and the city's 
investment while researching information for the Moorlach campaign. The two 
then discussed the issue before Thomas became involved at the city level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I counsel Mr. Thomas to pull the city's money out of the county pool? No 
way," Moorlach said. "I think the city was just doing its job. Pulling out is 
nothing dramatic, but it certainly is prudent." 
</P>
<P>
 Since announcing his candidacy, Moorlach has questioned Citron's investment 
practices and has submitted a request under the state open records law asking 
for details about where the county's funds are invested and what brokers are 
handling the county accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Moorlach said he is concerned about Citron's use of the reverse 
repurchase agreements to win higher returns for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous," the candidate said, "you better believe I'm nervous. I'm 
praying that the county money is OK. Everyone should be concerned, because this 
is public money." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyman Grossman, managing director of Standard & Poors' municipal finance 
department in New York, said Wednesday that over-dependence on reverse 
repurchase agreements can be cause for concern in some cases, but he was not 
familiar with details of the Orange County portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you try to squeeze out extra yield, sometimes you get burned," Grossman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citron said adequate safeguards have been built into the county's 
investment strategy for the protection of the pool's clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those contingency plans includes a $1.5-billion cash account to cover 
agency investments should they wish to leave the pool. Citron said Tustin has 
been the only agency to express a desire to leave the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he has been engaging in the repurchase strategy for nearly 15 
years with no reported failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know there are people on the City Council who are tied to partisan 
politics who are trying to make an issue out of the safety of this investment 
pool," Citron said. "This was not a complete surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 As the only Democrat in an elective office in county government, Citron said 
Republicans are injecting politics into a nonpartisan race as pay-back for his 
involvement four years ago in the hard-fought election victory of Democratic 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that election, Citron has said, he and Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas 
Fuentes were friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Fuentes didn't like what I did then," Citron said. "He told me, 'I'm 
going to get you.' " Fuentes was out of the country Wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, who is the assistant treasurer for the Orange County GOP Central 
Committee, has said that he consulted with Fuentes before announcing his 
candidacy, but only as proper political "etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
 County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, a Republican, said the 
Tustin decision would not shake his longtime support for Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think back with some horror about how we could have done some of 
things we've done in this county without (Citron)," Riley said. "He has my full 
confidence."

3RD COUNCIL SEAT UNDECIDED IN SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two incumbents have reclaimed their City Council posts here, but the third 
must wait until 200 outstanding ballots are counted to know if she erased an 
eight-vote lead by a former high school district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Jill Klajic and H. Clyde Smyth both received 13% of the total votes 
cast for the council -- with Smyth ahead 3,740 to 3,732 votes. In the election, 
10,452 people voted. 
</P>
<P>
 About 175 absentee ballots and 25 provisional votes -- those cast by residents 
not listed on their precinct's voting roll but believed to be registered -- 
were turned in to polling places on election day. They will be counted today or 
Friday, after voters' signatures are verified, said city public information 
officer Gail Foy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, neither Klajic or Smyth are claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is I have not won anything," said Smyth, 62, who served as 
superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates represent very different philosophies. Klajic supports 
growth control and environmental causes over business interests, while Smyth is 
pro-development and the infrastructure benefits it brings a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized it was going to be close and tight and difficult to beat an 
incumbent . . . ," Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be tight because we went in with a lot less money 
than other people had," said Klajic, 47. "I'm surprised that it's this close." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the narrow margin was the lowest turnout in Santa Clarita's 
six-year history. Fewer than one of every six of Santa Clarita's 65,287 
registered voters came to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 If Smyth and Klajic tie, there will be a runoff election, Foy said. Anyone may 
request a recount and that person will be responsible for footing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth said he would need to examine the potential time and cost of a recount. 
Klajic said she doesn't want one, but her campaign supporters probably will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the chips fall where they may," said Klajic. "I don't want to cause any 
more money (to be spent) or trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 In the decided council seats, Jo Anne Darcy won her third term in office, 
earning 5,378 votes, or 18.7% of the total vote. More than half of the 10,252 
Santa Clarita voters cast one of their three tallies for Darcy and she was the 
top vote-getter in 40 of this city's 51 precincts and among the absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old field deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
talked Wednesday about putting the election behind her to focus on the city's 
budget, downtown revitalization and traffic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things to do. I'm recharged," said Darcy. "It just gives 
me that surge of confidence to have people behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Boyer placed second for his third term with 4,147 votes, or 14.5% of 
those cast. Boyer, 54, credited his public service record for his success but 
was undecided if the low voter turnout means people are happy with the current 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if the council is doing well, people should come out and say so (at 
the polls)," Boyer said.

SCHOOL BOND LOSS A SURPRISE FOR SUPPORTERS; BURBANK: LEADERS SAY THEY MAY TRY 
AGAIN IN THE FALL. THE $100-MILLION MEASURE GETS 53% APPROVAL. TWO-THIRDS WAS 
NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite repeated failures of similar measures in other cities, Burbank school 
district officials expressed surprise Wednesday that a $100-million school bond 
measure did not pass, but suggested they may try again in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they did not realize how important the cost of the measure -- 
which they put at about $33 annually for owners of a median-valued residence in 
the city -- would be to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond failed with 53% of the turnout -- 5,766 votes -- in support of the 
referendum, and 46.7% -- or 5,061 -- voting no. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts need a two-thirds majority to pass a bond referendum, a 
standard that nearly half of California school districts have failed to meet in 
the past five years even though they earned a majority vote. In the aftermath 
of Tuesday's election, school officials took stock Wednesday of the lessons the 
bond campaign taught them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see this as a defeat," board President Elena Hubbell said. "We won 
this election. We just didn't do it with the two-thirds majority." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the bond reject that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Michael, a bond opponent, argued that a bond is unnecessary. There 
is enough money to rebuild the schools using other city or district funds, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people feel they are taxed entirely too much," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer campaign workers had identified enough voters in Burbank who 
supported the bond campaign, but many had simply stayed home, said Denise Lioy 
Wilcox, a board member who led the effort in support of the bond referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling places had been changed by the county this year, and Wilcox said some 
voters told her Wednesday that they did not know where to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But a broader problem was that the school board misjudged voters' interest in 
the details of the financing, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the bond disagreed with the estimate made by the district's 
financial advisers that the bond would cost a little more than $33 a year for a 
residence worth $101,000, the median assessed value for property in Burbank. 
The bond opponents complained the number was based on assumptions about the 
growth of property values, which they said might be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little taken aback," Wilcox said when those figures were questioned 
late in the campaign. "We were told (by other districts) that people would not 
focus on or care about those details." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board may start a new bond campaign, possibly for the November 
election, but Hubbell said the failure in Tuesday's election may force the 
district to consider other solutions to the mounting problem of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to take a look at year-round schedules," Hubbell said. 
Using district facilities for child care might also have to be re-examined, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox wants to create a coalition -- to include those who opposed the bond -- 
to develop a new plan to finance the rebuilding of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more than willing, now, to have them join us," Wilcox said. "We need to 
come together as a community."

GOOD SAMARITANS; MENNONITES HELP QUAKE VICTIMS PUT THEIR HOMES BACK IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Enright, a former bit actor with a string of recent health troubles, is 
a proud man who says he doesn't want sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going blind, I've lost a leg, I'm diabetic, I'm asthmatic. That's all," 
he said Tuesday. "The earthquake kind of put the cover on the garbage can." 
</P>
<P>
 The January temblor knocked the chimney off the roof and damaged the ceiling, 
fireplace, walls and light fixtures inside his home, leaving Enright without 
the resources he needed to do the repairs, which ran to several thousand 
dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 But Enright said he gladly accepted help from a group of Mennonites who have 
worked free of charge to put his Granada Hills house back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake, in a way, has got me new friends, a new outlook on life. 
People aren't as bad as they are made out to be in the paper or on those talk 
shows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Mennonites, who came from central California, Kansas and Calgary, Canada, 
replaced the chimney and began putting up a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers say they are in town for little reason other than to share God's 
love, and in most cases they are forgoing salaries from their full-time jobs to 
be here for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen people who belong to the Christian denomination have 
labored for months in the Southland, honoring their commitment to a small 
church known for its social activism and pacifism. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have completed work on about 80 private dwellings in Simi Valley, 
Inglewood and throughout the San Fernando Valley -- including Canoga Park, 
Tarzana, Van Nuys, Sylmar, San Fernando and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania-based Mennonite Disaster Service, with an office in North 
Hollywood, is one of two religious groups of its kind to offer help in the 
Valley. The Holderman Senior Mennonites of Oregon have already come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The service helps cover travel costs and room and board for its volunteers 
from around the country and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really lose any money," Stan Boettger, a Canadian electrical 
engineer and college instructor, said as he worked on Enright's home. "What you 
are giving up is a salary of $4,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think possibly a lot of people will get enough (government assistance) for 
materials, but for lots of people that's not enough to hire a contractor to do 
the work. We'll do the labor for free." 
</P>
<P>
 In return, he added, the good Samaritans get no more than "personal 
satisfaction of knowing you made a difference in somebody else's life who has 
gone through a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, organized by the Mennonite Disaster Service, may last for more 
than a year, said Roger Friesen, a retired plaster contractor who is a director 
for the group's North Hollywood office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers offer free labor for low-income disaster victims who are 
referred by the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
But because some earthquake victims have not yet received checks from FEMA to 
purchase rebuilding materials, Friesen said, it's too early to tell who needs 
manual help. 
</P>
<P>
 Enright, Red Cross officials told Friesen, is one who needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 He got his start pouring Maxwell House coffee in a television commercial. 
Enright said he has appeared alongside comedians Red Skelton and Jack Benny, 
and John Wayne in several Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 About six years ago, his health took a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds very dramatic," he said, "but I lost a toe and that was the first 
time they found out I had diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm just trying to get along." 
</P>
<P>
 Enright, who uses a shopping cart to maintain his balance as he walks, has 
nothing but praise for the Mennonites. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has sent them. Every once in awhile I think someone is watching over me. 
What they are doing for me gives me a belief that there are people still 
interested in you when you are down."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO LAY OFF 7 TO BALANCE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved a plan to lay off seven employees while 
eliminating 33 positions in an effort to close a $3-million budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven employees, who were informed last month that their jobs were 
targeted, will leave in May.Some other employees whose jobs were targeted chose 
early retirement, and the remainder of the 33 positions are otherwise vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the cuts were the only way of balancing the city's books 
without making massive cuts in city services or raising taxes. They said the 
budget shortfall was created by the sluggish economy coupled with decreases in 
state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was approved on a 6-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Phil Sansone opposed the measure. He said the city could have saved 
$3 million by not giving managers and other city employees raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is when you take people away, the services are reduced," 
Sansone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts bring to 86 the number of city positions that have been eliminated 
over the past four years. The total represents 11.3% of the city's former work 
force. Sansone said these reductions have been felt in slower response times by 
some city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest rounds of cuts will affect many sectors of the city, from the 
police and fire departments to the planning and building sections. The city 
also plans to reduce its capital improvement and maintenance budgets in an 
effort to cut costs, said Dennis Danner, the finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will examine a 1994-95 general fund budget, expected to top $59 
million, in May.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 'WOMAN OF YEAR' BEGAN TEEN SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Working as a school nurse, Carol Kanode encountered a 14-year-old abandoned by 
her mother, who had turned to the streets selling drugs and becoming a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode was moved by the girl's plight and compelled to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needed a safe place to go," said Kanode of the incident seven years ago. 
"I didn't want that to happen anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode formed a committee of other concerned people in her Huntington Beach 
community with a dream to one day open a shelter for homeless teens who are in 
crisis situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the 18-bed shelter finally opened in a restored older house in 
Central Park. Since then, the Huntington Youth Shelter has been a refuge for 41 
youths ranging in age from 11 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode recently was honored as "Woman of the Year" for Orange County's 67th 
Assembly District for her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised and grateful," Kanode said. "It means that the issues I 
represent, that of children, are in the forefront. It also means I was singled 
out when there are a lot of other people also doing good work. It's an honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode was selected by Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), who said Kanode 
was "willing to get totally involved with her community in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, co-founded by social worker Irene Briggs, is sanctioned by the 
city of Huntington Beach and its Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode also is a member of the Ocean View Elementary School District school 
board and was instrumental in starting a free program that brought medical, 
social and mental health services to one school site to assist needy students 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode also helped form the local cable show, "Youth Forum," aimed at 
teen-agers, their problems and questions.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also deal with issues that would help the community understand teens and 
for parents to be better educated about teen issues such as AIDS, depression, 
gangs and how to talk to your teen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanode, who has three daughters, said of her work with teen-agers: "We've got 
to take care of this group of people. Our youth are our citizens and leaders of 
tomorrow."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SCHOOL DRESS CODE ALSO PROTECTS GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One parent made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Huntington Beach Union High School District board were 
pondering a proposed new dress code. The proposal included a ban on clothing 
with words or symbols "which degrade gender, culture, religion or ethnic 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 But one Fountain Valley father, Mike Henigan, told the board Tuesday night 
that the code needed one more addition: a ban on clothing that carried hate 
messages against gays. "As the parent of a homosexual child, I urge the board . 
. . to protect all children," Henigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board unanimously agreed and amended the code to prohibit clothing with 
words or symbols degrading to gays. It was the only change board members made 
before adopting the sweeping new dress code, scheduled to be implemented when 
school begins in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The code covers Huntington Beach High, Marina, Edison and Ocean View high 
schools in Huntington Beach, and Westminster High and Fountain Valley High in 
those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the new dress code empowers committees at each high school 
in the district to make lists of prohibited "gang attire" clothing, allowing 
them to keep up with changing clothing styles of local gangs, the school board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state law that became effective Jan. 1 allows each high school to form 
"safety committees" to list and ban gang clothing. The committees consist of 
teachers, administrators, students and law enforcement representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board's overall dress code suggested some items that may constitute 
"gang-related apparel." These included spikes, chains, baggy clothing, jewelry 
with gang symbols, and visible tattoos on a student's body. It will be up to 
each school's safety committee, however, to decide whether to adopt those 
suggested items. 
</P>
<P>
 Five high school students protested the proposed dress code during the public 
hearing before the board voted. Also, Dan Tsang, representing the Orange County 
Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the school board he thought 
the dress code might unconstitutionally restrict free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. John Myers, however, told the board that the code had been 
carefully studied by lawyers for the school district and that they had found no 
constitutional restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new dress code is an update of one in place since 1987. "This new one is 
much more specific," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new code specifically lists some banned items of "sexually suggestive 
clothing." These include bare midriffs, tank tops, muscle shirts and "clothing 
which allows underwear to be exposed." BILL BILLITER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; VOLUNTEER TEAM STARTS PATROLS OF CITY STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of volunteer sleuths motored quietly through an east Calabasas 
neighborhood, scanning well-kept yards for signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, retiree Robert Gordon wheeled a U-turn. He had spotted something in 
the shade on a driveway. He braked in front of the house and his partner, 
34-year-old meat cutter Keith Thomas, stepped out of the car and adjusted his 
city-provided uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough. There -- next to and under a parked Volvo -- were the culprits: 
newspapers from the past three days. An open invitation for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who sees this can tell that whoever lives here is out of town," 
Thomas said, tossing the papers out of sight near the porch. "If there are 
crooks in the neighborhood, you don't want them to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is crime prevention on the sleepy streets of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Thomas are part of a seven-person team that, starting this week, 
will patrol the town under the auspices of the Sheriff's Department in an 
attempt to make safe Calabasas even safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime in Calabasas is almost nonexistent," said Sgt. Marty Dailey of the 
sheriff's Lost Hills/Malibu station. "We hope to keep the program pretty small 
and low-key." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar programs have sprung up in several Southern California communities in 
recent months. In Calabasas, volunteers armed with flashlights and cellular 
phones will cruise the city for two hours during the day and two hours at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the duties of the volunteers will be limited to reporting graffiti, 
reporting suspicious activity to sheriff's deputies and making "vacation 
checks," but may eventually be expanded to writing parking citations and other 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchase of the uniforms, phones, batteries and other equipment cost less than 
$3,000, said City Manager Charles Cate. The city also plans to buy a natural 
gas-powered car or van for the patrollers within several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants were carefully screened to find volunteers such as Gordon, who 
spent 14 years as a deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing this is a bit of nostalgia," Gordon said. "I like to keep my hand in 
the pie, and do something for my community." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 5 CITIES TO MEET FOR BUSINESS SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Representatives from five cities in the Glendale area will meet in Pasadena on 
Friday to discuss how their leaders can work together to create jobs and 
encourage business growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Arroyo Verdugo Sub-Region, composed of Burbank, Glendale, La 
Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena and South Pasadena, will host a summit from 8 a.m. 
to 3:30 p.m. at the Pasadena Hilton, 150 S. Los Robles Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendees, including business owners, council members and city staff, will 
discuss how to devise an areawide marketing strategy to build on the region's 
cultural and entertainment strengths, said Ray Cruz, a staff member for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz said the five cities must work together to counteract the effects of a 
four-year recession that has drawn businesses away from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the summit city planners will ask business owners and managers to suggest 
ways that the cities can smooth out their permitting or planning processes to 
make it easier for businesses to move into the area and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cities' representatives draft strategies for retaining businesses, 
the group's staff will form an economic development committee to implement 
them, Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Verdugo Sub-Region was formed by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments about 18 months ago to compile information on its five member 
cities for a comprehensive plan on cities from Ventura to Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
 After SCAG's plan was complete, Arroyo Verdugo sub-region members decided to 
hold the coalition together to collaborate on areawide transportation, air 
quality and economic issues, Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit will feature as its keynote speaker David Friedman, a former 
Fulbright Fellow and expert on local economic development. The forum's 
facilitator is Manuel Pastor, an economics professor at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists scheduled for the event are Lynn Reaser, senior vice president and 
chief economist for First Interstate Bank; Dan Garcia, senior vice president of 
real estate and planning for Warner Bros.; Barry Sedlik, manager of business 
retention at Southern California Edison; Dann Wallis of Cameloc Products and 
KABC disc jockey Roger Barkley. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 2 COUNCILMEN ARE RETURNED TO OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Calabasas City Council members were voted back into office this week in 
the city's second election since it incorporated three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Dennis Washburn and Bob Hill received 41% and 35% of the vote 
respectively during Tuesday's election, after campaigning on platforms touting 
their accomplishments during the start-up of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was putting together the list of our accomplishments over three years, 
I realized what a monumental job we've done," said Washburn, 51. "I heard it 
over and over from people: 'You worked real hard, we're proud of what you've 
done, and we're glad you're there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn and Hill, 57, said they were both pleased that the fledgling city has 
been able to establish a library, acquire land for four parks and a tennis and 
swim club and increase public safety and sheriff's services. 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn said his top priorities for the next four years will include 
emergency preparedness and efforts to block development plans at nearby Soka 
University and Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole challenger in the race, Ted Rosenquist, received 24% of the vote. 
Only 14.5% of the city's registered voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also approved a measure capping city tax revenues at $5.7 million, the 
amount of last year's budget. It was a step required of new cities by 
Proposition 13, which, among other things, set appropriations limits for 
existing cities in 1978, said Calabasas Finance Officer Sheila Cumberland. 
</P>
<P>
 The state measure was intended to prevent cities from carrying over tax 
revenues from one year to another. The limit may be adjusted each year, 
however, according to population changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of backfired because now cities have almost no reserves," Cumberland 
said. "But we are required to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 No new city in California has refused to set such limits, Cumberland said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: HIDDEN HILLS; 3 ELECTED AFTER MAYOR'S NO-VOTE PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two challengers and one incumbent were elected to the Hidden Hills City 
Council this week, after the mayor of the college campus-sized town asked 
residents at the last minute not to vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't vote for me!" screamed the headline of a letter sent Monday by 
Mayor David G. Stanley to residents of the city, which has about 550 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have come to the conclusion that my personal and professional obligations 
preclude my ability to continue to serve on the Hidden Hills City Council," the 
letter stated. "I have been very proud to have been a part of the many changes 
that have been effected by the City Council during my tenure." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Howard Klein and businessmen Stuart Siegel and Monty Fisher were 
elected Tuesday with 244, 275 and 290 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters cast 210 ballots in favor of Councilman James Cohen, who was appointed 
last year to fill the position of then-Councilwoman Susan Norris Porcaro, who 
moved. Cohen was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley received 77 votes. His successor will be chosen from among the new 
class of council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel attributed the challengers' success to a telephone campaign conducted 
by Siegel's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and a few friends knew half the voters well enough to call them on 
the phone and talk to them," Siegel said. "When a community gets small enough, 
you can really do that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The two challengers said they would change little about the tiny city's 
policies beyond expanding security and disaster preparedness. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY OKD BY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cypress School District board voted unanimously this week to give final 
approval to a policy prohibiting students from sexually harassing other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was adopted to maintain "an educational environment free from 
harassment, intimidation or insult on the basis of an individual's sex," school 
officials said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, district students are prohibited from making unwelcome 
sexual flirtations or propositions, as well as sexual epithets, threats, 
derogatory comments or sexually degrading descriptions either verbally or with 
jokes, gestures, drawings or writings. Spreading sexual rumors, teasing and 
touching classmates in a sexual manner, displaying sexually suggestive objects 
or retaliating against those who report violators also are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, students and teachers are required to report sexual harassment to 
principals, and violators could face expulsion, district officials said. MIMI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CHILD FINGERPRINTING TO BE OFFERED FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 200 children are expected to be fingerprinted and photographed as 
part of a free program run by a local hospital on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide a parent a record that is turned over to the authorities," said 
Jeanette Abundis, director of emergency services at Glendale Adventist Medical 
Center.Through the "Kidprint" program, police can use the pictures, 
fingerprints and other information the parent supplies to help find a child who 
is reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth year the hospital has offered the service, which grew out 
of other public services the hospital had offered for families, Abundis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also plan to provide safety tips to parents. For example, parents 
can teach children a code word and tell them not to go off with anyone who 
doesn't know it. Parents can also avoid letting children wear clothing that 
displays their names. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs and fingerprints would be included in a record of the child 
that also lists distinguishing marks, nicknames, school, physical problems, 
playmates and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprinting can also be arranged at other times during the year. The April 
24 program will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FORUMS TO DISCUSS CHILD CARE NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Child Care and Development Planning Council is conducting 
several public forums over the next two weeks on child care needs in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings will give residents a chance to offer their suggestions on how 
the county should spend $2.7 million in federal child care funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find out what is the greatest need in the county for 
subsidized child care," said Nancy Claxton, a spokeswoman for the council. 
"We're looking for testimony on the types of programs that are needed to meet 
the needs of parents." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Orange County received $2.7 million in federal child care funds out 
of California's total share of $97 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to continue to receive the federal money, the county must present an 
updated plan by June. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the forums will last from 4 to 7 p.m. They will take place today at the 
Student Services Building at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, Wednesday at 
the Fountain Valley School District Office in Fountain Valley, and April 21 at 
the Anaheim Civic Center in the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Written testimony is also welcome. For more information, contact Dennis 
Hudson, council consultant at (714) 733-2272. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY TO LEASE LAND FOR VETERINARY GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will lease land for an after-hours veterinary clinic despite 
opposition from several residents who called the transaction "a sweetheart 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal from the South Orange County Emergency Veterinary Group to build 
the clinic next to the city animal shelter and rent the land for $1,000 a month 
disturbed a handful of residents, prompting them to distribute anti-clinic 
flyers at local mini-malls last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment for strays at the clinic would be deducted from rent charges, which 
resident Jeannine Newton said meant the veterinarians might wind up "getting 
free rent." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members pointed to a real estate appraisal that set rent for the 
proposed clinic at $1,000 per month and criticized the residents' flyer for 
allegedly containing misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," Mayor Susan Withrow said. "I don't know how anyone could be so 
misinformed. (The city) paid for an appraisal that set the rent" for the 
veterinary clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease contract was approved 4 to 1. Councilman William S. Craycraft voted 
against the agreement but made no specific comment about his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic would rent about 10,000 square feet, including a parking lot, next 
to the shelter. City officials said the building is expected to be about 4,000 
square feet and cost the veterinarian group about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would take over the building once the lease expires. Rent increases 
would be tied to the Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 Primarily serving about 40 South County veterinarians and their clients, the 
South County Emergency Veterinary Group is currently operating from offices in 
San Juan Capistrano. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; LIBRARY BOOKSTORE FUND-RAISER PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial independence for the city library is only $38,000 away. 
</P>
<P>
 The library support group, Friends of the San Clemente Library, has come up 
with $85,000 since 1990.Through a series of fund-raisers, including a benefit 
on April 23, organizers hope to inch closer to the $123,000 needed to build a 
bookstore that will raise money to subsidize the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser will be held in the city community building at 242 Avenida Del 
Mar from noon to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the library support group has sold used books, raising 
money to buy new books for the library. But the space for selling the used 
volumes has been limited, inspiring the support group to seek funding for a 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the library group received a $50,000 bequest from retired librarian 
Alpha Russell and decided to start the bookstore campaign.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; ROYCE IMMIGRATION STAND DRAWS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 people -- mostly high school, college and university students -- 
picketed Rep. Edward R. Royce's office Wednesday afternoon to protest his 
support for 15 proposed federal anti-immigration bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Royce (R-Fullerton) is backing proposals that call for stopping payment of 
federal welfare and unemployment benefits to illegal immigrants, increasing 
penalties for immigrant smuggling, imposing a cap on legal immigration to curb 
costs, and increasing border patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see congressmen blaming all the economic problems on immigrants because 
we're an easy target," said Alberto Ortega, 25, a Fullerton College student. 
"We don't see the immigrant community doing anything about it so it's time for 
us to speak up and that's what we are doing with this picket." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce was not in town, but in a letter addressed to Ortega, he wrote: "The 
Immigration and Naturalization Service has indicated that there are now as many 
as 3 million illegal (immigrants) in Southern California, with more coming over 
the border every day. We must stem this tide, not because of racial or cultural 
prejudice, but to overcome the severe economic problems it creates in many 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators, who call themselves the Coalition Against Immigrant 
Bashing, carried placards reading, "Ed Royce should be illegal" and "Bash 
politicians not immigrants." They marched in a circle in front of Royce's 
office on Harbor Boulevard, chanting "raza si, migra no" (the people yes, INS 
no). 
</P>
<P>
 David Rojas, 22, an organizer of the rally, said it was the first of many 
planned for the next several months. Future picketing will target other elected 
officials and the INS, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're demonstrating against the fact that immigrants are being made 
scapegoats for any social and economic problem when the blame should be 
directed at legislators," said Rojas, a Fullerton College student. "Bashing 
immigrants leads to hate and violence among the citizens in this country and 
that is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce, who was in Washington during the demonstration, had his Fullerton 
office issue a statement on his behalf. In it, Royce said, "The people of 
Southern California just cannot afford the tax expenditure required for the 
number of illegal immigrants now crossing our borders. . . . Our public coffers 
are not brimming with wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not comment on the demonstration, which later continued in front of the 
offices of Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton).MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; ANTI-DRUG AND GANG SIGNS TO BE POSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first red, white and blue sign urging residents to report drug and gang 
activity was put up Monday by city officials at the entrance to Fountain Valley 
Recreation and Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials gathered at Brookhurst Street and Heil Avenue and hailed the 
installation of the signs citywide as a move to keep the streets safe from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another step to let our citizens know we mean business when it comes 
to their public safety," said Mayor John J. Collins. Officials said 36 of the 
12-by-18-inch signs will be posted at places where youth congregate: at all 
public and private schools within the city, the Recreation and Cultural Center, 
Family Fun Center and Mile Square Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the signs is $9 each, or a total of $324, paid for from drug 
asset seizure money. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our concerns is to get people involved," said Karen Ackley, chairwoman 
of the city's Alcohol and Drug Awareness Committee, which is sponsoring the 
sign program along with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sedlak, president of the Fountain Valley School District board, agreed 
that the signs "send a strong anti-drug message. We want to start preventive 
drug education as soon as possible."  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week also adopted a resolution supporting the 
establishment of drug-free zones. 
</P>
<P>
 A drug-free zone is any specific location in the community, especially where 
children congregate, where residents believe drug trafficking or alcohol 
problems exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laurann Cooksaid the city joins the neighboring communities of 
Huntington Beach and Westminster to establish drug-free zones, the idea founded 
by the "No To Drugs" (NODS) Foundation, a three-city alliance to promote and 
fund substance-free programs.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cook noted that Fountain Valley went a step beyond by adding "gang-free" 
zone to the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, council liaison to the Alcohol and Drug Awareness Committee, also 
believes the signs will be a deterrent and will send a message that drugs and 
gangs won't be tolerated in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Elvin Miali said that a copy of the council's drug- and gang-free 
zone resolution will be forwarded to the county district attorney and the U.S. 
attorney general.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is "advising them that Fountain Valley is participating in the war 
against drugs and encouraging prosecution to the maximum extent possible for 
all drug offenders violating the drug-free zones," Miali said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs have a drug-crime hot line number -- (714) 962-4447 -- and also 
state that confidentiality of the caller will be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 It is anticipated that information given to police from the public will lead 
to arrests and prosecution under the state's enhanced sentencing law, which 
provides stiffer punishment for drug sales within 1,000 feet of school 
property, Miali said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing else, it will make the drug pusher aware that our citizens will be 
watching for them and they will leave the area," Miali said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackley said the committee will also monitor the sign program for its 
effectiveness and possible expansion to other areas of the city where there are 
gang or drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have to put up more signs, we will put up more signs," she said. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; EMERGENCY WORK ON CHANNEL COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction crews have finished emergency work on a damaged underground 
drainage channel that caused a crater-size sinkhole on a golf course and 
threatened to undermine Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emergency work has been completed, the sinkhole filled and the 
threat to the highway abated, a county official said Wednesday that repair work 
to the large, underground channel will continue for several weeks. And 
officials remain mystified as to what caused the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still unable to pin down a cause or sequence that led to the ultimate 
failures," said Jim Miller, chief of flood control design for the county. "Some 
thought that it is potentially related to the earthquake earlier this year. 
That has some merit, but we don't know how we'd prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The hole near the 13th green at the Links at Monarch Beach appeared Feb. 21, 
and several days later workers traced it to a leaky underground drainage 
channel that carries runoff from Salt Creek to the ocean. Evidently, the aged, 
underground, 14-foot-high channel began to leak and a portion of it washed 
away, which ultimately caused the ground above it to fail, creating an 
80-foot-long hole on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was that the oldest section of the underground channel was 
built in 1932, when Pacific Coast Highway was constructed through South County, 
and later attached to a newer section built in 1973, officials said. The leaks 
occurred near the juncture of the two sections, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the emergency work cost the county and the California Department 
of Transportation, which are sharing the expenses, between $60,000 and $70,000. 
It could cost the county an additional $200,000 to finish its share of repairs. 
Caltrans' portion of the repair work will take two months and cost an estimated 
$350,000, spokesman Albert Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major portion of the repair work includes replacing the floor of the 
channel, which runs directly beneath the highway, Miller said. A new concrete 
floor will be anchored to the walls of the channel, Miller said. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; MEETING TONIGHT ON WATER-SHARING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of the Marine Corps and a local water district will meet with 
residents tonight to discuss a proposed water-sharing partnership that would 
provide a new area water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District would share 
high-quality water beneath San Mateo Creek with the Marines at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the plan is worth the estimated $6-million price tag for the 
district to drill the wells, build the infrastructure and distribute water in 
exchange for access to the underground basin, which is located at the northern 
edge of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership will provide not only a local water supply but an important 
reserve for 70,000 South County water customers, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 South County now depends on water from the Colorado River and Northern 
California, imported by pipelines that are susceptible to earthquakes and 
floods. And water district officials have warned that there is only enough 
storage capacity in Dana Point and San Clemente for a five-day water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents charge that the tiny Tri-Cities district is using the 
partnership to save itself from extinction.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County grand jury is studying whether Tri-Cities should merge with 
the other three South County water agencies that wholesale water to districts 
that serve customers. City officials have previously said they are concerned 
that the city will be left holding the bill for developing the new water supply 
if the Tri-Cities district is dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting begins at 7 in the Little Theater of San Clemente High 
School, 700 Avenida Pico. MARY LOU PICKEL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 5 TAGGING SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An anti-graffiti tagging task force made up of police officers from throughout 
the county raided four locations early Wednesday and arrested five people on 
felony vandalism charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects -- four juveniles and one 18-year-old -- are suspected of causing 
$38,000 in damages involving graffiti-related vandalism in recent months, 
including $11,000 worth of damage to a Simi Valley Freeway off-ramp, said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Craig Rhudy in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 All were expected to be held in custody until Friday, when they are scheduled 
to be arraigned, said Rhudy, coordinator of the Community Tagger Task Force. 
Authorities said the suspects were members of a prominent tagging crew known as 
ATR, or Above The Rest, which they believe has targeted freeways and personal, 
public and railroad property with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 When conducting searches of the alleged taggers' homes, police found a 
videotape of one of the juveniles spraying his moniker on a wall, and plan to 
use it as evidence against him, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Rosas, 18, of Mission Hills was being held in Van Nuys Jail on $10,000 
bail. The juveniles arrested were 15- and 16-year-old boys from North Hills and 
a 17-year-old boy and girl from Mission Hills, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four juveniles were being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. All five of the 
suspects were at their homes when police arrived with search warrants at 7 a.m. 
and arrested them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhudy said police from the San Fernando Police Department, the Los Angeles 
Community College Police Department at Mission College, the Mass Transit 
Authority police and officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
and Van Nuys divisions participated in the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, the task force has arrested 15 felony taggers believed to have 
done more than $200,000 in vandalism, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles face a maximum three years in local juvenile detention 
facilities, and Rosas faces up to a year in state prison and a $1,000 fine. All 
of them face possible restitution charges and penalties, Rhudy said. JOSH MEYER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: CHILD-CARE CENTER WILL BE DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A child-care facility for low-income families that is at the center of an 
effort to turn Maclay Middle School into a nexus of social services will be 
dedicated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, school board members and representatives of a New York 
philanthropic organization will join parents to celebrate the recent opening of 
the Maxwell H. Gluck Children's Center, which was built with a $1-million 
donation from the New York-based Maxwell H. Gluck Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The center began enrolling children in late January and is already at 
capacity, with 50 children between the ages of 2 and 5 and a waiting list of 
more than 50 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Los Angeles Unified School District's division for child 
development, the center serves parents in the community who are either enrolled 
in school or working. The donation will also fund the program in its first year 
of operation. With incomes less than $1,337 a month, none of the families 
currently enrolled pay for the child care. After its first year, the program 
will be run through the district with a combination of state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is part of an ongoing effort to turn Maclay into a place where 
parents can receive a variety of social services and children a continuity of 
care and education. When children reach school age, they can move directly from 
the day-care center to classes on the same campus at the Maclay Primary Center. 
In addition to child care and education, the center will offer parenting 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The inauguration of the center also marks cooperation with the district's 
division of adult education. Administrators of the child-care center reserved 
half of the spaces for parents who take job-training classes at the nearby 
Pacoima Skills Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Nava, an adviser at the Pacoima Skills Center, called the center's 
opening a big plus in a community where more than 1,000 families are on waiting 
lists for child care. "There is a tremendous need in the community," Nava said. 
"Parents cannot go after the training or education or work they need until 
their children are taken care of." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; $10,000 GIFT HELPS BURGLARIZED SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles foundation has donated $10,000 to North Hollywood High School's 
magnet center at the Los Angeles Zoo to replace some of the $35,000 of computer 
equipment stolen from a bungalow classroom in early March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Foundation, which supports a variety of educational, cultural and 
social-service programs, donated the funds to enable the school to continue 
classes without serious interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Shapiro, a science and computer teacher at the magnet, said the funds 
will be used to purchase computer hardware and software. The loss of years of 
accumulated programs and equipment forced Shapiro to revise the curriculum for 
his computer classes and assign up to four students to share a terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are looking up," Shapiro said Wednesday after learning of the 
donation. "At least I'm smiling again today." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the school still needs at least $20,000 to replace some of the 
television sets, videocassette recorders, laser discs and computer equipment 
stolen in the overnight theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is also working with the district to upgrade security in the magnet 
classrooms, which are located in the zoo's parking lot. The thieves entered 
through a hole they cut in a wall of the three-room bungalow and removed the 
equipment, most of which was bolted to carts or tables. Police still have no 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the district does not reimburse such losses, the 280-student magnet 
program, which was created in 1981, is relying on private donations to replace 
the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $10,000 from the foundation, the school has received about 
$1,000 in private donations. Administrators have also scheduled a benefit 
concert in early May. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; 35 CRACKS FOUND IN STEEL HOSPITAL BEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Engineers inspecting Holy Cross Medical Center have discovered 35 cracks in 
steel support beams, but hospital officials say most of the breaks are minor 
and pose no immediate danger to patients or staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Cross began inspecting the beams on its own initiative after widespread 
discussion of cracks in steel-frame buildings caused by the Northridge 
earthquake, said Allene Nungesser, the hospital's executive vice president and 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an ultrasound device, engineers have examined more than half of the 400 
joints in the building's steel frame, she said. The inspection will be followed 
by repairs that will take about six to eight weeks and cost $2 million to $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nungesser said the hospital, which has 209 acute-care beds and 58 skilled 
nursing and other beds, decided to remain open during the inspection and repair 
work because the cracks pose no immediate threat to patients or staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is one of only two trauma centers in the San Fernando Valley, she 
noted, and serves about 23,000 people in its emergency room each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers for the hospital and the state Office of Statewide Health Planning 
and Development are examining the building on a daily basis, she said, and it 
will be closed if they determine that the cracks are more serious than is now 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Cross was closed for seven days after the Jan. 17 quake, which inflicted 
$15 million to $20 million in damages on it, mostly to medical equipment and 
internal fixtures. The hospital was built after the 1971 Sylmar quake heavily 
damaged a hospital on the same site, forcing its demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nungesser said only three of the 35 cracks are serious, measuring about a 
quarter of an inch across. The rest, she said, "varied from hairline to less 
severe, more in the moderate range." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Ploeger, a spokeswoman for the state health planning office, said 
inspectors have viewed the cracks and agree that there is no need to evacuate 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys were down on the site and agreed with the facility that repairing it 
while patients were in it was appropriate," said Ploeger, noting that her 
office has the authority to order an evacuation. JACK CHEEVERS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOLS YIELD TO U.S. ON STUDENT SURVEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District has averted the potential loss of $12.4 
million in federal funds by complying with a demand that it turn over to the 
government about 1,000 student surveys commissioned as part of a national 
dropout prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute is the question of whether the school district 
should have sought permission from parents before surveying students on issues 
that could be considered personal -- such as whether their family receives 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Several board members were upset about the personal nature of the survey and 
balked at the idea of returning the questionnaires to the U.S. Department of 
Education as planned. But the government warned last month that the district 
would run the risk of losing millions of dollars in current and future 
education funds if it carried through on the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Tuesday, the Board of Education voted 3 to 2 to comply, 
despite objections that the surveys were conducted improperly and without prior 
parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Robert W. Balen, Audrey Yamagata-Noji and Sal Mendoza voted to 
release the 1992 surveys to the Education Department, which funds the 
dropout-prevention program. Trustees Tom Chaffee and Rosemarie Avila opposed 
the release. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,800 students completed the confidential questionnaire, which the 
Education Department says it will use to determine how the program is working. 
The agency will review 1,000 surveys and the district will destroy the rest, 
said district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee charged at the board meeting that the district violated the state 
education code in administering the 18-page surveys because they contained 
personal questions and were given without prior parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do this without parent permission I think was really uncalled for," 
Chaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintained that the district should have destroyed the surveys, 
administered them a second time and offered parents in the district an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in separate written opinions, attorneys for the Education Department 
and Mathmatica Policy Research Inc., which developed the surveys, concluded 
that the questions never intruded on students' privacy. Therefore, no parental 
permission was required, said Susan Despenas, an assistant to the district 
superintendent . 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she added that a third attorney, for the Orange County Department of 
Education, determined that some of the questions could potentially trigger the 
parental consent requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The family-related questions included: "How far in school do you think your 
father wants you to get?" "Does your family currently receive money from 
welfare?" and "How often do your parents tell you specifically that you 
shouldn't drink alcohol or use drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
 After Chaffee raised his concerns about the survey in January, the district 
then received parental permission retroactively for each of the 1,000 students 
whose surveys are being returned to the government, Despenas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despenas said the district received $1.4 million this year for the dropout 
program and expects about $1.2 million next year. The district stood to lose as 
much as $12.4 million if it were dropped from its federally funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee said he never intended to jeopardize the district's funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten so far out of proportion that the federal government has 
threatened us with the loss of $12 million," he said. "All I wanted was 
parental permission." JON NALICK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; DELI MAY REOPEN BY END OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Art's Deli, a popular restaurant on Ventura Boulevard that was ravaged by the 
earthquake and a related fire, will reopen in late August or early September, 
said part-owner Harold Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg, whose parents, Art and Sandy, founded the deli in 1957, said 
Wednesday that he expects demolition of the damaged building to begin April 25 
and construction of the new structure to begin shortly thereafter.The project 
has not yet received the green light from the Los Angeles city health or 
building departments, but Ginsburg said he is hopeful of securing the necessary 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city really wants to get places back in business," Ginsburg said. 
"With the economy being as bad as it was, they're really making an effort to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg said the past few months have been an emotionally difficult time for 
him and his family in their struggle to rebuild. But he said they have been 
heartened by a deluge of phone calls from well-wishing customers. The owners 
are considering applying for a Small Business Administration loan and have 
received an extension of the application deadline, said Ginsburg, who manages 
the eatery with his sister, Roberta Mitteldorf. 
</P>
<P>
 The deli's insurers have forwarded partial payment to the business to pay for 
some demolition work, architectural services and temporary office space, 
Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicatessen, which Ginsburg said suffered $500,000 to $700,000 in damage 
from the earthquake and resulting fire, will have a new look when it reopens. 
Incandescent drop lights will replace the old fluorescent lighting, ceilings 
will be raised, and the color scheme will be changed to reflect the decor, 
which Ginsburg described as a "traditional '50s deli theme geared to the year 
2000." 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll look sharp," he promised. KAY HWANGBO

DISTRICT PREPARED TO DROP EVICTION SUIT AGAINST RAMS; DISPUTE: SCHOOLS 
SUPERINTENDENT SAYS TEAM OFFICIALS ARE WILLING TO SIGN A LEASE EXTENSION FOR 
USE OF THE PRACTICE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to reports that the Rams are prepared to sign a lease extension, 
the school district that owns the team's practice facility said Wednesday that 
it would reconsider evicting the team if an agreement were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul S. Mercier, superintendent of the Magnolia School District, said city 
officials have informed him that team officials, after months of dispute, are 
willing to sign a lease extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercier said the Rams would have to sign a lease that was proposed several 
weeks ago because the district refuses to renegotiate any of the terms. City 
officials said the Rams seem willing to agree to those. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that (the Rams) are going to sign the lease," Councilman Bob D. 
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials Wednesday confirmed that they are continuing negotiations with 
the city and have made progress. They declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said the council gave the city manager and city attorney direction 
during Tuesday's council meeting on how to proceed in negotiations with the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Mercier said that district officials were not getting their hopes 
up "until all the signatures are on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district, which filed suit against the Rams on Friday, will 
continue with eviction proceedings. Both the city and the Rams have until 
Monday to respond to the district's eviction notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a time gun that we're under," City Atty. Jack L. White said. "If we 
don't get this wrapped up by Friday or Monday at the latest, I don't think it's 
going to go." He said he hopes to have an agreement signed by the Rams ready 
for the council's meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' position on the lease proposal apparently has changed in view of the 
eviction lawsuit filed by the district last week. Although the school district 
owns the site, the city leases the property from the district and sublets it to 
the Rams. The team's lease expired Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's last proposal, the city would subsidize about $3 million of 
the team's rent over the course of a 15-year lease. The Rams would be able to 
break the lease at any time provided they give at least six months' notice, pay 
$220,000 and restore the practice site to its original condition. The city 
agreed to pay about half of the estimated $1.2 million to $1.5 million in 
restoration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease dispute has highlighted the tension between the city and Rams. Team 
officials have said they will exercise an escape clause in their Anaheim 
Stadium lease May 3 and look to move the team to a city that has greater 
financial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he does not believe a resolution in the lease for the training 
facility, if it occurs, will have much impact on the team's desire to relocate. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will mean anything, but at least it will be settled," 
Simpson said. "We will be able to focus on bigger issues."

REFORM TOPS TUSTIN VICTORS' AGENDA; CITY COUNCIL: POLITICAL NEWCOMERS TRACY 
WORLEY AND MICHAEL J. DOYLE CREDIT THEIR UPSET OF INCUMBENTS TO SUPPORT FOR 
TERM LIMITS, BAN ON GIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tracy Worley and Michael J. Doyle, who pulled off surprising upsets of 
incumbent City Council members in Tuesday's municipal election, said 
Wednesdaythat they will push for political reform once they take their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters want change, and that's what we're going to give them," said 
Worley, 37, a member of the city's Parks and Recreation Commission who emerged 
as the top vote-getter in the four-way race. 
</P>
<P>
 In ousting incumbents Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles E. Puckett, Worley and 
Doyle placed first or second in 16 of the city's 19 precincts and captured more 
than 50% most of the absentee votes. They will be sworn in Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no consensus Wednesday on the reason for the challengers' lopsided 
victories. Worley and Doyle, who campaigned on a platform of establishing term 
limits, a ban of gifts to council members and limits on campaign contributions, 
said that the power of their message carried them into office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens looked at what we have to say, and what we promised to do, and 
said, 'Yes, that's what we want,' " said Doyle, 51, owner of a local 
restaurant. "The (political) organization just helped put our message across." 
</P>
<P>
 Pontious declined comment Wednesday, but Puckett said he was swept from office 
by "anti-incumbent fever that is sweeping the country." He also credited his 
opponents for running a strong campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody could have done anything to stem the tide," Puckett 
said. "They were taking their tasks (in the campaign) with fervor and their 
volunteers were working night and day." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that the endorsement by Mayor Jim Potts and the support of the 
police officers and city employees unions gave Worley and Doyle credibility and 
financial backing during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely an advantage," said Guido Borges, a member of the Tustin 
Residents Action Committee, which endorsed incumbents Pontious and Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas Saltarelli said that Worley and Doyle ran strong campaigns, 
but the endorsement by Potts was a key factor in their victories. "He (Potts) 
is a very respected person in the community and carries a lot of weight," 
Saltarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts' endorsement has led to predictions that the mayor was attempting to 
create a three-vote bloc on the five-member council. Saltarelli, who may be 
chosen mayor when the City Council reorganizes on Tuesday, said he does not 
believe there will be a voting bloc that controls city decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever sits on the council, historically, the decisions are 90% unanimous," 
Saltarelli said. "They make independent evaluations of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeffrey Thomas, however, said he is worried that he and Saltarelli 
could be the odd members out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll be somewhere in Siberia," Thomas said. "I see them retaliating 
against me . . . severely. They perceive me as being the bad guy somehow." 
Thomas did not elaborate, but said that he will try to work with the new 
council members "to form a solid council." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley said that she does not intend to retaliate against anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any hatchet during the campaign has been buried, as far as I'm concerned," 
Worley said. "The task is serving the citizens, and I'm not going to worry who 
was pulling for who during the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 James G. Rourke, the former city attorney who worked for the city for 34 years 
before retiring in January and serving as a consultant, said that "voting blocs 
don't last very long." 
</P>
<P>
 "It (City Council) is a nonpartisan body," he said. "People don't always come 
to the same conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Worley and Doyle said they would support a proposal long 
advocated by Potts to hire an in-house attorney, instead of keeping Rourke as a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Doyle said that he wants to "look at the numbers" first before making a 
decision. He said the legal fees should be studied to see how the city could 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke earns a minimum of $4,000 monthly as a consultant for the city. He said 
a city the size of Tustin cannot afford to have its own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after they are sworn in, Worley and Doyle will be involved in the 
preparation of the city's 1994-95 budget.  
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time to sort things and determine their (council members) 
priorities," City Manager William A. Huston said. "It's a learning process that 
the council and the staff go through together."

L. A. OKS MAP OF 'EMPOWERMENT ZONE'; REDEVELOPMENT: THE TARGETED AREAS, 
INCLUDING PACOIMA, ARE POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF MAJOR FEDERAL AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In hopes of winning much-needed federal aid, the Los Angeles City Council 
approved Wednesday the final map for a proposed "empowerment zone" that would 
stretch from Pacoima to South-Central to Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The map will be part of an application that the city and county of Los Angeles 
will jointly submit to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
take advantage of $100 million in special aid and tax breaks that the program 
provides businesses and residents in poverty-stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although HUD officials will not make a final decision on the zone applications 
until September, city officials said President Clinton has already assured them 
that Los Angeles will have an empowerment zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the process, Pacoima was threatened with being left out of the zone 
to make room for other poverty-stricken areas in East Los Angeles and San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 But community development officials and Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 
district includes Pacoima, rallied to keep the small working-class Latino 
community in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that Pacoima will be included in the application for an empowerment 
zone," Alarcon said in an interview. "This is a victory for those who will take 
advantage of the empowerment program." 
</P>
<P>
 He said other city officials who backed the inclusion of Pacoima realized that 
"helping Pacoima helps the Valley, and that helps all of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones are the centerpiece of Clinton's urban revitalization 
program. Only six zones will be approved nationwide, and each will be limited 
to a 20-square-mile area with 20,000 residents. In addition to the empowerment 
zones, the program establishes 65 smaller "enterprise zones," each providing $3 
million in social services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But for city development officials, drawing the map has been a technical 
nightmare. Under the federal guidelines for the empowerment program, only 4.4% 
of the city's jurisdiction and 5.7% of its population can be included in the 
zone. The zone does not have to be contiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved map breaks up the zone into three sections: a small area of 
Pacoima, a stretch that includes parts of Lincoln Heights, Boyle Heights and 
South-Central and an area that stretches from South-Central to Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima section is home to 13,400 people and has a poverty rate that 
ranges from 25% to 40%. The area includes the Hansen Dam Recreation Area and 
the San Fernando Gardens, a low-income housing project that shelters more than 
2,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The map was the result of detailed census studies and 14 public hearings over 
several months. Dozens of community leaders representing economically troubled 
areas throughout Los Angeles urged the city to include them in the application. 
</P>
<P>
 County development officials have been working closely with their city 
counterparts to make sure the map includes the most poverty-plagued areas 
outside of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have not given the map their approval, but Bill Johnson, a 
manager at the county's Community Development Commission, said he expects no 
conflicts between the city's and the county's version of the map. 
</P>
<P>
 "The application will allow different political jurisdictions to work together 
in a unique opportunity to make some improvements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the map is only a small part of the entire application. The city and 
county must now hold public hearings to come up with a proposal to demonstrate 
how the empowerment zone's benefits will be used to reduce unemployment and 
poverty and stimulate revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The first workshop will be held today at 6 p.m. at Pacoima Elementary School, 
11016 Norris Ave., Pacoima. Pacoima Empowerment Zone A map for a proposed 
federal empowerment zone was approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles City 
Council. It would include a 2.4-square-mile area of Pacoima that has been 
plagued by poverty and high unemployment rates for years. The zone, the 
centerpiece of President Clinton's urban revitalization efforts, is expected to 
provide tax breaks, grants and social services programs.

CAMPUS ENROLLMENT DECLINES AFTER QUAKE; EDUCATION: COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPORT A 
3.6% DROP. LOSSES IN THE VALLEY ARE NEARLY TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District suffered a 3.6% enrollment decline 
this spring because of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, with individual 
losses at two of its San Fernando Valley colleges nearly two to three times 
higher, district officials reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit among the district's nine campuses was Mission College in Sylmar, 
which has 10.1% fewer students than had been expected prior to the earthquake, 
researchers said in a report presented to the district board. 
</P>
<P>
 Next was Valley College in Van Nuys, with a 6% drop and Los Angeles 
Trade-Tech, with a 5.1% decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollments in the 882-square-mile district had been expected to drop even 
without the earthquake, from about 106,000 students last spring to a projected 
103,941 this spring. But the researchers estimated the quake alone caused an 
additional loss of 3,796 students, for a total enrollment of 100,145. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles and four other Southern California community college 
districts, the issue of trying to identify the earthquake's actual impact on 
their enrollments -- as opposed to other factors -- could become an important 
financial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges in California get most of their funding from the state 
based on the numbers of students they enroll. But for this fiscal year, the 
state Assembly has passed and the Senate is due to consider urgency legislation 
to shelter the five districts from state funding cuts due to earthquake-related 
enrollment losses. 
</P>
<P>
 May Chen, the district's director of research and planning, said the 
enrollment loss could cost the Los Angeles district at least $6 million in 
funding if the legislation is not passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it does, the legislation would not protect the district from 
enrollment losses in future years. "Usually it takes at least two to three 
years for the population to come back" after major disasters, Chen said before 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Los Angeles college district, the others targeted in the 
measure are Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen and her staff said in the report that Mission's projected enrollment was 
6,264, compared to actual enrollment of 5,634. The two other San Fernando 
Valley colleges, Valley in Van Nuys and Pierce in Woodland Hills, suffered more 
physical damage, but Chen speculated that Mission's severe decline was due at 
least in part to the closure of a portion of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley, the campus with the district's largest enrollment this spring, had a 
projected 16,353 student population and actual enrollment of 15,372, for a 6% 
loss.  
</P>
<P>
 Trade-Tech, located near Downtown, had its 13,061 projected enrollment decline 
to 12,396 for a 5.1% loss. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials attributed the losses to a combination of factors, 
including general apprehension in the wake of the earthquake and student 
preoccupation with resulting problems in their families. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. College had a 4.7% drop, from 8,108 expected students to a 7,724 
actual enrollment. Pierce, which suffered the most extensive physical damage 
among the nine campuses, saw only a 4.4% earthquake-related enrollment drop, 
from a projected 15,256 students to an actual 14,581. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City College, district researchers said, suffered a 2.7% decline from 
15,393 projected students to 14,971 actual enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials estimated no earthquake-related losses at East L.A. 
College, with 15,183 students, and Harbor College, with 7,922 students.

MAN ARRESTED AFTER ROBBERY, POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After pursuing two alleged supermarket robbers by car and by foot, police 
arrested one man and remain on the lookout for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men, one of whom had a handgun, entered the Lucky supermarket in the 100 
block of North Raymond Avenue about 9 p.m. Tuesday and demanded the money out 
of two cash registers, Fullerton Police Sgt. Mike Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness to the holdup alerted other store employees, who called police, 
Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two robbers fled in a car before officers arrived, he said. Dan Bohling, 
one of the officers responding to the call, spotted a suspicious car with two 
people inside near the store. When he tried to stop the car, its driver sped 
away, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police chased the vehicle eastbound on the Riverside Freeway and then 
southbound on the Costa Mesa Freeway. The chase ended when the alleged robbers 
encountered freeway construction and heavy traffic near Walnut Avenue in 
Orange, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men ran from their vehicle, Maynard said. Fullerton police, with the help 
of the Orange Police Department and other police agencies, searched the area. 
One of the men was soon found hiding in the yard of a house in the 300 block of 
Oak Street, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man could not be found. Maynard said police found a .380-caliber 
handgun in the vehicle used by the alleged robbers. No money was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 In custody at Fullerton Jail is Larry Ledesma, 37, of Orange. He was arrested 
on suspicion of robbery, being under the influence of an opiate, and felony 
evasion of arrest, Maynard said. His bail was set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for the other alleged robber, described as a male Latino in 
his early 30s, 5-foot-9, weighing 160 pounds, with short, black or dark-brown 
hair and mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police are asking anyone with information on the alleged robber or 
the money to call detective Steve Christoffersen at (714) 738-6753.

AROUND THE VALLEY / ABIGAIL GOLDMAN: AS TIME RUNS OUT, CANDIDATES STAND TALL IN 
FACE OF DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They were billed as victory parties. But there were no rousing speeches, no 
balloons, no snappy band music. No victories either. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the two parties thrown by Tuesday's losers, the hopefuls who would 
not concede the election even after state Sen. David A. Roberti's 2-1 margin 
seemed solidified. The ones who weren't quite sure how election parties were 
supposed to work. The ones abandoned early on by the TV crews, who preferred to 
wait out the returns in their trucks rather than mingle with the defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 At once pitiable and proud, resolute and yet disappointed, these were the 
folks the TV cameras wouldn't see anyway. Thirty-second interviews with 
campaign managers do not convey a sparsely filled room or the sinking spirits 
of people waiting for bad, but increasingly, inevitable news. 
</P>
<P>
 But how you view these people depends mostly on who you are, on what (and in 
whom) you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Balboa room of the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys, where about 75 
people gathered and never quite filled the room, a group of men in T-shirts 
watched a videotaped Connie Chung recount their recall efforts over and over 
again in an endless video loop. After about the third showing of the news 
segment, some of the group wandered back toward the mini-pizza and spring roll 
appetizers. Others stayed and watched again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dominguez, a systems analyst from Van Nuys and one of the four candidates 
hoping to replace Roberti in Sacramento, strode in with a group of supporters 
about 9 p.m. and staked out a table that would be his home for the rest of the 
night.  
</P>
<P>
 He is much bigger than his voice. Listeners have to lean in close to hear 
Dominguez speak, close enough to see the beads of sweat that form on his 
forehead when he's asked a question, close enough to see the camera-lens 
thickness of his simple and small glasses. His 200-plus pounds, poured onto a 
nearly 6-foot-3 frame, seems mismatched. 
</P>
<P>
 The early news put Roberti ahead of his would-be recallers at an almost 2-1 
margin. With the first few precincts reporting, Dominguez was a much-behind 
second. In between phone calls and whispered bits of election news, Dominguez 
sat quietly at his table, his knee rapidly bouncing up and down as he waited 
for a tide change that wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 Voices from other clusters of supporters carried throughout the room. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio reporter loudly explained that the recall effort was poorly planned, 
and even offered his own prescription -- too late, he said -- to defeat the 
senator: "Roberti is an idiot. But if they had listened to me early on, I told 
them that if he has one defense, you need three things to throw back at him. 
It's an old debating technique that those guys never mastered . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained about unfair and Roberti-biased media coverage every time 
reporters walked by. 
</P>
<P>
 The other failed victor's party had a more courtly tone. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile away at the 94th Aero Squadron Restaurant, with a view of the Van 
Nuys Airport landing strip, supporters of gun-shop owner and candidate Randy 
Linkmeyer gathered in a dark, wooded room decorated in World War I motif, with 
old airplane wings hanging from the ceiling and framed pictures of the Statue 
of Liberty and a bald eagle hanging on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of men in button-down shirts spoke quietly to women in party dresses 
seated at tables arranged around gas-burning fireplaces. On the patio, around 
another fireplace, a group of men smoked cigars and an affable, blue 
blazer-clad Tom Hanson, Linkmeyer's campaign director, hummed along with 
piped-in Doris Day singing her World War II-era hit "Sentimental Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 The roughly 60 people at this gathering talked about democracy and the right 
of recall. They talked about wanting to see their senator out in his bathrobe 
like the rest of the neighbors after an earthquake and how they spent about 
$4,000 to Roberti's nearly $750,000 -- and about believing that they had a 
chance to win anyway, even when the returns put their candidate dead last among 
the four contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Like at the other party, they all prefaced their comments by saying this 
election wasn't about guns. It was about crime and carpetbagging and buying 
elections, they said. But guns usually crept into their conversations anyway, 
as they talked about how they met gun-shop owner Linkmeyer or their Second 
Amendment right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Harper, in a crisp white shirt and tall beige cowboy hat, said the gun 
issue was a "small part" of his reason for supporting the recall and Linkmeyer. 
His father gave him a pistol when he was 12 years old, he said, and told him to 
protect his mother and three sisters. "I've still got it," he said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he wouldn't admit defeat, Harper wanted to put the event in 
perspective. "I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe we could win," he said. 
"If it doesn't happen, well, we'll live with it."  
</P>
<P>
 Back at the coalition's party, their numbers bolstered by supporters of 
candidate Dolores White, the most anxious members of the crowds seemed to be 
the reporters -- eager for the recall candidates to acknowledge defeat so they 
could go home, some wishing aloud that they had been assigned to the Roberti 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that he wasn't quite sure "how these things work," Dominguez 
nonetheless would not concede. 
</P>
<P>
 With two scotches under his belt, Dominguez beamed when he came up with a line 
to give the anxious reporters: "I will not concede this as a loss," he finally 
said. "I think it has been a victory for us and a defeat for Roberti." 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:30 p.m., leaving behind about 15 people still sitting around near-empty 
tables, Dominguez stood up, adjusted his pants, and walked out of the ballroom 
by himself.

BRANCH LIBRARY IN LAGUNA BEACH WILL CLOSE FOR REMODELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's Laguna Beach branch library will be closed for two months 
beginning today for an expansion and remodeling project that will add 780 
square feet to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 project will include the removal of a leaking skylight as well as 
the enlargement of the bathrooms so that they comply with the Americans With 
Disabilities Act, library spokeswoman Cheryl Pruett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion will reduce the size of the library's parking lot and will 
increase the overall size of the 22-year-old building from 9,510 to 10,290 
square feet. The library is at 363 Glenneyre St. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being paid by Mello-Roos development fee money and a $50,000 
donation by Friends of the Laguna Beach Library, Pruett said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the closure, people can use the county's Crown Valley branch library at 
30341 Crown Valley Parkway in Laguna Niguel or the El Toro branch at 24672 
Raymond Way in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These branches should take care of the patrons' needs," Pruett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach library is expected to reopen in June.

STREET VENDORS CAMPAIGN FOR OWN DISTRICT; BUSINESS: THE GROUP MUST GET APPROVAL 
FROM 20% OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE ZONE AND PAY A $1,000 FEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after the Los Angeles City Council approved a pilot program 
allowing street vending in specific areas, a group of northeast San Fernando 
Valley vendors has launched a campaign to establish one of the city's first 
street-vending districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the details for operating vending districts have yet to be 
finalized, the group, known as Street Vendors Assn. of the San Fernando Valley, 
began months ago to teach potential vendors food preparation, business skills 
and English. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, it would be the first, and probably only, such district in the 
Valley. Another district proposed for East Los Angeles is also in the works. 
Both are expected to submit formal applications by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley vending advocates say they will ask that street peddling be allowed on 
Van Nuys, Glenoaks and Laurel Canyon boulevards in areas of Pacoima and 
Panorama City where illegal street selling is practiced. City officials will 
decide the specific boundaries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a Mexican thing, or a Latino thing; it's a money thing," said 
Jorge Sanchez, a volunteer working with the vendors' association. "The vendors 
are going to start participating and they are going to pay their sales tax, 
city tax, state taxes. They are going to take part in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez said vendors understand that it won't be easy to overcome negative 
stereotypes about street peddlers. And they know that it will be difficult to 
meet the slew of requirements needed before the city approves the district, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vendors are gearing up to work on the most difficult requirement -- 
persuading area business owners and residents to support a vending district. 
Under the rules, the vendors must get approval of 20% of the property owners in 
a proposed zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get all the signatures, then the City Council can't deny me a 
district," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Valdez, the city's street vending administrator, said that half a dozen 
groups throughout the city already have begun generating interest in the 
program by distributing about 25,000 informational brochures to business 
owners, residents and vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the signatures, each group proposing a district must pay a fee 
of about $1,000 for enforcement, education and other program costs, Valdez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the City Council gave final approval to a two-year trial program 
to permit vending in eight special districts. But the council has yet to 
finalize the details on how the program will operate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council approved a fee structure for vendors interested in 
participating. Later in the day, a committee of the council reviewed a proposal 
for using Public Works and Building and Safety inspectors to enforce the rules 
for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they expect all elements of the program to be approved and 
finalized by July. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima and Panorama City and who 
sponsored the street-vending legislation, said he was surprised to learn this 
week how fast the Valley group was moving to establish the district. But he 
said he would work with the group to achieve its goal, as long as area business 
owners approve of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community-driven process," he said. "If we have a vending district 
in my district, it would have to be driven by the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, street vendors have taken advantage of a state grant through 
Mission College in Sylmar to educate vendors. The classes, held each day at 
classrooms owned by Catholic nuns on Blythe Street in Panorama City, have an 
enrollment of about 80 vendors, each of whom pays a $5 monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes began with about 20 vendors, but have increased so fast since the 
vending program was approved in January that evening classes are now planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vending program has been harshly criticized by business owners 
who fear vendors will take away their business, the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn. supports the establishment of a vending district in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "VICA definitely supports it," said David Fleming, a VICA representative and 
city fire commissioner. "I don't see that a little additional competition will 
hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fleming concedes that there may be individual business owners near the 
proposed district who oppose the program.

BALLOT MEASURE BACKERS SAY THEIR MAIL ISN'T ARRIVING; COMPLAINT: POST OFFICE 
INVESTIGATION IS ASKED BY GROUP THAT WANTS TO BAN MOST HEALTH AND PUBLIC 
EDUCATION BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Organizers of Save Our State's proposed immigration-reform initiative called 
Wednesday for an investigation of the Santa Ana post office, claiming that 
checks and signed petitions mailed by supporters were not being delivered to 
the campaign's Tustin headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 supporters of the initiative gathered Wednesday morning in front of 
the post office on Sunflower Avenue to draw attention to their demand. Chairman 
Ron Prince said the group has received dozens of calls from supporters who 
wondered why their checks hadn't been cashed and their requests for more 
petition forms had gone unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kiley, a political adviser to the initiative campaign, said the group had 
been expecting a rush of mailed petitions and donations in the days after an 
April 1 deadline the campaign set for workers, but the expected flood of mail 
never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing in attempts to reach post office officials directly, Kiley said, 
campaign organizers asked Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) to get the 
post office to look into the suspected disappearance of mail destined for the 
SOS campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Fanelli, district administrator for Dornan's office, said that the office 
receives requests from constituents for inquiries to federal agencies every 
day, and that it had passed along the request to postal authorities. "It's a 
standard thing," Fanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gillis, manager of the Santa Ana post office, which daily handles 6 
million pieces of mail to and from Orange County, said the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service has begun to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there's no specific evidence yet of mail lost or tampered 
with," Gillis said. "I have the highest regard for the integrity of our 
employees." He added: "Anytime we get a complaint we take it very seriously. . 
. . If they give us specific information, we will always investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, a co-author of the initiative, which calls for denying illegal 
immigrants most public education and health benefits, said he believes someone 
may be "stacking the mail to keep it from getting to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative supporters said they could not afford to wait for a two- or 
three-week investigation. The group has until April 22 to submit petitions 
bearing the signatures of 395,000 registered voters in order to get the 
initiative on the November state ballot, and has 310,000 so far, Ezell said. It 
may request an extended deadline of at least 10 days on grounds that the mail 
problem caused a setback, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said the group will wait for results of the Postal Service inquiry 
before deciding what to do next. "We're considering requesting an extension, 
but I don't think we need it," he said.

MAN FOUND FATALLY SHOT ON ANAHEIM SIDEWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were investigating the shooting death late Wednesday of an unidentified 
man found on the sidewalk near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and West 
Wilken Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 9 p.m., police received several 911 calls reporting a man shot on 
the sidewalk in the 2200 block of Harbor, according to Sgt. Gary A. Querry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a busy area," Querry said. "Lots of people go by there." 
</P>
<P>
 No details were available late Wednesday as homicide investigators combed the 
commercial area where many motels are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Querry said the shooting occurred next to a dental office and tire store, both 
of which were closed.

VOTERS BACK YOUTH MOVEMENT IN SAN FERNANDO RACE; ELECTION: DOUDE WYSBEEK, ONLY 
INCUMBENT REELECTED, WELCOMES VICTORIES BY JOANNE BALTIERREZ, RAUL GODINEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The five-member San Fernando City Council got an unexpected infusion of youth 
Tuesday night when newcomers Joanne Baltierrez and Raul Godinez ousted 
incumbents Dan Acuna and Jose Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Doude Wysbeek, 53, who was reelected, said he welcomed the new ideas 
promised by Baltierrez, 37, and Godinez, 32, after they replace Acuna, 53, and 
Hernandez, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have younger ideas," said Wysbeek, widely regarded as a conservative 
council member. "I think they will be good for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Acuna ran status-quo campaigns, centered on maintaining the 
current level of public services without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 All three incumbents whose seats were contested sought reelection, but only 
Wysbeek received enough votes, leading all candidates with 965. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltierrez, a social worker with the nonprofit CORO Foundation, a youth 
leadership training organization, promised to create literacy programs and 
bring more businesses into the city. She received 834 votes.  
</P>
<P>
 Godinez, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, said he 
would try to improve San Fernando's negative image by hiring a public relations 
consultant.  
</P>
<P>
 He also promised to clean up city government in the wake of the January firing 
of Parks Director Jess Margarito, a former council member, for allegedly 
falsifying official documents and misappropriating city funds. Godinez received 
833 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city's 6,000 registered voters, 2,406 took part in the election, an 
increase from the 1992 City Council elections, when 1,887 people voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good feeling I would be one of the winners," said Wysbeek, "and I 
thought Godinez would make it in, but I am surprised at the way things broke 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek was particularly surprised that only 579 people voted for Acuna, the 
city's mayor, who was running for his third consecutive four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though last time (1990) he had a few problems, he was the leading 
vote-getter," Wysbeek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message I heard on the streets was, 'Don't divide our community,' and 
both Baltierrez and Godinez seemed very aware of that in their campaigns," 
Wysbeek added. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna, who also promised to increase jobs and cut down on crime if reelected, 
took credit for the city's quick response to the Northridge earthquake. He 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City activists launched an unsuccessful recall campaign against Acuna in 1991, 
citing a history of financial problems. The state Fair Political Practices 
Commission issued a warning letter to Acuna in 1992 after finding that he 
improperly filed economic-interest statements and misused campaign funds, but 
no punitive action was ever taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, chairman of Cal State Northridge's urban studies and planning 
department, also fell short of reelection, receiving 740 votes. He has said he 
is a strong supporter of youth and senior citizen programs. Hernandez also was 
unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez said he was surprised that candidates with small campaign budgets 
received as many or more votes than better-financed candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Kay, who collected only 500 votes, had a $36,000 campaign fund, most of 
which was from his own law firm, according to campaign spending reports. John 
Becker, who did not file a report because he spent less than $1,000 on his 
campaign, received 516 votes. Most candidates spent between $10,000 and 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other candidate, Ed Guzman, received 423 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the others lost, but I'd like to think we worked hard, and 
we had a message that people liked," Godinez said. "I kept hearing that we had 
quite a bit of support, but I didn't know if that would mean we would get the 
third or fourth largest vote or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez said his first priority will be to have all council meetings 
televised.  
</P>
<P>
 The new council members will be sworn in Tuesday, and their first council 
meeting will be May 2.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FIRST-TIME CANDIDATE WINS SEAT ON PALMDALE 
COUNCIL; RETURNS: SHERIFF'S SGT. TERRY JUDGE IS THE TOP VOTE-GETTER. THE MAYOR 
AND A COUNCILMAN STAY IN OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unexpected finish, a virtual political unknown and first-time candidate 
came out on top in the Palmdale City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the election of Terry Judge in Tuesday's election, voters in 
Palmdale indicated satisfaction with their city leaders, retaining Jim Ledford 
for a second two-year term as mayor and Jim Root, one of two incumbents seeking 
reelection, for another four-year council term. Incumbent Teri Jones lost her 
bid to retain her council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Judge nor others seeking the two available council seats had a clear 
explanation of why Judge's campaign was so successful. 
</P>
<P>
 With crime a major issue in the community, Judge's 18 years with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department may have played a role. Judge said voters 
probably figured he has the most experience in combatting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the qualifications," he said. Judge was identified on the ballot as 
a sergeant with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Root, who finished second with 2,331 votes compared to Judge's 2,455, said: "I 
think law and order was a big issue. People were probably voting as much in 
favor of him as a sheriff as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor may be money. Although the bills are not all totaled, Judge 
estimates that $25,000 was spent on posters, mailers, advertisements and other 
efforts to get his message to the voters. Ledford put the tab for his 
successful campaign at about $20,000, while Root figured his at $15,000 or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, a six-year Palmdale resident, also said he may have gained some name 
recognition through teaming up with a pair of candidates who are well-known in 
the community. He ran on a slate with incumbent councilwoman Jones and Mike 
Dispenza, a Palmdale business owner who was challenging Ledford for the mayor's 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who finished a distant third in Tuesday's election in which less than 
20% of Palmdale's 34,130 registered voters participated, said she was unsure if 
Judge's success came at the expense of her own reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not active in Palmdale politics before the campaign or widely 
known in Palmdale, Judge said he did coach Little League. "I'm not one of those 
who try to make headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Judge was at a loss to explain his resounding success, mayoral 
candidate Dispenza had no reason for his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite billboards, lots of mailers, being well-known in the community and 
spending $37,000, Dispenza finished with just 2,362 votes, well below Ledford's 
3,208 votes.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWCOMERS EXPECTED TO SPLIT LANCASTER COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The days of virtual consensus among City Council members here may be over with 
the election of two newcomers who often have been critical of past council 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Michael Singer and homeowner activist Deborah 
Shelton were elected Tuesday along with one incumbent, the Rev. Henry Hearns, 
to fill the three available seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election with 29,222 votes cast, Singer garnered 5,421 votes; Hearns, 
3,993, and Shelton, 3,751. Incumbents Arnie Rodio and George Root were both 
ousted, finishing fifth and sixth, respectively with 2,779 and 2,759 votes, in 
a field of 13 candidates. Challenger Ron Thomason finished fourth, capturing 
3,438 votes. The remaining votes were split among the seven other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect Deborah (Shelton) and I will, in all probability, remain as closely 
aligned as we are at this point," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said they both expect more split votes from the new council, which will 
be sworn in Tuesday. "A 5-0 vote only represents one viewpoint," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearns, who with four years experience will become the senior council member, 
figures the election of Singer and Shelton will make his role as self-appointed 
peacemaker even more important. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner, who is not up for reelection until 1996, is doubtful 
the election will result in much change. Outgoing council members Rodio and 
Root both expressed concern about the two new members' impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they're planning some changes," Rodio said. "I hope they take their 
time and do it in the proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Both ousted incumbents blamed their losses on the city's retail incentive 
program and in particular a plan they and the other council members approved 
last year to give a chain pet-supply store $187,500 in redevelopment funds over 
several years to persuade the company to open a Lancaster store. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodio, a retired business owner, said he plans to take some time off before 
deciding how he will stay active in the community. Root said he will retire, 
travel and probably stay out of local politics.

<P>
 A man who police described as a transient was arrested on suspicion of fatally 
stabbing a Quartz Hill man, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ellis, 48, charged in the attack that occurred at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday, 
was being held without bail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Ellis approached Kenneth Wayne Vickers, 39, after he parked his 
truck in the 43200 block of 51st Street and the two men argued. The quarrel 
escalated into a fight that ended when Ellis stabbed Vickers several times with 
a utility knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers was taken to the Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, where he 
later died. CHAU LAM

KID STUFF: 'WETLANDS' WISDOM; OPERA USES ISSUE OF PROGRESS VS. MOTHER NATURE TO 
TEACH CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Man threatens beast. Beast outsmarts man. Man (a) sees error of his ways and 
repents, or (b) ends up looking like a total jerk.  
</P>
<P>
 From Aesop to Bugs Bunny, that premise has worked for centuries, and now Opera 
Pacific has put its own spin on it with "Crisis in the Wetlands," a children's 
opera that pits decent but shortsighted humans against a trio of ingenious 
critters in a high-stakes conflict between progress and Mother Nature. But this 
time the ending isn't so pat. 
</P>
<P>
 This adaptation of a Brazilian musical by Marilia Carvalho de Almeida presents 
an often volatile issue in simplified terms as a way to teach children creative 
problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we try to show is that there are reasonable solutions to 
complex problems," said Kevin Crysler, Opera Pacific's community programs 
director. "There are two valid points to any issue, and we need to work 
together to find a common solution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wetlands," which debuted in 1992, is one of three Opera Pacific children's 
works currently touring Southland elementary schools. The other two focus on 
anti-smoking and self-esteem. The group also presents an interactive program 
for developmentally disabled students, an abridged English version of "Don 
Pasquale" for high school students and next year will mount a bilingual opera 
on the Latino experience in Orange County based on a story by a local 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, "Wetlands" will have a rare public performance at 1:30 p.m. during 
Earth Day festivities held, appropriately enough, at Upper Newport Bay, one of 
the three major remaining wetlands areas in Orange County. Earth Day 
festivities run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and include children's art activities, 
naturalist-led tours, touch tanks, environmentally themed exhibits and 
entertainment. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea & Sage chapter of the National Audubon Society, one of the 
conservation groups that will be represented at Earth Day, recently formed an 
alliance with Opera Pacific that has breathed new life into "Wetlands," Crysler 
said. Beginning next fall, groups booking the show will have the option of 
adding a post-performance "wetlands lab" led by Sea & Sage volunteers. Hands-on 
activities will include a study of animal adaptations with live and stuffed 
creatures, an examination of pond life and a look at wetlands' role in the 
ecosystem, said one of the programs creators, Trude Hurd, project director of 
the San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who complete the project will receive a bookmark that lists the 
locations of the three local wetlands (the other two being San Joaquin Marsh 
and the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach), Hurd said. Opera Pacific 
also provides a study guide compiled by the Acorn Group, a creator of science 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message to the kids is 'Now you've seen the opera, done the stuff in 
school, but the most important part is to see (the wetlands environment) up 
close: live, muddy and wet,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wetlands" was adapted for Opera Pacific's community-outreach group, the 
Overture Company, from De Almeida's 1984 environmental opera, "Confusao no 
Brejo" ("Tumult in the Marsh"). The 1984 work was designed to teach, as the 
author puts it, "how important it is to understand other people's hopes, to 
preserve their right to live, and to respect their way of living." 
</P>
<P>
 The central characters in "Wetlands" are Owl, Heron and Grumpfy Frog, 
residents of a marsh designated as the site for a new road. When the project's 
engineer and her assistant arrive, the creatures devise a plan to persuade the 
humans not to destroy their habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the audience, the animals sing "The Song of the Marsh" to the 
humans, who have been conveniently captured (don't ask us how) by Grumpfy. The 
enlightened humans strike a compromise and join the animals in celebration with 
grand operatic flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetlands preservation has caused heated debate among local developers, 
government agencies and conservationists, but despite the subject matter, 
Crysler claims his company's show has no political overtones. In fact, he 
added, a large chunk of Opera Pacific's funding comes from the local 
developers, and to date he has heard nothing negative from them about the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment is an important issue in Southern California . . . where 95% 
of the indigenous wetlands are gone, and the ones that are left are located in 
prime real estate areas," Crysler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way of showing people that wetlands are valuable, that paving them 
over is a bad environmental decision. Children need to understand the bigger 
picture. It's just a matter of education; it's nothing to get angry about."

COMEDY; UNDER HIS SPELL; YOU'LL NEVER GET SLEEPY WATCHING THIS HYPNOTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If comic-hypnotist Flip Orley had his way, he'd cast a spell over the planet 
and plant this thought deep, deep into our souls: 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all hypnotists are cape-wearing, turban-topped Svengalis looking for 
weak-minded, pablum-brained sots to help fake the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The stereotype is one that Orley -- who brings his two-hour show to the Brea 
Improv through Sunday, April 24 -- has been trying to overcome for 10 years, 
since incorporating hypnotism into the stand-up act he started in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have the preconceived notion that we are some hokey older guy 
with a beer belly in a tuxedo doing some cheesy lounge act," Orley said in a 
phone interview from the home he shares with his wife, Dana, in Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite a concerted effort to get the word out, progress can only be 
measured in small steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done 'Comic Strip Live,' 'Entertainment Tonight' and a lot of local TV. 
I'm definitely breaking down some barriers, but you have to recognize the fact 
you need to be patient and go a step at a time."  
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the message keeps Orley, who has a degree from the Chicago Institute 
of Hypnotism, on the road about 40 weeks a year, but he's not complaining, even 
if it means doing it club by club, city by city. For now, he's content to work 
his way through the 50 states, polish his act and gain exposure in new markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, things are going well, and I do enjoy it," he said. "If I didn't, 
I'd be a personal-injury lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Orley, who is scheduled to appear on NBC's "Today" show May 5, 
would like to do Las Vegas, perhaps put together a cable special or start 
playing theaters, which would give him more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I take the next step up, I want to make sure I'm ready," Orley 
explained. "Maybe I'm being too cautious, but I'm setting a good foundation so 
when I'm in a theater, I'm ready to be there. I'm constantly adapting my act. 
The show must be ready to look bigger and be bigger and really fill the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orley's show is generally hilarious, he takes hypnotism seriously and 
is careful not to embarrass his volunteers. He will not make anyone bark like a 
dog or squeal like a pig. "Now why are some of you looking disappointed?" he 
asks in some of his shows. 
</P>
<P>
 After he hypnotizes people, the laughs come when Orley transforms them into 
contestants on a "Newlywed Game," candidates for a film critic's job or 
Mississippi cousins telling Geraldo about space aliens they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Orley also appreciates and supports the positive things hypnotism can achieve. 
He has worked with his wife and others, and, responding to demand after his 
shows, has put together self-help videos, including ones for smoking and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't just try to put the whammy on someone," he said. "I helped my wife 
sleep better, control her weight more easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Another example was a neighbor who had recovered from a car accident but 
remained a nervous wreck about motoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body had healed, but the psyche hadn't," he said. "I worked with her to 
be a better passenger." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also worked with athletes to improve muscle memory, concentration and 
relaxation. But one thing remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every person is different," Orley said. "Suggestions may or may not last, but 
if you learn self-hypnosis, you can reinforce the suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
 As for nonbelievers, Orley says they only need to pay attention to realize his 
performances are no hocus-pocus mumbo jumbo. When a volunteer cannot say their 
own name for $1 million, it is no act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit close," he says. "You can look directly into someone's eyes and you can 
see they think they should know the answer but it isn't coming to them. These 
really subtle things are incredibly interesting, because if you are a skeptic, 
you can see a lot of funny responses but question if it's real. You see things 
people wouldn't think to do consciously -- facial expressions, body language. 
It really lends credibility to the fact that something is going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Orley's mind goes blank when he tries to remember some truly 
classic shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been computer cataloguing. I've seen some amazing things," he 
said, laughing as he tried to come up with an answer, before remembering a show 
he did in Denver. Strangers were paired up in a "Newlywed Game," vying for big 
prizes chosen especially for them. A year later, one of the couples got 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 Orley generally starts his routine with a monologue before asking volunteers 
to take a seat on the stage. But he cautions he doesn't want anyone who is 
drunk or a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you don't think you're a (jerk)," Orley explains in the show, "if 
someone else thinks you are, that counts. So don't come up." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the volunteers are on stage, he does a mass hypnotic motion and then 
weeds out the subjects who don't go under. 
</P>
<P>
 That settled, he offers the suggestions and scenarios to those who made the 
cut. Let the laughter begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start every show having no idea what I'm going to do," he said. "Then I try 
to see what's going to work. 'The Dating Game.' A family from Mississippi. Or 
the psychics. From bit to bit and moment to moment, they teach me what they're 
capable of and what direction to take the show." 
</P>
<P>
 That spontaneity and creativity, however, determine the quality of the 
performance, meaning whether he succeeds or fails that night is out of Orley's 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downside with my show," he said, "is there is a little bit of the 
unknown, but the upside to that is I can't be bored, and I can't do my show by 
rote. I have to be involved, really keep my head into what I'm doing. That 
makes it fun for me, night in and night out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix native, who has been married nearly four years, traces his start 
to the time he picked up a copy of "How to Pick Up Girls Through Hypnotism" in 
the sixth grade. And yes, the title is exactly why he did it. Reality, however, 
threw him a curve, denying him the "megalomania control" he was after. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he picked up an appreciation for the discipline and an early lesson 
in romance. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out, Orley recalled, he was always the brotherly type to the girls 
he wanted to date, so he was relegated to the role of confidant. He did, 
however, salvage some control. When asked for opinions on affairs of the heart, 
he would reply with self-serving advice: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you should dump him."

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK

<P>
 The Swan Silvertones "Swan Silvertones & Singin' in My Soul" 
</P>
<P>
 Vee-Jay  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a group that would have nothing to fear if the FDA decided to apply 
truth-in-labeling laws to the monikers of music groups. This veteran gospel 
ensemble makes sounds as gleamingly graceful as its name. 
</P>
<P>
 This CD brings together two of the Silvertones' mid-'50s albums -- 24 songs in 
all -- for the Vee-Jay label, when it was at its artistic peak. Where so much 
contemporary Christian music sounds as if the singers live in an anesthetically 
induced state of eternal bliss, the Silvertones always manage to evoke the very 
human struggle to hold tight to faith in the face of earthly obstacles and 
distractions. Musically, the Silvertones simply are one of the most important 
small ensembles in 20th-Century gospel. Having started in the late '30s, it 
began as a traditional a cappella quartet, led by the elastic vocals of Claude 
Jeter, who also was an accomplished gospel songwriter (he wrote a third of the 
songs here). When they added guitar and drums to make the infectious rhythms 
even more pronounced, they helped change the sound of modern gospel music.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Jeter's silky tenor, which can slide effortlessly to a sweet 
falsetto, inspired a generation of R & B and soul singers who came of age in 
the '50s and '60s. Listen close and you can hear licks later copped by Sam 
Cooke, Otis Redding, Levi Stubbs and Eddie Kendricks. The way he repeats the 
phrase "I will never" in "Jesus Remembers" makes you think Van Morrison must 
have spent some time with Swans' records in his formative years, too. The 
unadulterated a cappella spirit in "Sinner Man" shows there were no studio 
tricks required. Say amen, somebody. RANDY LEWIS

 Gil Scott-Heron 
</P>
<P>
 "Spirits" 
</P>
<P>
 TVT  
</P>
<P>
 The Kurt Cobain suicide will likely be the pop world's story of the year, and 
it's the most profoundly disturbing one to come out of that world in years. 
There is not much worse than promise rubbing itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 So what we need right now are survivors' tales, stories of resiliency in which 
hard experience is faced, and, if not transcended, then at least endured. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Scott-Heron's first U.S. album in 12 years comes just in time. "Spirits" 
is a moving and eloquent argument against despair, delivered by a man who has 
won the right to make that argument, given that despair seems to have been his 
close acquaintance. In the early '70s, Scott-Heron emerged with a series of 
distinctive albums that combined intimate soul and blues vocals, jazz and funk 
instrumental backup, poetic lyrics and spoken monologues. His wide-ranging 
music was catchy enough to please the ear, and his lyrical vision alternated 
between tough, biting political satire ("The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," 
"Whitey on the Moon") and a yearning and heartbroken humanity ("The Bottle," 
"Winter in America"). 
</P>
<P>
 Rappers often cite Scott-Heron as a founding father, and it might have been 
tempting for him to slant this comeback release toward a hip-hop audience. 
While he alludes to rap rhythms in the album's opening and closing tracks, 
"Spirits" stays true to his '70s style. Instead of trying to replicate the 
booming, chaotic sound of today's streets, Scott-Heron dwells for much of the 
album in the delicate, highly personal moods that can envelop a small, 
late-night jazz and blues club. It's an album given over largely to saxophones, 
pianos and his own frayed and burdened voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap is very much on Scott-Heron's mind in the opening "Message to the 
Messengers," a quietly passionate address to young rappers that respects their 
mission but doesn't mince rhymes about such common rap lapses as brutal sexism 
and foolish vulgarity. And Scott-Heron is a master rhymer. In "Work for Peace," 
he assails an economy founded on a marriage of "the military and the monetary." 
As the song progresses, he spins a widening web of "-ary" rhymes off that core 
phrase, illustrating in raw sound the point he is making: that the influence of 
what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the "military-industrial complex" is 
pervasive, and, absurdly but inescapably, destruction has become the engine of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of "Spirits" is Scott-Heron's unsparing, yet ultimately forgiving 
depiction of how an idealistic man can fail, how an educated and motivated man 
can lose his way. In a reprise of his wrenching early-'70s song, "Home Is Where 
the Hatred Is," a poisonous mixture of pride and shame keeps a drug addict from 
turning to the only people who can help him.  
</P>
<P>
 But the album's fundamental message lies in its concluding song title, "Don't 
Give Up." Take responsibility for your own life, keep trying to do better, get 
back up when you fall back down. Hang in there, Scott-Heron gently urges. Maybe 
the spirits will call. MIKE BOEHM

SPOTLIGHT; MEAL TICKETS; BALLGAMES, CONCERTS SERVE AS ENTREE TO CORNUCOPIA OF 
ENTREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the recent past, the following choice for a night out was a necessity: A 
full-on dinner or an evening at a sports event, show room or concert hall. Not 
both. You'd settle for grabbing a snack before or after if you chose from the 
latter three. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's different. Movies remain our most popular diversion but, 
interestingly enough, about our most restrictive one when it comes to filling 
the stomach. Food service at most movie theaters is limited to popcorn, hot 
dogs, nachos with cheese and assorted and sundry commercial candies, just what 
most health-conscious folks dream about eating, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Go to a ballgame, a concert, even a museum, though, and you've often got more 
dining options than you can count on one hand. You'll find an accomplished 
tearoom at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, the wonderful Topaz Cafe at the 
Bowers, full-service dining at dinner theaters such as Elizabeth Howard's, 
snack fare at comedy clubs and well, the list stretches on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 So I recently did a little field work on this subject -- what with the Angels' 
first homestand underway and the summer concert season about to follow -- and 
have put together a short report on my findings. Just be aware that this 
represents a limited cross-section, because practically every venue from golf 
courses to libraries has some form of food service nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 (Now, if only movie house mogul Jim Edwards would find more evolved snacks to 
sell in his Edwards Cinemas, I'd be a happy camper.) Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
 You'd better come hungry if you come to the Big A, because this ballpark 
offers up a cornucopia of foodstuffs.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm betting the eclectic demographics of Southern California make this so. The 
concessions are managed by Ogden Corp., a $2-billion plus catering industry 
giant that supplies, among other things, sporting venues around the country. 
The caterer offers a truly mind-numbing arr my friends find it hard to get 
excited about meals at the Coach House, where one dines at long tables on 
rock-hard chairs, with complete strangers. But if you think of dining here as a 
convenience -- and are in the mood to make new friends -- then by all means 
come to the concert early. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't been to a show here, this is another dark box of a room, with a 
country-style bar to the rear and a red, 1941 Singer automobile on a side wall, 
purely for st thing I tasted was the stadium's vaunted cinnamon roll, a bargain 
at $2. They are baked fresh on game day -- oversized sticky, yeasty pull-apart 
buns, studded with chopped pecans, or plain, if you prefer. If you have a sweet 
tooth, it's better to eat it right away, as opposed to carrying it all the way 
back to your seat, given how fast these things cool and dry out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the food concessions are on the entrance level, places with names such 
as California Deli, Sausage House, Fish Bowl and Sushi Sushi. One site where 
the lines were tolerable was the Potato Hut, where you get a pretty fair-sized 
baked potato and an obscene amount of calorific toppings, including cheese, 
bacon, sour cream and chili, all for $4.75. I liked my Italiano Potato, at the 
same price, a mess of marinara sauce, Parmesan and sweet sausage. The potato 
tasted hot and fresh, and the sauce had a generous amount of sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fish and chips, another popular item, seems to have improved 
drastically from three years ago, the last time I tasted the dish at this park. 
Back then, I found the fish greasy and flavorless. On Monday, what I ate was 
hand battered and quite tasty, a huge portion. We'll forgive the fact that the 
stadium uses the lowly pollock, and not the Icelandic cod you'd get at a more 
tony venue. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want pizza, a Tombstone franchise offers pies whole or by the slice on 
the entrance level, while upstairs on the terrace level, at Mamma Mia's pasta 
house, the pizzas are made with a Boboli crust. I prefer the ones upstairs, and 
it is interesting that Tombstone was allowed to sneak into the Big A, because 
this stadium, unlike Dodger Stadium, limits its "branded stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the good sausages come from Farmer John, but my favorite, Chef Jack's 
Special Sausage ($5), comes from a recipe invented by the onetime personal chef 
of Gene Autry. It's a sort of mild, crumbly Italian sausage with a sweet spice, 
maybe basil, in the meat mixture and traces of liver in the finish.  
</P>
<P>
 As to the much-maligned idea of having sushi at the national pastime, I'm 
tempted to say that real men . . . well, let's just say that this version, the 
California Roll, is rather void of flavor, enough to give Japanese food a bad 
reputation. I lived in Japan for three years, and I never saw men eating sushi 
in Yomiyuri Stadium, where the Tokyo Giants play. Yakisoba-fried buckwheat 
noodles, yes, but not sushi.  
</P>
<P>
 Sushi Sushi, the Japanese food concession here, also offers teriyaki chicken 
and deep-fried egg rolls, but it has covered all bases and offers yakisoba as 
well. Lucky you. I'd rather have a double bag of peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium. 2000 Gene Autry Way, Anaheim. (714) 254-3100. The Irvine 
Improvisation 
</P>
<P>
 Being hungry isn't the only reason for dining at the Irvine Improv. Anyone who 
comes for dinner gets preferential seating near the stage, well within the 
clutches of the comedian performing that evening. The thin-skinned had better 
consider the second row. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one big black box of a comedy club, with only the brick wall behind 
the stage providing any sort of warmth. Dinner begins about two hours before 
the show, delivered by a team of surprisingly humorless food servers. Hmmph. 
And you thought everyone wanted to be in comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 What you eat holds few surprises but should be adequate for the surroundings. 
The Improv has a full bar, so you can start with original mixed drinks with 
names like Sex on the Stage or Barrel of Laughs, a beer, wine or a soft drink. 
You can ask the food server to apply whatever you drink to the club's two-drink 
minimum. I can't imagine the request would be refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The best appetizer here is probably ceviche, cut-up pieces of mahi mahi and 
bay shrimp that have been marinated in lime juice, then tossed with chopped 
onion, cilantro and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 The fried cheese isn't bad, either, lightly battered mozzarella sticks served 
with marinara sauce. The huge dinner salads come in large glass bowls, with a 
hefty portion of croutons and the dressings astride in plastic tubs. They 
aren't, however, included with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime rib is the entree of choice, a good-sized slab that is both flavorful 
and juicy. It's a bargain at $11.95. A slightly tired chicken Cordon Bleu is 
the most filling one. It's a huge chicken breast stuffed with ham and Swiss, 
blanketed with a floury Mornay sauce. There's always a broiled fish on hand, 
and there is a ponderous baked manicotti for pasta lovers.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't try any dessert, because the ones on the tray just weren't inviting 
enough. But the coffee here is fresh, will keep you properly on edge for the 
show, and can be applied to that pesky two-drink minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Improvisation, 4255 Campus Drive, in the Marketplace Shopping 
Center, Irvine. (714) 854-5455. Dinner for two, $22-$35. The Pond 
</P>
<P>
 I never expected to enjoy my meal at the Pond, the spiffy new home of the 
Anaheim Mighty Ducks, but that's what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the Ogden Corp. has decided to make the Pond its showcase for 
state-of-the-art concessions food. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news for Orange County concert-goers and sports fans, who can now 
nosh on designer sausages at Sausage Haus, terrific Italian beef sandwiches 
stuffed with meat trucked in directly from a Chicago meat packer at Main Street 
Deli, reasonably tasty calzones and pizzas at Pizza Supremo, Mexican fare 
complete with salsa ranging from mild to "suicidal" at Chili Peppers and even 
Yoshinoya's Japanese beef bowl, all situated in strategic spots around the 
Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is in the semi-exclusive Anaheim Club, where NHL officials, Mighty Duck 
season ticket-holders and even Barry Manilow groupies convene, that the 
building's upscale food is truly available to the masses. Anyone, you see, can 
make a reservation in this restaurant (a curved, wood- and cloth-paneled room 
with a decor that I'd describe as being a couple of steps up the charm ladder 
from what you'd find in an airport.) A reservation here allows visitors to rub 
elbows with celebrities and to access the building's snazzy club level, where 
the bars, private boxes and club seats are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Food in the Anaheim Club is simple and elegant, anything from a homey 
ossobuco-braised veal with marrow to a rather risque Jamaican jerk chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the food almost remarkable, considering the context. Rod Stewart was 
performing the night I visited, and almost everyone came in at once. 
Nonetheless, my onion soup had a finely browned crust, my wife's Caesar was 
crisp and gutsy and the dish I selected, mixed grille, had good sausage, 
premium lamb and reasonably moist grilled chicken on it, each lapping up its 
own respective sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalapenos play a large part here, both in the rolls and in the sauce on the 
restaurant's best dessert, an original mixed berries with a sweet jalapeno 
sauce. Executive chef Michael Glover deserves a lot of credit for overseeing 
all the concessions and dining kitchens, and Anaheim Club manager Norm Santos 
gets kudos for the intelligent wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks season is over, but if your budget doesn't allow you to dine at the 
Anaheim Club when you visit for a concert or soccer game this summer, then 
building manager John Nicoletti suggests you "wait until after the event begins 
to hunt up something to eat, when the lines subside."  
</P>
<P>
 That's what I personally would do. I'd wait until the first song started, and 
then I'd head over to the Main Street Deli on the Terrace Level for a beef 
sandwich with sweet peppers. Unless, of course, I was lucky enough to find a 
friend with a private box. Then, I'd let him do the ordering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Club at the Pond. 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. (714) 704-2450. 
American Express, MasterCard and Visa. Dinner for two, $40-$65. The Coach House 
</P>
<P>
 Some ofeffect. (Owner Gary Folgner says: "I traded a guy $1,000 worth of tacos 
from my Mexican restaurant for it.") 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve early enough, and you might get lucky and score one of the 
half-dozen-odd booths to have dinner in and watch the show from. Come close to 
8, however, when the music usually begins, and you can count on a hard seat and 
a more limited choice from the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can deny that the Coach House features the most eclectic, hip and 
daring mix of performers in Orange County. I wish I could say the same for the 
menu. But it must be said that this is another mass-production type kitchen, 
where the strengths depend more on the quality of the products than on the 
skill of their preparation.  
</P>
<P>
 And in that regard, the Coach House scores good marks. Both the New York steak 
and the swordfish are fine, generous cuts, there is a good salsa for the gloopy 
nachos and the side dishes, rice pilaf, baked potatoes and good mixed veggies, 
are appealingly done. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen bakes up apple pies fresh daily, and even concocts mud pies, the 
chocolate kind, from scratch. I like this mud pie, an Oreo type crust, 
chocolate ice cream in the center and a thick smear of fudge across the top. 
After 8 p.m., rely on the good burgers or cheesy potato skins to ward off those 
munchies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. (714) 496-8930. 
Dinner for two, $19-$35. A Few Others 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the symphony or legitimate theater had better make plans for an early 
dinner elsewhere if they plan on combining food with entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory, the Orange County Performing Arts Center and the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre don't have much more than perfunctory refreshment for their 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Patterson of the Performing Arts Center offered a small apologia for the 
lack of red wine, coffee, cookies or sandwiches, but he says, "That's the way 
it is for now."  
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Rep does have cookies from a company called Taylor's Mom's as well 
as upscale boxed candies, besides a full bar.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Barclay serves good, designer cookies such as white chocolate 
macadamia nut, as well as a good strong cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, you can count on good restaurants such as Gustaf Anders, Diva, 
Scott's Seafood and Amici in the South Coast area, and places like Chinatown, 
Zuni Grill, Bistro 201 and Bistango in Irvine.

WANNA DANCE?: HOUSE AT ODDS IN EMPIRE GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might say the odds are not with the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a spectacular 13,000-square-foot nightclub with a 1,200-square-foot 
dance floor, deluxe billiard tables, valet parking and a $7 cover in this 
sluggish economy is what some would call a gamble. Especially considering that 
the club, the Empire Ballroom in Costa Mesa, is only to be open Thursday 
through Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the really odd part is that the club plans to succeed by spinning House 
music exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 House is a genre that other clubs have already discovered doesn't go over well 
in Orange County -- at least not with the upscale, 21- to 35-year-old set that 
most splashy clubs try to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this fazes the unnamed financial backers of the Empire Ballroom, which 
opened its doors to the public last weekend. The club is managed by Gregg 
Mullholand and Mike Tuomisto (formerly a co-owner of Newport Beach's defunct 
N.Y.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 Empire Ballroom is an 18,000-square-foot former factory that has been gutted 
and recycled into what architect Rick McCormick of Hatch Designs in Costa Mesa 
dubs "neoterric post-Industrialism." He defines neoterric as recent or modern 
-- "It basically means taking an old building and giving it (a) new use," says 
McCormick, who also designed the interiors at the Shark Club, Metropolis and 
N.Y.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical trendy urban touches have been incorporated, such as exposed pipes and 
beams. The once graffiti-covered brick walls have been sandblasted to their 
original gray state, and concrete walls have been warmed a rustic orange. Rich 
varnished woods and plush sofas and chairs -- favorite signature details of 
McCormick's -- complement the otherwise hard, industrial setting. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 parking spaces are designated on the 2 1/2 acres the building sits 
on -- not nearly enough to accommodate the number of patrons (up to 1,000 
nightly) the club anticipates. Many will likely use the lots of the surrounding 
industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to other large clubs in the county, Empire Ballroom will not serve 
food . . . at least, not yet. Neither manager could make up his mind on this 
topic. Mullholand finally concluded that "people don't like to eat where they 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus here will be on dancing.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the first hard-core dance club since N.Y.C. closed," Mullholand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with a domed ceiling, a lounge overlooking the floor and a sound 
system designed to keep ears ringing long after you've left, the dance area is 
sure to impress. Less impressive is the touted entertainment from L.A. and New 
York.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Mullholand: "We don't hire deejays or go-go dancers from Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they should, and lower the cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the dress code amuses. "Nightlife attire" is spelled out as no 
sneakers or shorts, though hot pants are welcome. Ballcaps are a no-no, unless 
one accessorizes an Armani suit, Tuomisto says. 
</P>
<P>
 All this without an attitude, both managers claim.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be snotty," Mullholand promised. "We're going to be upscale 
but fun, not expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-huh. We'll see.

POP MUSIC; GREAT SCOT! THE OTHER STEWART HONORS CELTIC FOLKLORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First came Rod the Mod. Now here's Andy the Antiquary, the second warbling 
Scot named Stewart to play in Anaheim this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Stewart threw his rock 'n' roll bash for the masses at the Anaheim Arena. 
Andy M. Stewart, a leading figure in Celtic music for 20 years, will operate in 
cozier precincts suited to his tradition-steeped folk approach. 
</P>
<P>
 When he sings Friday at the Rose & Crown British Pub and Restaurant, he and 
his partner, guitarist Gerry O'Beirne, likely will feature some songs that were 
hits back in the day of Maggie May's great-great-great-great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 No song that the rock 'n' roll Stewart has sung -- not "Maggie May," not 
"Reason to Believe," not "Mandolin Wind" -- is more moving than "Land o' the 
Leal," the sublime ballad that ends the Celtic Stewart's fine new album, "Man 
in the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Written more than 200 years ago by Lady Nairne, a Scottish noblewoman, "Land 
o' the Leal" is a sadly beautiful deathbed oration that comes off as a more 
poetic answer to "Danny Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart acknowledges that when he sings the song, he can gauge its success 
partly by how effectively it tugs at his listeners' tear ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to give it all you have, but taste is the watchword for these kinds 
of things," he said, discussing the art of the tear-jerking ballad during a 
recent phone interview from a tour stop in Pittsburgh. "You wouldn't want to do 
any song filled with mawkish sentimentality, but (if it's) something with 
genuine feeling, if you draw a tear you've done your job." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's firm, emotive tenor is ideally suited to ballads, but there are 
other dimensions to his take on Celtic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "MacGregor's Gathering," another highlight of his new album, is a fiery poem 
by Sir Walter Scott that Stewart set to music. It's the anthem of a rebellious 
Scottish clan that vows vengeance against usurping overlords. Centuries later, 
the lyrics can help illuminate the tribal pride and ethnic fury behind any 
number of bloody clashes that are spreading across the globe: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If they rob us of name and pursue us with beagles,  
</P>
<P>
 Give their roofs to the flame and their flesh to the eagles.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's songbook isn't all blood and tears and lyricists from the 18th and 
19th centuries. But even the songs he writes himself, and the material he draws 
from other contemporary folk songwriters, are deeply rooted in traditional 
forms and themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the songs I've written, people have thought they were traditional 
songs," he said. "That's not an intention of mine, to sit around and reproduce 
something. But that's the way I compose, and the way they come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 42, traces his traditional roots to his upbringing in the farming 
town of Blairgowrie, in the Perthshire region at the edge of the Scottish 
Highlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's got a lot of tourists and skiers, but at that time it was mostly 
farmers," he recalled. "It's not the case now, but back in the '50s there was 
still a lot of Ceilis (traditional Celtic dances) and things. People would get 
together and play something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always interested in traditional music, but growing up, of course, I 
loved pop music. All kids do. But I never went that route because I don't think 
I'd be good at it. I have a much better understanding of traditional music. 
Hopefully it's not a blinkered, one-track approach to music, and influences 
come in from different kinds of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart was part of a generation of young Scottish and Irish musicians who set 
about retrieving Celtic music from mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started performing in Scotland, there was very little of it on 
the radio," he said. The popular stuff of the day "was music-hallish Scottish 
music, the 'Brigadoon' type stuff. Really awful. Suddenly, more genuine types 
of music came through. Bands started to get a much wider acceptance. Now, 
Celtic music worldwide can be played in symphony halls. It's certainly spread 
from people just wanting to get together." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Stewart found his first full-time gig when he was asked to join Silly 
Wizard, a Scottish band that earned acclaim for putting across traditional 
music with rollicking energy and virtuosic musicianship. In 1983 he branched 
out with the first of five albums under his own name. Several were 
collaborations with an Irish guitarist, Manus Lunny. Stewart's new sidekick is 
O'Beirne, a versatile Irish string player whose songs have been given exposure 
by Maura O'Connell, a Celtic-rooted singer who is building a career in the 
country music market. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stewart, Celtic tradition, if rightly conceived, defies the archival 
stuffiness that can set in if artists forget the lively qualities that enabled 
the tradition to survive in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music was for fun and relaxation, for having a very good time. 
Historically, it took people away from a harsh regime of work. Music and 
dancing was a great relief. If people come to the concert, they'll discover 
it's far from studious or boring. It's meant to be good fun, otherwise I 
wouldn't do it. I like to have a good time."

SURFING: PROPOSAL TO CUT METER HOURS PRAISED AS POLITICALLY CORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dawn Patrol surfers at the Huntington bluffs who are getting tired of 
shredding, thrashing and then sprinting to pay the parking meter could be 
spending more time in the water if City Councilman Jim Silva gets his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who's also running for Orange County supervisor, wants to cut back the 
hours the meters are in use. He said such a move would also help relieve 
parking congestion in nearby residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many calls from surfers all saying thanks," said Silva, a former 
surfer and a father of a surfer. "And half the calls were from the homeowners 
saying it's a good idea. (The City Council) just needs to adopt this, but it 
should be in place within 30 days . . . after all, we're Surf City." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva is confident the proposal will pass. Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, parking meters operate between 5 a.m. and dusk. Silva would move 
that up to 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig is delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 That's great. There are fewer and fewer places up and down the California 
coastline where you can park for free. But from Seal Beach to Newport, it's 
Parking Meter City. Any news about not having to pay meters is good news to me. 
I guess he's trying to get a coupla surfer votes there.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, votes or no votes, it's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The affected meters are inside two bluff-top parking lots north of Golden West 
Street. The meters along Pacific Coast Highway are unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking meters are like banks and help the city generate $650,000 to $700,000 
a year in revenue, said Jim Way, Huntington Beach operations supervisor, adding 
that the money goes into the city's general fund for street repairs and traffic 
control. Silva said his plan would cost about $3,000 a year in lost revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers know what a pain parking meters are, especially when the surf's good 
and you run out of quarters. This year it costs more to park at the beach. 
Huntington's parking meters now cost 25 cents for every 10 minutes. That's 15 
quarters for a 2 1/2-hour surf session. Who carries that many quarters? 
</P>
<P>
 The only other options are parking in the residential area and walking a 
half-mile or buying a yearly city parking permit for $50 at the lifeguard 
headquarters, 103 Pacific Coast Highway. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, it's cheaper. The meters open at 9 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. 
Cost is 25 cents every 20 minutes or three quarters an hour, said Mark 
Summerville, San Clemente maintenance service manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the pier bowl parking lot is metered only from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.," 
Summerville added. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone for an early-morning pier session in South County? 
</P>
<P>
 You gotta face it, there's few places where you don't have to pay for the 
beaches these days. You can't find too much in HB without paying the parking 
meter.  
</P>

 VISITING: Noah Budroe, the 26-year-old Hawaiian pro surfer, was in Orange 
County last week. Budroe, who is third in the Hawaiian pro-amateur circuit, is 
still reeling from his first place at Honolua Bay in Maui on Feb. 13, in what 
Fig described as epic surf. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard it was stand-up barrels, reach for the ceiling stuff -- just epic.  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN televised Budroe's $3,000 victory, which had him defeating world champ 
Derek Ho in incredible tubes. We talked with Budroe about his last ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the tube that I won the contest with, I remember seeing Derek Ho paddling 
out and looking at me," Budroe said. "He had this facial expression that said, 
'Whoa! Wow! What a wave!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Budroe said he back-doored it, went behind the wave, then came through and 
into a tunnel and went out the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 What's it like to get tubed? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kinda hard to explain," Budroe said. "You just pull in and everything's 
blue and people are paddling out and there's photographers. You're in it, and 
everything's peaceful. And, there's little bubbles here and there, and before 
you know it, you're popping out and you're just stoked!" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Contests: Kelly Slater, 21, former 1992 world champion, racked up back-to-back 
victories with his Assn. of Surfing Professionals first-place earlier this 
month at the Rip Curl Pro at Bell's Beach, Australia, and last month's Bud Tour 
contest at Seaside in North San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like Slater's on a reign of terror.  
</P>
<P>
 After the contest, Slater, who beat Great Britain's Martin Potter in the 
finals, told ASP organizers: "This really is a sweet win. In fact, something 
that I needed to prove to myself that I am again focused on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 And Potter? "I'll get the (bum) next time," he told the organizers, chuckling.

SPECIAL SCREENING: JUZO ITAMI BURIES HIS MISCHIEVOUS IMPULSES IN 'THE FUNERAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Juzo Itami got edgier as his directing career grew. Just think about "Tampopo" 
or "A Taxing Woman." In those movies, his humor can be sardonic to the point of 
serrated as he grins at a Japan co-opted by the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first picture, "The Funeral," Itami was more subdued, even 
reflective. The 1984 serio-comedy (which screens Friday night as part of UC 
Irvine's "Off the Beaten Path" series) is reined in, as if Itami is trying very 
hard to be thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes against Itami's mischievous impulses, which tend to make a film like 
"Tampopo" such a hoot. "The Funeral" isn't as good (or as extravagantly funny) 
as what came later, but it's still witty and enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's revealing too; in fact, it may be one of Itami's most exploratory 
offerings. The world he looks at is very small (what happens when a hip couple 
must hold a funeral, old Japan-style), but with fine details. Sometimes they 
add up in ho-hum ways, but mostly they're interesting as little documents of 
the Japanese culture. 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar theme, one the new wing of Japanese filmmakers routinely turned to 
in the '80s, is how the middle-class struggles to maintain traditions while 
devouring everything from the West, especially the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Itami uses a funeral as his whimsical centerpiece. All the events leading to 
the wake and actual funeral are highly idealized and marked by long-held 
customs, a fact that perplexes Wabisuke (Tsutomu Yamazaki) and Chizuko (Nobuko 
Miyamoto), a prosperous young couple who must take care of the remains of 
Chizuko's father. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual is precise and requires conformity, but the two are beleaguered by 
all sorts of questions. Where do you get a Shinto priest to say the correct 
prayers? How much do you pay after he's found? How do you arrange the 
ceremonial incense? What do you say to mourners? What about that symbolic 
gesture of hammering a nail in the coffin? Do you bang it once, twice or three 
times? 
</P>
<P>
 Wabisuke and Chizuko even turn to a self-help video, "The ABCs of a Funeral," 
for advice. It's a giddy scene as they memorize just the right things to tell 
family and friends; Chizuko, a practical wife if ever there was one, is 
relieved when she finds a brief platitude that the video's narrator assures 
will fit every occasion. "Nice and short," Chizuko chirps. "That's for me!" 
</P>
<P>
 There are patches in "The Funeral" that drag on, especially when Itami dwells 
on not-so-interesting characters, such as a pal of Wabisuke's who wants to film 
the whole affair. But just when the movie's pace barely jogs, Itami tosses in 
some dash, like the video scene or a touching speech by the dead man's wife 
(Kin Sugai) or the strange visit to a crematory. 
</P>
<P>
 In that passage, an assistant suddenly confesses how he's plagued by 
nightmares of corpses coming alive, just as the flames engulf them. But then he 
gathers himself and describes how babies have to be cremated gently, almost 
with an artist's touch. The scene isn't ghoulish at all; it's oddly humane. 
</P>

</P>

KIDS ON FILM: 'MAJOR LEAGUE II': A HIT DESPITE ITS STRIKINGLY PREDICTABLE PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Major League II," the Cleveland Indians are back after a championship 
season, but some of the star players (played by Charlie Sheen, Dennis Haysbert 
and Omar Epps) seem to have lost some of their drive in the off-season and need 
to rediscover their spark. (Rated PG).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A scrappy underdog beats the odds and achieves undreamed-of success. 
</P>
<P>
 If that basic plot is at the core of just about every sports movie ever made, 
a slight variation often fuels their sequels. The team, spoiled by success, 
starts to get cocky, distracted by the temptations of fame, and loses sight of 
the things that made it a winner in the first place -- only to regain its 
balance in time for the rousing big-game finale. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is at the heart of the two top-grossing movies now 
playing: "D2 The Mighty Ducks" and "Major League II." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, to be young again, when the banal cliches of such Hollywood product seemed 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids in the audience at a recent screening of "Major League II" were 
either oblivious to the predictable plot turns or were willing to overlook them 
in exchange for an hour and 41 minutes of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction among youngsters at the Tustin Marketplace was uniformly positive, 
although it stopped well short of wildly enthusiastic.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Aaron Faiola, an 11-year-old from Irvine, "It was funny." But even as he 
said it, he shrugged his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron, admittedly more of a hockey fan than a baseball fan, added that he 
liked "Major League II" better than "D2," which didn't have enough jokes for 
his taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like it," he explained. "This was better." 
</P>
<P>
 Zac Tull of Anaheim, 7, came down on the other side of the "D2"/"Major League 
2" debate. The hockey film, he said, was funnier, and its ending was more 
satisfying: "They went against people who were a lot bigger and still won." 
</P>
<P>
 Zac did enjoy "Major League II" though, he said, adding that Rick (Wild Thing) 
Vaughn was his favorite character. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, played by Charlie Sheen, is the reckless young Harley-riding pitcher 
who carried the team with his fastball in the first film. This time around he's 
gone straight, trading in his leather vest for a suit and tie, and losing his 
drive (and his fastball) in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Others returning from the first film (released in 1989) include Pedro Cerrano 
(Dennis Haysbert), who has traded in voodoo for Buddhism and, um, lost his 
drive in the process, and Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes in the first film, 
Omar Epps this time), who has gone Hollywood in the off-season, and lost . . . 
oh, you know the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other returnees include Tom Berenger as Jake, the catcher who turns to 
managing this time when his bad knees finally end his career. Bob Uecker is the 
team's radio announcer, in the film's funniest turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is the Cleveland Indians, our national symbol of hapless desperation, 
who in the first film scrapped their way to the playoffs. The new film picks up 
the following season, which starts dismally but -- you guessed it -- turns 
around when the team rediscovers its soul. The Chicago White Sox, dressed in 
black, play the bad guys in the playoff finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids in the Tustin audience seemed to respond best to the humor (often crude, 
but no more so than in many TV shows these days), the big-game finish and the 
character of "Wild Thing," who benefited from a rousing, high-decibel rendition 
of the pop novelty tune that inspired his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Even non-baseball fans gave the film a thumbs up. Jeremy Heydon, 7, of Orange 
admitted he doesn't really like the sport, "but I have lots of baseball cards." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was good, said Jeremy, getting a supporting nod from his 8-year-old 
sister, Amber, who chipped in that she liked "Wild Thing" the best and thought 
the movie was funny.

MAKE THAT MEXICO, NOT NEW MEXICO; THEME MAY BE SOUTHWESTERN, BUT FOOD ISN'T AT 
TORTILLA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo will be the first anniversary of gaudy, festive Tortilla Beach. 
How appropriate. Spring is a particularly pleasant season here, with the patio 
warmed by the sun and gentle breezes wafting in from nearby Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 However, owners Lori Neuss and Cary Hardwick, who also own Spaghettini next 
door, don't want us to think of Tortilla Beach as a Mexican restaurant. The 
soundtrack is more likely to be Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff" than "Besame 
Mucho" or "Mi Desgracia." And the waiters like to inform you that the 
restaurant's theme is Southwestern, not Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's sorta Southwestern. Tortilla Beach borrows its erratic decor not 
only from the Southwest but from Mexico, the Caribbean and Surf City. The 
exterior is pale yellow, decorated with brightly striped awnings you can see 
from a long way off. Inside, there's a corrugated metal hood over the open 
kitchen, giving the interior a snazzy Third World glint. If the surfboards, 
plastic sharks and suchlike paraphernalia that festoon the walls are 
Southwestern, they must come from the hitherto unnoticed beaches of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu itself is basically Mexican. Pass the big copper Aztec sundial at the 
entrance and enter the main dining area, a colorful, post-modern space painted 
up in various shades of pastel. You will be greeted with a basket of corn chips 
and a couple of different salsas, just as you would in any number of Mexican 
chain restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 You may actually be tempted to make a meal of these fresh, hot chips, as I 
was. They come in three varieties -- red (colored with chili), blue and the 
usual yellow -- and the salsa quemada (roasted salsa) is especially delicious. 
But when I looked at the menu and saw dishes such as chicken in mole sauce, 
blackened fish tacos and specials such as shrimp in garlic sauce, it appeared 
some restraint on the chips would be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't call Tortilla Beach's drinks restrained though. They run to things like 
giant tumblers of pink lemonade or the 32-ounce margarita they call Big Kahuna. 
The latter is quite good, really: hand-shaken Sauza tequila with fresh lime 
juice, Triple Sec and Grand Marnier (for $1.50 more, you even get to keep the 
shaker). Just don't think about driving after meeting up with a Big Kahuna. 
</P>
<P>
 I had high hopes for an appetizer called the three-dip sampler, but the idea 
didn't live up to expectations. It's a platter containing individual dishes of 
chili con queso , guacamole and spicy tuna dip, three condiments that were born 
to keep a hot tortilla chip company. Alas, all three could have been better. 
Chili con queso -- a melted cheese dip -- needs more fire and less salt, the 
guacamole is slightly fizzy and the tuna dip (the best of the three, thanks to 
a bit of cilantro and chopped jalapeno) would be more at home between slices of 
white bread. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be better off starting with spicy chicken tortilla soup, a fiery broth 
thickened with gooey Jack cheese, big chunks of chicken meat and about three 
times as many shredded tortillas as I've ever seen in a soup bowl. Shrimp 
cocktail Rosarita Beach style is chock full of fresh, clean-tasting peeled 
shrimp, plus chopped avocado, chilies, cilantro and onion. Shrimp Sonora salad, 
offered as a daily special, is a colorful mix of hearts of romaine, jicama, 
oranges, pasilla peppers and fresh shrimp, all bound by an exotic, 
anise-flavored vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally there are tacos, burritos and enchiladas, the best of them being the 
tacos based (remember, this is Tortilla Beach ) on flaky, neutral codfish, 
which is well suited to the deep fryer and to the various sauce combos you can 
impose on a taco shell. I particularly like the blackened fish taco, made with 
nicely blackened fish in a green chili cilantro sauce and topped with plenty of 
shredded cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy shrimp enchilada is another good seafood item: Cajun shrimp, gooey 
cheese, spinach and mild green chilies offset by a strangely aromatic tomatillo 
sauce. By contrast, the carne asada burrito is impressive mostly for its 
considerable girth. There is little or no flavor to the grilled beef inside, 
and the rice that surrounds it is equally bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Blandness isn't the chicken mole ' s problem. The menu tells us that this 
"traditional Mexican sauce made from chilies, dried fruits, nuts and cocoa . . 
. sounds strange but is great." I'd say the exact opposite. It's sounds great, 
but what you get -- a tired, frazzled chicken breast enveloped in a sweet, 
fruity sauce heavy on the chocolate and cinnamon -- is definitely strange. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problems don't quite end there. Carnitas, the classic Mexican roast 
pork, comes up oily and frazzled too, after the partially shredded bits of pork 
are finished on a griddle (of all things). You'll also want to avoid the dry, 
gummy refried beans, especially when you have the alternative of tasty black 
beans to go with the sweet corn cake and tasty Mexican rice that accompany most 
of these dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you've been gorging yourself, make room for the sizzling apple pie, 
one of the more surprising desserts I've seen in a while. This concoction is a 
good wedge of apple pie served on a red-hot iron platter sizzling with buttery 
caramel sauce, the whole thing topped with vanilla ice cream. The caramel 
candies up on the dish, all the while being cooled by the ice cream as it melts 
like crazy. It's a great idea, and it is probably reason enough, weather aside, 
to pay a visit to this quirky new Mexican (not, in my book, New Mexican) place. 
</P>
<P>
 Tortilla Beach is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.50 to $7.95. Soups and 
salads are $1.95 to $7.95. Other dishes are $6.95 to $11.95. The apple pie is 
$4.95.

PARKER'S PLACE: DESTINATION: UNKNOWN

</HEADLINE>

in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like watching a bad comic, making plans for a vacation can be not very fun at 
all -- torture, in fact -- if your group contains at least two people who know 
what they want, and at least one who doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to Israel," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to Tanzania," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go wherever you decide," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 This conversation took place back in January. We three brothers-in-law had 
taken two previous trips together in two previous Marches, and had a loose 
understanding that we'd try to do it again last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacations are like cars in that once you've owned one, you want the next to be 
bigger, faster, bitchener. Two years ago, the big island of Hawaii had proved a 
wonderful place to go -- good diving and weather, friendly natives (most of 
them California transplants) and exotic blue cocktails served in gallon-sized 
snifters with tropical fruit kabobs in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, we upped the ante and, after some bickering, decided upon the 
Fijian island of Taveuni. This place turned out to be absolutely superb in 
every respect, one of those trips that you'll never duplicate and never forget. 
We dived, wallowed in paradise, ate good food, hiked endlessly, slid down 
waterfalls, made some friends, drank kava and had the bar and astonishing South 
Pacific sunsets pretty much to ourselves every night for 10 straight days. It 
was even cheap. The bats that cut the skies at dust were the size of crows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, I want to go to Israel," Dave had said. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Tom had said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds good to me," I had added. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the next nine months we banked on Israel, until the time approached 
for making serious plans. Like most human beings, we put off decision-making 
for as long as possible, on the theory that nothing is real until it can't be 
avoided any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still want to go to Israel," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there," Tom said. "I want to go to Tanzania." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm," I offered. "You guys decide." 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the entire month of January, and part of February, in three-way 
long-distance diplomacy that would qualify each of us for office in Washington, 
based on our skill at talking a lot and deciding nothing. The two brothers 
(Dave and Tom) were deadlocked, while I kept saying I'd do whatever they 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt confident in my position that we'd go to neither Israel nor Tanzania 
because both contestants are well-spoken, strong-willed and brim with resolve. 
Compromise seemed impossible. Besides, I suspected I was running out of money, 
so flying halfway around the world seemed brazen. I was secretly hoping for 
something closer and easier, like Cozumel or Belize, but these were compact 
destinations, and at this point we were clearly talking luxury sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to Israel," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll go to Israel," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel it is," I agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The impossible had happened; compromise had done its narcotic work, and as of 
early March we were to be bound for Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Cairo, and six days of 
world class scuba diving in the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud to have been so decisive, I immediately began gloating to friends and 
acquaintances that I'd be "diving the Sinai" in a few short weeks. I made the 
usual promises to bring back gifts for certain people, and some friends were 
kind enough to give me books about the area, advice, even numbers to call at 
the county to find out how many butt-mangling shots I'd need before we left. I 
reserved the airplane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 I purchased three green cardboard Fuji throwaway cameras, though one would 
have been plenty because though I love snapping pictures, I have no interest 
whatsoever in seeing the developed film, and rarely return one for processing. 
</P>
<P>
 I got my passport renewed at the U.S. post office in Laguna Hills. It was an 
arduous process, but my new green passport did show up a few weeks later, as 
promised.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, late one Sunday night I called my Wells Fargo 24-hour customer-service 
number to make sure I had enough shekels left to finance this Middle Eastern 
extravaganza. I was a skosh short. More than a skosh, actually. To complete the 
picture, I also didn't have a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning I called my agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you hurry up and get me a book deal so I can take a vacation?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things take time, Jefferson. It's more important to do it right than to 
do it quickly. By the way, I'll be on vacation the next two weeks, but my 
office will keep you posted." 
</P>
<P>
 Forlorn, I called Dave, then Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go to Israel," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go anyway," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 As this year's Judas, I then took over the job of suggesting alternative 
destinations. This was not easy because I knew that Dave and Tom didn't want to 
go anywhere other than where they said they wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion of Mexico was met with a tomb-like silence. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion of Belize was met with the kind of enthusiasm one might have for 
a trip to the proctologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, I broke down, positing Key West, Denver, New York City, (even my 
house in Laguna Canyon!) as destinations we all might enjoy. I toyed with the 
idea of trading my house for Tom's in Mission Viejo for a week so we would feel 
as if we were on vacation, but that did nothing for Dave at all, stuck in New 
York and still dreaming of 100-foot visibility in the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to Costa Rica," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You two decide," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Costa Rica sounds good to me." I said. 
</P>
<P>
 One week, 500 phone calls, six sleepless nights and three ulcers later, we 
pow-wowed long distance for the final verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'll go to Costa Rica," Dave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great, let's go to Costa Rica," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, then, how about Costa Rica?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 This decided, the good news spread like a new religion and our party of three 
became a party of five, then of seven, then of eight. This wasn't just a 
vacation, it was an invasion. It sure sounded like fun. 
</P>
<P>
 I imagined all eight of us stuffed into a rented van of some kind, touring the 
Costa Rican countryside in glee, somewhat like R. P. McMurphy and the asylum 
patients in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." This trip, I saw, had all the 
right ingredients for a great one: chaotic planning, last-minute everything, an 
air of genuine desperation giving way to a genuine . . . need for a vacation! 
</P>
<P>
 Tom, in our weeks of trip-planning darkness, had said more than once that we 
were lucky to be having such problems. I couldn't agree more. Vacation-planning 
ordeals are for those fortunate enough to be taking a trip in the first place. 
We've been blessed this year, and I'm thankful for it. I will not bore you with 
pictures when I get back.

3-HOUR TOUR: IN YORBA LINDA'S OLD TOWNE, QUALITY'S A MAIN ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To best experience Old Towne Yorba Linda, simply go up one side of Main Street 
and down the next. The most interesting shops are all within a few doors of one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 10:30: When was the last time you were in a real hardware store -- not 
some huge "depot" or "club"? Established in 1927, Yorba Linda Hardware retains 
a spirit of earlier days. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise includes pitchforks and "world's best" rags -- recycled diapers -- 
for $1.29. Nails and screws are weighed out on the store's original scale, a 
contraption littered with little numbers: "An old, old-timer," agreed sales 
assistant Russ Prosser. "I don't understand all those (numbers) m'self." 
</P>
<P>
 But Prosser, 73, understands plenty else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of us here knows something," he said. "I know plumbing; another guy 
knows lumber. You come in, you get personalized conversation. We sell you just 
what you need, and we take back what you don't need. I know every customer who 
comes in here, so we don't let 'em buy anything they don't need; that would be 
bad. When it comes to plumbing, you're talking a dollar instead of a lot of 
dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's how we do it around here." 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 to 11: Gifts n Treasures sells on consignment items fashioned by 20 
mostly local crafters. Owner Peggyann Cowart has several crafters working in 
ceramics, wood, shirts and so on, and it's a beguiling potpourri. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a mop puppy ($14) and a musical brontosaurus ($26) with three strings 
struck by three balls. Nursery rhyme scenes ($30 to $38) in durable Fimo clay 
depict a cow jumping over the moon, and Jack and Jill next to a well. 
Home-sweet-home-style signs include one that says, "Missing, husband and cat. 
Reward for the cat." 
</P>
<P>
 Among miniature teapot sets is one in the form of strawberries and another of 
bears playing saxophone. Ceramic soap dispensers take the shape of kittens, 
elephants and hippos. 
</P>
<P>
 Books include the truly beautiful coffee table tome "The Ubiquitous Pig," and 
flying Holstein cows entreat "Love one an udder." 
</P>
<P>
 11 to 11:30: Rebecca Lynn's shop offers an impressive collection of antique 
English barometers and clocks ($215 to $675) and replicas of Victorian lamps 
($100 to $500). 
</P>
<P>
 The clocks variously incorporate brass, marble and wood, and some have little 
pillars. The lamps are made with beads, satin and chiffon in a variety of 
colors and have to be seen to be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 More typical antiques include an Underwood typewriter ($49) and a Singer 
sewing machine ($295). 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn's friends call her "the mad stenciler," and the walls of the shop are 
stenciled with borders that are both elaborate and tasteful. She teaches 
stenciling classes at the shop on Saturdays (two hours, $20, two-week advance 
reservations) and her system of overlaid designs can also be applied to 
furniture and fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 to noon: Abby wears wire-rimmed glasses and a sensitive expression. 
"Dolls have really gone toward realism," said Louise Pearson, proprietor of All 
Dolled Up. Abby, No. 10 of a porcelain edition of 25, sells for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Handmade porcelain dolls at All Dolled Up start at $800; vinyl versions hover 
around $500, and manufactured porcelain dolls are offered for as little as $69. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Less realistic are Omar and Khayyam ($380 for the pair). The camel is acrylic 
plush, and its master is made of felt. 
</P>
<P>
 The unabashedly un- realistic Muffy VanderBear line of dolls cover an entire 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Muffy is the youngest member of the VanderBear family. Muffy's pets include 
horse Oatsey, best friend Hoppy VanderHare and Her Dog Lulu, the trademarked 
name for her terrier. Muffy's accessories include an armoire and sleigh bed; 
Lulu's include a leash, dog bed and bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 One case contains "retired Muffies," discontinued, and apparently more 
valuable, items from the line. A StradiBearius violin, once $12, is now $125.  
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: Main Street Restaurant, previously mentioned in this column but 
worth mentioning again, offers Mexican and Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Quesadilla Ortega ($4.95) and Our Famous Antipasta ($6.95) share the appetizer 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant Burrito ($5.50) is stuffed eggplant with ricotta and mozzarella in a 
flour tortilla; Killer Burrito ($5.95) is called "classic," but inside you'll 
find Italian sausage, meatballs, bell peppers, onions and a zesty Italian 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The patio features both a New York City skyline and a Main Street facade 
depicting Lynn's Cafe and Mike's Barbershop; Lynn Ruocco owns Main Street 
Restaurant, and her husband runs Mike's Trim next door. The light switch and 
electrical outlet in the men's room may have been decorated by the mad 
stenciler or one of her proteges. Old Towne Yorba Linda

DUCKS CLOSE SEASON WITH A BANG, A LOSS; HOCKEY: VANCOUVER SCORES TWICE IN THE

 When the smoke finally cleared after the Mighty Ducks' last game of the season 
-- and their last pyrotechnics display -- the Ducks finished with one of the 
best first-year records an NHL expansion team has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers will set the record for most points by an expansion team. 
But the Ducks (33-46-5) set the record for victories and the Panthers can do no 
better than tie it tonight, when they play the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks lost their finale to Vancouver, 2-1, Wednesday at The Pond of 
Anaheim in front of a crowd of 17,174 that saw fireworks before the game and in 
the parking lot afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, the 1967-68 Kings and Flyers set the record of 31 in a 
74-game season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you work hard, you can reap benefits and dividends. That's what we did," 
Coach Ron Wilson said. "We convinced our players at the beginning of training 
camp that if we worked hard and played as a team, we'd have success." 
</P>
<P>
 As the last game of the season ended, many of the Canucks skated over to shake 
the hand of Wilson, a Vancouver assistant last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, Wilson thought winning 17 or 18 games sounded reasonable. 
General Manager Jack Ferreira and President Tony Tavares dared to dream of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't dare to think of finishing ahead of the Kings. But the players 
were bold enough to wear playoff-inspired "Skate for Eight" T-shirts -- and 
they ended up staying in the race until San Jose eliminated them April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of great moments, a lot of firsts," goalie Guy Hebert said. 
"I think we were pretty successful. We achieved a lot, but we didn't achieve 
our main goal of the playoffs. . . . (But) I think everybody has a sense of 
pride, from Mr. Ferreira on down." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the team's other achievements, they: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Set an NHL record for road victories by an expansion team with 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finished with 71 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Swept their season series with the New York Rangers, Winnipeg, Philadelphia 
and Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shut out Toronto, the New York Islanders and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saw 15 players reach career scoring highs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never went more than six games without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there weren't disappointments. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An 0-6 record against San Jose that all but killed the Ducks' playoff 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 2-10 record against the other four recent expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And 20 one-goal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The game against Vancouver was scoreless until 11:05 of the second, when Pavel 
Bure, who leads the NHL in goals, jumped on a loose puck and turned on the 
speed. He skated in on Guy Hebert, then went to his backhand and lifted the 
puck high for his 60th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a minute later, Tim Hunter made it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks made the third period close when defenseman David Williams scored 
off a pass from Terry Yake at 5:16. With the assist, Yake became the team's 
leading scorer with 52 points, one more than the injured Bob Corkum. One of 
their best chances to tie came with about five minutes left, when Garry Valk 
angled a shot from the left side that was wide to the right. But the season ran 
out, and the Ducks take their spot on the expansion list. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing they have in common with teams from different eras is that 
nobody expected much of any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my concerns were just that we wouldn't be competitive," Stu Grimson 
said. "You hear you'll be blown out night after night. . . . But my fears and 
apprehensions were quashed the first week when I saw how hard-working this 
bunch was." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira said he will offer to renegotiate the contracts 
of standouts Bob Corkum and Bobby Dollas, who have two years remaining. Corkum, 
who made $260,000, led the team with 23 goals and was leading the team with 51 
points before a severed foot tendon ended his season after 76 games. Dollas, a 
defenseman, made $250,000 and led the team in plus-minus at plus-19. . . . 
Center Stephan Lebeau left the game with a sprained right ankle and did not 
return. For Openers 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks established a record for victories by an expansion team in 
its first season. The all-time leaders: 03,14,09,05 Team Year Pts Mighty Ducks 
1993-94 33 Florida* 1993-94 32 Kings 1967-68 31 Philadelphia 1967-68 31

SANDERS HAS A BRAWL IN NEAR-PERFECT GAME; BASEBALL: CINCINNATI OUTFIELDER 
CHARGES MOUND, CLEARS BENCHES IN EIGHTH INNING WHEN HIT BY PITCH FROM EXPOS' 
MARTINEZ, WHO WAS PERFECT UNTIL THEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reggie Sanders wasn't happy when Pedro Martinez pitched him inside twice 
earlier in the game, resulting in two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Martinez tried it a third time and plunked Sanders on the elbow, the 
Cincinnati Red outfielder charged the mound, triggering your typical 
bench-clearing incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time, Sanders charged the mound to attack a pitcher five outs from 
throwing a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any (way) a pitcher throwing a perfect game is going 
to hit somebody on purpose," Montreal Manager Felipe Alou said after a strange, 
3-2 victory over the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a normal day," said Martinez, who lost the no-hitter in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was anything but ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, younger brother of the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez, had a 2-0 lead with 
one out in the eighth when he hit Sanders with an 0-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders charged the mound, tackled Martinez and touched off an incident that 
lasted several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way I was trying to hit him," said Martinez, who had come high 
and inside on both of Sanders' previous at-bats before striking out the 
slugger. "I guess he took it the wrong way. I was surprised he charged out. 
Surprised, but not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Montreal catcher Darrin Fletcher: "He had come up and in before. He 
brushed Sanders back in his first two at-bats, and Sanders gave him a long 
stare. What surprised me was Martinez stared right back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was ejected, and Martinez regained his composure to strike out Roberto 
Kelly on a pitch in the dirt. With Willie Greene at the plate, the 22-year-old 
right-hander threw a wild pitch that sent pinch-runner Jerome Walton to third. 
Greene then flied to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a spirit of forgiveness in this game," Alou said. "Martinez 
is a guy of 155 pounds. I'd like to see Sanders charge one of those big 
220-pound specimens." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was trying to become the second pitcher in a week to throw a 
no-hitter in his first complete game. Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves did it 
against the Dodgers last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who was 0-4 in four previous big league starts, struck out eight, 
walked none and was unafraid to come inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just Reggie," Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson said of Sanders, who 
wasn't available after the game. "He (Martinez) was up around the chin of three 
other guys. You don't take those things lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Dorsett ended the no-hit bid with a clean leadoff single to center in 
the ninth. John Wetteland (1-1) relieved, gave up a single to pinch-hitter 
Thomas Howard, then walked Tony Fernandez. Barry Larkin and Hal Morris followed 
with sacrifice flies, giving Wetteland his second blown save in two chances 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal won it in the ninth on an RBI single by pinch-hitter Lou Frazier. 
Fletcher, who homered twice and went four for four for the first four-hit game 
of his career, singled off Chuck McElroy (1-1). Cliff Floyd reached on an 
infield single with two out and Frazier blooped a single off Hector Carrasco, 
ending the Reds' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Rijo gave up five hits in eight innings, struck out four and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lucky," Rijo said. "Any time you get a no-decision in a game where 
someone almost pitches a perfect game, you know God must be smiling upon you."

JIM MURRAY: MASTERS COULD USE AN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Masters is a great and good sporting institution. I yield to no man in 
fondness for it. No way would I try to belittle it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, having said that, I wish to file a demurrer of sorts. It is this: I wish 
it were a little more vulnerable to attack. It is impregnable in its present 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, on Sunday, I was kind of longing for someone to come roaring out of 
the pack, mount up a garrison finish -- kind of like Johnny Miller firing that 
final-round 63 at Oakmont to win the 1973 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 But I knew it was impossible. Nobody was going to shoot a low, exciting number 
on that course. You could only hope one of the leaders would fire a high, 
exciting number. You knew that, if any of the leaders managed par or a little 
better, he was in. Pretty dull stuff. Playing for a tie, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to laud what the Masters is trying to do. All sports are in the same 
predicament. They have to fight continually to preserve the integrity of their 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Take football. They tinker with it every couple of years, change the blocking 
alignment, move the hash marks, change the contact. Only this year, they had to 
bow to the blizzard of field goals that was taking away from the historic 
object of the game -- to score touchdowns. They had to downgrade the field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 No sport is exempt. Pro basketball outlaws the zone defense. All basketball 
had to put in a shot clock; baskets count three points at long range, and the 
center jump that used to follow every basket now only opens a game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the march of science that frustrates games, too. Track and field has the 
devil's advocate role in stemming the use of steroids that make athletes run 
faster, jump higher, throw longer. Better times through chemistry is a constant 
bugaboo they have to fight off, to say nothing of the lawyers who seek to 
overthrow their authority and frustrate the illegality. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf's nemesis is technology. You turn the metallurgists and physicists loose 
on the great game and, pretty soon, you'll have a bag of tools that can shoot a 
59 all by themselves. They'll get square grooves, round grooves, oversized, 
hollow-backed implements you can't hardly hit off line. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open tries to head them off at the pass by growing ankle-high 
barbed-wire rough and narrowing fairways till you have to proceed down them 
single file. So, these guys get clubs you could hit out of a haystack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters doesn't have rough. So its main line of defense is the green. It 
takes its greens and tricks them up with undulations, slopes, peaks and valleys 
that defy reasoning. Almost gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 The putter, you see, is the one instrument they can't make foolproof. Some 
years ago, hockey introduced the curved stick to increase scoring. But putting 
is not susceptible to technology at all. Putting is between the ears. It's a 
function of nerves, not reflexes. Guys have won tournaments putting with a 
three-iron, to give you an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 So, that's the Masters' main line of defense. It makes the Maginot Line look 
like a sandcastle. It's foolproof, the one part of the game the technicians 
can't get at and overcome with a drawing board or an alloy. The brain is one 
part of the anatomy you can't improve in a gym or weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters is diabolical. Some of its greens look from a distance invitingly 
flat. The pin seems to be cut in the middle, inviting the player to play below 
the hole. But what appears flat is really a 50% (or more) grade. If you are 
suckered into landing your ball below the hole, it will roll back off the 
surface and back onto the fairway, maybe back to your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters has other configurations that call for a putt to have to turn at 
right angles at the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of this year's Masters, a lot of us were surprised to find the 
pins cut into what we have come to think of as "Sunday-afternoon locations." 
These are spots on the green for the pin that are usually not brought into play 
until the last round, when they want to punish audacious players and make the 
winner agonize for his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The greens were already so slippery, a polar bear would fall off. Veteran 
players had to try to squeeze the balls into the hole like toothpaste out of a 
tube. And longtime observers have never seen so many putts from great players 
come up short of the hole. Tom Kite, for instance, a U.S. Open winner, ended up 
so fearful of the hole that sometimes his second putt was short. 
</P>
<P>
 This preserved the integrity and dignity of Augusta National, but it had the 
effect of making the final round look more like a parade than a contest. A 69 
was to win it. That might not make the cut on a regular tour tournament 
nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th hole did not have a birdie all Sunday. Jose Maria Olazabal didn't so 
much win the tournament as survive it. He often took the scenic route to the 
holes but, once there, he was the best at sinking putts that had to turn a 
corner to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that a foreigner won our Masters. Shucks, Americans once won nine 
consecutive British Opens and 13 of 14, but nobody jumped off London Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that booby-trapped greens obviate that staple of the golf 
tournament, the late charge. We love the guy who comes riding to the rescue of 
the fort or the schoolmarm in the last reel. The chase is a staple of 
melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 There was none at Augusta this year. It was like seeing a title fight that was 
all clinches, watching a Super Bowl with the last six minutes of falling on the 
ball, it was the golf equivalent of the four-corner offense. 
</P>
<P>
 They should cut the pins on ice floes the first few days to run the ribbon 
clerks out but make the course subject to attack on the final day. After all, 
we want to see the rousing finish; we like to see the champ able to go for a 
knockout. Who wants to see Dempsey have to jab, Ruth have to bunt their way to 
victory?

ELLARD SIGNS WITH WASHINGTON; PRO FOOTBALL: LONG-TIME RAM RECEIVER GETS 
TWO-YEAR, $1.8-MILLION DEAL FROM THE REDSKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has played football for the last 11 years in Anaheim Stadium, but when 
Henry Ellard returns this season he will require directions to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I couldn't tell you where the visitors' dressing room is," said 
Ellard, who Wednesday became the newest member of the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, the Rams' all-time leading receiver in receptions (593) and yards 
(9,761), signed a two-year, $1.8-million contract with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, who earned $850,000 with the Rams last season, will receive an 
$800,000 signing bonus from the Redskins and a salary of $500,000 a year for 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams hope to replace Ellard with Houston wide receiver Haywood Jeffires, 
an unrestricted free agent. The team is also talking to Houston about a trade 
that would bring Kevin Donnalley to the Rams to start at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had signed Donnalley to an offer sheet, but the Oilers matched it. 
The Rams apparently haven't given up on acquiring Donnalley, and according to 
sources in Houston, have offered a second-round pick for him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Donnalley signed with the Oilers last Friday, assistant general manager 
Floyd Reese advised him that he might be dealt soon to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, meanwhile, made no real attempt to keep Ellard, although he led the 
team in receiving last season with 61 receptions for 945 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in L.A. for 11 years and there are lots of good memories, but 
things were changing and I didn't feel a part of those changes," Ellard said. 
"Once Ernie (Zampese, offensive coordinator) left to go to Dallas, it was time 
for me to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's business. I ended last season on a good note and that was important 
for me. In Washington I have the best situation with (head coach) Norv Turner, 
who worked with me for five years when he was with the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins also have asked Ellard to work with wide receiver Desmond Howard, 
who has yet to make an impact with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what Norv had me do with the Rams when they drafted Aaron Cox and 
Flipper Anderson," Ellard said. "It's a perfect role for me." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Rams began contract negotiations Wednesday with defensive 
end Robert Young, who has asked for $6 million for three years. The team also 
took a close look at USC defensive end Willie McGinest in preparation for the 
draft and worked out Charger linebacker Jerrol Williams and punter John Kidd.

DUCKS' FIRST SEASON ONE TO REMEMBER; HOCKEY: THEY FINISH WITH EXPANSION-RECORD 
33 VICTORIES DESPITE LOSING TO CANUCKS IN FINALE, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the smoke had finally cleared from the Mighty Ducks' last game of the 
season -- and their last pyrotechnics display -- the Ducks finished with one of 
the best first-year records in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers will set the record for most points by a first-year team. 
But the Ducks set the record for victories by an expansion team with 33, and 
the Panthers can do no better than tie it in their final game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks lost their finale to the Vancouver Canucks, 2-1, in front of 17,174 
Wednesday at The Pond of Anaheim that saw fireworks over the ice before the 
game and in the parking lot afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The team they feted finished with a 33-46-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, the expansion record of 31 victories was held by the 
1967-68 Kings and Philadelphia Flyers, who played a 74-game season in an 
all-expansion division. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you work hard, you can reap benefits and dividends. That's what we did," 
Coach Ron Wilson said. "We convinced our players at the beginning of training 
camp that if we worked hard and played as a team, we'd have success." 
</P>
<P>
 As the last game of the first season ended, many of the Canucks skated over to 
shake the hand of Wilson, a Canuck assistant last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Wilson thought winning 17 or 18 games sounded like a 
reasonable outcome. General Manager Jack Ferreira and President Tony Tavares 
dared to dream of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't dare to think of finishing ahead of the Kings. But the players 
were bold enough to wear playoff-inspired "Skate for Eight" T-shirts -- and 
they ended up staying in the race until San Jose eliminated them on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of great moments, a lot of firsts," goalie Guy Hebert said. 
"I think we were pretty successful. We achieved a lot, but we didn't achieve 
our main goal of the playoffs. . . . (But) I think everybody has a sense of 
pride, from Mr. Ferreira on down." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Ducks' other achievements: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They set an NHL record for road victories by an expansion team with 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They finished with 71 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They swept season series against the New York Rangers, Winnipeg Jets, 
Philadelphia Flyers and Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They shut out the Toronto Maple Leafs, the New York Islanders and the 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They had 15 players reach career scoring highs. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say there weren't disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 They included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An 0-6 record against San Jose that all but killed their playoff chances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 2-10 record against the other four recent expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Twenty one-goal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' finale was scoreless until 11:05 of the second period, when Pavel 
Bure of the Canucks scored his 60th goal. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a minute later, Tim Hunter made the score 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks made the third period close when defenseman David Williams scored 
off a pass from Terry Yake at 5:16. The assist made Yake the team's leading 
scorer, giving him 52 points, one more than injured Bob Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The team marked its 25th consecutive sellout and the 27th of the season by 
raising season-ticket prices on many seats for 1994-95. There is no change in 
the least expensive seats ($13) or the most expensive ($75 and $125). But 
others will go up from $1 to $12.50 each. For Openers 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks established a record for victories by an expansion team in 
its first season. The all-time leaders: 03,14,09,05 Team Year Pts Mighty Ducks 
1993-94 33 Florida* 1993-94 32 Kings 1967-68 31 Philadelphia 1967-68 31

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE REJECTS STANLEY'S LATEST USC REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Supreme Court justice Wednesday refused to order USC to reinstate its former 
women's basketball coach while she pursues a sex-bias lawsuit over being paid 
less than the men's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Sandra Day O'Connor turned down an emergency request by Marianne 
Stanley, who did not renew her $96,000-a-year contract after four years with 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley sued USC and Athletic Director Mike Garrett for $8 million, alleging 
discrimination and retaliation in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her lawsuit, Stanley, who has been replaced by Cheryl Miller, 
demanded equal pay with George Raveling, the USC men's basketball coach, who 
reportedly is paid $150,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies last August rejected Stanley's bid to force 
the university to reinstate her as coach, ruling that she failed to show any 
evidence of sex discrimination. Davies added that the men's and women's coaches 
perform different duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Davies' ruling in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley also unsuccessfully sought emergency help from O'Connor in September, 
when her case was pending before the 9th Circuit court.

PELE SAYS MARADONA IS WASHED UP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-time World Cup winner Pele said Wednesday that Argentina's Diego 
Maradona is so far past his best he should not even play in this summer's World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele, who helped Brazil win the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, said 
Maradona is only a shadow of the player who led Argentina to the World Cup 
title in 1986 and to second-place in Italy four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk to his friends and his manager two years ago and advise him 
to stop playing because he's not at his best," Pele said. "Now, he keeps 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to be in the best condition to play in this World 
Cup like he played before. I don't think that he's mentally and psychologically 
prepared for the World Cup. I feel sorry, because he's a great player."

RAMS' ELLARD BECOMES A REDSKIN; PRO FOOTBALL: ELEVEN-YEAR VETERAN AND TEAM'S 
ALL-TIME RECEIVING LEADER SIGNS TWO-YEAR, $1.8- MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 He has played football for the last 11 years in Anaheim Stadium, but when 
Henry Ellard returns this season he will require directions to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I couldn't tell you where the visitors' dressing room is," Ellard 
said Wednesday after signing a two-year, $1.8-million contract with the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard leads the Rams in receptions (593) and receiving yards (9,761) in his 
11 seasons. He will receive an $800,000 signing bonus from the Redskins and 
$500,000 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Ellard earned $850,000 with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The team hopes to replace Ellard with Houston Oiler wide receiver Haywood 
Jeffires, who remains an unrestricted free agent. The Rams are also talking to 
Houston about a trade for tackle Kevin Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Donnalley to an offer sheet, but the Oilers matched it. The 
Rams apparently haven't given up on acquiring Donnalley and, according to 
sources in Houston, have offered a second-round pick for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, meanwhile, made no real attempt to keep Ellard, although he led the 
team in receiving last season with 61 receptions for 945 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in L.A. for 11 years and there are lots of good memories, but 
things were changing and I didn't feel a part of those changes," Ellard said. 
"Once Ernie (Zampese, offensive coordinator) left to go to Dallas, it was time 
for me to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's business. I ended last season on a good note and that was important 
for me. In Washington, I have the best situation with (Coach) Norv Turner, who 
worked with me for five years when he was with the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins have also asked Ellard to work with wide receiver Desmond Howard, 
who has yet to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams began contract talks Wednesday with defensive end Robert Young, who 
asked for $6 million for three years.

PEPPERDINE LOSES RECRUIT TOO; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ONE DAY AFTER RESIGNATION OF 
ASBURY, RAMIREZ CHANGES MIND ABOUT COMMITMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after Tom Asbury resigned as the men's basketball coach at Pepperdine, 
one of the Waves' top recruits reneged on a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Ramirez, a 5-foot-10 point guard from Ventura College, recently visited 
the Malibu campus and told Asbury last week he would play for the Waves next 
season. But when Asbury announced Tuesday he was leaving for Kansas State, 
Ramirez decided not to sign a letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only visit I took, and I was very excited about playing at 
Pepperdine," said Ramirez, who averaged 15 points and six assists last season. 
"Now I think I'll wait it out and see what happens. I may want to take some 
other visits." 
</P>
<P>
 The spring signing period for prospective college athletes began Wednesday and 
continues through May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine signed three players during the early signing period in November 
and has two scholarships remaining. But with no coach, it might have trouble 
filling them. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling is also having trouble awarding his final two 
scholarships. He was hoping to sign 6-4 guard Jeron Roberts of Covina Charter 
Oak High and 6-6 forward Joe Zaletel of El Camino College near Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roberts, who averaged 33 points last season, received a letter of 
intent in the mail from USC, he signed with Wyoming. Zaletel, who averaged 28 
points, signed with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron Murray, a 6-0 guard from Glendora High and the brother of Tracy Murray 
of the Portland Trail Blazers, is the Trojans' lone recruit. He signed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has one scholarship remaining. The Bruins hope to give it to Jelani 
Gardner of Bellflower St. John Bosco High. Gardner, a 6-6 guard, said he will 
announce his decision Friday. He is also considering Cal and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gardner does not choose UCLA, the Bruins are in the running for 6-5 forward 
Brandon Jessie of Ventura College. Jessie has several recruiting trips planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the area's top players announced their choices Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Gillin, a 6-4 guard from Compton Dominguez, will attend Tulsa, and 6-1 
guard Sam Turks of Inglewood signed with Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi McKinney, a 5-9 guard from Palos Verdes Peninsula and one of the area's 
top girls' players, signed with Virginia. She also considered Auburn and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long way from home, but I'm thrilled to be going there," said 
McKinney, a four-year starter and three-time All-American.

CARLTON DENIES MAKING ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ZIPAY, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Philadelphia Phillie pitcher Steve Carlton on Wednesday angrily denied 
that he made anti-Semitic remarks and racial accusations attributed to him in a 
magazine article, and the American Jewish Congress backed off from its call to 
have him barred from the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The article has almost no truth in it. I reject it completely," Carlton said 
in a statement released by his business manager, Mike Sheehan. "It is wrong 
about my baseball career, my personal beliefs, my family life and my new 
hometown. There are so many errors that it would be foolish to try to correct 
them individually. . . . I specifically deny saying anything that could be 
interpreted as offensive to Jewish people. I stand on my long record of 
treating all teammates and opponents with the same respect, be they Jewish, 
black or white." 
</P>
<P>
 The story, written by free lancer Pat Jordan in the April issue of 
Philadelphia magazine, was based on a two-day visit to Carlton's 400-acre ranch 
near Durango, Colo., where he has lived since 1989. In the most controversial 
segment of the piece, Carlton discusses worldwide revolution, conspiracy 
theories and describes a survival shelter built underneath the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "One minute he'll say, 'The Russian and U.S. governments fill the air with 
low-frequency sound waves meant to control us,' " Jordan wrote, "and the next 
he'll say, 'The Elders of Zion rule the world,' and then, 'The British MI-5 and 
6 intelligence agencies have ruled the world since 1812' and '12 Jewish bankers 
meeting in Switzerland rule the world' and 'the world is controlled by a 
committee of 300 which meets at a roundtable in Rome.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The AJC wrote letters to baseball leaders, demanding that Carlton apologize 
and that baseball suspend plans to induct him into the Hall of Fame on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, the AJC dropped its protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentiments Mr. Carlton expressed are laudable," said Marc Palavin, an AJC 
spokesman. "We're glad to see him agree that anti-Semitism has no place in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and the magazine's editor, Eliot Kaplan, stood by the story.

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S NOFFSINGER SIGNS WITH MICHIGAN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Beach High's Stefanie Noffsinger said Wednesday that she has signed 
a letter of intent to play softball at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Noffsinger is a three-time All-Sunset League selection with 463 career 
strikeouts in 403 innings.Her career batting average is .332 and this year has 
a perfect 4-0 record allowing only three hits in 23 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Noffsinger suffered an eye injury in a game April 2 but is recovering from 
surgery and is expected to play next month. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sarah Beckley, a 5-10 forward from Brea-Olinda, will sign a letter of intent 
to play basketball at Missouri Southern, Brea-Olinda Coach John Hattrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was the first day basketball players could sign letters of intent 
for the late signing period, which ends May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckley, who will attend the NCAA Division II school in Joplin, was a 
first-team All-Southern Section Division III selection. She helped the Ladycats 
win their fourth consecutive State championship and chose Missouri Southern 
over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara and Oregon, Hattrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckley's teammate and first-team all-county selection, Colleen Hudson, 
probably will attend a community college, Hattrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 The late signing period for all other sports runs through Aug. 1. Many of the 
area's top baseball players probably will wait until after the baseball draft 
in June to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the top players in the county, Derek Baker of Tustin (USC), Seth 
Etherton of Dana Hills (USC), Brett Nista of Laguna Hills (UCLA), and Peter 
Zamora of Capistrano Valley (UCLA) signed during the early period in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, El Modena High football player Matt Marcyan announced he has signed with 
Georgia Tech. Marcyan is a 6-foot-3, 260-pound offensive and defensive tackle.

SPLASH SELECT FULLERTON RESIDENT GYAU IN THE CISL DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Splash, Anaheim's new entry in the Continental Indoor Soccer League, 
selected Fullerton resident Phillip Gyau with its first pick in Wednesday's 
league draft in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyau, a 6-foot-1, 170-pound forward, was most valuable player of the American 
Professional Soccer League in 1990 but has no indoor pro experience. The Splash 
selected him 38th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash used their other pick, in the 10th round, for defender Denis 
Hamlett, a member of the Harrisburg Heat of the indoor National Professional 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 With three other picks, the Splash protected three members of the old L.A. 
United, which played in the CISL last year and was sold to the group that 
created the Splash. The players are former UCLA midfielder Sam George, forward 
Raffaele Ruotolo -- the United's leading scorer last season with 24 goals in 19 
games -- and forward Bobby Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first pick overall by the Las Vegas Dust was Branko Segota, all-time 
leading scorer for the San Diego Sockers of the old Major Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash begins play June 10 at The Pond of Anaheim.

MIGHTY DUCKS ANNOUNCE TICKET PRICE INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks marked their 25th consecutive sellout and the end of their 
first season Wednesday by announcing that season-ticket prices for many seats 
are being raised for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 With attendance for 41 home games reaching 696,222 -- 98.9% of capacity -- 
team officials apparently decided the market would bear increases. The price 
hikes range from $1 to $12.50 per game, with the highest increases on the 
arena's lower level. 
</P>
<P>
 The average season-ticket price at The Pond of Anaheim will rise from $28.64 
to $31.67 per game, which Duck President Tony Tavares expects will be close to 
the NHL average next season. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no change in the prices for the most expensive tickets ($75 and 
$125 front-row seats) or the least expensive (the 500 single-game seats that 
sell for $13). 
</P>
<P>
 The largest increase -- from $40 to $52.50 -- affects the 1,209 seats that 
were designated as plaza corner this season and will be considered plaza main 
next season. Team officials say demand for lower bowl seats was extremely high, 
especially as new fans recognized that corner seats are more desirable for 
hockey than other sports. The plan is to have a single price for all lower-bowl 
seats within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices in the upper-level will increase no more than $4 a seat, with the most 
expensive seat at $28. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor in the decision to raise prices is the anticipated increase in the 
team payroll. The Ducks' payroll this season was the lowest in the NHL, at 
about $8 million, but they will be seeking to sign 1993 first-round draft 
choice Paul Kariya and a 1994 first-round pick this summer, as well as 
third-round pick Valeri Karpov. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's (raising prices) something we need to do," Andy Roundtree, vice 
president for finance and administration. "We are a first-year team and are 
fortunate to have a very low payroll. In the upcoming months, it's very obvious 
we have some very high draft choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares and Roundtree said they will find other suitable locations for 
season-ticket holders who do not want to pay for the increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to raise ticket prices," Tavares said. "I think the vast 
majority of our fans will have no problem with it. There is a small segment of 
our season-ticket holders who are going to be very upset with what we've done." 
More Bucks for the Ducks 
</P>
<P>
 Price changes for each location for Mighty Ducks games next season. Prices are 
per-game averages of season-ticket packages unless indicated. The average price 
will increase 10.6%. 04,21,09,15,12 Location 1993-94 1994-95 Increase Plaza 
Glass $125.00 $125.00 None Plaza Rear Glass $75.00 $75.00 None Plaza Main 
$50.00 $52.50 5.0% Plaza Corner* $40.00 $52.50 31.2% Plaza Rear $32.00 $40.00 
25.0% Plaza Disabled $28.77 $32.00 11.2% Terrace Lower $25.00 $28.00 12.0% 
Terrace Main $22.00 $23.00 4.5% Terrace Corner $19.00 $20.00/$23.00 5.3%/21.0% 
Terrace Rear $16.00 $18.00 12.5% Terrace Single Game $13.00 $13.00 None

JUST OFF THE CUFF, O'LAUGHLIN NOT READY TO PLAY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COMING OFF 
SHOULDER SURGERY, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE QUARTERBACK WATCHES THE START OF SPRING 
PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge opened spring football drills Wednesday with starting 
quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin watching from the same vantage point he occupied at 
the close of last season -- the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, who was knocked out of an Oct. 30 game against Chico State, is 
rehabilitating from reconstructive surgery on his right shoulder in December. 
He has been stretching and lifting weights, but is not cleared to throw a 
football until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming along well, about as good as could be expected," O'Laughlin said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some major damage." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin's injury was diagnosed as a complete tear of the rotator cuff, plus 
ligament and cartilage damage. He has a scar which stretches from under his 
throwing arm to the top of his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a six-month process and I'm going on four," O'Laughlin said. "I'm a 
little bit ahead of schedule, but I want to be smart about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He will watch for the rest of this week, then try to resist the temptation to 
cut loose any long passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be tossing it for a while," O'Laughlin said. "I don't want to jeopardize 
my recovery by trying to throw a bomb or something. I'm just going to take it 
day by day." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound transfer from Illinois, completed 99 of 214 
passes for 1,181 yards and nine touchdowns with five interceptions before his 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Burt welcomed 52 players for drills, but not before he asked many of 
them if they voted in student elections. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ballot was a referendum that would increase student fees to go to 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'If you don't go vote, we might be out here practicing for 
nothing,' " Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Bob Hiegert is on record saying the Northridge football 
program is in jeopardy should the referendum fail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors thought they needed a punter because Albert Razo, a four-year 
starter, has completed his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. The man Razo took over for has resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren McMahon last punted for Northridge in 1989, when he walked on to the 
team after hearing that Razo was ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon performed adequately, but Northridge coaches informed him that Razo 
would be their punter as soon as he regained eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 So McMahon, a former Granada Hills standout, left the team quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's back, taking advantage of a 10-semester rule used to determine the 
eligibility of Division II athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Northridge was competing in Division II when McMahon started his 
college career, he is governed by that standard, rather than the Division I 
requirement that an athlete complete his eligibility in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Division II rules, an athlete has eligibility for 10 semesters -- which 
do not have to be consecutive -- as a full-time student. 
</P>

NEW MAN; BOXER HAS PLASTIC SURGERY TO REDUCE EFFECT OF CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cut enough times against his will that he apparently had no fear when it was 
voluntary, Troy Dorsey has taken boxing where models, Michael Jackson and half 
of Hollywood have gone: the world of cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to give him an edge, so to speak, in fighting -- and kickboxing, his 
other profession -- Dorsey had his skin peeled from his face and a raised nub 
on his skull filed down. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last five fights, Dorsey has sustained 12 cuts, requiring 70 stitches. 
He lost four of those bouts as a result of those wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His last fight -- last May against Oscar De La Hoya -- was stopped in the 
first round because of a two-inch cut on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cutting from the inside out," Dorsey told Reuters from his home in 
Mansfield, Tex. "The bone was just too sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the surgery, Dorsey said to imagine headphones on the head as the 
arc along which an incision was made. Then the skin was peeled away from head 
and face and "they trimmed a centimeter off the bone of my eyebrows and then 
they filed it smooth. Then before they sewed it together, they cut 1 1/2 inches 
off the skin that they pulled down." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, when told of Dorsey's surgery, blanched at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never do that," said De La Hoya. "If it came to that, I'd just quit 
boxing. I guess he's really determined to win something, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, 31, a former International Boxing Federation featherweight champion 
who is preparing for Friday's pay-per-view kickboxing tournament, said doctors 
also cut one-fourth inch of skin off of his eyelids. TIM KAWAKAMI

 "I believe the situation is starting to change for the better. In my opinion, 
men are starting to take women more seriously in everyday situations such as 
school or work. People are starting to get the message that we are all equal in 
every way, except in anatomy. I also feel that women are starting to become 
more forward or aggressive when it comes to asking guys out, and this is 
definitely a good thing." Rich Hackett, 17, senior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on your gender. Women still generally think sexual harassment is a 
major insult and offense, while men think it's nothing." Norm Mowrer, 14, 
freshman, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting much better about not sexually harassing women, but people 
need to know that men can be sexually harassed also." Anne Chadburn, 15, 
sophomore, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "People are becoming more afraid of having a lawsuit brought against them 
now." Jennifer Klein, 17, senior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Society in general is becoming more aware of sexual harassment, and people -- 
especially women -- are not being afraid to press charges. The Clarence 
Thomas/Anita Hill incident has opened the eyes of Americans to the fact that 
sexual harassment exists, and there are people who won't put up with it." 
Tasnim Gosla, 17, senior, Rosary  
</P>
<P>
 "With increased awareness and prosecution of sex offenders, potential 
violators are slowly beginning to clean up their act. But, like anything else, 
sex-related accusations can and have been abused." Chris Birkheimer, 17, 
junior, Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's just as bad." Denise Leuis, 17, junior, Bolsa Grande 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the entire situation about sexual harassment has been completely 
overemphasized. Sometimes there are serious incidents that deserve our 
attention, but usually I just read the paper and laugh." Jay Joyer, 17, senior, 
Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's still a problem, even though it's out in the open more and 
people are more aware of it." Shawnee Stevens, 16, junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Women are believed more in sexual harassment and rape cases, and more 
cases are now appearing of women harassing men." Stacey Brownlee, 16, junior, 
University  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that it would be great if harassment of any kind didn't exist, 
but it is often blown out of proportion. Why must we either make legislation 
too conservative or too liberal? We have to compromise so that along with 
personal freedom we can continue to live in a prosperous nation." Nick Dinger, 
15, sophomore, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "There are laws about sexual harassment, but they give women a lot of power. 
As long as the law is not abused, it's good, but a girl can really slander a 
guy by making things up. Girls are almost always believed." Nathan Dunn, 18, 
senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys are more afraid to do it now. It hasn't changed for women, though; they 
still don't like it." Carol Lee, 16, junior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults these days seem to abuse it, and teen-agers take it as a joke. But 
overall, we're aware of it." Nancy Bui, 16, sophomore, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there is less now . . . . People are more realistic and less paranoid 
about the whole concept." Damon Mircheff, 18, senior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys just don't know the boundaries anymore, and some girls don't even know 
when they are being harassed. Maybe if people would just open their eyes, they 
would see what's going on." Kathleen Wood, 16, sophomore, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 "I think attitudes are changing because people are more aware of them and 
there's more of a tolerance." Anne Catto, 17, junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "It still exists everywhere and always will, but people have become more 
willing to help those who are harassed." Alex Huong, 17, senior, Fountain 
Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "People are taking it more seriously now that the consequences are harder." 
Erik Castro, 14, freshman, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are more aware of the problem; however, people need to stop 
the situation before it becomes a problem." Alicia Ritter, 16, sophomore, 
Rosary  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this whole sexual harassment thing is so blown out of 
proportion. People, guys especially, can't make any jokes anymore or say 
anything because anyone could say it's sexual harassment and sue them. I'm not 
saying that there is no sexual harassment, because there is. When a boy grabs a 
girl or consistently makes rude comments, that is sexual harassment. I just 
think that people need to be themselves. Don't be rude and watch what you're 
saying. And girls, guys will be guys, especially in high school. Just remember 
that." Jennifer Flicker, 16, junior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more aware of the issue, so they think before they act." Tiffany 
Blindt, 18, senior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 "No, people are still disgusted by it." Jackie Jenkins, 14, freshman, Bolsa 
Grande 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time or another, my friends and I have been harassed, but it happens 
so much without being noticed you can't really count it." Melissa Moshfegh, 16, 
sophomore, Villa Park

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's rowdy and a tad raunchy, daring and delightful -- an outdoor fair like no 
other in this century. The annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire returns weekends 
and Memorial Day beginning Saturday, through June 5, at the field adjacent to 
Blockbuster Pavilion, in Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore (off I-15 in San 
Bernardino). 
</P>
<P>
 Armored knights will demonstrate their riding and jousting skills and Her 
Majesty's soldiers will go to battle against renegade Scots. Crafts, music and 
dancing and strolling performers add to the period ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elizabethan village atmosphere is full of activities for children, 
including the Dragon Maze, a five-person swing, merry-go-round and a free 
crafts area, called Mistress Miranda's Traditional School. 
</P>
<P>
 Foods include corn on the cob, turkey legs, imported sausages, shepherd's pie 
and sweets. Hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Admission is $16.50 ($14.50 in advance); 
students, seniors and military, $13.50; children 5-11, $7.50. Parking is $5.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: BIG SALES ARE THE NAME OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty. Especially in publishing, where the right person's name in the logo 
can quickly define what a magazine is about and put wind in newsstand sales. 
</P>
<P>
 These days in particular, a name's the thing, from the new Mary Emmerling's 
Country to the newer Louis L'Amour Western Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so many magazines out there, you want to break through in a crisp 
fashion," says Peter Costiglio, vice president for communications at Time Inc., 
which publishes Martha Stewart Living. "Having a name . . . not only defines 
the field you're in, such as the home/style field, but also defines where you 
are in that field, as is the case with Martha Stewart Living." 
</P>
<P>
 The champion of the eponymous species is edited by the ubiquitous designer, 
cook, author, TV host and homemaking doyenne whose name has become synonymous 
with an upscale country style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time Inc. saw that Martha Stewart was a franchise and a business entity all 
by herself," says Leo Scullin, who heads Scullin & Co., a media consulting 
firm. "All they needed was a product with her name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Stewart Living is such a hit that Stewart takes the confident step in 
the April/May issue of not appearing on the cover for the first time since the 
magazine's launch in 1990. With ad revenues up nearly 93% last year (to an 
estimated $8.8 million), she explains in an editor's note that her image and 
her name had formed "a sort of 'brand statement' that readers could quickly 
identify." Brand identity established, Stewart says she will now spend less 
time posing and more time working on stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Emmerling has been an editor at Country Living and other magazines, 
designed furniture and authored best-selling books on country decorating and 
such. She was Stewart's boss at Mademoiselle and House Beautiful but now is 
expected to give Mary Emmerling's Country, now in its third issue, a 
Stewart-like name recognition in the crowded country field. But she will appear 
far less often than Stewart in photo illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be real low-key," explains Emmerling, whose magazine focuses more 
on country decor, so that it does not compete with Stewart's do-it-yourself 
gardening and entertaining ideas. "I'm doing this magazine to show all the 
people I've met around the United States and to promote what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmerling's March/April issue, which features a Santa Fe, N.M., hideaway, a 
Long Island farmhouse and the editor's own countrified SoHo loft, will be one 
of four published this year. Advertisers are being guaranteed a circulation of 
300,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by this trend, Hearst Magazines is slowly developing Lauren, a 
lifestyle magazine that would reflect the upscale cabin and Americana interests 
of designer and urban cowboy Ralph Lauren. Cooking Light has extended its 
health-conscious franchise by publishing 600,000 copies of a special fitness 
issue, Kathy Smith's In Shape for Summer, which features the shapely star of 
more than a dozen exercise videos on page after page. Dell Magazines is 
publishing new sagebrush fiction in Louis L'Amour Western Magazine, evoking the 
name of the late mega-selling master of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the name game has been played for years. The iconoclastic liberal 
I.F. Stone published I.F. Stone's Weekly. The flamboyant Malcolm Forbes was a 
walking advertisement for Forbes magazine. Media baron Rupert Murdoch has 
invested millions to establish the mature woman's fashion mag Mirabella, which 
he launched in 1989 and named after founding Editor Grace Mirabella when she 
was dismissed from the helm of Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lear's, the magazine Frances Lear started for the woman (like herself) "who 
wasn't born yesterday," ceased publication recently. Its demise leaves the 
older woman's market to Mirabella, perhaps proving that no niche is big enough 
for two names-as-titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, more magazines are expanding their franchises by putting their own 
well-established names on kindred offshoots, such as Esquire Gentleman, Esquire 
Sportsman and the new Country Living Country Travels -- hoping to connect 
instantly with satisfied readers of the parent magazines during the few seconds 
they spend perusing a newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley and Jordan in Print: It's hard to pinpoint the funniest entry in "Sir 
Charles," a $14.95 title from Warner Books in which Charles Barkley of the 
Phoenix Suns fills 127 pages with his wit and wisdom. But try this: "Stupidity 
and reality are very close." Or this: "Why do bald guys always wear beards? 
When I started to go bald, I took it like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar but more serious vein, HarperSan Francisco has published Michael 
Jordan's "I Can't Accept Not Trying" -- a 36-page hardcover ($12) in which the 
superjock-turned-minor-leaguer offers inspirational sentiments about the 
pursuit of excellence. Such as: "Any fear is an illusion. . . . What is there 
is an opportunity to do your best and gain some success." 
</P>
<P>
 B Matter: The New Yorker devoted much of its Dec. 6 issue to journalist Mark 
Danner's account of how 700 villagers were slaughtered in 1981 by U.S.-trained 
soldiers of the Salvadoran government. Now, Vintage Books has published 
Danner's expanded report of the episode as a $12 trade-paperback edition, "The 
Massacre at El Mozote." The book makes generous use of newly released documents 
that detail Washington's slow response to what happened in that remote mountain 
hamlet more than a decade ago . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Olshaker should receive a more eager reception from booksellers when his 
next thriller, "The Edge," is published in September by Crown. New Line Cinema 
has optioned the book for $200,000, with an $800,000 purchase price in the 
offing, for director Renny Harlin, of "Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2" fame. 
Olshaker tells the story of a Washington homicide detective (a woman) who's on 
the trail of a serial killer, an artist with medical training . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A felonious reader in Provo, Utah, was the first to sample Dave Wolverton's 
"The Courtship of Princess Leia" before Bantam Books' new "Star Wars" offering 
went on sale last week. Wolverton reports that someone broke into his home 
before Christmas, left the TV and stereo, and took only the final page proofs 
to the book.

TELEVISION REVIEW; WORLD MUSIC WITH A SENSE OF ADVENTURE; WEST AFRICAN ARTIST 
YOUSSOU N'DOUR, WIDELY KNOWN FOR HIS COLLABORATIONS WITH PETER GABRIEL, CREATES 
SOUNDS THAT STAND AND BREATHE ON THEIR OWN IN A CONCERT FILM THAT AIRS TONIGHT 
ON KOCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best introduction to Youssou N'Dour is through his utterly astonishing 
live shows. Orange County last got a chance when he gave a free performance at 
Irvine Meadows in 1990, one of the best local concerts of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who missed the show, the concert film that airs tonight at 10 on 
KOCE Channel 50 serves as a next-best alternative. This performance, taped in 
Kentucky for the "Lonesome Pine Special" series, was part of that same 1990 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 N'Dour, hailing from Senegal in West Africa, is best known in the United 
States for his occasional collaborations with Peter Gabriel (it is his voice 
that soars over the fade-out of "In Your Eyes") and for his participation in 
one of the mammoth Amnesty International tours. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gabriel, he shares a sense of musical adventure and a desire to make 
something meaningful out of the much-overused term "world music." Where some 
cross-cultural excursions merely water down their sources, N'Dour builds 
something that is more than the sum of its parts, something that stands and 
breathes on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of two brief interview segments on tonight's show, N'Dour explains how 
he grew up in a musical family, dreaming of making a modern music that would 
reflect urban Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 His dreams were realized in the music he creates with his superb backing band 
Super Etoile de Dakar, which weds the mbalax rhythms of Wolof-speaking Senegal 
with a lean uptown sheen, incorporating international influences that range 
from Afro-Cuban jazz to Motown. The emotional range is wide, mixing soft, 
lilting passages with muscular grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Above it all floats N'Dour's voice, which carries in its high, keening flights 
more than a hint of the Islamic influence that extends into West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour concert film draws heavily from his 1990 album, "Set," a stellar 
showcase of urban African pop -- sophisticated, driving, and spiritual. There 
is also an overarching political consciousness at work, which can be gleaned 
even from the few English passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights include the bittersweet "Medina," with its haunting sax line, "One 
Day," a groove-driven plea for world peace, and "Set," which closes the show on 
a high-energy climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Production values on the film are good, although it is difficult to experience 
the real, visceral impact of talking drums through a TV speaker. With some 
wonderful dancing, the concert works on a visual level as well as on a musical 
one. Still, there's nothing like seeing N'Dour in person, and on the evidence 
of his subsequent 1992 tour (in support of the masterful album "Eyes Open"), he 
is only getting better. Watch tonight, but don't miss him live. 
</P>

 CELEBRITY AUCTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 A Piece of Elvis: More than 1,000 Elvis Presley items including automobiles, 
guitars, clothing, jewelry, historical documents and movie posters will be 
auctioned June 18-19 at the Las Vegas Hilton. Auctioneers Butterfield & 
Butterfield are billing the sale as the largest collection of Elvis Presley 
memorabilia ever offered. The collection comes from the Elvis Presley Museum, 
founded in Memphis in 1978 by 1950s recording artist Jimmy Velvet, a close 
friend of Presley. Velvet later opened additional museums in Nashville, Orlando 
and Honolulu, which have since broadened to include other performers. The lots 
will be previewed here May 4-8 at Butterfield & Butterfield's Sunset Boulevard 
showroom.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: MAKING COMMITMENT TO ANCIENT WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we nip at the heels of the 21st Century, our daily rituals tend to reflect 
a secular, contemporary lifestyle. There's morning coffee, the one-hour lunch, 
the 6 p.m. dinner and the 11 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, some of us worship at a church or temple of choice, but our religious 
observances are generally formal and separate from our more routine daily 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for the 15 men, women and children at the 100-acre enclave off Highway 
33 known as Chorro Grande. There, residents are attempting to bring ancient 
Indian rites and ceremonies to modern-day Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a religion, it's a way of life," Anotka, one of Chorro Grande's 
leaders, told staff writer Jeff Meyers, who wrote this week's Centerpiece story 
on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there is some controversy around Chorro Grande -- which is seen by 
some in the local Chumash community as a "New Age" retreat -- Meyers was, 
nonetheless, impressed by the commitment and rigor of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really struck me about the tiny society at Chorro Grande was its 
sincerity and reverence toward Native American rituals," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect was the operative word." 
</P>
<P>
 To actually adopt a Native American way of life means to be self-sufficient, 
which is what the residents of Chorro Grande are attempting, said Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't easy in today's world, but they plan to grow their own food, raise 
goats and use solar-powered generators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike the Chumash, however, they have a problem with garbage. While the 
Chumash used most everything and buried the rest, current residents of Chorro 
Grande recycle, and hauling the waste down the hill is a major undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
 But then living within the constructs of an ancient belief system isn't 
supposed to be a walk in the park. Instead, there are two day-and-night walks 
in the woods, known as vision quests; drumming and chanting ceremonies; and 
Sunday sweat lodges, which are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a lot of saunas," Meyers said, "but the sweat lodge was so hot 
my teeth even perspired." 
</P>
<P>
 But Meyers said he was moved by the power of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I was a little skeptical when the sweat leader said we'd be 
energized all week, I did indeed feel sharp mentally and physically," he said. 
"I might even try another sweat."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; 9 HOMES DESIGNATED HISTORIC LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Victorian-style home in North Long Beach and eight structures along Linden 
Avenue built in the early 1900s have been granted historic landmark status by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pressburg residence, a 2 1/2-story Victorian home at 167 South St., is one 
of the few farmhouses remaining from when the area was unincorporated 
farmland.Built in 1905, it may be the oldest building in North Long Beach, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Dan Pressburg purchased the house because of its unique architecture and 
requested last year that it be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight buildings from 1324 to 1357 Linden Ave., near Anaheim Street, were 
recognized as a historic district. Many of the homes, constructed between 1905 
and 1912, once were owned by prominent figures in Long Beach history. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agent and oil investor Jonah Jones made 1327 Linden Ave. his home 
in the early 1920s. His son, Jonah Jones Jr., a prominent attorney and founder 
of the Long Beach Yacht Club, also lived there. A member of Long Beach's first 
City Council, Galen H. Welch, lived at 1344 Linden Ave. in the 1920s. The 
buildings feature several architectural styles popular in the early part of 
this century, such as Greek, colonial and Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are some of Long Beach's hidden treasures," said Ruthann Lehrer, the 
city's historic preservation officer. "An inner-city neighborhood is not a 
place you would expect to find these specimens." There was no community 
opposition to the designations, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under historic preservation guidelines, any exterior repairs or modifications 
will require approval by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission and must not 
change the buildings' architectural styles. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; MORATORIUM DECLARED ON RECYCLING CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has declared a moratorium on new recycling centers on the 
west side of Long Beach to allow time to draw up stiffer regulations. Officials 
said they are seeking to stem growing sales of stolen material -- everything 
from car batteries to copper piping -- at some centers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they want to correct a previous oversight in city 
planning. The west side of Long Beach does not require certain permits that 
exist in other areas and allow the city to monitor recycling centers more 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who proposed the moratorium, said the action 
stems in part from an investigation last summer into a center called Long Beach 
Recycling by state officials and local police. Although the owner was cleared 
of wrongdoing, three employees were arrested on misdemeanor charges of 
knowingly accepting stolen goods, said Long Beach Police Lt. Richard Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Recycling's business license expired last month and the company was 
seeking to move into an area that did not require the permits, Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Long Beach Recycling, Howard Noble, said this week that he is 
preparing legal action against the city because he feels the moratorium 
discriminates against him. Noble added that neither he nor his company had been 
charged with any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a problem with some of the employees, but as soon as I found (out) 
about what they were doing they were discharged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will probably require all recycling centers in Long Beach to have a 
conditional-use permit, which will allow the city to limit what the centers can 
accept, said James R. Kuhl, the city's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, companies could be forced to turn away recyclables delivered in 
shopping carts or in the city's purple recycling bins, Kuhl said. Some centers 
might only be allowed to accept California Redemption Value items such as cans 
and bottles, to eliminate the market for more profitable items such as copper 
and metals that can be stolen from industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 21 recycling centers operate in Long Beach, Kuhl said. JOHN POPE

NIGHT LIFE: HE'S STILL ON AN ENDLESS ROAD TRIP OF THE BLUES; AFTER 32 YEARS, 
JOHN HAMMOND CONTINUES HIS GLOBAL TOUR. THE SOLO GUITARIST PLAYS TONIGHT IN 
VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1962, the year John Hammond's first album came out, John Kennedy was trying 
to figure out the Soviets and the Cubans, Wally and the Beaver were trying to 
figure out girls, and girls were trying to figure out how to get a date with 
Elvis or Little Joe Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Kennedy never did, Wally and the Beav never did, and now the girls 
wouldn't want to. But 32 years, 31 albums and about a billion miles later, 
Hammond still has those blues. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll be playing selections off his latest release, "Trouble No More" tonight 
at Nicholby's in Ventura. Another noted blues guitarist, Duke Robillard, is 
also on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his New York home (probably the one with 37 newspapers in the 
driveway), Hammond discussed the endless road trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came back from Australia, a place where I've never seen so much beer 
consumption in my whole life. I've been there many times. Actually, I've been 
on every continent except Africa, and I'm curious, but it would have to be part 
of a good tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond is the son of a famous industry A&R man for Columbia named John Henry 
Hammond, who figured in the careers of Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan and Bruce 
Springsteen, among others. Rooting around in his dad's record collection, the 
younger Hammond got turned on to the blues by the likes of Robert Johnson, John 
Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf. Now Hammond is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought it was the hippest, sexiest, down-home music, and it just 
hit it off with me," said Hammond. "I do more than 200 dates a year, which 
means I'm on the road more than that, due to off days and travel days. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go on the road to make money unless you are the best studio 
musician in the world. Then you have to learn how to live on the road. Since I 
don't make rock star money, I have to play a lot. I play smaller theatres and 
clubs. With experience you learn how to maintain your energy and not blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, girl groups were in, teen idols were duly idolized and the British 
Invasion hadn't yet hit England. In 1993, there's grunge, rap, industrial, 
techno, heavy metal and alternative music (everything else), but, the blues are 
still around. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has gotten phenomenally huge compared to then," he said. "What's 
happening now is music is becoming more and more specialized. There's blues, 
jazz or folk labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, a big label like Columbia would have a blues department, a folk 
department or a jazz department. I don't know if that's better or worse, but 
the blues have never been top of the pops, always more of a specialized type of 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the blues are doing a lot better during the last five years. Now 
there are specialized blues labels such as Alligator, Black Top and Pointblank, 
there seems to be more radio stations that have blues programs and there are 
some publications that are blues-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond's bio reads like a who's who in the music biz. At one time or another 
Hammond has played with John Lee Hooker, Duane Allman, Rick Danko and Robbie 
Robertson of the Band, Bill Wyman of the Stones, Charlie Musselwhite, Eric 
Clapton, and for a few weeks in the '60s, he had a pretty good guitar player 
named Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite all the cool collaborations over the years, Hammond remains a solo 
player; just a guy, a guitar, a road map, with no need for a calculator to 
divide the loot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had bands over the years, and I've gotten to use and record with bands 
over the years. I just don't make enough money to support a band. But during 
the last three of four years, I've toured with bands such as Little Charlie and 
the Nightcats and Duke Robillard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duke has a band, and we'll do a set together on this tour. On 'Trouble No 
More,' I've got some stuff with Charles Brown in an uptown sort of style, and 
there's seven songs with Little Charlie, plus an acoustic song with Roy Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But being a solo artist, that's always been my strong suit. I feel I've got a 
unique spot out there. I'm just playing eclectic blues as I've always done. 
Hopefully, I'm getting better."

CITY ELECTION; INCUMBENTS THROUGHOUT AREA OUSTED FROM OFFICE; SOUTHEAST CITIES: 
FEW ARE ABLE TO HANG ONTO THEIR JOBS AS POLITICAL NEWCOMERS PREPARE TO JOIN 
COUNCILS. 
</P>

 Residents throughout the Southeast will see lots of new faces on their city 
councils, as voters ousted incumbent candidates in a majority of cities in 
Tuesday's municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bellflower, all three incumbents on the ballot were defeated. Some 
incumbents also were ousted in Norwalk, Whittier, Santa Fe Springs, Artesia, 
Pico Rivera, Paramount, Signal Hill, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, South Gate, Maywood 
and Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In Norwalk, where the hottest campaign issue was whether to fire City Manager 
Richard R. Powers, voters ousted two incumbents who were the city manager's 
allies and elected an incumbent who wants to reduce the city manager's 
authority. Two of Powers' most vocal critics, including a former City Hall 
employee who was fired by the city manager for alleged sexual harassment, also 
won council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gordon A. Stefenhagen, 51, was the lone incumbent to be sent back 
to office. He cruised to a decisive victory, and was the top vote-getter among 
16 candidates. Stefenhagen, who was appointed to the council in 1992 after 
Grace F. Napolitano was elected to the state Assembly, said he believes Powers 
has too much influence and control in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners were Eleanor Zimmerman, 73, the well-known wife of late 
councilman John Zimmerman, and Jesse M. Luera, the former director of social 
services who was fired last year after being accused by two women of sexual 
harassment at City Hall. Zimmerman has vowed to demote Powers, and Luera 
promised that he would move to fire the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran councilmen Luigi A. Vernola and Robert J. Arthur, both staunch 
supporters of Powers, were soundly defeated. Each received just 6% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers could not be reached to comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Luera, who will now give up his post as president of the Norwalk-La Mirada 
school board, has consistently denied the sexual harassment allegations, and 
denounced a hit piece sent out to voters detailing the claims.  
</P>
<P>
 "(I am not someone) who will fall apart under pressure," Luera told a cheering 
crowd of supporters at Govan's, a local eatery. "We are sturdy and strong and 
in control. Now we can move forward and help the residents of Norwalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the throng of supporters said they did not believe the allegations. 
Some questioned the timing of a civil lawsuit filed two weeks ago by a woman 
who alleged that Luera raped her.  
</P>
<P>
 "It backfired because the people in the community know (Luera) and we know his 
character," said David Plaza, a 25-year-old Norwalk resident who was among the 
crowd of well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Whittier, Councilwoman Helen McKenna-Rahder, who successfully spearheaded 
past efforts to throw out City Council incumbents, had the tables turned. She 
lost to little-known challenger Greg Nordbak, 42, owner of a trophy store and a 
woodcarving shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Bob Henderson was the leading vote-getter among eight candidates for 
two four-year council seats. In the contest for a two-year term, appointed 
incumbent Janet R. Henke easily outdistanced challenger Robert A. Canales. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordbak pledged to be a dissenting voice on a council whose members, he said, 
were getting along too well. He accused incumbents of trampling on the rights 
of property owners and supporting anti-business regulations. Four years 
earlier, McKenna-Rahder had scored big by arguing that the city should demand 
higher standards from developers.  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Fe Springs, voters decided to dump one city councilman but returned 
another incumbent who was strongly opposed by organizations that represent city 
workers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial tallies showed Ronald S. Kernes, 55, retained the seat he has held 
for more than 16 years. Voters also elected George Minnehan, 56, a truck driver 
who has run for the council four times in the last eight years. Incumbent Al 
Fuentes, 64, who was seeking a third term in office, trailed by a few votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners accepted their victories tentatively early Wednesday. Still 
pending were 75 questionable ballots that were sent to county elections 
officials to be counted.  
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Kernes and Fuentes were reappointed when no candidates ran 
against them. This time, the incumbents faced heavy criticism from four other 
candidates and from the employee groups. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers and firefighters supported Minnehan and Hazel Fields, a former 
city clerk who worked for Santa Fe Springs for more than 25 years. Fields 
finished a distant fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In Artesia, a dispute over absentee ballots and a malfunctioning ballot 
counter created an acrimonious election eve and delayed vote counting until 
early Wednesday morning. In the end, however, 20-year council veteran James A. 
Van Horn Jr. and one-term Councilwoman Mary Alyce Soares were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters elected former planning commission chairman Timothy J. Kelemen and 
current planning commissioner John Lyon, who had run a high-profile campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that surprised city officials, Hawaiian Gardens Councilwoman 
Kathleen Navejas asked to inspect more than 600 absentee ballots. She said she 
was working as a volunteer political consultant to Lyon and Kelemen, and was 
concerned about possible vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Navejas challenged 35 ballots, citing irregularities ranging from torn 
envelopes to improper signatures. Ultimately, city officials decided that 30 
ballots had been completed properly and could be counted, City Manager Paul J. 
Philips said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the dispute over absentee ballots held up the vote-counting process more 
than two hours, the city's vote tabulator broke down, forcing officials to 
begin counting votes manually, which lasted into the wee hours of the morning.  
</P>
<P>
 In Bellflower, voters rejected all three incumbents in favor of two former 
councilmen and a candidate who had failed miserably in his bid for council two 
years ago. Many blamed a failed card casino initiative in August for the demise 
of incumbents Bob Stone and Bill Pendleton, who favored the proposal. But 
incumbent John Ansdell, who did not support the gambling measure, also was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Randy Bomgaars, who lost his council seat two years ago by only 19 
votes, was the top vote-getter. Voters also elected Ray T. Smith, who served on 
the council from 1966 to 1970, and longtime council critic Art Olivier. Smith 
said he thought Bellflower residents had grown weary of political infighting 
and personal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, longtime Pico Rivera Councilman Richard L. Mercado Sr. finished 
seventh among 11 candidates vying for three council seats. Incumbent John G. 
Chavez and newcomers Helen O'Hara and Gil De La Rosa were elected. Mercado had 
supported a failed attempt last year to bring gambling to the city. In 
Paramount, incumbent Elvira A. Oropeza was replaced by Diane Martinez, and in 
Signal Hill, Councilwoman Carol A. Churchill trailed incumbent Gerard Goedhart 
and challenger Tina Hansen in the race for two seats.  
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Bell Gardens Councilwomen Rosa Hernandez and Josefina (Josie) 
Macias were defeated in a six-candidate race for two seats. Community activist 
Maria Chacon led the field, and city planning commissioner Ramiro Morales 
claimed the second council seat. Macias took office two years ago after a 
historic recall of four white council members. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Park, Councilman Luis M. Hernandez, who still owes about $10,000 
in fines stemming from faulty campaign expense reporting in 1990, was defeated. 
Two Maywood incumbents, Rose Marie Busciglio and Thomas H. Engle, also failed 
at reelection bids, as did Cudahy incumbent Joseph Graffio.  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents posted solid victories in some cities, however. Voters in Cerritos 
reelected veterans Sherman R. Kappe and John F. Crawley. In La Mirada, 
incumbent Wayne Rew was the top vote-getter, and in Lakewood, Lawrence H. Van 
Nostran and Joseph Esquivel won by large margins. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Habra Heights, voters appeared to remain in an anti-development mood. 
Voters chose Carol Engelhardt, 48, an outspoken foe of the controversial Powder 
Canyon project, and Fred Klein, 49, the only planning commissioner to vote 
against it as their new council members.  
</P>
<P>
 Project supporter Boyd Coffman, the only other candidate, finished a distant 
third in the race for two seats. Incumbents Diane Kane and Richard N. Newbre 
did not seek reelection.

CITY ELECTION; KELL LOSES BID FOR 3RD TERM; JUNE RUNOFF SET; LONG BEACH: 
EX-COLLEGE PRESIDENT BEVERLY O'NEILL WILL FACE COUNCILMAN RAY GRABINSKI FOR 
MAYOR'S SEAT. NEWCOMERS FARE WELL IN COUNCIL RACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Long Beach voters ushered in a new era on Tuesday, soundly rejecting two-term 
Mayor Ernie Kell and setting up a runoff for his seat between a political 
newcomer and a City Hall insider. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly O'Neill, the former president of Long Beach City College, led all 13 
mayoral candidates in her first bid for public office. But O'Neill fell far 
short of the 50%-plus-one-vote mark needed to win the race outright. She faces 
the second-place finisher, City Councilman Ray Grabinski in a June 7 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell finished fifth. Also running ahead of him were Belmont Shore businessman 
Frank Colonna, the leading fund-raiser in the mayoral race, and City Councilman 
Jeffrey A. Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
 The white-haired Kell, whose 13 years as a city councilman and six as mayor 
had made his name synonymous with City Hall, seemed to concede defeat with each 
new update of voting results Tuesday night. At several points, he clutched the 
arms of supporters and told them, softly, "One door closes, another door 
opens." 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters obviously wanted change," a subdued Kell said after learning the 
final results at Ninos Restaurant, his traditional election-night roost. "I 
think this has been a tough year for people and I accept that. I'm just proud 
of what we accomplished in the last 19 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other Long Beach elections, two candidates hoping to become the City 
Council's first Latino members will continue their bids in June runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Long Beach school board member Jenny Oropeza was the top vote-getter in 
the 1st District council race. She will face Dianne McNinch, a longtime 
community organizer. In the 3rd District, Tonia Reyes Uranga was second to Mike 
Donelon, a general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 A runoff also is set for the 9th District, where incumbent Councilman Warren 
Harwood trailed first-time candidate Jerry Schultz, a sheriff's deputy. During 
the campaign, Harwood was often criticized by his six challengers for his 
reputation as a council naysayer, the member most likely to cast the lone 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council incumbents won reelection by capturing more than 50% of the vote. 
The winners include 3rd District Councilman Douglas Drummond, who overcame 
speculation that he could suffer at the polls because of anti-gay remarks he 
made at a conservative forum last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of his challengers said they decided to run, in part, after Drummond said 
he favored Cuban leader Fidel Castro's idea of quarantining gay men who are 
HIV-positive. But Drummond, who later apologized and voted with the council to 
censure himself, said the episode was behind him. "The public knew I apologized 
for those remarks and they accepted that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Councilman Les Robbins easily recaptured his 5th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 City Prosecutor John A. Vander Lans and City Auditor Gary L. Burroughs, 
meanwhile, fended off rare challenges to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 A ballot measure to outlaw smoking in most buildings in the city won 
overwhelming approval, but voters soundly rejected a measure that would have 
given the city Water Department more power to purchase land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Long Beach Unified School District, marriage counselor Bonnie Lowenthal 
overcame opposition from school officials and overwhelmingly won election. 
Lowenthal, 54, replaces Oropeza, the board's first and only Latino member, who 
opted to run for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, noting the changing ethnic makeup of the district, had urged 
voters to replace Oropeza with another Latino, but Lowenthal defeated social 
services worker Olivia Nieto Herrera and Jerome Orlando Torres, an 
administrative analyst for the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mayor's race, political observers said the vote against Kell was a vote 
against the Long Beach of old, in which most residents were white and middle 
class. Kell, his challengers said, had lost touch with the needs of the 
increasingly diverse city, which has lost thousands of jobs to defense cutbacks 
in recent years and experienced the growth of immigrant Latino and Asian 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernie Kell's showing in this race reflected the pent-up frustration and 
desire for change in a different direction," said Jeff Adler, a veteran of 
several Long Beach races, including Kell's two previous mayoral campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, 63, the City Hall outsider, said her theme of civic renewal and her 
slogan "Make Long Beach proud again," hit home with voters looking for an 
alternative. "In our growth from a small city to a big city, we lost a lot -- a 
sense of community, a sense of safety," she said. "The voters feel that there 
needs to be a new direction. I represent change." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grabinski, 50, has spent two terms on the City Council, he also has 
tried to portray himself as an agent of change. Grabinski is often 
characterized as a populist politician, and pundits have referred to him as the 
"people's candidate." He said his neighborhood connections and his longtime 
commitment to law enforcement appealed to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski and O'Neill pledged to wage "above-board" campaigns in the runoff, 
sticking to the issues and avoiding mudslinging. But on election night 
Grabinski had already begun taking jabs at his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of successful government experience, versus her experience in 
one of the biggest bureaucracies there is, the Southern California education 
system," he said of O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 To many community leaders, an O'Neill-Grabinski matchup offers a break with 
the past. "For the first time neighborhood organizations and small businesses 
-- people who have traditionally been outside the system -- will have a voice," 
said Jose Ulloa, a community leader from central Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kell, 65, the loss was his first since being elected to the City Council 
in 1975. From the beginning of this race, Kell seemed to be fighting an uphill 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, he began walking door to door to reintroduce himself to voters, 
stopping at more than 5,000 residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell didn't use a political consultant this time, relying instead on his wife, 
Jackie, and a close-knit group of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>

Psyche Pascual contributed to this story.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: RULES OF ROAD IMPORTANT ON THE DANCE FLOOR; OBSERVING CORRECT 
ETIQUETTE HELPS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE, INCLUDING YOU, HAS A GOOD TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 True or false dance floor etiquette quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 1. A gentleman should dance with his right hand clutching his partner's 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Cigarette ashes or beer are great ways to make the dance floor slicker. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Two-step and East Coast swing are indoor contact sports. 
</P>
<P>
 4. During fast line dances you have the right to steam roll anyone in your 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 5. If a couple strays too close to another couple on the dance floor, it's OK 
for the man to jab the other guy in the back with his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 6. To learn a line dance, shadow someone's moves while bouncing off fellow 
dancers until you get it, the same way you'd play a pinball machine. 
</P>
<P>
 If you answered true to any of the above, you're guilty of poor dance floor 
etiquette. Despite what you see in many country dance clubs these days, the 
floor should not resemble Times Square on New Year's Eve. And practitioners of 
line dances, two-step and swing should not swarm the floor at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, folks could learn a lot from Chuck, my plumber. "In Texas and 
Denver they have signs up: 'If you're slow, move to the inside or leave the 
floor.' And if you don't know you're slow, they have bouncers who will tell 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may not seem important. But wait until you're part of a crowd 
packed front to back. Each line of dancers has linked arms, the whole crowd is 
traveling around to a fast 10-step, and someone gets out of sync. Or watch the 
crowd during a fast walking wazzi or Kentucky chug. You can tell the novice by 
the way he swims upstream -- and up the heels of fellow dancers -- every time 
the herd suddenly changes direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most new country dancers aren't aggressive, boorish knotheads. Chances are, 
they just don't know the rules. And rules are especially important because most 
floors in area clubs are small -- so small that if you cussed the cat, you'd 
get fur in your mouth. And nothing puts a burr under my saddle quicker than 
playing bumper cars on the dance floor; if my legs get tangled with somebody 
else, we'd better be engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has different opinions and expectations. But most people agree dance 
floor etiquette begins with common sense and courtesy. Before each lesson, 
instructor Cliff Cox used to tell his students, "If you're not havin' fun -- go 
bowling." But there's more to it than the right attitude. And a few clubs, like 
Denim & Diamonds in Woodland Hills, even distribute flyers that explain their 
dance floor etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 During group or line dances such as the tush push, dancers must make room for 
people who know the steps. When the floor is shared by people doing different 
dances, swingers and line dancers belong in the center -- but not usually at 
the same time. And partners engaged in progressive dances, including two-step, 
waltz, schottische and polka, should travel counterclockwise around the dance 
floor with the fastest couples using the outermost lane. In addition, couples 
doing such country dances have the right of way on that outside track. And 
nothing or no one should impede the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep things moving, deejay Rick Borja, "beat mixes" up to five two-steps in 
a row at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. "Mixing the CDs 
provides smooth transitions between songs without a drop in energy. But I start 
slow and increase the speed of each two-step. That discourages the tendency for 
dancers to want off the floor when a song is done," said Borja. 
</P>
<P>
 But if couples start to disperse as the pace picks up, Borja quickly reminds 
them to clear the dance floor or claim the inside track of the "Borderline" 
painted on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, couples are expected to dance at the speed of traffic so they aren't 
weaving through people recklessly. And the man -- who always leads -- 
progresses clockwise in line of dance even as he and his partner are spinning. 
He never risks trampling the couple behind him by stopping or dancing backward. 
</P>
<P>
 And you should never take a cigarette or drink on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 You will see several types of dancers coexisting on some local dance floors. 
But Borja said their club policy doesn't generally permit line dancers on the 
floor when couples are two-stepping or when they might be sitting ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a couple weeks ago the floor was filled with line dancers doing tumble 
weed," Borja said. "And I had to ask a couple doing West Coast swing at the 
edge to come off the floor. Otherwise, when the line dancers turn, run and 
slide, the couple was right in the impact area against the railed wall." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a dancer myself, I remind the crowd of dance floor etiquette. And the 
security guards enforce it for the safety and dancing pleasure of everyone."

THEATER REVIEW; 'KING LEAR' MAKES FOR GREAT ACTION DRAMA; VIOLENCE AND LUST 
KEEP THE STORY MOVING IN A WELL-ACTED PRODUCTION BY CALIFORNIA SHAKESPEARE 
COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding to relax a bit in his golden years, King Lear intends to divide his 
wealth among his three daughters. When Cordelia, the youngest, doesn't 
compliment him to his satisfaction, he banishes her, dividing her share between 
the other two. But Goneril and Regan, who professed their undying love to the 
king, are already conspiring to overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the main story of "King Lear," being performed by the California 
Shakespeare Company in Moorpark. Like all of the company's productions, it's 
well-acted under William Fisher's direction, and as accessible as the Bard is 
going to get. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lear's thankless daughters are working to unseat him, there's another 
inter-familial plot in the works: Edmund, illegitimate and jealous son of the 
Earl of Gloucester, is plotting to discredit his noble-spirited and legitimate 
half-brother, Edgar, by framing him in a plot against their father. Regan is in 
league with her husband, the villainous Duke of Cornwall, and Goneril is 
cheating on her virtuous husband, Lear's friend, the Duke of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 While Goneril is mainly ambitious, and a bit lusty, Regan seems to bask in the 
sheer joy of being nasty (she's similar to Richard III in that respect); again, 
Shakespeare has created especially strong female characters. Lear goes mad, 
Gloucester has his eyes gouged out and tries to commit suicide by jumping off 
the White Cliffs of Dover, and several principal characters are dead by curtain 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 While Atty. Gen. Janet Reno searches for Shakespeare so she can have a stern 
talk with him about all this violence, there's plenty of melodramatic action in 
"Lear" for everybody else. It is also, in several places, intentionally very 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Rezac stars as Lear. Only a few years ago he had never performed 
Shakespeare, and now with Macduff, Henry IV and Richard III among his major 
roles, he's one of Ventura County's most accomplished performers. M. Virginia 
Worley plays devoted daughter Cordelia, with Tracy Markle and Amanda Charlton 
as the evil (and, of course, much more fun) sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Rye -- a newcomer to the company, with a magnificent voice -- plays 
the doomed Earl of Gloucester, with Brian D. Evans and Dan Wingard as foul 
Edmund and fair Edgar. Anthony Liveri gets the flashy part of the Duke of Kent. 
Robert Seeley is the conniving Duke of Cornwall, Michael Jordan is Lear's ally, 
the Duke of Albany, and Will Shupe is the King's not-so-foolish Fool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge cast, with Mitchell Castro deserving mention for dashing on and 
off stage in six spear-carrying roles; Seth Allen plays four, and Ored Gross 
plays three. 
</P>
<P>
 The production is typically simple, all the better to concentrate on the 
acting, though the costumes are nice and Aaron Craig has choreographed some 
good sword fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "King Lear," California Shakespeare Company's last show until fall, ends the 
season with a flourish. The upcoming Ojai Shakespeare Festival and Shakespeare 
in the Park should find these productions to be quite a challenge. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 p.m.; Sunday afternoons at 3 p.m. 
through May 15.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL GARDENS; FAMILIES WIN $500,000 SUIT AGAINST LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five families who sued their landlord for ignoring substandard living 
conditions have been awarded more than $500,000 to cover back rent and 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one for the good guys," said Nelson L. Cohen, attorney for the 
plaintiffs. "These are people who bring home $1,000 a month to feed a family of 
four. They're thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner, Dr. Charles Sassoon, a Walnut Park-based obstetrician, was 
ordered on April 1 to pay $19,740 in back rent, $168,000 for distress, $350,000 
in punitive damages, and about $31,000 in interest, Cohen said. The award is to 
be split among the five families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sassoon, however, said he would appeal. The plaintiffs "don't deserve 
anything," he said. "I should be paid for what they did to me."  
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk Superior Court jury found that Sassoon ignored tenants' complaints 
of unsafe and unhealthful living conditions that ranged from rat infestation to 
raw sewage and numerous other code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspector Carlos Levario, who was a key witness for the 
prosecution, testified that the city inspected the 11-unit apartment complex at 
5516 Gotham St. about 40 times over an 18-month period beginning in July, 1991, 
in an effort to solve problems. Most of the other tenants in the building had 
moved away by the time the five families filed suit, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worse violations, Levario discovered, was an illegal garage 
conversion where sewage flowed under a baby's crib. "It was one of the worst 
properties I'd been in," Levario said. A videotape documenting conditions at 
the property helped sway the jury, Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Sassoon pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of failing to 
correct substandard living conditions at the building and was sentenced to 
three years' probation and fined $2,500. Sassoon asserted that the tenants 
vandalized the property and then called city inspectors in a ruse to win free 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been treated very unjustly," Sassoon said last week. "Before they 
left, they broke the place and took pictures. I treated them very fairly. I did 
everything possible to keep the place in the best way possible that I could."

 Jean-Michel Cousteau is partial to Fiji, New Guinea, parts of Indonesia, and 
several places in the Indian Ocean and Asia. But he now hangs his hat in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in Santa Barbara for the last year and a half, and I opened my 
office last June," he said. "I've had my eye on Santa Barbara for the last 20 
years. We have the Channel Islands that have been virtually untouched except by 
the military. They have survived the rather formidable demographic process, and 
also, it's a great place to dive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the son of eminent environmentalist and ocean explorer Jacques 
Cousteau will host an evening of short films and a discussion titled "Legacy of 
the Living Sea," at Campbell Hall on the campus of UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousteau will screen three short films: "The Tribal Sea: Dolphins and Whales," 
"Relics of the Sea," and "Wonders of the Nocturnal Sea," the latest releases 
from his company, Jean-Michel Cousteau Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1938, Cousteau toured with his father for more than 40 years, 
exploring places most of us haven't heard of, couldn't spell or afford to 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the younger Cousteau knows a thing or two about film, having been a prime 
organizer of the award-winning television series, "The Undersea World of 
Jacques Cousteau." He has produced "Jacques Cousteau: The First 75 Years," the 
Peabody award-winning series, "Cousteau's Amazon" and the Emmy-winning 
"Cousteau/Mississippi." His company makes educational films, cartoons and 
environmentally oriented children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Between filmmaking assignments and exploration trips, Cousteau spends as much 
time on the road as a blues musician. He has lectured to as many as 100,000 
students a year. A co-founder of the Cousteau Society, he served as executive 
vice president from 1979 to 1993, although today he is no longer affiliated 
with that group. 
</P>
<P>
 A trained architect, he is much in demand internationally as a consultant on 
marine environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyday, we are faced with news about the degradation of the environment. 
According to Cousteau, at least some of those responsible for the problem are 
doing something to rectify it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just 20 years ago, corporations didn't want anything to do with us unless 
they could see Jacques Cousteau's pretty little fishes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, improving the environmental quality is actually in their 
self-interest because it improves their public image. The bottom line is, of 
course, money, but that's fine with us. We have to find ways to counter these 
dangers and at the same time seek compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the sheer magnitude of some of the plant's environmental woes, tends to 
create a certain apathy and a we-can't-change-the-inevitable attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, that which hasn't happened yet isn't inevitable, and individuals, 
according to Cousteau, can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "On an individual level, it has to begin with awareness, like not dumping. 
Even if you live inland or on the coast, everything ends up in the ocean. Every 
time you flush the toilet, it goes to the ocean." Details

THEATER REVIEW; MUSICAL TACKLES TOUGH ISSUES OF ROMANCE; 'COMPANY' EXPLORES 
CONTEMPORARY RELATIONSHIPS. THE SANTA BARBARA GROUP HOPES TO BRING MORE 
SUBSTANCE TO PRODUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your taste in musicals runs more toward substance than spectacle, the 
Contemporary Music Theatre of Santa Barbara might be just your ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed company has dedicated itself to producing more provocative 
alternatives to the Broadway blockbuster revivals that have become the staples 
of regional theater. In place of the familiar escapist romanticism of the 
Rodgers and Hammerstein era, CMT's declared intent is to emphasize social 
issues and newer works. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, newish at least. "Company," CMT's inaugural production, actually 
premiered in New York 24 years ago. At the time, Stephen Sondheim's smart, 
sophisticated songs and George Furth's episodic, chronologically challenged 
book played fast and loose with established theatrical conventions, forcing a 
fresh perspective on their viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some of the show's cutting edge topicality may have been blunted by 
the intervening decades (sexual promiscuity, experimentation with pot, etc., 
are hardly uncharted territory anymore), "Company" tackles some particularly 
difficult questions about marriage and relationships that ring as true in the 
AIDS-conscious present as they did in the swinging '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really desirable -- or even possible -- to maintain a lifelong 
commitment amid the temptations of hedonism in today's world? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the central issue troubling our bachelor hero Robert (Mark O'Brien) on 
his 35th birthday, as he observes his married friends and wonders if he should 
settle down with someone. 
</P>
<P>
 What's still refreshing about "Company" is its refusal to settle for pat 
answers. When Robert asks his buddy Harry (Ken Ryals) if he's sorry he got 
married, the song "Sorry-Grateful" that he gets in reply is steeped in the 
emotional complexity that forms the heart of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 You're always sorry,  
</P>
<P>
 You're always grateful,  
</P>
<P>
 You're always wondering what might have been,  
</P>
<P>
 Then she walks in.  
</P>
<P>
 In a more hackneyed piece, that song would be the cue for the magical 
recognition -- of course being with her makes it all worthwhile. But Sondheim 
doesn't allow us the easy out, as Harry continues: "And still you're sorry/And 
still you're grateful. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Company's" songs never fail to dazzle with their ingenuity and insight, and 
the 14-member cast handle the tongue-twisting lyrics and unpredictable rhythms 
with impressive skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most noteworthy performances are Karyl Lynn Burn's triple-time ode 
to premarital neurosis in the frenetically paced "Getting Married Today;" 
Angela Haag's eloquent celebration of romance amid the hustle and bustle of New 
York City in "Another Hundred People;" and the wistful morning-after duet 
between Robert and a stewardess (Julie Keatinge) in "Barcelona." 
</P>
<P>
 As Robert, O'Brien's acting skills just aren't on a par with his singing. His 
delivery is often mannered and unconvincing, especially in comparison with the 
more natural characterizations we get from Katie Malloy-Thatcher as a 
deferential spouse who explores some newfound assertiveness (and an altered 
state of consciousness), and Rose Anna B. Vitetta as a raucous Weight Watcher's 
refugee given to wrestling bouts with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Robert's role through much of the piece is as passive witness to 
the hilarious excesses of his friends. O'Brien proves far more successful when 
he gets to articulate his conclusions in song -- notably in the heartfelt 
finale, where he realizes being with other people is the secret to "Being 
Alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Production values are modest, but the thrust stage and three-quarter surround 
seating make for intimate viewing. Musical director David Potter leads his 
tasteful three-piece live ensemble through the intricacies of the score with 
commendable precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Briskly directed by Pope Freeman, the show marks an auspicious debut for a 
fledgling troupe. The commitment to material of substance, the professionalism 
of the implementation, and the chance to see a watershed work of contemporary 
musical theater make this production pleasant "Company" indeed. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Company." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through April 17, Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., 2 p.m. matinees 
on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Fleishman Auditorium, Museum of Natural History, 2559 Puesta del Sol, 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $16.50.

LONG BEACH'S ROCKY ROAD; CRIME PUTS A DAMPER ON ANAHEIM STREET'S RICH OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not much to look at, this treeless commercial strip of auto-body shops 
and drive-through hamburger joints and dark convenience stores where the canned 
goods may be dusty but the liquor bottles gleam like the front window at 
Tiffany's. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim Street, which spills untidily across southern Long Beach, from the 
truck stops in the harbor district to the upscale Los Altos residential 
neighborhood, plays a crucial role in the city's commercial and cultural life. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the street's inelegant hodgepodge of businesses -- more than 
700 of them, at last count -- has become the entry point for hundreds of 
minority entrepreneurs. Anaheim Street is where Cambodians, Mexicans and other 
recent arrivals take their first steps into the American free-enterprise 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled unobtrusively among El Pollo Loco, Midas Muffler and other franchise 
outlets are tropical produce stores, Cambodian grocery shops, pinata stores, 
carnicerias and a collection of restaurants offering everything from burritos 
and Salvadoran pupusas to pad thai and down-home barbecued ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have there are the pushcart vendors of the 1990s," said City 
Councilman Ray Grabinski, whose district encompasses a portion of the strip. 
</P>
<P>
 On the single commercial thoroughfare, one can buy yucca roots, lemon grass, 
joss paper, Thai eggplant, old-fashioned washboards, imported jewelry, cheese 
for enchiladas, exotic fishing tackle, grinding stones, tortilla meal, loose 
corn husks, home-cooked pork rinds, gardening tools and a six-pack of 
Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of commerce and culture along Anaheim Street's five miles sparks 
occasional reveries among merchants; they sometimes dream together over lunch 
about attracting the big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The street could be an international bazaar, a stopping-off point for shoppers 
with Visas and MasterCards, said Sandy Blankenship, director of the Cambodian 
Business Assn. "Why go to Los Angeles?" she said. "Anything you want to try -- 
it's right there on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, most merchants concede, Anaheim Street needs a serious 
make-over -- from cosmetic improvements to the storefronts to reductions in 
rampant petty crime -- before the tourist buses start rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 The street wrestles with a two-ton gorilla of an image problem, they say. "I 
get calls all the time from Cerritos and Torrance," said Deborah Turner, owner 
of Doggie In The Window, a pet grooming shop where more than 100 dogs and cats 
are washed, primped and blow-dried every Saturday. "People say, 'I've heard 
about your business but I'm afraid to go down there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the street hit a low point in the early 1980s, when dozens 
of businesses failed and prostitutes and drug-dealers moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, thousands of Cambodians, refugees from the reign of terror in their 
country in the late 1970s under dictator Pol Pot, began settling in the area. 
And members of this new community began opening their own stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Cambodian businesses -- restaurants, jewelers, grocery stores and 
doughnut shops, usually with Cambodian writing on the front -- have given 
Anaheim Street a shot of energy, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 300 Cambodian-owned businesses in Long Beach, most of them 
along Anaheim Street, according to the social service group United Cambodian 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area that was surely in its death throes 10 years ago," Grabinski 
said. "Now there are shopping centers where most forecasters would have said 
nothing good could come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the street is still plagued by burglars and other street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department does not keep separate statistics for crimes committed 
on Anaheim Street, but a spokeswoman acknowledged that its South Patrol 
Division, which includes most of the commercial strip, is by far the 
department's busiest. 
</P>
<P>
 After dark, dim amber-colored street lights go on, most pedestrians disappear 
and shop gates and shutters clatter shut. 
</P>
<P>
 For the few businesses that remain open, there is sometimes a siege mentality. 
"People come and ask for free chicken," said Abu Taher, the manager of a 
Church's Fried Chicken outlet on the street, "and when they don't get it, they 
throw stones and break the windows." 
</P>
<P>
 One man recently put his hand in the window where orders are taken and knocked 
over a $2,500 cash register, said the Bangladesh-born Taher. Two months ago, 
gunmen forced their way into the store at closing time, pistol-whipped 
employees, and escaped with $700. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some merchants appear oblivious to the nighttime fears. Brite Spot, a 
24-hour Mexican restaurant, stands out like a neon beacon in the dark at the 
corner of Anaheim and Walnut Avenue. It's a lively place even at 1 a.m., with a 
steady stream of rancheras pouring from the jukebox and low-cost food, with 
ample ladles of beans and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 For owner Guadalupe Perez, the key to his consistently tranquilo restaurant is 
its informality. "People feel like they're at home here," he said. "For our 
regular customers, if they have no money, no problema ." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights on Anaheim Street, the sidewalk traffic sticks around a 
little longer, and the activity offers a glimpse of what some planners see as 
the street's future. Mariachi trios often ply the street, traveling from one 
Mexican restaurant to the next. Cambodian wedding parties, with women in 
traditional lace and silk dresses, bustle in and out of banquet halls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For at least a decade, local merchants have pushed plans to upgrade the street 
and to mainstream its ethnically oriented merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the street is not a City Hall priority, residents and merchants complain. 
"Minority neighborhoods have never been a priority of this city," said 
Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord, whose family once owned a restaurant on 
Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to see the mayor of Los Angeles fighting for (that city's) 
projects, while our city does nothing," said Harry Boerner, president of the 
Anaheim Street Business Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not quite accurate, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials have declared Anaheim Street an enterprise zone, 
providing some employers with subsidies and tax breaks. And it has funneled 
small federal grants to minority businesses there. Last year, the city included 
Anaheim Street in a huge octopus-shaped community redevelopment area, making it 
eligible to use a share of property taxes for new capital projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But even city officials concede that observable change is probably years away. 
"The street just really became a redevelopment area at the start of the year," 
said Fred Solomon, manager of the city's Redevelopment Bureau. "It's at least a 
year or two away from accruing funds to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department, turning up the heat on street criminals, has put foot 
patrols in the area and plans to begin using bicycle patrols there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the department's gang detail have also been assisting Asian 
merchants to resist extortion demands from Cambodian gangs. Because of the 
gangs' intimidation tactics, the detectives' success has been limited, said 
Detective Norm Sorenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the business people) think it's a lot less hassle to succumb to the 
demands of the gangs," Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants, some of whom began a "business watch" program last month to 
keep an eye on each other's stores and alert police to problems, agree that the 
police have been responding with renewed alacrity. In the first week of the 
business watch there were four arrests stemming from merchants' calls, 
including one drug bust, said Turner, owner of the pet-grooming shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants have tried to do things on their own to fix up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 About five years ago, said Vora Huy Khanthoul, executive director of United 
Cambodian Community, there were meetings about a plan to transform the street 
into a sort of Little Phnom Penh. The idea was to give the central part of 
Anaheim Street an aesthetic theme -- "like Little Tokyo or Chinatown, with a 
McDonald's with a pagoda roof," Khanthoul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the proliferation of Cambodian, Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese 
businesses, however, the idea of the unifying theme disappeared with the 
collapse of the real estate boom, community leaders say. It never got beyond 
the pipe-dream stage. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, there was the electric trolley bus fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, after two years of planning and $11.6 million of design and 
engineering work, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted to scuttle a 
planned trolley system along Anaheim and 7th streets. Faced with a $126-million 
deficit, the MTA erased the program, which would have entailed capital costs of 
up to $5 million per mile.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan, its advocates say, would not only have helped to reduce air and 
noise pollution with electric buses, but it would also have given Anaheim 
Street a face lift, using mostly federal and state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Boerner, Anaheim Street merchants had met numerous times with 
engineers and designers to discuss everything from the shape of new lamp posts 
and the look of new bus shelters to the species of palm trees to be installed 
along the trolley route. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the rug was pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have meant the renaissance of Anaheim Street," said Boerner, who 
owns an Anaheim Street electronics store that was looted during the 1992 riots 
following the state trial in the Rodney G. King police beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 Connoisseurs of Anaheim Street say that, for all of its shortcomings, it 
exhibits a spunky, unpretentious vigor unmatched by any other Long Beach 
street. There are rarely any vacant stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It already is an international bazaar," said Dixie Swift, director of 
Homeland, a community arts program run by the city's Department of Parks, 
Recreation and Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes an urban adventurer like Swift to pick the gems out of the 
commercial sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 The street has always been a low-end commercial street -- "a discount center," 
one store owner calls it. In the 1940s and 1950s, most of the merchants were 
European Jewish immigrants. By the 1970s, as blacks and Latinos replaced whites 
in the little bungalows and apartment buildings, the central part of Anaheim 
Street became a black shopping and entertainment strip, with restaurants and 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a dozen black businesses have hung on, including the Butler Barn, a 
liquor store where the owner, Alfred Butler, sometimes bemoans the way he ekes 
out a living seven days a week, envied by some of his impoverished customers 
but enduring hard times himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As many blacks have moved farther north, sales have become skimpy on Anaheim 
Street, Butler said.

<P>
 There's a wild and woolly end of Anaheim Street, west of Pacific Avenue. The 
sidewalks here sometimes seethe with panhandlers and street hustlers, and, 
according to residents, there is an active late-night drug market. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants there are a hearty group, seeking to sell their wares to a 
community of impoverished new immigrants and transients. "No good at night," 
said a Korean mechanic who works in the area. "A lot of people come out and 
sell crack. We close at 5." 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian-born Othman Shalabi and Ziad Saad, who have run a 99-Cent 
store on the north side of the street for a year, recently saw entrepreneurial 
opportunity there. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Latino homemakers trekking to a grocery store 12 blocks away, 
the two Palestinians last month opened La Bodega on the south side of the 
street. The colorful store, with a depiction of a large cornucopia with 
tumbling fruits and vegetables on the front, now does a booming business in 
Latino produce, from plantains to pineapples. 
</P>
<P>
 The two merchants, both of whom have become fluent in Spanish from dealing 
with Spanish-speaking customers, brush off the dangers of doing business on 
Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the crooks, but the competition from small markets on the side 
streets, Saad said. "That's what makes it tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One establishment that doesn't worry about street criminals is the Long Beach 
Kick Boxing Center, which resounds with the grunts and sighs of students 
pummeling each other in the four-limbed Thai fighting style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best self-defense," said teacher Oumry Ban, 49, a still 
boyish-looking Cambodian, who fought professionally in the rings of Southeast 
Asia for 14 years before coming to the United States in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Street businesses are not all newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Jost's, a couple of miles farther east, has been plying draft beer and 
pickled eggs for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A long room, with pool tables in the back and walls plastered with pictures of 
customers wearing Joe Jost T-shirts in settings from the Bahamas to Bangkok, 
the bar's old-fashioned saloon ambience is a favorite with movie and commercial 
makers. (Kevin Costner brought Whitney Houston there in "The Bodyguard.") 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's busiest day is Christmas Eve, when former residents of the area's 
single-family bungalows come home to visit, said owner Ken Buck. "We get four 
generations of family members in here," says Buck, the grandson of the founder. 
"There are people who remember their grandfather bringing them in, and now 
they're bringing their own kids in." 
</P>
<P>
 Next door is another Anaheim Street institution, Fishermen's Hardware, where 
anglers from as far away as Zaire and New Zealand come to buy fishing tackle. 
The store, with its bins of lures and stands of rods, offers the equipment to 
go after anything "from the smallest pan fish to the largest marlin," said 
manager Don Somerville. 
</P>
<P>
 On the walls are Fiberglas replicas of some clients' catches, including a 
311-pound yellow-fin tuna and a 468-pound marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street is the Anaheim Street Ace Hardware Store, founded 42 years 
ago as Evans Hardware. For the past seven years, the store has been owned by 
Tyler Barnes, who insists that Anaheim Street is a great place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes has modernized the stock, laid it out on neat pegboard stands and, 
establishing accounts with most of the apartment buildings in the neighborhood, 
multiplied sales by a factor of 10, he says. "This place is a gold mine," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Cambodian merchants who have gained a foothold on the street, 
there's a stubborn determination to stay. Many of them, survivors of Cambodia's 
"killing fields," have built their businesses by borrowing from friends and 
spending long hours at work. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most ambitious Cambodian enterprises is Apsara, a spacious 
restaurant on Atlantic Avenue, just north of Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, Apsara, with its striking frieze-work sculptures reminiscent of 
the holy Cambodian city of Angkor Wat, has become a favorite spot for weddings 
and other celebrations.

OPINION; IF MOM WERE MAYOR: ESSAY WINNERS GIVE HER GUIDANCE

 Long Beach youngsters were invited to write essays describing what their 
mothers or fathers should do if one of them were elected mayor. Steven Wasick, 
a freshman at Polytechnic High School, won first place in the high school 
category. Rome Sotelo, who is in the eighth grade at Hughes Middle School, 
topped the middle-school division. Nearly 100 students entered the contest, 
sponsored by "Straight Talk" Cable Television show, ACT Electronics and Kinko's 
Copy Center. The winning essays:

<P>
 If my mom was the mayor (and she should be) there are plenty of things I would 
ask her to do. These are just a few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Long Beach is a large modern city, we need a sense of community. 
Neighborhood meetings are a way to start. People in every neighborhood have 
good ideas and if everyone came together and discussed the ideas, problems 
would be solved and neighbors might be friends again. Also, get corporations to 
sponsor events at local parks so that youth in the area will have something to 
do after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime: it's on everyone's mind. People used to be able to leave their doors 
unlocked at night and not worry. Now, walking down the street at night is left 
for the daring. We need to restore that feeling of security to the citizens of 
Long Beach. One way to do this is to put more police officers on bike patrols. 
They have been proven to be more effective in stopping crime and are much less 
expensive to support. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Long Beach has problems, we are still a great city. People who live 
here know that. We must make sure that other people from around the country 
know that, too. Long Beach must project a positive image of itself so that 
businesses are enticed to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an old saying that a city is only as good as the people who live in 
it. The fact that Long Beach is a great city is a testament to the people who 
live here. We have made Long Beach into the wonderful city that it is today. 
Don't stop now, together we can make it even better.

<P>
 Long Beach is seriously sick. I would want my "doctor" mom to cure it. She 
remembers when Long Beach was well. It was clean, safe and a wonderful place to 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach needs strong medicine, an inventive, perhaps bitter pill to 
stimulate its own recovery. She would like Long Beach to stand for Let Our New 
Government Bring Encouragement and Continuing Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The first attack would be to get rid of the germs that are eating away our 
city's resources and strengths, namely anyone or thing that cannot justify, 
with concrete results, its time and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, put to use our greatest resource: our people. Have a youth staff on the 
City Council with full authority. Have elderly and welfare mothers of small 
children baby-sit at senior and community centers, enabling able-bodied parents 
to work without endangering their children or their pocketbooks. Have citizens 
participate in community projects, paid by city vouchers, redeemable for food, 
clothing and shelter. These projects can include graffiti removal, renovating 
houses and businesses, service to youth, and clerical duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The next course of treatment is safety. Along with sobriety checkpoints, 
establish random safety checkpoints at any or all of our schools to search 
motorists and pedestrians for weapons. Create a program paying cash or tickets 
for tips or weapons. Give incentives for neighborhood patrols and watches. Make 
it clear that Long Beach will not tolerate crime. Support law enforcement by 
clearing court dockets with mandatory sentencing coupled with mandatory 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the patient, Long Beach, healthy, you must keep its system running 
smoothly. First, balance the budget by allowing the city to borrow from other 
departments, its people and money. That would mean restructuring city 
government and bringing it into the 21st Century. No more career civil servants 
who take more than they give. No more contracts to underqualified and 
overpriced firms. We need to refinance existing debts, create penalties for 
unused properties, create a complaint department for its citizenry, extend 
hours for city services to evening and weekends, create liaisons for business 
to city, city to city, residents to city, residents to business, residents to 
residents; establish new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Mom's pet projects include gambling on the Queen Mary, water treatment, 
storage and selling of the Los Angeles River and the Pacific Ocean, 
establishing Long Beach as an entertainment mecca, an offshore airport, no 
smoking anywhere children are present, and space-age technology for all forms 
of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly you must advertise, advertise, advertise! Sell Long Beach as the place 
to live, work and play, and then, keep your word!

 VAULTING TO THE TOP 
</P>
<P>
 It's still up in the air as to who is a better pole vaulter, but Zack Evink 
and Fernando Preciado will try to determine that Saturday when they compete at 
the Downey Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 At a dual meet March 29, Evink, a Paramount senior, and Preciado, a junior 
from Downey, each cleared 14 feet. However, since Evink did it on his second 
vault and Preciado on his third, the senior was awarded first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Coach Tim Meledy, who worked with both vaulters last summer, said 
Preciado might have the edge Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the potential of beating Zack because (Preciado) made the 14 feet by a 
good margin and Zack slithered over it," said Meledy, who thinks Preciado could 
break Downey's record of 15-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Meledy, who wrote his 1987 thesis on the techniques of pole vaulting while 
attending Cal State L.A., acknowledged his surprise about the impressive vaults 
of his two pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare for one kid in a dual meet to go 13 feet," he said. "And then they 
both went on to achieve a foot higher than that." ON TO IOWA 
</P>
<P>
 Timicha Kirby and Shannon Perry, future University of Iowa teammates, were 
named to the Southern Section girls' basketball team. Kirby, a Lynwood High 
senior, and Perry, a senior from Cerritos, were chosen to the team by a panel 
of sportswriters. LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 Two coaches notched their 400th victory on Saturday. Baseball Coach Dave Snow 
accomplished his feat when the 49ers pounded No. 1 ranked Cal State Fullerton, 
10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before a school-record crowd of 1,826 at Blair Field, the 49ers (25-8) 
used a 14-hit attack led by center fielder Rolando Avila. Avila had a triple, 
two singles, a stolen base and two runs scored. Shortstop Ryan Miller had two 
hits and batted in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who were held to three hits in a 9-1 loss to the Titans on Friday, 
took the third game of the series on Sunday, 4-2. Trailing 2-1 in the eighth, 
the 49ers turned two singles, two bunts and two errors into three unearned 
runs. Second baseman Eric Martins, who produced three of the 49ers' seven hits, 
extended his hitting streak to 12 games and is batting a team-leading .352. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-game series broke attendance records. The crowds of 1,638, 1,826 and 
1,448 are the three largest in school history, and mark the largest three-game 
series ever (4,912), beating the 3,895 for Wichita State earlier this year. 
Also, the home attendance record of 15,313 was broken with 15 home games left. 
</P>
<P>
 49er softball Coach Pete Manarino earned his 400th career victory when Long 
Beach won the first game of a doubleheader, 1-0, over host New Mexico State on 
Saturday. The 49ers (20-16, 7-7 in the Big West Conference) lost the second 
game, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 11 seasons at Long Beach, Manarino has a 400-237 record. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 49ers' 1-0 win, Linda Lunceford singled home Kristyn Frady in the first 
inning and Stacy Van Essen (7-8) gave up only one hit. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State women's rowing team won the California Cup at the San 
Diego Crew Classic on Sunday. Finishing in 7 minutes 8.6 seconds, the 49ers won 
by a boat length over the University of San Diego. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Hilda Alfaro, third baseman on the Long Beach City College softball team, is 
expected to sign a letter of intent with Southwest Louisiana on Friday. Alfaro 
is batting .286 in South Coast Conference play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (25-4, 6-0) was scheduled to play at conference-rival Mt. San 
Antonio (19-6, 5-1) on Wednesday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking baseball team (14-15) continued to struggle. After Thursday's 7-5 
loss to Mt. San Antonio, Long Beach lost to Harbor, 13-4, on Saturday. The 
Vikings have a home-and-home series with Cerritos that begins today at 2:30 
p.m. at Cerritos. On Saturday, the teams play at Long Beach at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking women's tennis team improved to 8-1 and 8-0 in conference by 
defeating El Camino, 7-2, on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos baseball team improved to 21-8 and 10-4 in South Coast Conference 
play by defeating El Camino, 13-4, on Saturday. Brooks Morris, Juan Rocha and 
Carlos Olea each had three hits. Sophomore shortstop Kaina McCallum had four 
RBI. Freshman right-hander Chris Hill improved to 4-0. WHO'S WINNING 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, one board turned down another board. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-to-3 vote, the ABC Unified School District board turned down Gahr's 
request for a new scoreboard at Rants Stadium. The existing scoreboard, which 
has been in place since 1979, recently malfunctioned during a Southern Section 
soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 According to ABC President Cecy Groom, the school board is looking for 
"alternative funding" for a new scoreboard, which she said would cost $9,500. 
If money is not found, it would have to come from the general reserve fund. 
There is a question of how much money is in the general reserve, but that 
should be resolved in the next few months, Groom said. Currently, the school 
district has a $2.9 million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a point where we just can't be making expenditures right now," said 
Groom, who voted against paying for the scoreboard with general reserve 
funding. "It's a matter of establishing what the priorities are. The scoreboard 
has to be put in. It's just a matter of where the money will come from."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides Gahr, Cerritos and Los Alamitos play their home games at Rants 
Stadium. Los Alamitos rents the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gahr booster club president Greg Uttecht said that in the long run, it will 
cost the district more money if it doesn't install a new scoreboard. Uttecht 
estimated the district cleared $4,000 for renting the facility to Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coupled with that, the district also rented out the stadium to the CIF for 
the soccer final," he said. "After expenses, we believe the revenue was $2,500 
for the two days. That's $6,500 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Uttecht also noted that without a working scoreboard, the district would have 
to rent a stadium for Gahr and Cerritos at about $1,000 a game. He favors 
taking the money from the reserve fund with a plan to replenish it over the 
next 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom contends that the deficit is already impacting the reserve fund which 
has to be at least 3% of the total $89 million general fund. Still, she 
believes the money for a new scoreboard will turn up somehow. 
</P>
<P>
 "From one to 10, it's a 10 there will be a new scoreboard," Groom said. 
MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams obtained former Long Beach Poly defensive back Marquez Pope from the 
San Diego Chargers in exchange for a sixth-round draft choice. The 5-foot-10, 
193-pound Pope was a second-round draft pick by the Chargers out of Fresno 
State in 1992.

 Long Beach City College will play host to the Southern California Spring 
Basketball Spectacular on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Games, featuring many of 
the area's top prep seniors and underclassmen, begin at 5:30 p.m. on Friday.

 I didn't even have to ask which kids liked this movie. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard them singing along with Thumbelina in the theater. I saw them bouncing 
up and down and clapping in their chairs. I ran into them afterward, twirling 
and flapping their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Rafferty said she knew her daughter Debbie, 3, liked the movie when she 
had to take a restroom break but ran there and back, nearly knocking people 
over, so she wouldn't miss too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's everything she loves, the pretty dresses, the beautiful voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this Don Bluth version of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale is 
not a classic in its own right, but it's not for lack of using nearly every 
element of recent animated blockbusters "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the 
Beast" and "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the innocent soprano with an animal guide, in this case Jacquimo, a 
swallow in musketeer costume. There are the oddball animal characters -- 
especially a humorous family of singing toads, "Los Sapos Guapos," led by the 
voice of Charo, and Miss Fieldmouse, the voice of Carol Channing, who advises 
Thumbelina, "Love won't put porridge in your bowl, Dearie; marry the mole." 
</P>
<P>
 There are sweetly sung show tunes, written by Barry Manilow, as well as 
cleverly animated changes of season. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the classics, there are also a few tense moments before the heroine and 
the prince live happily ever after. Some parents thought some of those moments 
might have frightened their children. The prince, for instance, becomes trapped 
in a block of ice until the Jitterbugs thaw him out. The toad is a fairly ugly 
aggressor, as is a mustachioed beetle. But these setbacks and enemies are mild 
compared to some other animated children's features. Here, no one dies. There 
are no evil witches, no scary typhoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sad," said Christian Lazenby, 6, referring to the scene in which 
Jacquimo had a thorn in his wing. But what he remembered most was "when they 
marry at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Ananda Mallory, 3, said she liked "the part where the prince was alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Lawson, 6, also liked the ending most when Thumbelina "got her wings" 
and became a fairy princess. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 7-year-old Eric Schultz, there just wasn't enough traditional action. 
He much preferred the preceding animated short, "Animaniacs." Of the main 
event, he said, "I didn't especially care for it. There were some parts that 
were OK, but most of it was, a little, you know, off course for me." 
</P>
<P>
 What he really objected to was the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, a girl that was taken away and goes through all these adventurous 
things, that's not that good a plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would change the plot to a handsome prince coming, and she gets rescued by 
him, and he has to go through all these obstacles and everything, and at the 
end, they just, you know, get married." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's not "Aladdin." But, hey, it's all right. And most of the little 
ones seemed captivated by its twist on the classic fairy tale: There's someone 
for everyone, even if you're two inches tall.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; OCEANIC ARTISTS MOVE SHOW TO BIGGER FACILITY; 
TICKETS WON'T BE A PROBLEM THIS YEAR AS THE UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY 
PRESENTS ITS '94 COLLECTION AT THE 1,600-SEAT OXNARD CIVIC AUDITORIUM.

 The Channel Islands Underwater Photographic Society moves to the big room as 
it steps up from a modest community center to the Oxnard Civic Auditorium for 
its annual show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Terry Reid of Oxnard said the group used to sell out the 550-seat 
community center as much as a month in advance, but the 1,600-seat auditorium 
means tickets should be available until show time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of underwater pioneer Jacques Cousteau, will be 
master of ceremonies for "Underwater '94," a collection of eight submarine 
videos, films and slide shows. The 2 1/2-hour show includes a documentary on 
whale skeletons discovered in a South Pacific cave and a video on rescuing 
injured sea lions on the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who did the sea lion rescue has a helmet mounted-camera," said Dave 
Reid, dive club vice president. "They stalk gill-netted sea lions, stalk them 
with camouflage and the whole thing. When they get close enough, they charge 
and you get this picture bouncing down the beach with sea lions running in 99 
different directions. It's just pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
 The animals, once captured, are unbound and treated for any injuries they 
might have sustained from the nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the program is "Sea Flight," a slide show of pictures from the Channel 
Islands kelp forests with music, and a BBC feature on an eight-inch shrimp that 
clubs its prey to death with a claw that delivers a blow equal to a .22-caliber 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousteau will do two presentations, the first a feel-good documentary about 
Jojo, an unusually friendly dolphin in the Caribbean that seeks out human 
contact. The second film features a less cuddly marine life form -- plankton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, they're quite beautiful," Reid said. "They're in strands that run 
through water, and if you light them properly they are like living rainbows." 
</P>
<P>
 The show starts at 7:30 p.m. For tickets call the auditorium at 486-2424.

<P>
 The makers of "Saviors of the Forest," a funny and irreverent documentary on 
rain forest destruction and the environmental movement, will be on hand for 
Sunday's screening of their film at the Ojai Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Day and Terry Schwartz will answer questions before and after the 
presentation of this often hilarious film that attempts to show how political 
action to save the world's rain forests will necessarily be filled with paradox 
and ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of producing an environmental news program, the two filmmakers 
meet an Ecuadorean Indian who persuades them to visit his country to make a 
film that will help save his native rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a vaudevillian look at the realities of developing nations and 
their uses of the environment. Giddy humor and homespun self-confession leavens 
the apocalyptic gloom typical of environmental discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The film will be shown at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai 
Ave. Admission is $6.

 Do you think your recorded telephone message is exceptionally fine? Do friends 
comment on how warm and confident you sound telling them you're not home? Might 
that translate into a career in voice-overs? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 James Thomason, the voice casting director for Disney's animation department, 
said there's a huge supply of talent and those who do make it have to work 
awfully hard. Still, anyone who fights his way to the top can make big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "All through one night of prime time you hear one voice between shows -- 
'coming up next and later tonight' -- that sort of thing," he said. "That guy's 
getting a good quarter million a year. And there's lots of other work beside 
that, but the numbers are against you. If you're thinking about selling real 
estate and going to voice-overs a couple of days a week, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still not discouraged? Thomason will teach a workshop Saturday at Learning 
Tree University in Thousand Oaks on how to break into the biz. It runs from 2 
to 5 p.m.

ON THE ROAD: PLUMBER'S PIPE DREAM BECOMES ARTISTIC CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a garage off Oxnard Boulevard, Bernard Collin wields a blowtorch upon a 
thick slab of sheet steel, cobalt flame strobing the room, a rain of sparks 
falling everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There," he says, looking up. "It's a little deer. All you do is cut through, 
and then maybe you put a man in the steel who chases the deer." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Bernard's wife, Mary, minds the store. This is where 
Bernard's work ends up, in a cinder block showroom of the torched: Steel lamps. 
Steel tables. Steel room dividers. Eight-foot-tall free-standing pieces of 
rusted, cut, torched and beaten steel that, rendered weightless by the 
"movement" of primitive and abstracted motifs, are friendly monoliths. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard's a Frenchman, a former pipe fitter from a village near Dijon. Mary's 
a Californian who grew up in Mill Valley and the San Fernando Valley and 
odd-jobbed in Venice Beach along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 They live in a trailer in Malibu. They fell in love when Mary, as a part-time 
college student in the '70s, backpacked her way around Europe and hired on to 
help raise 120 sheep at a bed-and- breakfast/farm owned by Bernard's family. 
The farming went well. The marriage did, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But in France it was hard to get ahead. Bernard saw himself fitting pipes 
forever, not that fitting pipes is bad work. But Bernard had noodled around 
with wood back home, carving abstract sculptures. He just didn't think much 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to California, took a place in Venice, and Bernard became the 
darling of apartment building owners who were mystified by a plumber who liked 
to fix old things rather than mindlessly replace them with the new. Bernard let 
his hourly rate do the American thing -- triple with demand, topping out at 
$45. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tradesman ghost returned. Bernard figured: This is all I'll ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed for the basement at night after work, torching and bending steel. 
The first pieces were decorative, with some utility: huge weather vanes, not 
unlike the custom pieces atop numerous Beverly Hills garages. Then some lamps. 
Then a table. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary would schlep the pieces to open construction sites in Santa Monica, 
Malibu -- wherever they'd listen to her. She sold a few. The big break came, 
however, when the Brian Jeffreys store on Melrose in Los Angeles purchased two 
lamps for more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "That night," says Mary, "we cried. We saw it might be possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Things took off. Bernard torched and cut full-time in a rented space in Culver 
City. Mary drove, sold and went to the trade shows to pass out not glossy 
brochures but sometimes blurry Fotomat snapshots of her husband's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cher would buy a Bernard Collin piece, so would others of the rich and famous 
who live in mansions that surround Paradise Cove, site of Mary and Bernard's 
trailer home. Bernard's pieces, originally heavy and rough-hewn, took on a 
leaner line. They would then show up in the upscale mail-order catalogues, such 
as Sundance and the Last Great Place, which currently lists Bernard's simple 
Latigo table lamp for $345. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Oxnard. This is not your basic art district kind of street. The shop 
states its business in block letters -- FRENCH METAL ART -- but is situated 
across from OK Radiator and Pettigrew Muffler & Brake. Rust, it would seem, 
binds the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is fine with Mary and Bernard, who admit to having not a clue as to how 
well they'll do, even though Bernard and his assistants are cranking out 130 
metal art pieces monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a businessman," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, we're just winging it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, how well they do commercially may not be the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard walks past a $550 sideboard into which he has cut a primitive hunting 
scene and then a $300 floor lamp whose flowing lines defy its perhaps 40 pounds 
of heft and then the copper-shaded Latigo lamp, which here sells for the outlet 
price of $200. He is wearied by discussions that would place him in 
large-scale, gotta-get-rich production. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Bernard is most animated when discussing a not-for-sale, unfinished 
abstract sculpture that carries the raw, edgy energy of a Miro in 3-D. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe fitter from France rubs his stubbled jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artist?" he says. "Oh, I am, perhaps, an artisan. For me, my dream would be 
to make someday a very big gate, a gate with many designs in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the gate would lead is anybody's guess. But it would surely embody 
what's here, in a showroom in this industrial outback.

EARTHWATCH: BUILDERS PUT WELCOME MAT OUT FOR NEW ECO-HOUSES; WEST COAST 
INTEREST IS RISING OVER TOPICS LIKE SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES, HEALTHY HOMES AND 
ENERGY-EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 All of a sudden in the building business it's fashionable to be environmental. 
Up and down the West Coast from Vancouver to Ventura County's patch of Malibu 
Hills, there have been sightings -- much more substantial than the Elvis sort 
-- of environmentally friendly building projects under way and also lots of 
environmental seminars for major builders and architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the number of invitations I have received by mail or fax, I could 
have spent every one of the past 90 days kibitzing at conferences or playing 
looky-loo at various eco-homes -- and never left the Pacific time zone. A few 
situations were irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what has happened recently in towns other than quake-damaged Los 
Angeles that might be causing this increased interest in energy-efficient 
construction and retrofitting, drought-tolerant planting and use of recycled 
building materials. But such is the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a delegation from our county, including members of Ventura County's 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects, trekked up to Santa Barbara to 
share ideas with experts from around the nation on topics such as eco-villages, 
sustainable landscapes, adaptive reuse and creating healthy homes. Those are 
code words for the various approaches to building on the planet without ruining 
its health and our own. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the participants, Julie Shular, who is building her own house in our 
county, attended a seminar she called "The Green Team and the Design Process." 
The formal title of the panel, indeed the title of the whole Santa Barbara 
shebang, was "Designing for Sustainable Communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Shular isn't an architect, but rather an owner-contractor. She went to the 
symposium to discuss the fine points of building what she sees as "a 21st 
Century environmental home," which will be constructed on her Houston Road 
property in Ventura County near Malibu. Her architect is Paul Bierman-Lytle, 
internationally famous proponent of resource-and-energy-thrifty homebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 This involves solar-powered heating and cooling, recycled materials such as 
plastic and steel, and landscaping that is both lovely and resource efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to be a realist about what's possible," Shular said of her project, 
which has passed muster with the Ventura County Planning Department and is 
about to be submitted to the Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in seeing and getting inside a home with these features, 
and don't mind a drive up the coast, there's an opportunity this weekend to 
satisfy your curiosity. Fifteen "eco-homes" are being opened to the public as 
part of an organized architectural study tour in San Luis Obispo, which will 
give you an idea of what may become mainstream in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you can't wait 57 months until the millennium arrives, you can buy one 
of the eco-houses being shown on the tour. Or, if you are planning a move 
farther north, check out Davis, where there is an entire eco-friendly 
subdivision called Village Homes. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Northern California, I also learned of yet another indicator of the 
eco-trend. This past Monday, the Pacific Stock Exchange began trading issues in 
a Ukiah-based company called Real Goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "RGT.P," as it is listed, sells the hardware to make your home eco-perfect. 
The stock appreciated 50% in its first day on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, is this eco-building stuff a trend, or what? Details

1994 PREP BASKETBALL ALL-STARS; GIRLS' ALL-STARS; SELECTION OF PENINSULA'S 
MCKINNEY MARKS THE END OF AN ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An era passed last month without much notice. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peninsula High lost to Clovis West, 67-65, in the semifinals of the 
Southern California girls' basketball regionals March 10, it marked the final 
high school game for Mimi McKinney, the last link to Peninsula's 33-0 national 
championship team in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney was a sophomore that season and part of an otherwise all-senior 
lineup. The other Panther starters -- Kristen Mulligan, Monique Morehouse, 
Jeffra Gausepohl and Raquel Alotis -- all earned scholarships to Division I 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 After their departure, McKinney was left to carry the torch for Peninsula as 
the program rebuilt. She came through the past two seasons by leading the 
Panthers to two Bay League titles, two playoff berths and a 42-14 record. 
</P>
<P>
 This marks the third consecutive season that McKinney has been chosen to The 
Times' South Bay All-Star team, an accomplishment that places her in the select 
company of such former standouts as Lisa Leslie of Morningside and Heather 
Burge of Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance forward Stephanie Pfau and McKinney are the only repeat 
selections. Rounding out the all-star team are centers Ieesha Donadelle of 
Torrance and Brandie Gray of Carson, forwards Yanick Clay of Inglewood, Cheryl 
Dickson of Morningside, Tracy Holman of West Torrance and Andrea Miller of 
Redondo, and guards Shelley Dungo of Bishop Montgomery and Jenille Ramos of 
Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa 
Monica. The South Bay player and coach of the year awards will be announced at 
the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Yanick Clay (Inglewood) -- The talented junior could be the area's most highly 
recruited player next season. She has attracted attention from several 
colleges, Inglewood Coach Arnold Blalark said. Clay led her team to second 
place behind Peninsula in the Bay League, averaging 15.6 points, 9.7 rebounds, 
3.4 assists and two steals. She was named league most valuable player and was 
selected to the Southern Section Division II second team. Third-seeded 
Inglewood lost to Gahr in the first round of the Division II-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Dickson (Morningside) -- Named most valuable player of the Ocean 
League, Dickson led the Monarchs to the league title and a Division III playoff 
berth. Second-seeded Morningside was beaten in the first round by Newbury Park, 
but the loss didn't detract from a stellar senior season for Dickson. The 
forward averaged 10.2 points and 9.5 rebounds. She was named to the Division 
III second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ieesha Donadelle (Torrance) -- Although her team failed to reach the playoffs 
from the Pioneer League, Donadelle was recognized as the league's most valuable 
player by the coaches. The center averaged 23 points (25 in league play), 15 
rebounds and two blocks. She is being recruited by several four-year colleges, 
including San Jose State and Hawaii. She scored a game-high 13 points to lead 
the Blue team to a 69-44 victory in the South Bay all-star game March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Dungo (Bishop Montgomery) -- A three-year varsity starter, Dungo made 
the transition from shooting guard to point guard last season and led the 
Knights to a 23-8 record and two playoff victories. Bishop Montgomery lost in 
the Division III-AA semifinals to eventual state champion Brea-Olinda. Dungo 
averaged 13.6 points and 3.2 assists and was named to the Division III first 
team. She was MVP of the Anaheim Western tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandie Gray (Carson) -- The 6-foot-3 center was a force inside for the Colts, 
averaging 16 points and 12.3 rebounds. Gray was also one of the area's leading 
shot blockers. She helped Carson finish in a three-way tie for the Pacific 
League title with Crenshaw and Washington. Carson (22-5) lost to eventual 
champion Crenshaw in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Holman (West Torrance) -- A straight-A student as well as an all-around 
athlete, Holman helped the Warriors secure a Division II-A playoff berth by 
leading the team in virtually every statistical category. She averaged 19.8 
points, eight rebounds and five assists. West took third behind co-champions 
South Torrance and North Torrance in the Pioneer League. Holman will attend 
Loyola Marymount on a volleyball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi McKinney (Peninsula) -- A two-time All-American, McKinney has been a 
highly regarded player since her freshman season at Palos Verdes. Her senior 
season was marred because of injuries, but she managed to lead Peninsula with 
averages of 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, four assists, four steals and 1.4 
blocks. Peninsula (25-5) lost in the Division I-AA final to Lynwood. McKinney, 
who played on two state champions during her four years as a varsity starter, 
was the only area player named to the 10-player Southern Section team. She 
played in the inaugural National High School Coaches Assn. East-West all-star 
game Saturday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Miller (Redondo) -- Named most outstanding player in the Ocean League, 
Miller led the Sea Hawks to second place behind Morningside and to the second 
round of the Division II-A playoffs. The junior, who played guard and forward, 
averaged 15.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.5 assists in her third season as a 
varsity starter. Miller was named all-tournament at South Torrance and Pacific 
Shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Pfau (South Torrance) -- One of the area's most versatile athletes, 
Pfau is a two-time Southern Section selection in basketball and volleyball. She 
helped the Spartans tie North for the Pioneer League title by averaging 12.4 
points and 7.4 rebounds in league play. Her overall averages were 9.3 and 6.1. 
Pfau was a four-year varsity starter and was chosen to play in the South Bay 
all-star game. South lost in the first round of the Division III-AA playoffs to 
Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenille Ramos (Banning) -- The catalyst behind Banning's City Section 3-A 
Division title, Ramos emerged as a leader in her junior season. She averaged 
14.5 points and 4.5 assists and was the Pilots' top three-point shooter for the 
second season in a row. Ramos was named 3-A Division player of the year after 
sharing Southern League most valuable player honors with Gardena's Tomika 
Cantley. With its top eight players returning, Banning should be a force again 
next season.

1994 PREP BASKETBALL ALL-STARS; BOYS' ALL-STARS; CLASS OF '94 LACKS HEIGHT, BUT 
IS ALWAYS A STEP AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball is a big man's game, but try telling that to The Times' South Bay 
All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a true post player, the all-star squad reflects the trend toward 
quicker, smaller lineups that emphasize the three-point shot. The 10-player 
team consists of eight guards and two forwards. The tallest players are 
Inglewood forward Paul Pierce and Serra guard Ricky Price, both 6-foot-6. 
</P>
<P>
 That might leave this team vulnerable on the inside if it ever had to take the 
court. But it wouldn't be lacking athleticism or scoring punch, with five 
players boasting averages of more than 20 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa guard Shane Willis is the only repeat selection. Inglewood, with 
Pierce and guard Sam Turks, is the only school with more than one all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the squad are guards Phil Belin of Peninsula, Morgan Ensberg of 
Redondo, Kareem Mutrie of Bishop Montgomery, Jason Pickett of Banning, Neil 
Thakur of Chadwick and forward Charles Perry of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa 
Monica. Winners of the South Bay player and coach of the year awards will be 
announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Belin (Peninsula) -- Although only a sophomore, Belin blossomed into the 
Panthers' best player after transferring from Chadwick. The rangy guard was a 
force on defense, leading the team in blocks and steals. He also was the top 
scorer, averaging 16 points a game. Belin teamed with another sophomore, 6-6 
center Andrew Klein, to lead Peninsula to a 21-7 record and second place in the 
Bay League behind Inglewood. With four starters returning, Peninsula should be 
even stronger next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Ensberg (Redondo) -- The most consistent player on a balanced team, 
Ensberg helped Redondo (21-8) to its winningest season in several years with 
his scoring and tenacious defense. He made nearly 40% of his three-point shots 
and averaged 14.6 points. The two-time All-Ocean League selection was at his 
best in the clutch, winning five games with last-second shots in the past two 
seasons. Ensberg was named to the Southern Section Division II second team 
after helping Redondo win two playoff games and advance to the II-A 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Mutrie (Bishop Montgomery) -- One of the area's premier point guards, 
Mutrie led the Knights to third place in the competitive Mission League and a 
berth in the Division III-AA playoffs. He averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 assists, 
and was named to the All-Mission League first team for the second season in a 
row. Mutrie's other honors include selection to the Division III first team and 
the all-tournament teams at El Segundo and Anaheim Katella. He signed a letter 
of intent with the University of San Diego in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Perry (Carson) -- A steady, all-around player, Perry helped the Colts 
reach the City Section 4-A Division semifinals before they were disqualified 
for using an ineligible player. He averaged 15.1 points and seven rebounds, and 
was his team's most accurate shooter, making 56% of his field goals. Perry was 
named to the All-Pacific League and 4-A Division teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Pickett (Banning) -- The area's leading scorer, Pickett averaged 26 
points a game in helping the Pilots to their second consecutive City Section 
3-A Division title. A streak shooter with great range, he carried Banning in 
several games. Not surprisingly, he was a unanimous selection as 3-A Division 
player of the year. Pickett remains one of Southern California's top unsigned 
players because of problems with the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pierce (Inglewood) -- Widely regarded as the top junior in the state, 
Pierce led Inglewood (30-4) to its most successful season since 1980, when the 
Sentinels went unbeaten with a team that included future UCLA standout Ralph 
Jackson and NBA player Jay Humphries. Pierce has attracted recruiters from 
around the country who covet his rare combination of inside strength and 
outside shooting. The forward averaged 23.2 points, 11 rebounds and two steals 
in leading the Sentinels to the Bay League and Division II-AA titles. He was 
runner-up to St. John Bosco's Jelani Gardner for Division II player of the year 
and was named to the elite 10-player All-Southern Section team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Price (Serra) -- After his much-publicized transfer from St. Anthony, 
Price entered last season with the biggest buildup of any South Bay player. He 
signed with Duke in November and was chosen the West Coast's top college 
prospect in a poll of college coaches. The guard didn't disappoint, averaging 
25.3 points, 11.2 rebounds and three steals in leading Serra to the Camino Real 
League title. The Cavaliers' season ended in the Division IV-A semifinals. 
Price was his league's unanimous choice for most valuable player and was named 
to the All-Southern Section team. He was selected to play in the prestigious 
McDonald's All-America game and won the dunk contest. He was also named to USA 
Today's All-American first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Thakur (Chadwick) -- The area's top three-point shooter, Thakur made 110 
of 282 attempts (39%) on a Chadwick team that set the Southern Section record 
for most three-point baskets in a season with 294. A four-year varsity starter, 
he averaged 24.8 points. He scored 30 points or more in eight games, including 
33 in a close loss to Division IV-A champion Verbum Dei. Thakur was the Prep 
League most valuable player and earned Division V honors for the second season 
a row. A versatile athlete, he was twice named all-section in football as a 
wide receiver. He hopes to continue his education and athletic career at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Turks (Inglewood) -- In two seasons as Inglewood's floor leader, Turks 
helped the Sentinels to a 50-14 record, two Bay League titles, a Southern 
Section crown and a 10-2 postseason mark. He didn't repeat as league MVP 
because of Pierce's emergence as a dominant force, but Turks received the 
secondary award of most outstanding player from coaches. Turks averaged 16 
points, nine assists and three steals, repeating as a member of the Division II 
team. He was MVP of the Pacific Open and named all-tournament at Pacific Shores 
and Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Willis (Mira Costa) -- Willis was named Ocean League most valuable 
player after leading the Mustangs to the title. Although not the favorite, Mira 
Costa lost only one league game by relying on the outside-inside combination of 
Willis and Phil Fonua, the team's 6-2, 265-pound junior center. Willis averaged 
21 points, six rebounds and four assists, and played a big role in the 
Mustangs' march to the Division II-A quarterfinals. The University of 
Hawaii-bound guard repeated as an All-Division II selection. BOYS' ASL-STAR

FOR THE KIDS; CHILDREN GET HELP MAKING INVENTIVE CONCEPTS PAY OFF; WORKSHOP 
WILL SHOW YOUNGSTERS HOW TO TAKE THEIR IDEAS AND TURN THEM INTO REALITY.

<P>
 The 6.8-magnitude earthquake that shook 11-year-old Kelly Allen's house made a 
mess of the kitchen, with shattered dishes and glasses littering the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, an idea "just popped into my head," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not make a special container for dishes so that they won't bang against 
each other or fall out of cupboards? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not indeed. Kids are just as capable of coming up with marketable 
inventions as adults, according to Alan Tratner, president of Canoga Park-based 
Inventors Workshop International. 
</P>
<P>
 Tratner, an inventor himself, is leading a workshop for budding young 
inventors April 23 at Moorpark Community Center. It's for kids 5 and older and 
runs from 10 a.m. to noon. The cost is $15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the session, kids (and parents and teachers too) will learn how to take 
their ideas and turn them into real inventions, Tratner said. As a group, the 
class will form a hypothetical company and brainstorm ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so far-fetched. Tratner probably will tell the group about some 
successful young inventors, such as Joshua White, who, at 8, devised a board 
game involving dinosaurs. Called "Dinomite," the game is being sold in toy 
stores around the world, and the Washington state youth is raking in the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Kelly Allen. Earlier this year, Tratner spoke at her 
Chatsworth school about inventions. Kelly talked to him about her earthquake 
idea, which she called "Safe Attack." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing led to another, and two weeks ago Kelly did a taped interview about 
her gizmo for "Good Morning America." (It was scheduled to air this week.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hot stuff -- kids inventing and being encouraged," Tratner said. Too 
often there is never any follow-through on kids' ideas, Tratner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with Kelly. She constructed a prototype of "Safe Attack" using odds and 
ends around the house. She designed it to be adjustable, with flaps and 
partitions, so that it would fit cupboards of all sizes. Her father, a 
machinist, helped. The final product, she surmises, would be made from molded 
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to patent it," she said. She thinks the idea will sell. Flashlights 
and other disaster supplies were selling briskly after the earthquake, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has even given "Safe Attack" a real-life test. The night before she 
appeared in Los Angeles for the television taping, she put the device on the 
kitchen counter and filled it with dishes. That night an aftershock rattled the 
house, but the dishes were OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Brainstorming ideas is nothing new for Kelly, a sixth-grader who wants to 
become a doctor. "My mom says I have an imaginative mind," she said. "I like to 
sit in my room and make things up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have a lot of good ideas," Tratner said. He should know. When he was 12, 
he designed a futuristic car that caught the attention of General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 His organization, formerly based in Camarillo, is 23 years old and has 23,000 
members who can get help with designing, patenting, building and marketing 
their ideas. The group's youth division, for kids under 16, has about 100 
members. A kids' membership costs $35 a year. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 What's new at the Santa Barbara Zoo? The new caracal exhibit. So you don't 
know what a caracal is? (It's a small cat, a close relative of the lynx and 
bobcat, with long, tufted, pointed ears.) 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo is also putting out a call for teen-agers who want to become 
counselors in-training for the zoo's summer camp for young children. Would-be 
counselors should be attending grades 7 through 12 next fall. 
</P>
<P>

JAUNTS; TRAINS, PLANES AND MOTORCYCLES IN THE SPOTLIGHT; SANTA PAULA FESTIVAL 
WILL PROVIDE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE EXCURSIONS AND INCLUDE A DISPLAY AT THE AIRPORT.

 Santa Paula will move back in time this weekend -- literally. The town is 
paying tribute to vintage transportation in a festive wingding called "Trains, 
Planes & Motorcycles." 
</P>
<P>
 You can take a ride on a restored passenger train, pulled by a steam 
locomotive built in 1906. If planes are more your speed, you can peruse the 
collection of antique aircraft at the Santa Paula Airport. Or, you can see the 
vintage motorcycle exhibit at the Santa Paula Union Oil Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by the Santa Paula Chamber of Commerce and the Santa 
Clara River Valley Railroad Historical Society, runs Saturday and Sunday, 
mostly in downtown Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 For kids who have never ridden a train or even seen a steam locomotive, it's a 
chance to climb aboard and explore the past. Short Line Enterprises, based in 
Fillmore, is firing up its vintage train for the event. These are the folks who 
supply the trains for the movie and television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday and Sunday the nine-car train is making five hourlong 
sightseeing runs from the downtown Santa Paula depot. The train goes halfway to 
Fillmore, through aromatic citrus fields, and then back to Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most gorgeous time of year to go -- it's so fragrant," said A.J. 
Farrar at Short Line Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ride, passengers can wander through the restored cars and glimpse 
the movie posters on the walls. One of the cars is a 1925 sleeper, complete 
with bedding, for anyone who wants to stretch out. A train buff will be on 
board the car, dressed as a porter, to provide some historical tidbits about 
the sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The train ride costs $12.50 for adults, $7.50 for kids 4-17 years; kids 3 and 
under ride free. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's thrills you want, walk over to the new motorcycle exhibit at the Santa 
Paula Union Oil Museum. There you'll find a small replica of a motorcycle 
racing track from the early years of racing. Perched on the side of the steeply 
banked wooden track is a vintage motorcycle and "rider." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is called "Splinter Road" and it's a tribute to the death-defying 
pioneers of early racing who risked their lives on the wooden velodromes where 
signs advertised "Neck to Neck with the Wall of Death!" According to the 
exhibit, these riders roared around the track, lap after lap, at speeds of more 
than 100 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Two rooms of the museum are devoted to the exhibit, sponsored by the city and 
Egan's Vintage Motorcycle of Santa Paula. Some 20 motorcycles are on display, 
including one old-timer, the Excelsior Auto Cycle, that operated with a leather 
strap rather than a chain, and a 1915 Harley Davidson Speed Roadster. 
</P>
<P>
 A gleaming 1929 restored Harley-Davidson is billed in advertising from that 
time as the fastest road model the company had ever made. Some bikes are fancy, 
like the one with a fringed seat and saddlebags. One rusty model lacking tires 
is still awaiting restoration. Another was used by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit includes old newspaper stories about motorcycle racing greats -- 
including a woman racer -- pictures, posters and advertisements. "Splinter 
Road" is on display through June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 From the downtown area you can take a shuttle over to the Santa Paula Airport 
where some 15 vintage airplanes will be on display on the taxi way. Docents 
will be on hand to talk about the classics, which include a 1925 Travelair 
biplane and a 1939 German training plane called a Brucker. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport, known as a hub for out-of-the-ordinary planes, you can get 
more than a look. For a fee, you can take a ride -- even a spin in an aerobatic 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula's Dana Elcar, who starred in the "MacGyver" television series, is 
the honorary chairman of the two-day event. Other goings-on include a farmers' 
market, classic car displays, street fair, walking tours, and a barbecue dinner 
and dance Saturday night. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Trains, Planes & Motorcycles," a two-day event featuring vintage 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Downtown Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Train tickets are $12.50 for adults, $7.50 for kids 4-17 years, and 
children 3 and under free. Saturday dinner and dance, $15. For ticket 
information, call 525-5561. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Train departures are 10 and 11:30 a.m., and 1, 2:30 and 4 p.m., from 
the depot, 10th and Santa Barbara streets.

FASHION; WOMEN CONTINUE TO SHOULDER BOLD PROFILE; THE FOAMY GARMENT PADS, 
CREATED IN THE '30S, ARE MORE THAN A DESIGN FLAIR. THEY HAVE BECOME A SYMBOL 
FOR FEMALE INDEPENDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In our midst are hidden persuaders. Born in the '30s, they ballooned to huge 
excesses in the next decade. Then, in a stunning defeat, they appeared to have 
been wiped from the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they were building strength for another onslaught. A generation later, 
they struck with a vengeance, and the cycle repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Will we ever be free from the influence of the shoulder pad? 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who fervently hope not, and cling tenaciously to the mounds of 
foam. Others see them as a blight on the fashion landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 These latter types are unaware of the pads' true mission, which is not an 
aesthetic one. Instead, they were created for: intimidation.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's true. When women reach for independence, the womanly silhouette 
expands with it -- in a sort of sartorial muscle flexing. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: When did the first shoulder mushroom out beyond the hip line? When 
women entered the work force. And, when was the well-documented sequel? Of 
course, it coincided with the dawn of power dressing in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 It works. Check out the shoulder pad poster woman: Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 The pads were in fact invented for Crawford by her designer at MGM, Adrian. 
And, if you read her biography, you will see that before she wore them, she was 
a very shy person. Afterward -- well, has there ever been a more intimidating 
woman than Ms. Crawford? 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why the fad spread so widely. In the '40s, women needed to look 
more or less like quarterbacks to go into industry -- their first offensive 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when robotesque shoulders peaked in the '80s, a new generation was in 
between them, making a statement for full equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Having experienced the padded look at least once, women have largely taken 
sides in what might be called the shoulder pad wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are passionate about shoulder pads, one way or the other," said Marie 
Miller, display manager at Mervyn's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Some grieve if the additions are left out of a garment; others rip out the 
smallest padding before taking a purchase home. 
</P>
<P>
 Adherents who are noticing less loft in this season's clothes can find 
satisfaction anyway -- through the portable shoulder pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Clingy foam pads can be added to garments that were denied them by a 
manufacturer. The accessories were pioneered eight years ago by Damin 
Industries of Burbank, and christened Stay-Put Pads. Millions of them have 
found their way to women's shoulders since. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of fashion whims, they remain in demand. "They go up a little bit 
here, they go down a little bit there; it's never a big fluctuation," said 
Rochelle Rhodes, Damin's marketing manager. "Women who like their shoulder 
pads, like 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 The company grosses over $3 million a year in pads, and offers 10 different 
models, including its largest, the two-inch wedge, a style we imagine would do 
Crawford proud. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Broadway in Thousand Oaks, we found two Stay-Put models, the one-inch 
wedge and the one-inch flapped dolman, which features an extension to go under 
bra straps for complete security. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are popular items, said salesclerk Kathryn Carr, who indicated almost all 
of them are bought by women too young to have experienced the first round of 
padding in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other retailers confirmed this. Although the look seems to have turned off 
senior customers for good, many younger women are enamored of the built-up 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love shoulder pads," said Miller at Mervyn's. "I have big hips, and it 
balances (my figure)." 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan of the look, Pat Mages of Thousand Oaks, a child-care worker for 
Conejo Valley schools, buys pads to add bulk to all of her clothes, including 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make you look like you're sitting up straight," she said, "and they give 
you a little bit of height." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, we took these comments with a grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 We noticed both women were outgoing, assertive types with challenging careers. 
They did not avoid confrontation; they stood their ground when asked the sort 
of odd personal questions most women do not normally face. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they had unmistakably larger-than-natural shoulders. It's a pattern we 
fashion investigators have seen repeated many times. An imposing profile, a 
bold stance. It never fails. 
</P>
<P>
 We rest our case.

SHOP TALK; GET THE LEAD OUT, BEFORE TAX MAN PENCILS YOU IN; IT'S THAT TIME 
AGAIN, AND HERE'S SOME PRICES ON THE THINGS YOU'LL NEED TO FINISH UP THOSE 
FORMS.

<P>
 Tomorrow, needless to say, is that deadline of deadlines. Tax Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course you're not worried. Oh, you may have put things off to the last 
minute again, but you feel pretty confident that you'll be pulling up to the 
post office well before midnight tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything will be fine -- assuming nothing goes wrong. Like your dog turns 
all of your pencils into chew toys? Or your last eraser shreds like confetti? 
Or you spill your last bottle of Liquid Paper? 
</P>
<P>
 Having your best interests at heart at this stressful time, we went shopping 
last week for some Tax Day Eve items. We went to Staples and The Office Mart in 
Ventura and to Walmart in Oxnard so that, if you find yourself in a supply 
emergency situation, you'll have some idea what's out there. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is out there? 
</P>
<P>
 Pencils: We're partial to the old Dixon Ticonderoga No. 2s. We found a box of 
a dozen for $1.59 at Staples and $1.56 at Office Mart. At Walmart we didn't see 
any Ticonderoga's, but they had Empire-Berol USA brand No. 2s at a dozen for 76 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pens: We went for Bic Round Stic model, black ink. A dozen were 79 cents at 
Staples and 85 cents at Office Mart. A package of 10 was 77 cents at Walmart. 
Interestingly, Walmart had this Bic model with blue ink for 77 cents, but with 
red ink for a dime more. Then again, you didn't really want your tax figures to 
be in the red, did you? 
</P>
<P>
 Correction supplies: If you're like us you are prone to making mistakes. We 
can usually find the Liquid Paper supplies with our eyes closed. An average 
6-ounce bottle of the standard white bond correction fluid was $1.10 at Office 
Mart and $1.28 at Walmart. At Staples, surprisingly, the white bond is not sold 
in individual bottles, but in packs of three, for $2.99. The store does have 
single bottles of Liquid Paper in blue, pink, canary yellow, green, and ivory 
at $1.17 each. 
</P>
<P>
 As for erasers, we went for the kind you stick on the end of your pencil, 
where the built-in eraser used to be before you wore it down correcting your 
many errors. A package of 12 Eberhard Faber brand Arrowhead erasers was 77 
cents at Staples. At Walmart, Pedigree brand cap erasers were five for 46 cents 
and 15 for 78 cents. Office Mart had individual Arrowhead erasers for 6 cents 
each (or 72 cents a dozen). 
</P>
<P>
 Ledgers: We're talking about those "analysis pads" that enable you to list 
expenses and earnings in easy-to-decipher column form. Thought it may be too 
late to use for this year's taxes, it wouldn't hurt to start compiling figures 
for next year. At Office Mart we found National Brand's Premium Analysis Pad, 
four columns, 11 by 8 1/2 inches, at $1.95 for a pad of 50 sheets. That same 
item was going for $3.63 for a two-pack (100 sheets) at Staples. Walmart had 
different brands and sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now quit sitting around and get to work.

 If it isn't happening yet, that colorful array of spring blooms in your flower 
beds will soon begin to wither. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to fret. It is time to plant annuals, those sun-loving, quick-growing 
flowers that bloom throughout the warm months and well into fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annuals bloom almost nonstop from the time you get them to close to seven 
months and more," said David Nichols, a nurseryman at Green Thumb International 
in Ventura. "You get incredible color -- longer than almost anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as you choose the right color flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers with more gentle, hues -- pinks, lavenders and the like -- are 
appropriate for the garden as long as it's shrouded by a marine layer or the 
sun is playing peekaboo with clouds. These softer colors, however, can pale in 
the stronger light of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is better to use flowers of a richer color when and where the sun is 
strong, said Stacy Stowe of Jasmine Nursery in Ojai. Marigolds, zinnias, 
nasturtiums and many others can provide the explosive reds and yellows, oranges 
and gold during sunny weather. 
</P>
<P>
 A plethora of annuals is available at area nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really gearing up," said Mike Handberg, a nurseryman at Garden Outlet 
in Simi Valley. "Everybody's got the bug to get out and plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Annuals are sold in various sizes and packages. Generally you'll find single 
four-inch plants that retail for $.79 to $1.29. A six-plant "jumbo pack" can 
run $2 to $3, depending on the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 With the four-inch size, Handberg said, you are paying for a more mature plant 
that is already blooming. "Jumbo pack plants are normally smaller and sometimes 
not showing color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also not too late to seed summertime flower beds. Seeding, of course, 
means a lot more work, but you won't be digging as deep into your wallet. If 
you have a large area to plant -- and want to do it on the cheap -- sowing 
seeds may just be the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquidity need not be a major concern, though: "One of the main advantages of 
annuals is that they're always on sale," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before making a plant purchase, the fastidious gardener may want to have a 
general color scheme worked out, thus avoiding a potential color clash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all in the eye of the beholder," Handberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 One trick to ensure that your palette of colors harmonizes is to splash in 
some white here and there to neutralize potential hot spots. White flower 
varieties include verbena and some petunias and zinnias. Ask the nursery staff 
to suggest other creamy-colored types. 
</P>
<P>
 You may also want to ask for help in selecting annuals of varying height. 
There are so many varieties -- low-lying types and those that stand more 
proudly -- there's no reason to have a one-dimensional flower bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The taller flowers should be planted toward the back -- so as not to obstruct 
the more dainty varieties -- but you can create a varied appeal by mixing it up 
a little. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual, though a short-lived specimen, performs extraordinarily well: It 
seeds, lives and dies all in one brief season. But they don't call them annuals 
for nothing -- you'll have to replace these plants each year. But you can 
expect them to bloom stunningly for months on end. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * PLANTING TIPS: Stacy Stowe of Jasmine Nursery offers these tips when 
planting annuals in your garden: 
</P>
<P>
 Feed annuals with an all-purpose fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay particular attention to watering when first planted. Moist soil is needed 
to establish roots before hot weather comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 Never over-water; soggy soil will inhibit root development. 
</P>
<P>
 For optimum, consistent blooming, you'll need to remove dead blossoms 
regularly. "You don't have to run out to your garden everyday to pick off dead 
buds," Nichols said. "But once a week will keep them in bloom."

CENTERPIECE: PURIFYING THE BODY AND SOUL; A NATIVE AMERICAN RITE OF 
SELF-DISCOVERY, CULMINATED IN A SWEAT LODGE CEREMONY, IS FINDING ITS WAY BACK 
TO THE OLD LANDS OF THE CHUMASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a cluster of ramshackle mobile homes on a gently sloping mesa, a bearded 
man senses a presence and looks up from a truck engine. Turning toward the 
mountains, he sees a young woman standing motionless at the trail head, a 
blanket draping her shoulders and weariness haunting her dark eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa's down," Roy says to Wolf, a wiry man with prominent cheekbones and 
braided hair. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two days and two nights, Lisa has been on a vision quest, a 
Native American rite of self-discovery conducted alone in the mountains without 
food or water. After returning to her home on the mesa, she finishes her ordeal 
with purification and prayer in a sweat lodge, then breaks the fast with washna 
, a mixture of corn, berries, string beef, chopped nuts and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, at a waterfall a quarter-mile away, a shirtless man named 
Bud shakes a rattle and chants: 
</P>
<P>
 Hinda u, hinda u, hinda u, hinda hey no whey . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ways of Native Americans are returning to the old lands. On the mesa of a 
private 100-acre enclave called Rancho Chorro Grande, drumbeats are once more 
piercing the stillness in the mountains of the Chumash. Riding a pan-Indian 
revival that has been building for 25 years across the nation as well as the 
county, Native Americans and others at Chorro Grande are bringing back ancient 
Indian rites, ceremonies and sweat lodges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a religion, it's a way of life," explains Anotka, who lives on 
the mesa. "Like that tree over there, I am trying to become what Grandfather 
intended." 
</P>
<P>
 Chorro Grande, once the launch-pad for high-class packhorse expeditions, is 
being transformed into a "Native American inter-tribal spiritual encampment," 
says Wolf, a 34-year-old Huron descendant who, along with Anotka, is one of the 
leaders at Chorro Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 From Mondays through Saturdays, the mesa is occupied by about 15 men, women 
and children living rent-free: Wolf and Lisa. Roy, Ken, Rick and Bud. Anotka 
and his family. Randy and Rain. Mardee and Cliff. Others come and go on their 
journey down the "Red Road," the Indian way. Infrequently, someone is asked to 
leave for breaking the ban on alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays, when the weather cooperates and California 33 is passable, Chorro 
Grande opens to the public for a traditional Indian sweat lodge ceremony, one 
of a handful estimated within the Greater Los Angeles area. Aside from 
attracting practicing Native Americans, the event at the ranch draws numerous 
city dwellers seeking to blend a day in the mountains with an attitude 
adjustment in the sweat lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free; donations in the form of practical items such as tools and 
clothing are appreciated. Participants bring a dish for the post-sweat feast -- 
the leftovers used to supplement weekday menus and feed the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mercedes and BMWs leave after sunset, life returns to normal. Or as 
normal as it gets at Chorro Grande. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ya ha o ha ah, o ha o ah, hay ah o hay ah . 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Lambert's soulful chant and the accompanying drumming by Rick Puhl 
resonate inside the community lodge, the main house on the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dogs have staked out a place by the hearth, where an oak-fueled fire 
radiates warmth and light into a great room with a 12-foot ceiling. A dozen 
stuffed chairs and a massive coffee table sit on a worn Persian rug. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert and Puhl, both in their 20s and alumni of Native American camps, 
continue to chant, beat drums and shake rattles. While Mardee Sprung 
occasionally leaves her pot of bubbling beef stew on the kitchen's wood stove 
and dances into the great room, throwing shadows on the walls, her husband, 
Cliff, reads the horse-racing page in a newspaper. Three or four others sit in 
semi-darkness, lulled by the fire, the staccato pounding and the sage 
smoldering on a small altar. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another Saturday night at Chorro Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment goes on for about 45 minutes, ended by the arrival of the 
beef stew. Appetites are ravenous, most of the men having spent a long morning 
splitting nearly a cord of oak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're poor, but we sure eat good," Puhl says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mardee corrects him. "We're not poor -- we just don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert leans back against an easy chair. "As long as I have something to eat 
and a warm place to sleep," he says, "the whole world is my playground." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for indoor plumbing at the community lodge, living conditions haven't 
improved much at Chorro Grande since the Chumash camped there centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The mesa is on Pine Mountain in Los Padres National Forest, 18 miles from the 
nearest telephone, mail drop and electrical outlet. A few of the men take jobs 
as carpenters or handymen, but getting down the mountain can be a problem: 
Wicked winters and malfunctioning autos often make the ranch a prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Although self-sufficiency is still only a dream for the current residents, 
they prefer a bare-bones existence and freedom over a conventional lifestyle in 
a confining urban setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reject going back to the city," Mardee says. 
</P>
<P>
 A 47-year-old flower-child cum grandmother, Mardee and her husband have been 
living in wilderness areas for 20 years, raising a family along the way. A 
recent convert to Native American traditions, Mardee says she has "not a drop 
of Indian blood but a respect for their ways." Seven years younger than his 
wife, Cliff is one-quarter Chickasaw and "the rest redneck," he says with a 
wink. For several years, they ran Pine Mountain Inn a few miles up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know the hardest part about living around here?" Cliff asks. "There ain't 
no 7-Eleven down the corner for a carton of cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sprungs take care of the lodge and live in a back bedroom with the only 
television on the mesa. Tied into a 20-foot outside antenna, the small 
black-and-white set operates on 12-volt car batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You preserve your power and see only what you really want to see," Mardee 
says. "Up here, we have to watch a lot of weather forecasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night winds up about 9:30 with another song. But not one you'd 
expect. While dead serious and respectful about their ceremonies, members of 
the tiny community still have a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 To the tune of the "Addams Family:" 
</P>
<P>
 Dum da da dum dum, da da dum da da, da da da da da, we're the Chorro Family . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of this would happen without Pardner Hicks, "our No. 1 dude," Cliff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks bought the ranch in 1977, using money from an inheritance. Opening 
Chorro Grande Pack Station in 1980, he and Tony Alvis escorted city slickers 
into the far reaches of Los Padres, becoming renowned as trail guides. But in 
1986, at the age of 31, Hicks abruptly terminated the business to embark on an 
esoteric -- and some would say quixotic -- academic quest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinated with indigenous cultures and anthropology since his student days at 
upscale and earthy Ojai Valley School, Hicks became obsessed with proving that 
humans originated in the New World. The theory was popular 100 years ago, but 
today's scientists overwhelmingly support the belief that Native Americans 
arrived in this hemisphere 11,500 years ago by migrating across the Bering land 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any formal training in anthropology, Hicks wrote and published 
research papers, attended scientific conventions and became phone pals with 
prominent scientists. Although the scientific community still rejects his 
maverick theory, he is encouraged by recent finds that, if confirmed, would 
push the arrival of man in the New World all the way back to 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of the ranch into a Native American cultural center was a 
natural progression for Hicks. In 1986, he began allowing Native Americans to 
hold sweat-lodge ceremonies. Intermittently since then, he has let Native 
Americans and others live for free on his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more to learn from sharing than I do from seeking simple monetary 
gain," says Hicks, a bachelor who lives in Shell Beach and visits the ranch 
several times a month, staying in the community lodge. If he had kept the mesa 
as his own private preserve, he says: "It would have been a loss. This way, I'm 
doing something good for a community of people." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody is on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics within the local Chumash community dismiss Chorro Grande as a 
"New Age" retreat, but their main complaint is that non-Chumash ceremonies have 
been conducted in Chumash territory without permission, a breach of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never go into someone's house and do anything you want without asking 
permission," says Kote Lotah, a Chumash doctor and priest who wears a slender 
bear bone through his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotah, 48, and some other local Chumash leaders, were angered last year when a 
Cheyenne Sun Dance renewal ceremony -- a test of fortitude and self-sacrifice 
that includes body piercing -- was held at Chorro Grande without their OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tribes all over California heard we allowed (the Sun Dance) to happen," says 
Lotah, who lives in Ventura. "We're taking the rap for these people who had no 
respect for our traditional ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks says he did contact several local Chumash but could not reach Lotah. 
Julie Tumamait of Ojai, whose late father was a leader among local Chumash, 
gave Hicks her blessings for the Sun Dance; so did an elder at the Chumash 
reservation in Santa Ynez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks believes his detractors should be more open-minded. "Look how many 
different kinds of churches there are in a town," he says. "Native Americans 
should support each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Dance incident has had an impact on Hicks, making him refine his 
vision for Chorro Grande. "We'll incorporate concepts of (all) Native American 
life and thought, but with respect for the Chumash as the traditional keepers 
of the land," he says. "We need to respect the Chumash first." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Buh waaaaaa .... buh waaaaaa.  
</P>
<P>
 Two blasts on a conch shell signal the start of the Sunday sweat lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweat-lodge area, near the bottom of the mesa, is marked by four upright 
poles indicating the four compass points. The larger of the two sweat lodges is 
a squat dome, 18 feet in diameter, with a frame made of bent willow poles. When 
the lodge is in use, the frame is covered with layers of blankets that black 
out all light. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the sweat lodges is a large altar nearly encircled by an earthen 
berm, with a fire pit in the middle. Roy Lytle, 44, is the fire starter, 
turning a stack of oak into a furnace capable of making lava stones glow. In 
Indian mythology, the stones represent the oldest objects on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceremony is about the wisdom they've collected over the centuries," says 
Wolf, who will lead the sweat. "The fire wakes up the stone people and they 
understand that the two-leggeds need them again." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 participants show up for the ceremony, including several neophytes. 
Spring and Debra, fortyish Valley residents, were attending a sunrise 
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting when someone mentioned the sweat lodge. Brigitte 
and Steve Ferry of North Hollywood heard about it from a friend of a friend at 
a Saturday night dinner party. Aware they would be exposed to a couple of hours 
of discomfort, none were intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at it as a healing, spiritual experience," Spring says. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony is divided into four rounds, each lasting 20 to 30 minutes. 
Mixing prayer, song, mystic symbolism and group therapy, each round has a 
theme: The first acknowledges the living, the second focuses on personal 
healing, the third on death, and the final round on "going home," greeting 
ancestors in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 With men wearing only shorts and most women in loose-fitting dresses, the 
participants duckwalk or crawl into the large sweat lodge, forming two circular 
rows around a shallow pit. Forty-two are allowed in at one time, the rest told 
to wait outside until someone drops out. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait isn't long. After the first round, the flap opens and a man leaves. 
He is a doctor of optometry taking part in his first sweat lodge. "It was 
incredible," he says. "You suffer, but there is good afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did he get out? "I like to do things in moderation," he says. "If I was 
starting an exercise (regimen), I'd do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the sweat lodge, the bare earth is soaked with perspiration and 
condensation. Jammed together, sitting cross-legged, the participants gulp 
fresh air and await the next round. Wolf, sprawled by the pit, calls out to Roy 
to bring in the stone people. Using a pitchfork, Roy delivers four red-hot 
rocks through the flap, which is then closed, bringing complete darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The stones quickly heat the dome, but not intolerably. Speaking in a voice as 
smooth as syrup, Wolf instructs, guides, prays. A drum and rattle are joined by 
songs. Several times, Wolf pours water on the stones, each spurt causing a 
hissing, popping sound and raising the air temperature to scorching intensity. 
Breathing hurts. More water. More pops. More heat and steam. People groan. 
Droplets of sweat from the unseen man in front of you trickle on your legs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final round, the singing and drumming and searing heat reach a 
crescendo simultaneously. Then it's over. Wolf asks that all the flaps be 
opened. Drinking water -- "a gift from the gods," -- is brought in. As a cool 
breeze washes over the participants, Wolf tells them to thank the wind for 
providing relief, then instructs them to exit the lodge by crawling single file 
across the now-muddy earth. On the way out, each must say o mitak we ah sa , 
which means "to all my relations," a way of making sure your prayers have 
included everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Steve Ferry looks as if he has just finished sprinting a marathon in 
the rain. "It was a good deal more rigorous than I expected," he gasps. "It's 
not like Beverly Hot Springs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ferry would do it again. "Anything grounded in earth religion I 
wholeheartedly support," he says. But the North Hollywood costume-maker also 
liked the spirituality of the ceremony. Praying for his nephew, who is 
diagnosed with leukemia, he came away "feeling positive." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Brigitte, also felt an emotional connection. "Listening to the 
feelings of the songs got me in touch with feelings I've been having," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigitte was impressed by Wolf's respect for the land. "I'd like to 
incorporate that in my life," she says. "But it's hard. I'm a city girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mancini, a 20-year-old student living in Santa Monica, enjoyed her first 
experience at Chorro Grande. Mancini, who grew up on a South Dakota Indian 
reservation, had worried about the authenticity of the Chorro ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you get a group of white people together who've read a book and 
think they can run a sweat lodge," she says. "But I was very happy with this. 
It was very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Spring was moved by her first sweat and the peaceful, gentle atmosphere at 
Chorro Grande. "Places like this are few and far between," she says. "It's to 
be cherished big-time." Sweat Lodge May Be Too Hot for Some 
</P>
<P>
 Taking part in a sweat lodge isn't for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely avoid it if you have heart problems," said Siegfried O. Storz, a 
Ventura cardiologist. "People with heart trouble don't deal with extremes very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in a sealed sweat lodge can reach an estimated 120 degrees or 
more. The high heat can lower blood pressure, making the sweat lodge 
potentially harmful for people with existing low blood pressure, Storz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking alcohol before entering a sweat lodge can compound potential 
problems, Storz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy young people don't have to worry in a sweat lodge, Storz said, but 
seniors "should check with their doctor if they have any questions."

<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, girls' high school basketball was played much like 
football. There was an offensive team and a defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a six-player game where each team had three players on offense and 
three on defense at opposite ends of the court. Players could not cross the 
midcourt line and offensive players could not take more than two dribbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' game has improved dramatically since 1969-70, the last time a 
six-player game was played in California, and so has the level of play. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to winning championship banners, area players are beginning to 
receive national recognition. For the second consecutive season, St. Bernard 
won a State Division IV title and its standout player, 6-foot-4 forward Olympia 
Scott, played in the nationally televised Kodak All-American game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the girls are becoming more athletic and have a greater sense of 
competitiveness," said Lori Pawinski, a former player and current coach at St. 
Bernard. "They play with greater ability and intensity. Girls' basketball is 
not identical to the boys' game because the girls are not as physical. But they 
are playing at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott leads the selections to The Times' 1994 Westside All-Star team for the 
third consecutive year. Yuriko Jung of Venice, Taryn Reynolds of Notre Dame 
Academy and Sherrise Smith of Crossroads are also repeat selections. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa 
Monica. Winners of the South Bay player and coach of the year awards will be 
announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Ginoza (University) -- One of the area's most versatile players, the 
5-foot-6 Ginoza played point guard, small forward and center during her three 
seasons at University. Her success came as a result of hard work and a 
persistent attitude, according to Coach Patricia Peisner. Ginoza averaged 10.4 
points and had a game-high 17 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Sternlight (Marlborough) -- The 5-11 forward catapulted into a 
starring role this season after replacing the graduated Kathleen Stewart. An 
excellent inside player, Sternlight averaged 15.5 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Codd (Palisades) -- Another good inside player, Codd led the Dolphins 
with averages of 12.7 points and 7.8 rebounds. She had a season-high 24 points 
and 12 rebounds against rival University and scored 19 points in back-to-back 
games against Fairfax and Los Angeles. Codd was Metro League co-player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Johnson (Hamilton) -- One of the top centers in the Coastal Conference, 
Johnson was known for her shot-blocking. Although she averaged only 5.5 points 
a game, her rebounding strength helped to contribute to the Yankees' scoring. 
She had 16 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three steals against Monroe 
in the first round of the City Section 3-A Division playoffs. Johnson was Metro 
League co-player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marte Alexander (St. Bernard) -- One of the top players in the Southern 
Section, the 6-4 Alexander has earned a scholarship to Arizona. Alexander, who 
transferred from Marlborough after her sophomore season, averaged 16 points and 
15 rebounds a game and had a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympia Scott (St. Bernard) -- The Stanford-bound senior will go down as one 
of the top all-around players and one of the best rebounders ever to compete in 
the Southern Section. A four-year starter, Scott averaged 18.8 points and 15 
rebounds a game. She was selected to the Kodak All-American team and to the 
All-Southern Section team. 
</P>
<P>
 Taryn Reynolds (Notre Dame Academy) -- The area's leading scorer, Reynolds 
averaged 24 points and seven rebounds. She has the speed to drive to the basket 
and the shooting range to make a three-point basket. Reynolds is only a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrise Smith (Crossroads) -- The 5-5 junior guard is often compared to 
Reynolds for her scoring ability and athleticism. Smith scored 452 points for 
an 18.8 average and is also an outstanding dribbler and defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuriko Jung (Venice) -- This 5-8 junior point guard rivals Smith as an 
offensive threat. Jung can single-handedly beat a press with her dribbling and 
break down a zone defense with her outside shooting. She helped Venice go 
undefeated in the Western League. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamila Locke (Venice) -- Locke was a key player inside for Venice, averaging 
averaged 13 points and eight rebounds. Locke compensated for her lack of height 
against taller players with speed and an aggressive playing style. GIRLS'

RESTAURANT REVIEW; EATERY ADDS GREEK SPECIALTIES TO ITS MIX OF FRESH FISH 
DISHES; GRILLED OR FRIED, THE WELL-PRICED SERVINGS COME WITH TARAMA SALAD, 
ORZU, PITA BREAD OR SPINACH SPANAKOPITA.

 At one edge of the Oakbrook Mall, this small fish diner has given itself a 
name that almost succeeds in telling it like it is. Pacific Fresh Grill 
features mostly fresh fish, mostly from the waters of the Pacific and mostly 
grilled -- unless you order it fried. There are also goodly Greek undercurrents 
to the restaurant, and these are some of the best reasons to eat here. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Fresh Grill doesn't attempt to camouflage its shopping center 
location. The restaurant is brightly lit, utilitarian and pleasantly spotless. 
The color scheme echoes the dazzling whites and lapis lazuli of the Aegean 
Island travel posters that decorate the walls. It also evokes blue skies and 
fresh air, though the actual air inside provides some sensory overload from 
heavy duty frying. Not unpleasant by any means, but it did make me want to open 
up a window. 
</P>
<P>
 They do know how to fry food properly here. And for less than $5, you can get 
a decent plate of fried fish on a bed of "chips" (thick French fries), with a 
side of coleslaw. The coleslaw is concocted from a mixture of lettuces and 
cabbages, sloppy and sweet and not at all boring. A fish and shrimp combination 
was moist where it was supposed to be and crisp in the right places too. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend the tarama salad (taramasalata), a Greek specialty made from 
tarama (pale orange carp roe) whipped together with soaked bread, olive oil and 
lemon juice to a creamy smooth consistency and tantalizing flavor. Though quite 
salty, it was delicious. As an appetizer it comes laced with sliced onions, 
green peppers and Greek olives, served with toasted triangles of buttered pita 
bread. Save some to use as a condiment on the fish; it's even better than 
tartar sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good selection of nearly a dozen kinds of fish, seared on the grill 
and served with your choices of green salad, coleslaw, French fries, rice 
pilaf, vegetables (quite good) and orzu, those tiny pasta shaped like grains of 
rice. Prices range quite reasonably between $5 and $7 for a satisfying meal. We 
tried both an excellent sea bass and a tasty fileted trout, as fresh as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Crab and shrimp salad was a disappointment, though there was no skimping on 
the lettuce. The shrimp were tiny, too pink and soft, and the crab seemed dry. 
The Greek salad was much better. Also Gargantuan, it arrived under a sea of 
crumbled feta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you are partial to Spam, which it most resembled, the chicken gyro is 
to be avoided. But fish quesadillas ($4.75), one of the specialties, were 
appealing, made from small chunks of grilled fish ("this and that," I was 
told), with just enough cheese to hold it all together within a hot flour 
tortilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean plate ($6.10) is worth ordering. It comes with the delicious 
taramasalata, tender grilled chicken on a skewer, delectable orzu, a portion of 
crispy, flaky, spinach spanakopita and hot, tasty pita bread. Yummy. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant serves breakfast on the weekends, offering standards like 
omelets and French toast and bacon and eggs. On weekday afternoons the kids 
from the school down the block suddenly appear on skateboards outside the 
windows, like mushrooms after a damp night. They are attracted perhaps by the 
smooth asphalt and lack of traffic, but there may also be something 
irresistible to their young hormones in the smell of good fried food. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides yogurt and ice cream, one other dessert polishes up the meal: a fine 
baklava ($1.50), made almost entirely with chewy chopped nuts and 
quasi-crystallized honey. Another Greek-inspired victory. Details

 Frank DePanise, most recently one of the chefs at the Ojai Valley Inn and 
Country Club, took over last week as the main chef of the Shoals Restaurant at 
Ventura's Cliff House Inn. And some major changes are in store. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy (Thierry Bregeon) who was here before was a little into old-style 
California cuisine," said the 36-year-old DePanise. "I'm doing something a 
little more rustic, a little more ethnic. I worked at Allegro's in Santa 
Barbara and we did Mediterranean things, dishes from Morocco, Spain, Greece, 
Italy, France. I'm going to bring some of that here, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 DePanise, who also worked at Norbert's Restaurant and Brigitte's in Santa 
Barbara, said to expect the menu to continue to change regularly, as it did 
before his arrival. Also expect some of the same standard items to be included 
on it. "There will always be two or three fresh fish and meat dishes, some 
pasta and vegetable dishes," he said. "But I'm going to stay away from heavier 
sauces and creams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shoals is located at 6602 W. Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to former Shoals chef Bregeon? He's now at La Cumbre Country 
Club in Santa Barbara. And as for the Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club, 
restaurant manager Linda Medd said DePanise has not been replaced. 
</P>

 More than 15,000 people are expected at the three-day "Taste of Ventura 
County" food and wine festival, beginning Friday at Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen restaurants in the county -- including La Dolce Vita, Capistrano's, 
The Whale's Tail, and Yasmeen's -- plus an ice cream shop and the Oxnard 
Farmers' Market, will sell sample-size food servings for $1 to $5. Four 
wineries and the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf will have booths set up for 
thirst-quenching purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can literally go to six or seven restaurants, depending on how hungry 
they are," said Susan O'Brien, executive director of the Channel Island Harbor 
Assn. of Lessees, the event organizer. "There's a good cross-section -- 
everything from steakhouses, to Indian restaurants, to Greek restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival hours are 5 to 11 p.m. Friday, noon to 11 p.m. Saturday, and 11 a.m. 
to 8 p.m. Sunday, with musical entertainment throughout. Admission is $6 for 
adults, $3 for military personnel and persons 55 and older, and free for 
children under age 12.

STUDY DOWNPLAYS COST OF AIDS TO EMPLOYERS; WORKPLACE: REPORT SAYS THE AVERAGE 
TAB IS $17,000 AND THAT MOST OF THE ULTIMATE EXPENSE IS BORNE BY THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Workers with the AIDS virus cost their employers far less in medical and other 
expenses than is commonly believed. The average patient's tab amounts to 
$17,000, a new report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Farnham, a Georgia State University health economist who was a co-author 
of the study, said many employers have been misled by estimates of medical 
costs related to HIV and AIDS. The purpose of the study was to develop an 
economic model for estimating "the expected costs that a typical large company 
would incur over a five-year period." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal researchers have pegged the average lifetime medical bill of a person 
with the human immunodeficiency virus at between $85,000 and about $120,000. 
But Farnham contends that some employers familiar with the estimates mistakenly 
believe they will bear most of that cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this perception that AIDS is completely different, much more 
expensive and has a much greater economic impact" than other catastrophic 
illnesses, Farnham said. Compared to diseases such as cancer, acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome "is in the low mid-range in terms of overall costs to 
society," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, in part, was aimed at employers who have cut off benefits or fired 
workers with the AIDS virus -- a theme portrayed in the movie "Philadelphia," 
in which Tom Hanks portrays a lawyer who is fired after his firm learns he has 
the AIDS virus. Although they are protected under the federal Americans With 
Disabilities Act, AIDS groups say workers often face discrimination on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In one widely cited case, a Houston music store slashed its medical coverage 
for AIDS after one of its employees developed AIDS-related pneumonia -- in 
effect, cutting off his benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Shepherd Smith Jr., executive director of the Washington-based Americans 
for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, said small businesses tend to have the greatest 
concerns about the impact of AIDS on their workplaces. They often have skimpier 
medical coverage and may risk cancellation of their insurance policies or huge 
premium increases if an employee develops a serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were the result of three years of research Farnham undertook with 
co-author Robin Gorsky, an associate professor at the University of New 
Hampshire's School of Health and Human Services. The study was done under the 
auspices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was warmly received by AIDS education advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It dispels some of the myths about HIV, including the idea that it is a 
bottomless pit of costs for employers," said Patrick May, a spokesman for the 
National Leadership Coalition on AIDS, an education group backed by business 
and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred J. Hellinger, a leading AIDS health care expert for the federal 
government, has estimated that the medical costs of treating someone infected 
with HIV averages $119,000, taking into account the entire period from the time 
the virus is contracted until the patient dies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hellinger backed the findings of the study. He said most of the medical 
costs are picked up not by employers, but by taxpayers. He explained that the 
highest medical expenses come in the last months of the patient's life, usually 
after the patient has left work and is no longer covered by the company's 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a manageable problem for most employers," Hellinger said. "It's a public 
burden at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, contended that many employers continue to incur significant 
costs in the form of premiums for medical and disability coverage of employees 
in the late stages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Klein, executive director of the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare 
Plans, an employer trade group, said the costs to employers may be understated 
in the report because of the time period it covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts noted that two-thirds of the HIV-infected workers in the study had not 
yet developed full AIDS. The study tracked workers over a five-year period, 
ending between nine and 10 years after they contracted the AIDS virus. Federal 
authorities say most people with HIV, on average, don't develop full AIDS until 
10 years after they become infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 In another recent study, researchers in San Francisco reported that people 
with the AIDS virus are living about a year longer than those who were infected 
a decade ago, largely because of successful treatment of AIDS-related 
pneumonia.

HEDGE LOSSES CALLED LOW RISK TO BANKS; FINANCE: REGULATORS SAY THAT DESPITE 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOST IN MARKET PLUNGES, THE HIGH-RISK FUNDS POSE NO 
IMMEDIATE THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High-risk hedge funds, which suffered billions of dollars in losses during the 
recent stock and bond market plunges, pose no immediate threat to the health of 
the nation's banking system or securities firms, federal regulators said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank exposure -- either through investing in or lending to the funds -- is 
very limited, said Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and Federal 
Reserve Board Gov. John P. LaWare. Only eight national banks have any financial 
exposure to the funds, with loans or credits totaling $1.04 billion, Ludwig 
told a hearing of the House Banking Committee. He said he has stationed at 
those eight banks full-time staff members who track the banks' level of risk 
and review market-related activities at least weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the regulators' assertions are true, that's good news for taxpayers, who 
would foot the bill for bank failures stemming from exposure to hedge fund 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawmakers and market experts nonetheless say the risks are high that 
individual companies, pension funds or mutual funds could report losses from 
the use of hedge funds and so-called derivatives. Those losses in turn could 
hurt individual investors and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reassurances of the banking regulators that hedge funds are not a 
problem, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said he is 
still worried about the potential for federally insured institutions to take 
big financial risks that could hurt their profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress and the regulators must develop "supervisory strategies to control 
the risks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedge funds -- which operate privately without regulation and use borrowed 
money to speculate in stocks, bonds and currencies -- aim for extraordinary 
profits.  
</P>
<P>
 They often make heavy use of derivatives -- investment instruments derived 
from the prices of assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. 
Derivatives provide an opportunity for big profits -- or big losses -- through 
the use of leverage, in which comparatively little money can control a much 
larger investment. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Askin Capital Management, a New York firm with money from 
wealthy, private investors, was wiped out recently after losing $600 million 
trading in bonds backed by mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund apparently borrowed $2.50 for every dollar invested, and when the 
value of the assets declined rapidly, it was necessary to sell holdings at a 
loss to meet margin calls, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur 
Levitt Jr. said. (Margin calls require that investors pay additional money to 
make up for the decreased value of stocks or bonds they acquired by borrowing.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, losses to broker dealers who provided funds "were not significant in 
relation to firm or industry capital," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt said he has asked the hedge funds to provide information on their 
owners, investments, borrowing and trading activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's LaWare said the recent decline in stocks and bonds reflected more an 
easing of an overly hot market than a panic selloff. "It seems clear that the 
rumors of widespread margin calls by lenders to hedge funds were exaggerated," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hedge fund operator, international financier George Soros, told 
the committee that the recent market decline was "a healthy correction for the 
industry." He said his $10-billion fund probably represents about 15% of the 
total hedge fund business. "There has been a boom in hedge funds, and with 
every boom there is a danger of excess," Soros said. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that his fund makes comparatively little use of derivatives and 
instead trades directly in stocks, bonds and currencies.

MORE COMPANIES, FUNDS MAY TAKE HITS FROM DERIVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many U.S. companies, pension funds and mutual funds may be exposed to losses 
similar to those suffered by Procter & Gamble Co. in the exotic market for 
so-called derivatives, financial analysts said Wednesday. Such losses could in 
turn affect the savings of millions of small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of derivatives has grown sharply in the last few years, as they have been 
marketed to otherwise conservative institutional investors as a means of 
protecting against adverse changes in financial or commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, pension funds holding foreign stocks use derivatives to limit their 
potential losses from currency fluctuations. Mutual funds have used them to put 
huge sums of money to work quickly without having to make sudden large 
purchases of stocks or bonds. And corporate treasurers use them to manage their 
costs of raw materials and credit. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers ranging from investment counselors to bankers are growing more 
alarmed that the increasing complexity of these instruments far outstrips the 
ability of corporate and investment managers to understand and control them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives do test the skills of portfolio managers in ways that are very 
new," said William McBride, an analyst of international investments at Lipper 
Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are financial instruments tied to, or "derived" from, conventional 
instruments or securities such as stocks, bonds or commodities. A futures 
contract on pork bellies, for example, is a derivative based on the price of 
raw bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble on Tuesday became the latest of a growing number of 
corporations to disclose losses from derivatives trading when it said it would 
take a $102-million after-tax charge to close out two swap contracts tied to 
movements in U.S. and German interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The swaps were evidently designed for Procter & Gamble by Bankers Trust Co. as 
bets that rates in both countries would fall; instead American rates shot up, 
and German rates have fallen more slowly than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are bracing for similar announcements from other companies that may 
have seen their exotic hedging strategies fail because of this year's extreme 
volatility in the financial markets. No adequate figures exist, however, on 
corporate America's exposure to such risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, derivatives have been only for the hardiest and most 
venturesome individual investors. In recent years, however, banks and 
investment houses have begun marketing them to institutional investors as 
hedges against the inherent risks in interest rate changes and other market 
moves.  
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, these programs have worked as intended. But the markets' 
recent volatility has made hedging strategies more difficult and costly to 
maintain. And some of the biggest losses have afflicted investors who changed 
from hedging to speculating. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to the extent that corporations or pension or mutual funds incur losses, 
so will their shareholders, beneficiaries and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McBride, most stock mutual funds -- including those aimed at 
conservative small investors -- have rewritten their bylaws to allow them to 
trade derivatives, if only modestly. As pension funds have begun to diversify 
into overseas markets, they have found they need to hedge against the U.S. 
dollar's strengthening in relation to foreign currencies -- a trend that 
reduces the relative value of foreign securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey division of investing, which manages that state's $35 billion 
in public pension funds, today has about 10% of its assets in foreign 
investments, and hedges 40% to 60% of that sum in the derivatives market 
against adverse currency moves, according to Roland Machold, its director. Many 
other public funds do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 One troublesome trend may be the one reflected in Procter & Gamble's 
announcement: the trading of derivatives by corporations whose managers are not 
investment pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what happens when a chief financial officer turns himself into an 
investor and not just a manager of corporate cash flow and capital," McBride 
said. "These mistakes are somewhat the result of hubris." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers who lend to such companies are unnerved by the prospect that their 
corporate borrowers' credit-worthiness may depend not on sales and profits, 
which they can measure, but on exotic trading that may be beyond the 
comprehension of even corporate managements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weakness that shows up again and again is in control structures," said 
Terry Watson, head of trading credit administration at BankAmerica Corp. 
Indeed, Procter & Gamble Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said in a statement Tuesday 
that "derivatives like these are dangerous, and we were badly burned."

TRYING TO PULL THE PLUG; BIG OIL COMPANIES SPONSOR EFFORTS TO CURTAIL ELECTRIC, 
NATURAL GAS CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As California presses ahead with its rule forcing auto makers to sell 
cleaner-fueled vehicles, including a virtual mandate to sell electric cars 
beginning in 1998, big oil companies have been largely silent. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the companies have found their voice -- or, more accurately, the voice 
of others -- by quietly bankrolling what on its face appears to be a 
grass-roots campaign against $600 million in proposed utility investments in 
alternative-vehicle support systems. 
</P>
<P>
 A new group called Californians Against Utility Company Abuse -- run by 
Woodward & McDowell, a high-powered Burlingame, Calif.-based public relations 
firm -- gathered petitions and demonstrated Wednesday in front of a regional 
office of Southern California Gas Co. The group also recently mailed a letter 
to 200,000 utility ratepayers statewide. It does not mention oil industry 
support in its literature. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a freshly forged coalition of the utilities, labor and 
environmental groups is angrily burning up fax machines across the state, 
labeling the tactics of its opponents a "dirty trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the debate over alternative-fuel vehicles has focused on efforts by 
the Big Three auto makers to weaken or delay the state's mandate for 
introducing electric cars by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 But many proponents are now convinced that the mandate will be upheld by the 
California Air Resources Board next month, citing the as-yet-unwavering support 
of Gov. Pete Wilson's administration, as well as a final report by the ARB 
staff, expected to be released later this week, that proponents say will 
confirm that the technology will be there to meet the 1998 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil-company-funded letter urges taxpayers to send accompanying postcards 
to their state legislators in support of two bills designed to curtail utility 
company plans currently before the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Required by state law, these are plans by the gas and electric utilities to 
promote the use of natural gas and electric fuel. The utilities propose to 
spend the money -- charged to ratepayers, not shareholders -- on public 
refueling stations, rebates for car buyers and other infrastructure support for 
the new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that this amounts to a subsidy by ratepayers of 
alternative-fuel vehicles that will benefit only the few who can afford to buy 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailing cites two prominent consumer groups -- Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization and Utility Consumers Action Network -- as well as the California 
Business Alliance and other business groups as supporters. But it does not 
mention that the effort is almost entirely funded by the Western States 
Petroleum Assn., which represents oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Air Alliance, a new parallel group that presents technical and 
economic arguments against electric cars, is also funded primarily by the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly our money," said Douglas F. Henderson, executive director of the 
Western States Petroleum Assn., based in Glendale, who added that he did not 
have a figure for how much money the association has put into the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there's a far better alternative" to mandating use of alternative 
fuels, Henderson said, "and that's the use of our products. . . . And you may 
think that's selfish, but our industry is spending $5 billion in California 
alone to upgrade our refineries to supply the new generation of gasoline, which 
is a very clean alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All gasoline sold in the state as of next January must meet federal standards 
for cleaner-burning, so-called reformulated gasoline. The state's much stricter 
reformulated blend must be used beginning in March, 1996. The oil companies 
have long argued that reformulated gasolines and improved auto engines can meet 
air pollution emission standards without the need to resort to electric and 
natural gas cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to ratepayers, TURN Executive Director Audrie Krause and Howard 
R. Owens, legislative director of the Congress of California Seniors, call the 
utilities' request a "hidden tax on your gas and electric bill" and urge that 
fellow taxpayers "join California consumers, seniors, business and farmers in 
this ratepayer revolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Krause and Owens urge support for SB 1819, introduced by state Sen. David 
Kelley (R-San Diego) and AB 3239 by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). 
Krause says TURN and the oil companies just happen to be on the same side in 
this dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kelley bill is TURN's bill," Krause said. "We wrote it, we sponsored it 
and the oil industry chose to support it. We didn't come to them. They came to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The new group on the other side of the issue -- Santa Monica-based 
Californians for Jobs and Clean Air -- represents the utilities, environmental 
groups and businesses entering the advanced-transportation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That the oil companies are starting what they call a grass-roots effort . . . 
makes me feel the most positive yet that electric vehicles are really going to 
happen," said Diane O. Wittenberg, manager of electric transportation at 
Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg said the new oil industry-consumer coalition is not only unfairly 
secretive but misrepresents the benefits of the utilities' plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are electric and natural gas cars necessary to meet clean-air goals, 
she says, but in a future substantial shift from gasoline to electricity as a 
transportation fuel, ratepayers would actually save because the costs of the 
utility infrastructure would be spread over a larger customer base. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Edison estimates that in coming decades, a 20% to 30% market 
penetration by electric cars could save ratepayers as much as $11 on their 
monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the secrecy, Henderson of the oil trade group admits that "people are 
often more willing to join hands with a coalition than they are to join hands 
with the petroleum industry, and that's fine. . . . We're not ashamed of it at 
all." Ever-Cleaner California Cars 
</P>
<P>
 As part of California's requirement to meet federal clean-air health 
standards, the state Air Resources Board in 1990 adopted a plan to dramatically 
lower emissions from vehicles, which are estimated to cause more than 70% of 
the state's air pollution. The plan, currently under review, mandates a 
potentially wide-ranging shift of vehicles and fuels between 1998 and 2003.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WHY THE CLIPPER'S NOT LIKELY TO CHIP AWAY AT 
PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

 J GVD BOSF BEUI JUZP VTIP VMEX PSLG PSUI FOTB . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . or maybe you shouldn't. But there should be no doubt that the Clinton 
Administration's confused Clipper chip initiative threatens to turn every 
American who cares about privacy into a practicing digital cryptographer. Which 
may very well be a good thing, but perhaps not in quite the way this 
Administration intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Some background: One year ago, President Clinton signed an executive order 
that authorized the creation of an optional federal standard for secure voice 
and data communications. Rather than go with a commercially available 
encryption scheme, the government chose to use one effectively developed by the 
National Security Agency (America's Capital of Cryptanalysis). 
</P>
<P>
 A specially designed silicon chip called Clipper would be the tool to encrypt 
and decode these communications. Clipper would ultimately be built into the 
telephones the government procured. Hey, why shouldn't the government have 
secure internal communications? 
</P>
<P>
 But creating a new encryption standard for federal use apparently didn't go 
far enough. The feds -- aggressively encouraged by the national security and 
law enforcement communities -- agreed to market Clipper as an alternate 
encryption standard and an essential high-tech ingredient in the global War 
Against Crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The NSA, the Justice Department and the FBI have publicly encouraged global 
corporations, such as banks, to adopt Clipper as their own encryption standard. 
To absolutely, positively assure that no one in the government would ever 
improperly eavesdrop on Clipper-ized conversations -- that could never happen, 
could it? -- the Administration offered an elaborate scheme of safeguards 
whereby law enforcement officers who managed to get a warrant would have to go 
to two separate agencies to get the software keys to unlock the relevant 
Clipper code. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, the civil libertarians have gone ballistic over this effort 
by the government to build an infrastructure that technologically empowers it 
to more easily listen in on human-to-human and computer-to-computer 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of private companies have voiced their opposition to the Clipper 
proposal (which, a harried spokeswoman for the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology swears up, down and sideways, is really "optional, optional, 
optional!" ). Essentially, the public relations campaign for Clipper has been 
about as intelligently handled as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the vital issues of privacy and civil liberties aside, however, and, on 
purely pragmatic terms, the Clipper initiative seems to have been put together 
by people who behave as if they have no understanding of privacy, technology or 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Clipper chip seems destined to produce exactly the opposite 
effect of what was intended. Instead of creating an encryption standard that 
gives the government a fighting chance for successful eavesdropping, the feds 
have encouraged the creation of an encryption market to bypass the threat of 
government decryption. 
</P>
<P>
 Put it this way: Suppose the government issued you very strong locks to 
protect your home against intrusion. Now suppose the government could get the 
keys to those locks only with a very special warrant. If you could buy your own 
powerful locks or alarm system for just a few extra dollars, would you do it? 
That's the question confronting individuals and organizations who fear for 
their telecommunications privacy today. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, you can go on the Internet and, at no cost, get an encryption 
scheme called PGP (for Pretty Good Privacy) to protect your electronic mail. By 
the end of this year, predicts PGP creator Philip Zimmerman, people will be 
able to participate in scrambled voice communications using their personal 
computers as encryption boxes, for far less than the cost of a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 You can expect to see cryptography activists posting freeware or shareware 
versions of their algorithms in the ongoing battle to assure truly private 
communications in the face of government standards. Who knows? Maybe Mitch 
Kapor's Electronic Frontier Foundation or the Markle Foundation will fund such 
privacy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, unless the government actually makes such private encryption illegal, 
Clipper is going to foment entrepreneurial digital cryptographers feeding off 
the paranoid fantasies of individuals and institutions that fear their 
communications might be compromised by Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the slogan "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will have 
cryptography" ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
 As an internal government standard, Clipper is fine. But without regulating 
commercial cryptography, the Clipper chip is a wasteful, impotent policy 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 The economics of digital cryptography mean the marginal cost of providing 
powerful encryption is going down even as the government tries to seduce -- or 
require -- people to use its proffered standard. Clipper is economically 
obsolete even as you read this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is so obvious to people in the cryptographic community that they hardly 
discuss it. But the fact is that digital cryptography has proliferated to the 
point where Clipper is likely to be more of a catalyst for innovation than an 
effective weapon against criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 People truly concerned about government eavesdropping -- global drug dealers, 
organized crime, hedge fund managers, munitions makers, etc. -- are precisely 
the sort who would be willing to pay a few hundred extra dollars to buy 
encryption software that foils or bypasses a Clipper chip. Talk with people in 
law enforcement about the bypass option and they have no real response 
(although they are fond of pointing out how stupid criminals can be when 
talking on the phone). 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there is a thriving market in commercial cryptography, Clipper is 
unlikely to be a threat to our privacy or our criminals. It is, however, a 
definite threat to our respect for the government technocrats who craft public 
policies that treat our privacy and our technology marketplaces with a mix of 
such seeming ignorance and contempt.

NEW STATE STANDARDS FOR PLUMS CRITICIZED BY CONSUMER GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Food and Agriculture on Wednesday announced 
marketing orders for plums, which consumer advocates said would result in 
tighter supplies and higher prices for the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing order gives a state-appointed committee of plum farmers the 
right to set appearance standards for the fruit. Plums not meeting the 
standards -- those with a spot of sunburn, for example -- cannot be legally 
sold, though they are edible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the marketing order applies only to shipments of California-grown 
plums, its impact reaches beyond the state, as California accounts for 88% of 
U.S. plum production. California plum sales topped $63 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Influential plum growers have argued that marketing orders are needed to keep 
unripe fruit off the market. They said sales suffer when consumers disappointed 
by poor-quality plums refuse to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates and a minority of plum growers say few growers sell unripe 
fruit. They contend marketing orders are mechanisms for controlling the price 
and supply of plums, at the expense of consumers and competitors who want to 
sell less-than-perfect-looking fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no other industry where groups of competitors are allowed to 
dictate to everyone else how much they can sell and what consumers will have 
access to," said plum grower Dan Gerawan, who two years ago ran afoul of 
federal marketing orders barring sale of undersized nectarines and peaches. "It 
is like McDonald's and Taco Bell getting together to decide Burger King's 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates have argued that beauty standards for plums may mean that 
up to 10% of the crop will be destroyed every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers probably won't see much of an impact immediately, given the 
controversy over the marketing orders, said Harry Snyder, co-director of the 
West Coast office of Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer 
Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably too smart to limit the amount getting to consumers this 
year," he said. "In future years, farmers and handlers and packing houses will 
decide what kind of plums we can get and how we can get them. It will result in 
higher prices, less choice and destruction of edible fruit.' 
</P>
<P>
 Plum marketing orders in California have a tangled history. Federal marketing 
orders for plums were lifted in 1991 amid charges of favoritism on the part of 
the committee of plum growers administering them. In a 4-year-old federal 
lawsuit still pending, four large plum growers allege that the committee 
manipulated the "color standards" to keep their competitors' fruit off the 
market. Farmers on the committee deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor plum seasons led some farmers to seek reinstatement of marketing orders. 
The push for state marketing orders in turn inspired state legislation 
outlawing the orders, now before the Assembly Agriculture Committee. It is 
supported by Consumers Union and opposed by many agricultural groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Enns, a plum grower and proponent of the state marketing order, said 
color is one element of the new appearance standards. He said the new standards 
would have two tiers, rather than one under the old federal marketing order. 
This would allow farmers to sell plums not meeting the highest level for 
appearance standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Enns estimated that three-quarters of plums sold by California farmers already 
meet the highest standard, known as California well-mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Enns said he didn't know whether the marketing orders would affect consumer 
prices. "There are so many variables involved in what a supermarket charges," 
he said.

TRUCKING STRIKE HAS NON-UNION DRIVERS BUSY; LABOR: WHILE DELIVERY DELAYS AND 
CUSTOMER FRUSTRATION GROW, THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF A TEAMSTERS AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ and GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's trucking system has begun to feel the strain of the week-old 
Teamsters strike, as some non-union firms Wednesday said they are being 
overwhelmed with orders and customers are experiencing more frequent and 
lengthy delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are maxed out," said Jeff Jordan, a spokesman for Overnite Transportation 
Co., a non-union trucking company based in Richmond, Va. "More of our terminals 
are approaching gridlock simply because there is so much moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Overnite's shipments are running two or three days late as customers shift 
away from the 20 trucking companies now struck by about 70,000 Teamsters. "We 
are trying to accommodate our customers as best we can," Jordan said. "That's 
getting harder and harder to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A doubling of orders in the past week has led Superior Fast Freight of 
Irwindale to hire 17 additional drivers and 10 more terminal dock workers, said 
President Richard Castro, whose company operates with non-union workers in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still growing," said Castro of shipping volume. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While delays and customer frustration grow, there are no signs that the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Truck Management Inc., which 
represents the trucking firms' labor negotiations, are anywhere near a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations broke down March 31 over the companies' proposal to expand the 
number of part-time workers in their terminals, make greater use of railroads 
and use binding arbitration to settle contract grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike originally was called against 22 trucking firms, but one firm has 
since closed and another agreed to negotiate with the Teamsters separately. 
Three other firms have also asked for interim agreements with the union, but 
the Teamsters have yet to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers large and small have adjusted their deliveries to deal with the 
strike. For example, Pivot Rules, a New York-based casual apparel producer, 
found alternative carriers along the West Coast -- United Parcel Service among 
them -- to serve its Seattle warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike will lead to some inventory shortages at many smaller retail stores 
if it extends into next week because many retailers order products every two 
weeks, said John Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business 
United, a Washington-based trade association with 6,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been limited impact at this point, but the strike would have greater 
impact over time," Galles said. "If it continues, the little guy -- the small 
retailer -- will be hurt most, and that's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Galles said owners of auto parts shops and small furniture stores would be 
most affected.

 Lockheed Missile Unit Plans More Job Cuts: The company's missiles and space 
group in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it will eliminate another 600 jobs by midyear 
in response to continuing declines in Pentagon spending. The division, which 
has cut 800 positions since Jan. 1, also said it will probably reduce its work 
force by an additional 1,500 jobs in the second half of 1994. The division, 
part of Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp., currently employs 16,750 and has not 
yet decided how the reductions will be divided between layoffs and attrition, a 
spokesman said.

PRICES, SALES EDGE UP, EASING FEARS OF INFLATION; ECONOMY: ANNUAL RATE FOR THE 
FIRST QUARTER IS 2.5%, DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Consumer prices and retail spending rose moderately in March, the government 
said Wednesday, potentially easing fears that the economy's recovery will spark 
renewed inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said the consumer price index inched up 0.3% for the 
second straight month, with increases in the cost of housing and clothing 
accounting for nearly half the upturn. The rise was in line with economists' 
predictions. The department also said weekly earnings of U.S. workers rose 0.9% 
in March to $383.09, after falling 1.5% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.4% in 
March, with sales totaling a seasonally adjusted $182.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five-county Southern California region, consumer prices edged up 0.2% 
last month, leaving them just 1.8% higher than in March, 1993. The government 
said higher clothing and private transportation costs more than offset lower 
costs for housing and personal care throughout Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first three months of the year, the annual inflation rate was 2.5%, 
compared to 2.7% for the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said that the latest rise in the consumer index should be 
considered the second bit of reassuring inflation news in two days. On Tuesday 
the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices were in check in March, 
increasing just 0.2%. For the full first quarter of 1994, they increased at an 
annual rate of 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the inflation figures could help hold down short-term interest 
rates for a while. But some said they still expect the Federal Reserve Board, 
looking further down the road, to move again this spring to tighten the money 
reins. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the modest increase in consumer spending suggested that the 
economy would continue to grow modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, expanded at a 
4.4% rate in the final three months of 1993. Retail sales represent about half 
of consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the report suggests that "consumer 
spending is growing at a sustainable pace consistent with the balanced recovery 
now under way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales last month were 8.9% higher than in March, 1993, when blizzards buried 
much of the nation and kept shoppers at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile sales were up just 0.5% in March, compared to 2.6% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaber and other analysts contended that previously reported increases in unit 
sales suggested the government's figures will be revised upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy prices, which had shot up a revised 1.6% in February, advanced 0.4% in 
March with the arrival of spring and milder weather. Food prices rose 0.1% in 
March, following two straight months of declines. The cost of medical care rose 
0.2% in March, matching the smallest increase in a decade. Retail Sales

JAPANESE MARKETS REACT FAVORABLY TO LIKELIHOOD OF HATA SUCCESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's emergence as the clear front-runner to be 
Japan's next prime minister was welcomed Wednesday as boosting hope for 
economic recovery and for an easing of trade tensions with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, a conservative former finance minister with extensive experience in 
government, is generally seen as a competent figure who would try to move 
forward with steps to stimulate Japan's stagnant economy and make it more open 
to foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japan's ruling coalition remained deadlocked Wednesday over plans to 
choose a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, investors in the Tokyo 
stock market responded favorably to the political shift toward Hata. The 
225-stock Nikkei index rose 412.08 points, or 2.1%, to close at 20,060.41. The 
dollar strengthened by 0.13 yen to close at 103.65. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Hata effect," Paul Summerville, director of Asian research at Lehman 
Bros. Japan Inc., said of the stock market's sharp rise. "He is seen as someone 
who knows how to pull the levers of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's momentum encouraged investors not only because of his personal 
qualifications, but also because a quick decision on any acceptable figure as 
the next prime minister reduces the risk of prolonged political uncertainty. 
One fear has been that political stalemate could lead to quick but inconclusive 
elections, delaying important economic policy-making for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as complex political maneuvering within Japan's ruling coalition appeared 
to shift decisively in Hata's favor, he flew out of Tokyo on Wednesday for 
Marrakesh, Morocco, where ministers from more than 120 countries are gathering 
to sign a landmark international trade accord under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, confirming the Uruguay Round agreement reached in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata is scheduled to meet Thursday in Marrakesh with Vice President Al Gore 
and Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Hata's aim is to 
restart the U.S.-Japan "framework" trade talks that broke down at the February 
summit in Washington between Hosokawa and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor told reporters in Marrakesh on Tuesday that "the ball is in their 
court" for Japan to come up with proposals on how to make progress on trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The current political upheaval was prompted by Hosokawa's sudden announcement 
Friday of his intent to resign. If the ruling coalition settles quickly on Hata 
as the next prime minister, his election by the lower house of Parliament could 
come early next week.

group of operations upset with major brokerage houses raiding their talent, 
sued giant Prudential Securities Inc. for $12 million for allegedly stealing 
its four top salesmen. The Irvine bond broker and dealer also accuses

A Prudential spokesman said the New York brokerage hired one salesman two years 
ago and that three others approached Prudential about jobs 16 to 18 months ago.

 Newton MessagePad Sales Weaker Than Expected: Michael Spindler, Apple Computer 
Inc. president and chief executive, said sales of the product the company 
heralded as the future of computing have not met expectations.He would not give 
specific sales figures, but blamed the poor performance on what he called 
retailers' inability to present the product to customers. The Newton, 
introduced in July, is a hand-held computer designed to aid communications for 
executives on the go. Sales of the device, which has optional paging and 
wireless faxing functions, has been hurt by glitches that can prevent its 
recognizing handwriting.

 Report Lauds Medical Instrument Makers: California's medical instrument 
manufacturers generated $6.3 billion in revenue in 1991, more than the combined 
total for companies in the states ranked second, third and fourth, the state 
Trade and Commerce Agency said in a report released with survey results last 
month. The agency cited the burgeoning medical instruments industry as proof of 
"the state's superiority in bringing together a variety of high technologies to 
manufacture a complex product." Southern California is home to more than half 
the 837 makers of medical instruments identified by the state researchers.

 Hilton's Profit Falls: Hilton Hotels Corp. reported a 14% decline in profit. 
It noted that year-earlier results were inflated by accounting changes and the 
company's torrid streak at its Las Vegas gambling tables.For the quarter ended 
March 31, Hilton earned $22.7 million, or 47 cents a share, compared to $26.5 
million, or 55 cents a share, during the first quarter of 1993. Hilton said 
hotel operations continued a recovery that began in the second half of 1993, 
with operating income up 62% to $20.7 million. Casino results fell 20% to $38.6 
million, a decline Hilton attributed mainly to unusually high 1993 winning 
percentages at the tables of the Las Vegas Hilton. Overall operating income was 
$55.7 million, up 2% from $54.6 million in the first quarter of 1993.

 Daimler-Benz Unveils Cell-Powered Car: The parent of the German luxury auto 
maker Mercedes-Benz presented what it called Europe's first vehicle powered by 
a hydrogen fuel cell.The cell, which works like a small power station, 
eliminates the need for heavy batteries. The company's Canadian subsidiary, 
Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, has already produced an experimental bus 
powered the same way. Although use of the cell will eventually reduce the 
weight of an electric vehicle, at the moment, "it's still far too bulky, too 
heavy and too expensive," a spokesman said. He said it will take a few years' 
work to make the car small enough for mass production.

SURVEY FINDS WORKING WOMEN SATISFIED; LABOR: GALLUP POLL INDICATES THAT MOST

 Liza Dawson says she has a good life. 
</P>
<P>
 She gets up at 6:45 a.m., and her 6-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl get up 
shortly after. When she leaves her home in the suburbs to catch the 8:07 train 
to her job in New York City, a live-in nanny takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, a senior editor at William Morrow & Co., returns home about 10 1/2 
hours later. After the long day at work, her long night at home begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stressed out to the max, but I can't imagine life any other way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson's optimism may sound unique, but a new Gallup Poll says it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, commissioned by Working Mother magazine for its May issue, found 
working women to be increasingly satisfied with the balance in their lives 
between job and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallup polled 1,000 working mothers nationwide -- 500 chosen at random and 500 
selected as being committed to careers. The findings seem to contradict those 
of other studies reported recently in the media by experts in the work-family 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies found many women -- and men -- to be uncomfortable with long 
hours on the job, often riddled with guilt about being away from families and 
doing so only because they have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Gallup survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven of 10 women said they work because it makes them feel good about 
themselves, regardless of the job they do or how much money they earn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight of 10 working mothers said they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied 
with how their children were doing and how they were doing as mothers; 90% 
described their children as happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * From a woman who de-snouts hogs in Missouri to a physics professor in 
Florida, 75% of the women said they "like" or "love" their jobs. Just 4% said 
they hate their work.

GARAMENDI BACKS OFF ON QUAKE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the threat of a lawsuit that he said could hamstring homeowners' 
efforts to recover from the Northridge earthquake, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi on Wednesday backed off his earlier plan to bar insurers from naming 
mortgage lenders as co-payees on earthquake claims payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Garamendi said he would establish a telephone hot line to help 
resolve disputes between homeowners and their lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners were surprised -- then angered -- to discover that they could 
not cash insurance claims checks because the insurer had made them out to the 
homeowner and the lender. The Insurance Department has received about 300 
complaints on the subject, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical case is that of Karen Gold, whose home in Woodland Hills was badly 
damaged in the quake. Lying on her dresser is a large insurance company check 
made out to her and her husband -- and their mortgage lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold says it is galling that homeowners who had the foresight to buy the 
insurance must give up control of the money during the repair process. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he still believes a lender has no legal right to demand a 
two-party check for quake insurance proceeds unless it is specified in the loan 
agreement or the insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said that during negotiations last week with mortgage industry 
representatives, the lenders vowed to file a lawsuit if Garamendi ordered 
insurers to write claims checks exclusively in the homeowners' names. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi acknowledged there is conflict between insurance law and banking law 
over the lenders' stake in insurance payments. A long legal battle would only 
freeze the insurance payments and delay the rebuilding process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said his staff will assist in resolving disputes and refer consumers 
to federal or state banking regulators where appropriate. The Insurance 
Department's toll-free consumer hot line is (800) 927-HELP.

AUTO INSURANCE RATES DECLINE BUT STILL VARY WIDELY BY CARRIER, REGION; DRIVING: 
SURVEY SHOWS THAT COVERAGE COSTS MOST IN L.A. COUNTY, AND THAT INNER CITY 
RESIDENTS PAY MORE THAN SUBURBANITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 California auto insurance rates have declined slightly over the last year, a 
new state survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the things the Insurance Department's annual survey shows are the 
same as in previous years: rates in Los Angeles County remain the state's 
highest, followed by Orange County; rates still vary widely from carrier to 
carrier, and a poor driving record costs a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 And once again, the survey demonstrates that inner city residents pay much 
more for auto insurance than suburbanites, in absolute terms and as a 
proportion of income. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi blames that on insurance company 
redlining -- or refusal to offer coverage in certain neighborhoods. He said he 
will provide evidence of redlining at a special congressional hearing on the 
subject Friday at the Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, releasing the survey Wednesday, credited his refusal to grant rate 
increases, plus the beneficial effects of Proposition 103 -- the 1988 insurance 
rollback initiative -- for the decline in auto insurance prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing they cannot rely on regular rate increases, companies have had to find 
ways of reducing their costs to remain profitable, said Garamendi, who is a 
Democratic candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited State Farm Insurance Group and 20th Century Insurance Co. -- both of 
which have refused to pay ordered rebates under Proposition 103 -- as having 
among the lowest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that Farmers Insurance Group, Mercury General Group and Auto 
Club of Southern California had recently lowered their rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The survey shows that the state average annual premium for a 30-year-old 
driver with a clean driving record is $543, down $13 or 2.4% from a year ago. 
In Los Angeles, the average premium for such a driver is $944, down $24 or 2.5% 
from a year ago. Orange County's average is $636, down $11 or 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest lesson for consumers in the survey is to shop around. Rates for 
the 30-year-old with a clean record in Los Angeles County, for example, vary 
from a high of $1,288 (Farmers) to a low of $674 (20th Century). For other 
driver categories, the variation is even wider. 
</P>
<P>
 How much difference does a poor driving record make? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: Mercury's rate for the 30-year-old Los Angeles resident with a 
clean record is $685. With a speeding ticket and an at-fault accident, it jumps 
to $1,278. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates within regions also vary widely. Garamendi noted that a 30-year-old 
driver with a clean record pays an average of $584 annually in Palmdale, $628 
in Palos Verdes, but $1,416 in South Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "These premiums clearly show that California's auto insurance market remains 
unfair and arbitrary," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Crystal, a spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information Services, an 
industry trade group, said that insurers are satisfied with the accuracy of the 
survey but that it provides only a general indication of pricing. Rates are 
based on so many factors that individual consumers' premiums may be much 
different from those shown in the hypothetical examples, she said. Average

 Here are the average annual premiums for Southern California's 13 largest auto 
insurers, region by region, using six hypothetical examples of coverage.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; END OF TAX WRITE-OFF PROMPTS 
RE-EVALUATION OF AIRLINE CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many years, the exclusive airport clubs that cater to the needs of 
business travelers and other frequent fliers have offered more than office 
support, help with travel arrangements and free beverages. They've served as a 
tax write-off as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But the benefit of belonging to an airline club was one of the casualties of 
the new tax law that went into effect at the beginning of this year. Now, 
cost-conscious airline passengers and the airlines themselves are taking a 
closer look at the clubs, what they offer and how much they cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few cases, airlines are considering changing their fee structures as a 
result of the change in tax law. Most, however, said they are still studying 
the situation, and none have taken any action yet. 
</P>
<P>
 A rundown on current airline club room programs: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Airlines Admirals Club: Forty locations. A one-year membership 
costs $150, plus a $100 initiation fee. Adding a spouse costs $75. Lifetime 
memberships are $2,600, plus $1,500 to add a spouse. A senior lifetime 
membership (for ages 60 and up) costs $700, plus $200 for a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs provide televisions, personal computers, phones, desks, fax machines 
and copy machines. Conference rooms can be reserved for a fee. Coffee and tea 
are complimentary, and cocktails and other beverages can be purchased in the 
United States. In Europe and South America, drinks are free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delta Airlines Crown Room: Clubs in 39 cities. A one-year single membership 
costs $150, plus $50 to add a spouse. Three-year memberships are $360, plus 
$100 for a spouse. There are no lifetime memberships or initiation fees, and 
you can use frequent-flier miles toward the purchase of a membership. There are 
no senior discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Group meeting rooms are available at no charge. Although club rooms have fax 
machines and phones, there are no copy machines or computers. Crown Rooms offer 
complimentary beverages, including cocktails. Members can cash checks for up to 
$50, and each club is staffed by a concierge to assist in travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>

advance. Nearly half the clubs also include office modules with desks, fax 
machines and computer hookups. The staff can provide a computer, but a 
reservation is required. 
</P>

 Personal checks can be cashed for up to $100. Each club room has a concierge

 * When it comes to travel, women feel the industry treats them strictly 
second-class, according to a survey released this week. A poll of 650 women by 
the travel magazine Endless Vacation found that most women believe they receive 
inferior service to men when on the road and even pay higher prices in some 
cases.The survey found that 69% of those polled believe the travel industry 
treats men better than women. In addition, 35% said they attribute negative 
experiences they have had while traveling to being female. 
</P>
<P>
 * A company that has been testing free-standing private rooms at the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport since August, 1992, says the idea is 
a winner and that it is negotiating with other airports. Business travelers can 
use the rooms for catnaps or to catch up on work. Eight Ziosks made by Ziosk 
Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., are scattered throughout the terminal, each 
equipped with a sofa, worktable, credit card phone, fax machine, television and 
clock radio. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain access, the traveler picks up a phone outside the unit. An 800 number 
is automatically dialed, which puts the customer in touch with an operator, who 
takes a credit card number as well as the length of time for which the unit is 
to be reserved. The user then gets a four-digit code that allows entry and 
re-entry during that period. The cost: $12.95 for the first hour, $6.98 for 
each additional hour. So far about 2,900 people have used the units at the test 
site, with their stays averaging about 90 minutes, Ziosk said.

 The nation is overhauling its state-dominated economy, although political 
infighting has slowed privatization. Growth has been fueled by repatriated 
money -- earned by Turkish workers in Europe -- that helped finance a modern 
infrastructure. Growth industries include tourism, which grew to over $4 
billion last year.

 Daimler-Benz Reports Worst Performance Since WWII: Germany's largest 
industrial group reported a loss of $1.08 billion for 1993, compared to a 
$791-million profit in 1992.The loss, which is according to U.S. accounting 
rules that the company adopted when it was listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange last year, is the group's worst performance since World War II. The 
Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary posted an operating loss of $742.2 million, 
contrasted with a $1.34-billion profit in 1992. Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard 
Reuter said the company is expected to have an operating profit this year. He 
said the group made an operating profit in the first quarter of 1994 and sales 
rose 15%.

BRIEFING BOOK / BETH KNOBEL: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; UNPAID ENERGY BILLS SPLIT 
RUSSIA, NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KNOBEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Russia, the world's largest energy exporter, is turning up the heat on 
countries that won't pay their power bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's cash-strapped neighbors in the Baltics and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) are the worst offenders: Ukraine owes Russia nearly 
$3.5 billion for energy, including $900 million for natural gas; Belarus owes 
$240 million and tiny Latvia owes $23 million for Russian natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 In early March, Russia tightened the screws and cut gas supplies to Ukraine 
and Belarus by up to 65% as a warning to all its debtors to pay up. Russia 
argues that its whole energy sector risks paralysis if, due to delays in 
payment, it lacks the cash to buy needed equipment and pay workers. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: When the Soviet Union split up in 1991, many of the successor 
states were left with few energy resources. They turned to the same place for 
oil and gas as they had in Soviet times -- Mother Russia, rich with 10% of the 
world's known oil reserves and nearly 40% of its natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Russia continued to sell its neighbors the heavily subsidized 
petroleum that fueled their economies in Soviet days. But under prodding from 
Western monetary institutions, and to compensate for a slide in overall 
production that has worsened every year since 1987, Russia has raised its 
prices for oil and gas exports nearly to world market levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, Commonwealth and Baltic nations are buying less Russian energy. 
Russian deliveries of oil to CIS nations dropped a hefty 47% in 1993 compared 
with 1992 levels, falling to 40.4 million tons, and gas sales slipped by 17% to 
80 billion cubic meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many government-owned factories in the former Soviet nations have been closed 
due to the energy crisis, and the shutdowns hinder these countries' ability to 
pay for the oil and gas they buy from Russia. In Ukraine, for instance, where 
industrial production fell 30% last year, a senior official said the gas cutoff 
was like "a bomb exploding on Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, too, is caught in a vicious circle. It says it cannot keep the pumps 
running unless customers pay their tabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total of non-payments has taken on such huge proportions that in the near 
future . . . it could completely paralyze economic activities on the part of 
energy sector enterprises," the Russian energy ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Having flexed its muscles, Russia restored most of the flow of gas to 
Ukraine and Belarus in mid-March -- but gave its neighbors until April 10 to 
pay up or face another shut-off. Ukraine dispatched a high-level delegation to 
Moscow for talks with Russian officials, which began last Friday and are still 
under way, in hopes of resolving the non-payments crisis. An earlier round of 
talks, held in March, failed to draw up a payment plan acceptable to both 
sides. Belarus and Moldova have also been negotiating with Gazprom, Russia's 
gas-producing monopoly. To show their good faith, Ukraine and Belarus each made 
payments of about $100 million toward their outstanding energy tabs. But they 
are going to have to come up with more than that to satisfy the Russians in the 
long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are short on cash, Ukraine and Belarus -- like the other debtor 
nations -- are likely to turn to two sources for financing. First, they will 
try to barter food, ships and industrial equipment for energy. "We can supply 
Russia with various manufactured goods," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
explained last month. "Russian enterprises cannot buy them because they 
themselves have no money." The republic of Moldova has already agreed to send 
Gazprom $25 million dollars worth of fruit, vegetables and other agricultural 
products as part of its gas payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the former Soviet states will continue to seek Western loans and 
credits. As a stopgap, international institutions and individual nations have 
given aid to these debtor nations to buy energy in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: Countries buying Russian energy are looking for other, cheaper 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, some countries have turned to other former Soviet producers 
for help. Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have energy to sell. But 
that's only a partial solution because those producers also won't tolerate late 
payments. In February, for instance, Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies to 
Ukraine for non-payment of a $700-million gas bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, Commonwealth and Baltic nations are trying to boost their own 
energy production. Some countries, such as Lithuania, are working to develop 
untapped sources of oil and gas. Others, such as Armenia and Ukraine, are 
turning to nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, for instance, was to have closed the Chernobyl power plant -- scene 
of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986 -- last year. But the Ukrainian 
parliament voted to keep the plant open, even though it is acknowledged to be 
dangerous, and to beef up other nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the United States said Ukraine had agreed to speed up the closing 
of Chernobyl, that the shutdown could come as soon as this summer. But the 
Ukrainians say it may take them until 1998 to secure enough alternative energy 
resources to be able to do without power from Chernobyl.

 Hong Kong Exports Fall While Imports Rise: The colony's exports dropped 8.1% 
in the January-February, 1994, period compared to the same months in 1993, 
while imports increased 9.2%, the Census and Statistics Department 
reported.Hong Kong exported goods were valued at $3.73 billion in the first two 
months of the year, and imported goods were valued at $2.67 million, the 
department said. Re-exports in the first two months of this year rose 14% to 
$16.3 million. Re-exports are goods imported into the territory and then 
re-exported without substantial change.

 Some Progress in Brazil's Fight Against Inflation: Brazil, which has been 
fighting hyperinflation, has reduced inflation in its major metropolitan areas 
from the rate earlier this year.But inflation is still running ahead of the 
rate at the same period last year. Inflation in March for the 11 major cities 
was 42.8%, 2.4 percentage points lower than the 45.2% registered in February, 
according to the government's National Institute of Geography and Statistics. 
The rate was 27% a year ago.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS DONE ON THE FLY

 "In our family there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing." -- 
Norman Maclean, "A River Runs Through It" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That damned movie," grumbles Darwin Atkin, a fly fisher from Porterville, in 
his curmudgeonly best. Yet one senses he's not all that upset about the film 
that's brought droves of converts to his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 True, some Western fishing holes are now knee-deep in people, and people 
pollute. Still, Atkin is here in Long Beach, at the Southwest Council, 
Federation of Fly Fishers show, waxing poetic about his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly fishing isn't about Friday fish fry. It's about casting out a line just 
so, in a great, graceful arc. About tying a fly that fools a fish. 
</P>
<P>
 As we circle the exhibit hall, show chairman Bob Montgomery, a graphic 
designer from Fontana, explains: "Most of us start spin fishing or bait 
fishing, get bored and try fly fishing." Before you can say striped bass, 
"You're hopelessly addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 The level of surrender varies. Some just fish. Some tie their own flies. 
Others tie their flies and make their rods. Montgomery calls it an addiction 
that "can adjust to any income level." 
</P>
<P>
 Graphite rods and good reels can cost $500 a piece. A fly can be bought for 
$1.25 -- or $600. The latter, explains Atkin, "will never, ever see the water," 
but will wind up on the wall of a collector who's "never seen an Atlantic 
Salmon in their life." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkin, a UC Riverside citrus researcher, and Chuck Echer, a researcher at 
Lawrence-Berkeley Lab, are revered by fly-tiers as winners of the Buz Buszek 
Memorial Award, the Heisman Trophy of fly tying. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Echer would bring home bushels of bass. "They'd get freezer 
burn for two or three years and then even the cats wouldn't eat them." These 
days he prefers to "kiss the fish" and toss it back: "You can go down to the 
Safeway and buy dead fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Catch-and-release fishing, with barbless hooks, is what's it's about today. 
Those hooks also prove handy, Echer observes, "if you're unfortunate enough to 
hook yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Fly fishing, which started in Victorian England, has spread worldwide. The 
U.S. federation claims 130,000 fly fishers, among them a small, but growing, 
number of women. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran is Maggie Merriman, an instructor who divides her time between 
Huntington Beach and West Yellowstone. "For years," she recalls, "I had to wear 
men's waders." Now, with more spouses as fishing partners, they make them for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 When we catch up with Merriman, she's casting into a shallow 100-foot-long 
plastic pool in mid-hall, showing how to avoid knots and tangles and keep the 
landing so smooth it won't spook all the fish away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mumford of Ridgecrest introduces himself as the new president of the 
Southwest Council and soon we're talking about trout stocking, which the state 
Department of Fish and Game has had to resume after a 10-year hiatus. (Of 
California's 50 trout fishing waters, 35 are designated catch-and-release by 
Fish and Game, which defines it as keep two, put the rest back). 
</P>
<P>
 Truthfully, Mumford says, it's not quite sporting. "The wild trout tends to be 
smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hal Janssen of Santa Rosa is onstage in the video fly-tying 
theater. He's saying straight off that his flies aren't works of art, but they 
catch fish. He has no time for museum-piece creations that would tempt only 
"some suicidal fish." 
</P>
<P>
 To a hook held by a vise he ties tufts of marabou. In minutes, he's made 
something that looks like a leech, swims like a leech and will hoodwink a 
hungry trout. 
</P>
<P>
 When all's said, there's this about fly fishing: It's not about sitting in a 
boat waiting for a bite. The fly fisher makes it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 As Norman Maclean, minister's son, says: He and his brother were left to 
assume "that all first class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly 
fishermen." A Patent Interest in Old Inventions 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Greene surveys his toys. Here's a Rube Goldberg-ish contraption patented 
in 1874 as the first security alarm. "Looks like something I would have built 
when I was a kid messing around in wood shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the working model for the first mechanical washing machine, powered by 
rubber belts. "The woman just had to get it started and push it once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Over here's a sawdust conveyor, "The kind of invention Henry Ford looked at 
and said, 'Ah, an assembly line.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the first refrigerator condenser (1866). "This guy devastated an entire 
industry" -- ice. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of haunting auctions and antique shops, Greene, who lives in 
Sherman Oaks, has 27 of these models. To know just what he has is to know a bit 
of the history of the U.S. Patent Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1790, it was rather loosely regulated and, by the mid-1830s, 
found itself patenting willy-nilly already existing inventions. Fearing 
lawsuits, it ruled that inventors must henceforth submit working models. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, buried under about 250,000 models, the agency dropped that 
requirement. The models were stored, forgotten, in a barn in Upstate New York 
until 1908, when Congress gave the OK to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Private collectors, foundations and museums, including the Smithsonian, 
snapped up some. Others remained stored. In the '70s, some entrepreneurs formed 
Mom's Apple Pie Co., hoping to market thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's embarrassing to me as American -- they actually tried to sell these at 
department stores. But nobody knew what they were." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many survive. Greene thinks some have left the country and 
probably "a lot of guys have one on their mantle." 
</P>
<P>
 His are mostly home improvement inventions. (He is, after all, CEO of the 
N.E.C. Group, which produces the L.A. Home Remodeling and Decorating Show). 
He'll be exhibiting them for the first time at the annual show, Friday through 
Sunday at the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the first steam iron, the first gizmo for opening or closing a window 
from inside. There's something the inventor simply called "Preventing Chimneys 
From Smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 He intends to learn all about his inventors. Did they get rich? Get ripped off 
and die broke? He surmises they were "somewhat witty and whimsical" and, as an 
incurable gadgeteer, he likes that. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene won't put a price on his collection, and he won't sell. That would be 
"like selling the Lincoln Memorial." (Understand that he's the kind of guy who 
drives a Cadillac, not a fancy foreign car. On principle.) 
</P>
<P>
 By taking his models to home shows, he hopes to encourage 20th-Century 
Americans to "think about being inventive and creative." 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, Greene is certainly creative, having parlayed a college job 
demonstrating pots and pans at state fairs into a home show empire. 
</P>
<P>
 And someday, he vows, "I'm going to invent something."

ANN CONWAY: A MAGIC CARPET RIDE JUST BEFORE JOURNEY; AFTER A PARTY WITH 
ORCHESTRA BUFFS, PEABO BRYSON IS ON HIS WAY TO WAYNE NEWTON'S RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who would have guessed that recording artist Peabo Bryson ("A Whole New World 
(Aladdin's Theme)," "Beauty and the Beast") was heading for Las Vegas on Wayne 
Newton's private jet after his appearance at a party with Pacific Symphony 
buffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Following his performance Saturday night at Segerstrom Hall, Bryson mingled 
casually with orchestra supporters at the Center Club, posing for pictures, 
signing autographs -- even singing a few bars of "I Have Dreamed" (from "The 
King and I") for one guest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank you all for coming (to the concert)," Bryson told members of 
the orchestra's Maestro Society. "Without this kind of support, I can't give 
the talent God gave me as a form of therapy to others. And we all need 
therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Especially Wayne Newton and his new bride, attorney Kathleen McCrone. 
"Wayne knew how much Kathleen loved Peabo's voice, so he arranged for us to fly 
to the wedding," said Johnny Pate, Bryson's conductor. "For sure, one of the 
songs he'll sing to them is 'A Whole New World.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After spending about 25 minutes with guests, Bryson joined Pate and three 
backup singers to fly out of John Wayne Airport for his engagement at Newton's 
53-acre Casa de Shenandoah Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Also mingling with guests was singer Patti Austin, who wowed the Segerstrom 
Hall crowd with hits such as "Baby Come to Me" and "The Heat of Heat." Between 
numbers, Austin led the audience in a sing-along and cracked them up with 
jokes. "I love to give an audience as much as I can," she said. "I learned that 
when I was very young and saw a performance by Judy Garland. She gave every 
audience everything she could. It turned my life around. An audience deserves 
that kind of fuss." 
</P>

 Mum on the Clintons: After Barbara Bush gave a speech last week at a benefit 
luncheon for Angelitos de Oro, a support group of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of 
Orange County, she answered questions submitted to her on paper by the hundreds 
of guests at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But only certain questions. Queries about the Clintons were ignored. "What 
standards do you feel the First Family should set and uphold?" was one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, wearing her trademark double-strand of pearls, flashed a smile and said 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over, the former First Lady, assisted by luncheon chairwoman Arden 
Flamson, set aside handwritten questions, declining even to articulate them 
before the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests soon got the message: "I'm not answering any Hillary questions," Bush 
finally huffed. "There's quite a few of them here, in fact. Everybody does 
their own thing. . . . To each his own." 
</P>
<P>
 One question Bush answered in a split second: "Will you and George be back in 
'96?" "No!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former First Lady and her husband are thoroughly enjoying being just 
folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we left the White House, I'm happy to report that we've settled 
comfortably back into private life. . . . I drive a Mercury, he cooks eggs and 
bacon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 30 years of public life, it's nice to be out of the news, out of the 
public eye. Recently, at a celebrity golf tournament, (TV newscaster) Bryant 
Gumbel hit a sea gull (and it made headlines). George hit four spectators and 
you never heard a word." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the Bushes are penning books. "His is a very serious reflective 
discussion on foreign policy, such as what happened in the Oval Office the 
night Desert Storm began. . . . Mine will be more along the lines of what 
happened under the table the night George did you know what (threw up at a 
state dinner in Japan)." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she concluded her remarks, Bush made a pitch for literacy, her pet 
project. "Did you know that one out of 10 drivers can't read the road signs? 
That the average kindergartner has watched 5,000 hours of television? That's 
more time than it takes to get a college degree!" 
</P>
<P>
 For Flamson and Catherine Thyen -- president of Angelitos de Oro -- one of the 
day's highlights came when Bush graciously acknowledged their contributions to 
the local charity scene. "You are not only points of light," Bush said. "You 
are beacons."

 Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross and wife of the U.S. 
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, took the spotlight Monday evening at the 
Pepperdine University Associates' "Spirit of Volunteerism" black-tie dinner at 
the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 She praised Southern Californians for their "courage and perseverance" in the 
wake of so many disasters and noted: "Americans have a social contract to 
support, protect and encourage one another; this acts as the glue holding 
society together." She added: "Action is eloquence, and it's up to you and me 
to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine president David Davenport, a fellow Kansan, welcomed Dole at the 
dinner chaired by Richard C. Seaver and keynoted by Pepperdine regent Matthew 
K. Fong. Many in the room were just receiving news that Seaver's 102-year-old 
aunt, Blanche Seaver, the illustrious philanthropist to not only Pepperdine but 
USC and the Claremont colleges, had passed away.

 Eclat: The conspicuous success of the Diadames Creative Table Settings 
Luncheon at the Regent Beverly Wilshire last week headed by president Joyce 
Kresa and event chair Marion Anderson was marvelous. If president Kresa was 
exuding, look at it this way. Husband Kent Kresa, chairman, CEO and president 
of Northrop, had just pulled off one of the biggest business deals around by 
buying Grumman Corp. for $2.11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took his radio to church Sunday (Bel-Air Presbyterian) while the deal was 
under way. I told him, 'If you dare use that radio in church. . .!' " Kresa 
says. 
</P>

 Some of those conjuring beauteous table settings: Connie Gavin, Arletta 
Tronstein, Gloria Holden, Joni and Clark Smith, Mary Marshall, Lucy Zahran,

</P>
<P>
 The "Duke" award was bestowed on Dr. Donald L. Morton, the institute's medical 
director. Kudos to the chairs -- Illa Waldman and Susan Dobson -- netting 
$350,000 and booking the classy performances by Diahann Carroll and Ray

 Derby Day: Lots of drama at the 57th running of the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby 
Saturday. Brocco won the big race for his owners Albert "Cubby" and Dana 
Broccoli (true fact: Cubby's family in Italy developed broccoli from 
cauliflower and rape). Sally Keller of Hancock Park, wife of Santa Anita 
president Stephen Keller, presented the trophy in the winner's circle, which 
called for bubbles. Toasting with champagne with the Kellers were Roger Moore 
("James Bond" in the movies produced by Broccoli) and trainer Randy Winick. On 
the infield the fancy Rolls Royces and Bentleys competed with the ponies in the 
Concours d'Elegance benefit with Kitty and Eddy Bridges and Judy and Byron 
Matson lunching on pa te and gazpacho.

 The medical instruments industry is a significant force in California's 
economy and is likely to become even more so, according to a recently released 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 California's medical instruments manufacturers generated $6.3 billion in 1991 
revenue, more than the combined total for companies in the second-, third- and 
fourth-ranked states, the state Trade and Commerce Agency wrote in a report 
accompanying the survey results. They were released last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which uses data from 1990-92, cites the burgeoning medical 
instruments industry as proof of "the state's superiority in bringing together 
a variety of high technologies to manufacture a complex product." 
</P>
<P>
 Covering everything from simple dental picks to sophisticated imaging devices, 
the report portrays California's medical instruments manufacturers as a 
dominant national force in terms of employment, revenue and foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is home to more than half of the 837 medical instruments 
manufacturers identified by state researchers and accounts for 70% of the 
industry's statewide employment of nearly 45,000, according to the survey. Of 
those, Orange County had 8,838 people employed by the industry, and Los Angeles 
County had 9,413. 
</P>
<P>
 Biomedical industry observers said Tuesday that the researchers may even have 
understated the industry's growing significance in a region stung by defense 
and aerospace cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials "will probably be shocked to learn that the industry in Orange 
County is five times larger than they think it is and about three times larger 
in Los Angeles County," said David Anast, publisher of the Costa Mesa-based 
Biomedical Market Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Anast said the state survey probably failed to locate hundreds of tiny 
companies that opened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also dramatically understates the industry's overall importance to 
California's economy, the researchers said, because of the difficulty in 
tracking related laboratory workers in research and development or employees 
who operate and maintain medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 California accounts for 11% of U.S. manufacturing jobs but has 19% of the 
nation's medical instrument manufacturing positions, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry also pays healthy wages, according to the survey. The average 
annual wage for employees at California's medical instruments companies in 1990 
was $33,400, compared to the $29,400 average for all U.S. manufacturing 
workers. Pay within the industry in the San Francisco Bay Area was 25% higher 
than the state average, while Southern California's was 12% lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggests that the industry is poised for continued growth, largely 
because nearly 20% of the new companies registering with the Food and Drug 
Administration during 1991 and 1992 were from California. 
</P>
<P>
 And, researchers said, the state's medical equipment industry will continue to 
benefit from strong overseas sales. More than 20% of the nation's medical 
equipment shipments now originate in California, the report said, and "export 
opportunities look even brighter in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that the state is finally devoting some attention to verifying 
the true size of the medical manufacturing industry," Anast said. "From this 
type of data, many other good things are going to flow." Medical Instrument 
Mecca 
</P>
<P>
 About six in 10 of the state's medical instrument manufacturers are in 
Southern California, as are two-thirds of the jobs. Figures are based on a 1992 
survey: 04,27,15,11,13 Average County Manufacturers Employees annual wage Los 
Angeles 209 9,413 $36,992 Orange 139 8,838 37,742 San Diego 87 5,165 35,628

TAX TIME TICKING; ACCOUNTANT BUSINESS PICKS UP IN A HURRY FOR COURIER SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Cavers rolled his chair from the file cabinet to his desk and announced, 
"Sheet number three, 10:40." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavers was beginning a third roster of incoming customer calls, which made it 
an unusually busy morning at California Express Courier Service in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one-third of the 117 million Americans who must file federal tax 
returns are trying this week to beat the Friday midnight filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 And any business that does any business with accountants is feeling the 
crunch. Courier services are expecting a 35% to 50% increase in business during 
the week leading up to tax day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably go straight to midnight on the 15th," said Mike Zelmer, 
operations manager at Fountain Valley-based AAA-PCS Express. "This is our 
heaviest week."  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, which is home to more than two dozen courier services, many 
of the companies have stationed drivers in Irvine, near the local offices of 
the major national accounting firms. As tax returns are completed, they are 
carried by couriers to clients for their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are busy, too. An estimated 400,000 to 600,000 Orange County taxpayers 
are filing returns this week, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Twelve 
Orange County post offices have announced plans to remain open later than usual 
on Friday. Accountants and other tax preparers are working almost around the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get four or five hours of sleep," said Chip Higgins, an 
independent accountant in Irvine. "I'm working, other than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Courier services are open early this week, many at 7 a.m., and most have hired 
extra, temporary drivers. Zelmer and California Express are both offering a 20% 
discount this week to new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount has brought in an average of five new clients daily since the 
middle of last week, said John E. Franse, president of California Express. 
</P>
<P>
 His operation -- with seven drivers -- is relatively small. The three-room 
headquarters office is cozy enough to allow the dispatcher, without raising his 
voice, to ask the lone salesman to pick up the phone. Next month, however, 
California Express plans to quadruple its space and add warehousing capacity 
for small parts storage. 
</P>
<P>
 As fax machines and satellites have cut into the business of document 
delivery, many courier services are specializing in transporting bulkier 
things, such as clothing and blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like California Express, act as a distributor for a client company's 
sales force in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 California Express charges $10 to $15 for its average delivery, but rates 
change based on distance and the required speed of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Franse, 29, is a former electronics technician who became burned out and took 
a job as a driver for a courier service. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually became vice president of that company, a 25-driver operation. 
Then, he took a job at a major courier operation -- 75 drivers -- to learn how 
a large operation worked. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, Franse and Cavers opened a business on Airway Avenue, a 
kind of Miracle Mile of Orange County transport services. Federal Express, 
Airborne Express and three other courier companies have operations in the 
neighborhood because it is near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very entrepreneurial business," said Stephen Miley, president of 
the Messenger Courier Assn. of the Americas, a trade group based in Washington. 
His service, The Go-Between Inc., serves the entertainment industry from a Los 
Angeles office. "It's a great way for an individual to work for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Franse said that owning his own business, after five years in the industry, 
has so far brought only one unexpected result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised at how good a relationship we can have with our clients," he 
said. "We make a point of knowing the first names of the people who call. We 
know what's going on in their lives."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ANAHEIM FIRM PLANS WIRELESS LINE OF PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home Theater Products International, which makes and sells consumer electronic 
products, said Wednesday it will introduce a line of wireless audio, video and 
multimedia products during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which specializes in home surround-sound systems, said it will be 
the first to offer a complete home theater system using infrared and 900 MHz 
technology in its components and not as accessories.Infrared technology, now 
used in fiber optic data communication and TV remote controls, is more reliable 
than conventional technology, the company said, and use of radio frequency 
bands in the 900 MHz range can result in more accurate transmissions with less 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Anaheim, reported earnings of $700,000 on sales of $8.1 
million for its latest quarter.

MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS STILL STALLING UNTIL THE FINAL HOUR; TAXES: TENS OF 
MILLIONS DELAY THE INEVITABLE, JUST BEATING THE FRIDAY MIDNIGHT DEADLINE TO 
FILE, MOST BECAUSE THEY OWE MONEY.

<P>
 For millions of Americans, Friday is the worst rite of spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one-third of the 117 million people who must file federal tax returns 
will wait until just before the April 15 midnight deadline, mainly because they 
owe money, according to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Filers who waited until the last week a year ago totaled 34.2 million. This 
year, the IRS expects that number will be easily surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are booked solid, appointments until midnight," Laura Springer, who works 
at an H&R Block office in Silver Spring, Md., said Wednesday. "It's like this 
every year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 400,000 to 600,000 Orange County taxpayers filing returns this 
week, according to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who miss the deadline can count on paying late fees and a penalty of 
5% for each month they stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers can get a delay until Aug. 15 to file their return -- but the 
request form and the estimated tax owed also must be filed by midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, nearly 6 million people opted for the four-month delay, the IRS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the chronic procrastinator, the IRS will allow a second extension to Oct. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Those heading to the Post Office Friday night in New York will have company -- 
the Postal Service is expecting 20,000 mad dashers at its main branch on 8th 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In Springfield, Mass., there will be champagne, music and banners to greet the 
late-night filers, who last year included a woman whose dog who has been 
trained to drop her return in the mail box. 
</P>
<P>
 In Phoenix, Baskin Robbins will pass out free ice cream. The flavor? Income 
Tax Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic Peabody Hotel in Memphis is hosting a "Tax Stress Release" party, 
with food, drink and stamps to the first 1,000 people who show up. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bethesda, Md., an Elvis impersonator will be giving out free Elvis Presley 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of stamps, the Postal Service warns that filers must have the right 
postage (four pages equals one ounce, which can be sent with a 29-cent stamp) 
and cannot use a postage meter. That's because the IRS will neither pay extra 
postage nor recognize the postage meter date stamp as valid. 
</P>
<P>
 The postage meter date can, after all, be fudged. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, however, the April 15 late-night rush will be just a memory, thanks 
to the potential for filing by computer. As of April 1, some 12.4 million 
returns had been filed by computer, up 8.3% from a year ago, a trend tax 
collectors hope will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS says it eliminates paperwork, saves money and time, speeds up refunds 
and makes for more accurate returns.

SECURITIES FIRM ALLEGES RAIDS ON TALENT, SUES PRUDENTIAL; BROKERAGES: 
IRVINE-BASED LIBERTY CAPITAL MARKETS CONTENDS INDUSTRY GIANT USED UNFAIR 
ADVANTAGE TO IDENTIFY, LURE 4 TOP SALESPEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small securities company, joining a growing group of operations upset that 
major brokerage houses are raiding their talent, has sued giant Prudential 
Securities Inc. for $12 million, alleging that it lured away its four top 
salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Capital Markets Inc. accuses Prudential in a San Francisco Superior 
Court lawsuit of using their confidential working relationship to identify and 
hire Liberty's top producers, thus disrupting Liberty's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential had been Liberty's agent in clearing all securities transactions, 
thus gaining access to customer activity and salespeople's performances, Doyle 
L. Holmes, Liberty's president, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Irvine bond broker and dealer contends that Prudential 
defamed it by suggesting in a pamphlet at a recent convention that Liberty was 
out of business, said Liberty's lawyer, Joseph L. Alioto, a former San 
Francisco mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman William J. Ahearn said he knew nothing about the alleged 
defamation, but he denied that his firm did anything wrong. Prudential 
recruited one of the four Liberty brokers two years ago, and the others 
approached Prudential about jobs 16 to 18 months ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Prudential has asked a court to stop Dain Bosworth Inc. in 
Minneapolis from hiring any more of its employees. Dain Bosworth had lured 13 
Prudential salespeople from the company's Bellevue, Wash., office in the past 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty's suit, filed Monday, is one of a number of lawsuits filed recently 
against major brokerages accusing them of wrongly raiding smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the industry, raids happen on a fairly regular basis," he said. "We don't 
normally pursue these matters much. Some companies go to arbitration, some go 
to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Top salespeople, he said, are being offered "significant" pay packages now, so 
more job switching is occurring, and that is probably leading to more 
arbitrations and lawsuits. Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, for instance, 
recently sued Smith Barney Shearson Inc. in federal court in Miami for 
allegedly luring away its top three salespeople and two assistants.

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL; RETRO UNIFORM STYLES COVER ALL THE BASES AT ANAHEIM STADIUM

 When it comes to fashion, classic designs usually prevail. It's no different 
in the sports world. For proof, head out to Anaheim Stadium and catch what the 
home and visiting teams are wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's got anything that's outrageous anymore, like the old Chicago White 
Sox who went to short pants or the old Houston Astro 'rainbow' uniforms," said 
Craig Gerber, director of marketing for the California Angels. "The clubs have 
gone to a 'retro' look, updating classic uniforms for today." 
</P>
<P>
 Change is apparently the name of the game when it comes to Major League 
uniforms. Only six of baseball's 28 teams didn't tinker with their uniforms 
before this season's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians, who completed a three-game stand at Anaheim on 
Wednesday night, are sporting new garb at home and away, Gerber said, including 
black shoes that are worn only on the road. But the biggest change occurred in 
Houston, where the Astros replaced their "rainbow" uniform with a more 
traditional design. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't a case of change for change's sake, Gerber said. Uniforms do get 
dated. As important, many fans get tired of seeing the same old thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's White Sox proved that a few years ago when a dramatic uniform change 
pushed the team's memorabilia and sportswear sales from dead last to No. 1. Two 
years ago, sales of Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies merchandise shot to 
the top -- even though the teams had yet to play a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales explosion generated by the Rockies and Marlins benefited every club, 
Gerber said, because merchandise royalties are generally split among all Major 
League teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last year's Angels redesign, which Gerber described as "an updated look 
at a classic uniform," sales of the home team's merchandise ranked 27th out of 
28 baseball clubs. According to the league's most recent figures, the Angels 
are a top-tier club when it comes to sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans definitely like the new look," Gerber said. "I'm seeing more fans 
wearing the new hats and logos."

4 EX-HONDA OFFICIALS, LAWYER NAMED IN KICKBACK SUIT; COURTS: THEY ALLEGEDLY 
SOUGHT TO DEFRAUD TWO BUSINESSMEN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AN AUTO FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Four former executives of Torrance-based American Honda Motor Corp. and a 
Philadelphia lawyer were named in a suit charging that they sought to defraud 
two business executives of $250,000 to acquire a Honda franchise to be opened 
in Hammonton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania, asks for $10 million in punitive damages and $5 million in 
compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit stems from a major criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney that 
resulted in the March 14 indictment of 13 former Honda officials for extortion 
and racketeering. All of the executives named in the Philadelphia suit were 
among those indicted by the U.S. attorney, said the Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., law firm 
Furman & Halpern, which is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Honda executives named in the Wednesday suit are Senior Vice 
President Stanley Cardiges of Laguna Hills, who worked for Honda from 1977 to 
1992; John Billmyer of Raleigh, N.C., who worked for Honda from 1970 to 1988; 
Western Regional Sales Manager Robert N. Rivers of Irvine, who worked for Honda 
from 1979 to 1993, and Roger Novelly of Medford, N.J., who was employed by 
Honda from 1981 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at American Honda said the company would not comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, businessmen Joe Flynn and the late Robert Mendelsohn 
retained Philadelphia lawyer Raymond Hovsepian to assist them in acquiring the 
Hammonton Honda franchise. Hovsepian represented himself as an expert in 
automotive franchise law with special knowledge of Honda because of his 
longstanding representation of the Martin Organization, one of the largest 
automotive dealerships in Delaware Valley, Pa., the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hovsepian's legal assistance, the Martin Organization, which is currently 
owned and operated by the estate of Martin L. Lustgarten, acquired numerous 
Honda and Acura dealerships nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that, after retaining Hovsepian and forwarding to Honda an 
application for the Hammonton franchise, Flynn and Mendelsohn received a letter 
from Hovsepian demanding a $250,000 kickback in return for a letter of intent 
that would have virtually guaranteed them the Hammonton franchise. Hovsepian 
allegedly told the plaintiffs that the $250,000 would be split equally among 
himself and four Honda executives. 
</P>
<P>
 When Flynn and Mendelsohn refused to pay the kickback, the lawsuit alleges, 
Honda refused to process the application. The Hammonton franchise was never 
awarded to Flynn and Mendelsohn. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that Honda either knew about or was recklessly 
indifferent to unlawful conduct spanning 12 years and involving high-level 
employees and officers. Moreover, the suit charges that, even after Honda 
became aware of the illegal conduct in 1991, the company failed to remove the 
executives and officers involved in the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen former executives of American Honda were either indicted or pleaded 
guilty March 14 in a New Hampshire district court for accepting money and gifts 
in exchange for choice dealerships and hard-to-get cars. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda said at the time that it was "outraged and saddened" by the 
indictments and guilty pleas, which were announced by federal prosecutors in 
Concord, N.H. Honda said that it would take legal action to recover damages 
from all former officials who defrauded the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda also said that it was formulating a financial disclosure policy for all 
senior executives who make major decisions. The measure may be unprecedented in 
the auto industry, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former executives allegedly gave or received about $10 million in gifts, 
bribes and kickbacks from 1979 to 1992. As many as 40 dealers among American 
Honda's 1,300 Honda and Acura dealerships were involved, federal prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments are the result of a 1991 lawsuit against American Honda by 
Richard Nault, a former Concord, N.H., Acura dealer. Nault charged that Honda 
executives gave a rival dealer in Nashua, N.H., preference in choosing which 
cars to sell. That suit was settled last year, reportedly for more than $5 
million. But testimony in the case opened a nationwide investigation by the FBI 
that led to the indictments and guilty pleas in New Hampshire.

ANALYST WITHDRAWS 'BUY' ON MERCER; INVESTING: HE SAYS THE FIRM SHOULD EXPLAIN 
$14-MILLION TRADING LOSS AND METHOD OF CALCULATING EARNINGS FROM PAPER MILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Weinress, an analyst for L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankson Inc. of 
Irvine, has withdrawn his "buy" recommendation on Mercer International after 
questioning the company's accounting and disclosure practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinress said in a report to investors this week that Mercer owes them an 
explanation of a $14-million trading loss and its method for calculating 
operating earnings from its paper mills. He is the only analyst who has 
followed the company closely in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinress also criticized Mercer for not making its chief financial officer, 
Mike Smith, available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer, originally formed as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust, is 
incorporated in Washington state and based in Vancouver, Canada. The company 
has interests in financial services worldwide and in several paper mills in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is in Germany negotiating the purchase of another paper mill from the 
government, a company official said last week. Weinress is also out of town not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 William Atkinson, Mercer's vice chairman, said the analyst was meeting with 
company officials Wednesday to resolve "significant misunderstandings." 
</P>
<P>
 According to financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the company reported a $14-million loss on its investment in 
Industry Secco, an Italian company formerly traded on the Milan stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinress said he did not know about the investment or the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the fact that we have been following the company since November 
of 1993 and spent time with management, it seems peculiar that we were not made 
aware of an investment of this magnitude nor the potential liability," he wrote 
in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said the investment was made several years ago, and Mercer decided to 
write down its holdings in Secco after trading of the company's stock was 
suspended in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people were under the impression that this investment was somehow 
kept secret," he said. "This investment had been on our balance sheet for some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Mercer's revenue is generated by the company's paper mill 
investments. Mercer already owns two mills and is negotiating to buy a third, 
although the talks have stalled because of rising pulp prices, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the company's financial statements, the paper mills generated 
$57.1 million in revenue last year, of which $29.8 million was subsidies from 
the German government. In other words, the mills generated $27.3 million, less 
than their $34.7 million in operating costs, according to the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinress said Mercer told him government subsidies would be used only to 
offset losses on the plants. As a result, the analyst concluded, Mercer was 
able to post profit from operations of $9.6 million instead of a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the supplements and after the investment loss, the company would have 
lost money on operations," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson, however, said the terms of the subsidies changed. Instead of simply 
providing "loss guarantees," the German government gave Mercer complete control 
over more than $42 million in subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were to be used as additional revenue at our discretion," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to book the remaining $12.2 million in subsidies as revenue 
in 1994, he said.

previous 12 months. Annual revenue was $3 million, compared to $3.7 million for 
1992. The company attributed the 1993 results to its lack of operating capital

JUDGE'S WALL STREET EXPERTISE SERVES JUSTICE WELL; PROFILE: MILTON POLLACK, WHO 
SORTED OUT THE DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT MESS, CONTINUES TO HEAR CASES AT 87. HIS 
LEGAL CAREER BEGAN BEFORE THE 1929 CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB WELLS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 87 years of age, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack has seen his share of 
financial disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 His career as a securities lawyer started two weeks before the 1929 stock 
market crash. Sixty years later that experience helped him clean up a 
multibillion-dollar mess stemming from the fall of Michael Milken and Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., once one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banks, 
which collapsed into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, nothing has changed," Pollack said in an interview, comparing the 
similarities between 1929 and the yuppie era of the 1980s. "The greed incentive 
still remains as the driving catalyst for the excesses that occur on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has changed is the manner in which the cases are presented." 
</P>
<P>
 The Drexel case solidified Pollack's stature as a Wall Street legend, a 
gray-haired, seemingly mild-mannered judge with a reputation for making 
high-priced attorneys squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight telephone calls, harsh face-to-face meetings and a piercing intellect 
are tools he employs to force resolution of octopus-like litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've appeared before him a number of times over the years and I would say 
that he's about one of the smartest people I've ever dealt with on the bench," 
said Stanley S. Arkin, a veteran defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be very careful to get on the right side of him. He's a man (who) 
has a lot of common sense, and laced with toughness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That toughness was displayed last year when he grilled Milken, the ex-Drexel 
financier and convicted felon who appeared on the witness stand for two former 
clients, Victor and Steven Posner. The father-and-son investment team later was 
convicted of civil securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent decision, Pollack criticized Milken as an evasive witness 
unable to "accept the fact that he has done wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Posners, Pollack ordered them barred from serving as officers or 
directors of any public company and ordered them to repay about $4 million they 
gained from one of their businesses. Pollack described the two as "legendary 
people in the sense of being barracudas when it came to dealing with other 
people's money and other people's businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Few attorneys interviewed about Pollack offered criticism of the judge. Those 
who did wouldn't speak on the record but generally complained about the 
pressure to arrive at settlements and his occasional tongue-lashings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack admits he can be tough on lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't allow the inconvenience of their having to come here to interfere 
with what I wanted to find out," he said from his office in Manhattan federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack clearly enjoys his work, putting in eight-hour days, then plowing 
through cases after dinner. "My theory of longevity is the harder you work, the 
longer you live," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the spirit that led Pollack to resolve what could be one of the 
biggest, most complex financial cases of all time -- the civil litigation 
surrounding Drexel and Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Drexel bankruptcy case first came before him in 1990, claims against 
the fallen junk bond house vastly exceeded the $3 billion in assets set aside 
for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 180 lawsuits were filed against Drexel, which Milken had built into one 
of the most aggressive securities firms through its dealings in junk bonds, the 
high-risk, high-yield IOUs that proliferated in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Pollack gave final approval to a $1.3-billion settlement of the 
Milken-related litigation. Pollack calls resolution of the cases his 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorabilia of the event decorate his spacious office: There are framed 
courtroom sketches of a Feb. 18, 1991, hearing (called on the President's Day 
holiday so attorneys couldn't use the excuse of conflicting cases) in which the 
outline of the agreement was concluded. There is also a framed, single sheet of 
legal paper that contains the scribbled terms of the Drexel agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As a judge on senior status, Pollack can refuse to take cases, leaving him to 
focus on large, complex litigation. Attorneys in the Drexel case also gave him 
wide discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This entire group of lawyers got together and gave me carte blanche to talk 
to anybody on any subject at anytime without the encumbrance of anybody else 
being present," Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack stayed in touch with the numerous attorneys despite a crisis in his 
personal life -- a severe heart attack suffered by his wife, Moselle. While she 
was hospitalized in Houston, Pollack made telephone calls from a doctor's 
office to the attorneys to ensure that they were meeting his deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack's wife figured into another aspect of the Drexel case. In 1988, 
lawyers for Drexel and Milken tried to remove Pollack from hearing a Securities 
and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the defendants. They argued that the 
judge's impartiality was in question because Pollack's wife stood to gain $30 
million from a buyout of her company, Palais Royal, which Drexel helped 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal appeals court upheld Pollack's decision to stay on the Drexel case. 
Ironically, Drexel was later represented by another law firm that specifically 
asked Pollack to oversee the subsequent bankruptcy case two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's best known for work on the Drexel case, Pollack made his mark 
long before then. As a private practicing attorney, Pollack won a $4.5-million 
shareholder lawsuit against General Motors Corp. in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack ran his own law firm, specializing in securities law, from 1945 to 
1967, the year President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 As a judge, not all his cases have involved the arcane world of securities 
law. In 1975, he sentenced to 27 months in prison one of the members in the 
Weatherman Underground, convicted of a plot to bomb the federal building as a 
protest against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack also issued a ruling allowing Concorde supersonic jets to land at John 
F. Kennedy Airport in New York, and issued a decision that allowed regulators 
access to secretive Swiss bank accounts to prosecute insider-trading cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One way he has kept abreast of the fast-moving changes over the years is by 
paying special attention to ideas from his young law clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bring a new dimension to what you're doing. And you have to keep up with 
them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack remains close to many of his clerks, all of whom gather for annual 
reunion dinners. Peter Wang, a clerk in 1973, recalls when the dinners started 
off as small affairs. Now they rent a ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last gathering, the normally private Pollack gave a short speech 
offering insight into the sacrifices necessary to be on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges may not lead the ideal life that many people think they do," he said. 
"Being a judge is a lonely job, professionally and socially. They can't allow 
themselves to show the same range of emotions that other professionals can show 
during their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges start keeping even their old friends at arms length."

DRESSED UP FOR THE MOVIES; GOING THE MONTY PYTHON ROUTE, KIDS IN THE HALL 
LEAVING TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Coming soon to a theater near you: The Kids in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you heard of them? They're in the final season of a TV series critics 
love that's been running for five years. They just got a movie deal with 
Paramount Pictures. They're managed by the same group that handles Robin 
Williams and Billy Crystal. They're currently selling out theaters on a live 
tour, including two performances tonight at the Wadsworth Theater in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still doesn't ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
 If not, you're not alone. For five exhausting seasons, the five-man Canadian 
troupe has written and acted in more than 700 comedy sketches for "The Kids in 
the Hall," an absurdly funny TV series that films 10 long months a year, both 
in the studio and on location. 
</P>
<P>
 But their half-hour show, which is wildly popular north of the border in prime 
time, airs on a ragtag lineup of CBS stations in this country at 12:35 a.m. on 
Fridays, one of the worst time slots in television, with virtually no network 
promotion. Comedy Central shows nightly reruns of the series, but the cable 
channel can only be seen in one-third of all television homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Kids -- Dave Foley, Mark McKinney, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson 
and Bruce McCulloch -- are choosing to end their TV series to try to make the 
risky leap to feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the few unanimous decisions we've ever made in our lives," said 
Foley last week, speaking by cellular phone on a tour bus driving from Toronto 
to Ottawa, with Elvis Costello blaring in the background. The performers, all 
in their 30s, are taking time out from TV production to do an eight-day tour 
with stops in Seattle, San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything, we just thought we were getting old," Foley said. "We 
figured we can't be the Kids in the Hall forever. We want to do some other 
projects before the troupe loses its will to work together. We wanted to make a 
movie, and we didn't think we would ever find time if we kept doing the series. 
The series eats up our whole lives. We don't have friends. We never see our 
wives." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Kids in the Hall may not be big names in America, neither were the 
six members of Britain's Monty Python when they wrapped their TV series after 
only 45 episodes -- compared to 110 for "The Kids in the Hall." "Monty Python's 
Flying Circus" didn't pick up steam in this country until after it had ceased 
production in 1974. The members pursued solo careers and periodically 
reassembled for a string of successful movies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's roughly what the Kids have in mind.  
</P>
<P>
 "You only have so many three-minute ideas in your head," McDonald said. "It's 
getting harder and harder to create a little world in three minutes. You have 
to think of a good ending every time, and that's the hardest thing. The only 
way to keep our comedy going is to move to the next forum, which would be a 
movie. Either that or opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Python, the Kids have developed something of a cult following here for 
their bawdy humor, and they routinely dress in drag when their comedy calls for 
women. They're recycling TV skits on a minimalist stage for their current tour, 
including one about two secretaries probing the new man in the office to find 
out if he is gay, and another in which five men playing poker talk about how 
they wish they were women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kids in the Hall opened last week to a crowd in Ottawa who screamed and 
applauded when their favorite TV characters appeared throughout the show -- 
such as the Chicken Lady, the mutated offspring of a farm boy and a barnyard 
fowl. The man who brought the Kids to America, "Saturday Night Live" creator 
Lorne Michaels, says it's that way no matter where they play, in the United 
States or Canada. He said more people come up to him on the street in this 
country to inquire about the Kids than any of the other comedians he has 
shepherded to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is these shows will still be watched in 20 years," Michaels said 
of "Kids in the Hall," which debuted in America three years ago on pay cable's 
Home Box Office, before moving to CBS in 1992 and becoming the second 
highest-rated show on Comedy Central. New episodes will air through December 
before the series goes dark. "The fans tend to be very devoted. Whenever the 
Kids play live, it's always a sell-out, and that can be in Boulder, Colo. So 
they must be reaching a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kids have four or five vague ideas for their feature film, ranging from a 
period piece about beatnik poets in Greenwich Village, to a story that takes 
place in the middle of a jungle, to a movie involving karaoke. Two days after 
the TV series finishes production in July, the Kids are going to a private 
retreat in Northern Ontario to write the movie together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's ahead for the group -- that depends on how our movie 
does," Thompson said. "Even if it's a huge hit, I think we will have to take a 
break from each other. We've been together so long, and we all are itching to 
do solo projects. Some of us will fail, some of us won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley is the first to get a major supporting role in the upcoming movie "Pat," 
one of Michaels' many "Saturday Night Live" movie spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in features, the Kids won't have to deal with the hassles of network 
TV. Their series also airs on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., where standards 
are loose compared to American broadcast television. When the Kids began airing 
on CBS, they had to deal with grief from the network over language and some 
dark humor dealing with drugs, suicide, homosexuality and bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last fight I was involved with was a sketch called 'Grizzly,' which shows 
my ass twice," McDonald said. "I had a fight with CBS to get in two ass shots. 
We won. In the sketch, Mark and I drive up to this club north of Toronto in the 
woods, because we're horny bastards and we want to hit on women. We don't 
realize it's a gay bar. There's also a known grizzly in the area. A big hairy 
gay man comes after me, grabs my crotch and tries to hit on me. I flash back to 
when I was a Boy Scout and the leader said, 'Whenever you're caught by a 
grizzly play dead.' So I do, and he takes me home and has his way with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kids often shoot two versions of scenes now to pacify network executives. 
This season, they actually began using the F word in Canada. "We've sort of 
broken that barrier," McCulloch said. "You can only say it when you're really 
mad, or if you spill something hot on yourself. For the CBS version, we might 
say, 'Oh knackers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We win more of the TV skirmishes than we ever thought we would," McDonald 
said. "The ones we lose we go out and drink and complain about them, but at 
least it's fun because we're drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 McCulloch said that five years doesn't seem like a long time compared to TV 
shows that run for 10 years or more. "But five years for us has been a marathon 
effort when you have to create seven or eight new sketches every week," he 
said. "Right from the beginning, we were cognizant of trying not to repeat 
characters too much. We all joke about hacks, and we don't want to be ones. 
Being a hack is not about compromising for us, it's just about doing the same 
thing too much or too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now the Kids, who just flew in from San Francisco, are enjoying their 
tour. They started out on stage in the mid-1980s, when they were in their 20s 
with full-time jobs and still wrote 90 minutes of new material for a weekly 
stage show in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done this in a couple years," Foley said. "We're sort of playing 
hooky to do this tour. When we were talking about doing another season of the 
show last year, we asked production to find time for us to get out on the road 
again. Largely because it's fun, and it reminds us of when we started out. In a 
stage show, you can do anything you want at the moment, and not worry about 
whether you're screwing up a scene. That's kind of liberating."

FILMMAKER STILL TRYING TO SHED HITLER'S STIGMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For at least 50 of her 91 years, through court cases and memoirs and, now, a 
three-hour documentary, Nazi Germany's genius filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl has 
been struggling to clear her name of its Third Reich tinge. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of what many consider to be the world's greatest propaganda film, 
"Triumph of the Will," portrays herself as an unwitting or unwilling adjunct to 
evil's inner circle: She never wanted to make her brilliant film on the 1934 
National Socialists Party meeting in Nuremberg, but Hitler wouldn't take no for 
an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Riefenstahl says she was either out of town or out of touch during Nazi book 
burnings, the "Crystal Night" destruction of synagogues and businesses and the 
daily persecution of Jews, Gypsies and political opponents. Like most Germans 
of her time, she says she did not learn of the extermination of 6 million Jews 
until after World War II. American, French and German tribunals exonerated her 
of Nazi activity. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why at the end of Ray Mueller's documentary "The Wonderful Horrible 
Life of Leni Riefenstahl," which opens today at the Nuart Theatre, Riefenstahl 
looks earnestly into the camera and asks, "What am I guilty of?" 
</P>
<P>
 She really doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview at her home in southern Germany, Riefenstahl insists that 
her mistake in life has been to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have had it very easy if only I had lied," she says. She was a 
prisoner of the French after the war. "They said if you write here that you 
knew about Auschwitz, then you are free, you can make films, everything. They 
wanted that I lie. They didn't believe that I didn't know this. How can I be 
guilty if I didn't know this?" 
</P>
<P>
 That Riefenstahl ignored infinite evil and served the interests of Nazism in 
pursuit of her own film career was clear to just about everyone but herself. 
After the war she became persona non grata and was unable to complete any 
serious film work again. 
</P>
<P>
 Riefenstahl's life is itself something of a triumph of will. She dropped out 
of sight to photograph the Nuba people in Africa in the 1960s and she went 
underwater at age 72. The nonagenarian has just returned from nine weeks of 
scuba diving, five in Tanzania, four in the Seychelles. She has stopped work on 
an underwater video to stay at her house above Starnberger Lake for a few days, 
arranging details of a Japanese exhibition of her still photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 She bounds down the stairs into a sitting room wearing black leggings, an 
indigo satin blouse and patent leather shoes. She has the thighs of a 
20-year-old, the manicured hands of a woman half her age and tremendous energy. 
Only a slight curve in her spine hints at the sum of her years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many ask me how it is possible that I am able at my age to make this film," 
Riefenstahl said. "I think there are several reasons. You know every person who 
loves their work can do more than normal people. And from the beginning, I 
always had to fight -- and the fight, if you are the winner, makes you strong." 
</P>
<P>
 She considers herself a winner, dogged as she is by questions she has answered 
so many times that her words now spill out as question and answer together. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning they said that I was the lover of Hitler, or Leni has taken 
a Gypsy child (from a concentration camp) or Leni was in Poland and has seen 
how Jews were shot. Nothing, not a little bit was true," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This much, however, she readily admits in her autobiography, "Leni 
Riefenstahl: A Memoir." In the 1930s, the beautiful young actress from "The 
Sacred Mountain" and director of "The Blue Light" had intimate conversations 
with Hitler, who would call her to the Chancellery and other residences when he 
needed someone to talk to. She had a power struggle with Hitler's Propaganda 
Minister, Josef Goebbels, who hated her, she says, because she spurned him as a 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riefenstahl wills that the world see things her way: She was never a member of 
the Nazi Party. She says she is simply honest for admitting what others deny -- 
that she was taken in by Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at what Germans said after the war, all were against Hitler. I am 
the only one who had the courage (to admit my sympathy). . . . There were some 
people who were against Hitler from the beginning, Thomas Mann, several people. 
But that was the minority," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler asked her to make a Nazi Party film after seeing "The Blue Light." She 
made "The Victory of Faith" in 1933 and, the following year, the 
better-financed and more successful "Triumph," a romantic film about Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 The film begins with Hitler's plane descending from the clouds, and with the 
text: "Sixteen years after the beginning of German misery, 19 months after the 
beginning of Germany's renaissance. . . ." The Fuehrer is seen with happy 
children, with throbbing crowds and goose-stepping troops. Riefenstahl's 
innovative camera work from below makes Hitler appear a giant, benevolent 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have called it a passionate film, technically astounding and a 
masterpiece of propaganda. It is still shown in film schools around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riefenstahl is adamant that it was a documentary. She says she knew about 
making "good pictures, not politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ach, I didn't even know what propaganda was. I couldn't even make a 
television ad. . . . The money did not come from the party, because the party 
was against me. Goebbels was not my friend. . . . Hitler wanted it. Hitler knew 
that I was gifted. That was my tragedy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, Riefenstahl has catalogued her life in color-coded binders neatly 
filed in white cabinets next to her editing room. The filing is organized by 
country -- gray for Germany, red for America, orange for England -- and by 
film. From a yellow file on "Olympia," her masterpiece on the 1936 Olympic 
Games in Berlin, she has pulled two reviews from 1938 editions of the Los 
Angeles Times and the Hollywood Citizen. The writers assert that her film was 
"a triumph for the camera" and "a magnificent film" -- but not propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Olympia," for which Riefenstahl received an Olympic gold medal, also has been 
called the greatest sports film ever made. To get her shots of the strongest 
and fastest men on Earth, she placed her cameras in pits, on pulleys and poles, 
setting the standard for sports photography. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to Riefenstahl, one senses that she laments her decisions early in 
life not because she served a devil, but because they made the rest of her life 
so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 She has regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that Hitler was an anti-Semite, but nobody had the idea that he would 
do such inhuman things," Riefenstahl says. "I wish that I had never made 
'Triumph.' I think I would have had the chance after the war to work in 
Hollywood. . . . Even my enemies say that I am very talented." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrets, but no guilt. 
</P>
<P>

L.A. PHILHARMONIC ANNOUNCES 76TH YEAR; MUSIC: THE ORCHESTRA'S 27-WEEK WINTER 
SEASON WILL OPEN OCT. 6 WITH WORKS OF 20TH-CENTURY COMPOSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and Ernest 
Fleischmann, the orchestra's executive vice president and managing director, 
have announced the Philharmonic's 1994-95 winter season, the orchestra's 31st 
year in residence at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This 76th L.A. Philharmonic season opens Oct. 6, when Salonen conducts a 
program of 20th-Century works: Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony, the Piano 
Concerto by the late Witold Lutoslawski and Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps." 
</P>
<P>
 It ends, May 25-28, 1995, with four concert performances of Tchaikovsky's last 
opera, "Iolanta," conducted by Russian musician Valery Gergiev, and sung by 
five soloists from the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, and the Los Angeles 
Master Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 The season comprises 27 weeks of programs, 12 of which will be led by Salonen, 
in his third year at the helm of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>

British isles in their debuts here, Donald Runnicles (music director of San 
Francisco Opera) and Mark Wigglesworth; former LAPO music director Zubin Mehta; 
Simon Rattle, James de Preist, Mark Elder, Lawrence Foster, Eri Klas and Franz 
Welser-Most.

RECALLING GLENN GOULD: AN INSPIRED INTROVERT; MUSIC: THE ARTIST IN THE FILM 
BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE MAN WHO LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK. BUT NO ONE 
EVER PLAYED AS HE DID, AND NO ONE COULD PERSUASIVELY IMITATE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Colm Feore, a remarkably sensitive actor, gets to play a genial, eccentric, 
self-obsessed, self-possessed pianist in "Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn 
Gould." Significantly, however, he never gets to play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be just as well. Some things are hard to fake. Ask Charlton Heston, 
who was more convincing when he parted the Red Sea in "The Ten Commandments" 
than when he conducted a symphony orchestra in "Counterpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glenn Gould who emerges in Francois Girard's episodic quasi-biography 
bears a striking resemblance to the Glenn Gould who left an indelible mark on 
music and music-making in the 1950s and '60s. The film, vaguely structured in 
the manner of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations -- which Gould turned into something 
of a heroic signature piece -- depicts the protagonist as a man of many faces 
and many quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes canny use of his recordings on the soundtrack, and even resorts to 
some Wagner as background music (which Gould would have despised). The film 
seldom lapses, however, into the phony reverence that so often accompanies high 
art on the big screen, and it makes few technical mistakes (apart from 
insistently confusing a recital with a concert ). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this fascinating portrait cannot show Glenn Gould in action. No one 
ever played as he did, and no one could persuasively imitate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who heard Gould, and those who continue to savor his work on CDs, know 
him as a thinking-person's pianist. He was a musician who valued clarity over 
passion. He commanded a dazzling technique, a vast dynamic scale and a crisp 
sense of rhythm. He paid a lot of attention to matters of architecture, to 
linear propulsion and subtle detail. He all but ignored the pedal and the fuzzy 
generalities it induced. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, perhaps, he dared take liberties. He paid little attention to 
tradition, to easy effect and, ultimately, to audience communication. He was 
the pianist who inspired a friendly collaborator, none less than Leonard 
Bernstein, to make a pre-performance speech disowning an unorthodox 
interpretation of Brahms' D-minor Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw Gould -- and, given his penchant for cancellation, that wasn't 
always easy -- will not forget him. I saw him for the first time in a recital 
at Jordan Hall in Boston. The year must have been 1955. He arrived on stage a 
half-hour late, confounding the skeptics who predicted he would not arrive at 
all. His attire looked slept in and several sizes too large. His hair gave new 
meaning to the concept of unruly. His gait added new dimension to the concept 
of gawky. 
</P>
<P>
 He had brought along his own slightly battered, antique Steinway. He never 
left home without it. He insisted on his own chair -- some 14 inches low -- 
plus cushion and carpet. A trusty glass of Poland water awaited him atop the 
otherwise empty music-stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the audience cheered his loping entrance, he took little notice. He 
slouched into his mini-seat -- placed as far from the keyboard as possible -- 
extended his extensive arms, buried his head as close as possible to his lap, 
closed his eyes, and started to play. Magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
 He also started to sing, hum, grunt, moan, roar and conduct. He stirred the 
air with any fingers, feet or arms that did not happen to be more directly 
engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 If another pianist had put on an act like this, the viewers would have laughed 
at best, scoffed at worst. Gould, however, defied scorn. An inspired introvert, 
he was trying to impress only himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring from the stage must have caused him no pain. His last appearance -- 
never announced as such -- happened to take place in Los Angeles on April 10, 
1964. The locale was the modest Wilshire Ebell Theatre, though you'd never 
recognize it in the current movie. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gould had excused himself from a previous engagement here in January, the 
management tried to mollify ticket-holders by showing a documentary. Albert 
Goldberg, The Times' chief critic at the time and an authority on pianists, 
chose not to give this one a second chance. He sent a stringer to review the 
recital. Dion Winans loved the Bach and Hindemith, deplored the Beethoven and 
the mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
 A new generation eventually got to know Gould as a writer, recording virtuoso, 
interviewer, composer, broadcaster, recluse and self-inventing legend. Many 
converts to the cause revered him primarily as the man behind the soundtrack -- 
Bach, of course -- in "Slaughterhouse Five." 
</P>
<P>
 The eccentric genius was only 50 when he died in 1982. He hadn't entered a 
concert hall for 18 years.

A DIFFICULT STAGE IN LIFE; YOUNG PERFORMERS DO BATTLE AGAINST BUTTERFLIES AS 
THEY AUDITION TO MAKE IT INTO HUNTINGTON BEACH'S 'SCHOOL WITHIN A SCHOOL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a sunny Saturday morning, the kind of day when a teen-ager might go to 
the beach for a picnic, maybe bike down to the mall for a double burger and 
fries. 
</P>
<P>
 But food and frolic are the last things on Sarah Miller's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sick," says Sarah, 14, as she stands in the vestibule of the 
Huntington Beach High School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not the only one. About 100 other teens -- mostly girls -- are also here 
suffering from different degrees of the same affliction. 
</P>
<P>
 Their queasiness comes from the fact that they are about to audition for the 
School for the Performing Arts (SPA), a little-known opportunity for 
stage-struck young hopefuls who are willing to trade basketball-game afternoons 
and teen-age nights for arduous hours of additional studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Milling about in groups or sticking close to their mothers, these wanna-be 
actors, singers, musicians and dancers have stage fright. They're afraid they 
might not be accepted for the coming school year. And they're not ashamed to 
admit any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so nervous," says Sarah, a Santa Ana resident. "I really want to get 
in. It's really important I get in." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little nervous," says Huntington Beach resident Lauren Anderson, 13, 
who, like Sarah, is in the eighth grade. "But I'm pretty used to being nervous 
because I've already done plays and dance (productions). I know I'll get 
butterflies right before and once I get in I'll be fine. So I say to myself, 'I 
know it'll be OK.' I'm just excited, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students -- such as Sarah and Lauren, are auditioning to be admitted to 
the tuition-free public school for the first time. Others are auditioning to 
stayin. 
</P>
<P>
 SPA student Sarah Reichert, 17, says she's a "little more nervous than last 
year. Last year there weren't as many people. And we're really nervous because 
we've heard a lot more really good actors want to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 This Sarah, a Marina High School cheerleader who this year at SPA is enrolled 
in musical theater and dance, says she'll today audition for drama and show 
choir. She says her school day now typically runs from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m., not 
including productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work," she says. "But I've wanted to be an actress ever since I 
was 6, and the experience is really great." 
</P>
<P>
 Started just last September as a "school within a school" by the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District, SPA draws mostly students from that 
district's cities: Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also open to any teen-ager willing to transfer into one of the 
district's six high schools. (No one has to move there; students just have to 
arrange transportation.) 
</P>
<P>
 During the normal school day, students attend regular classes, then go to SPA 
until dinner time or later. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only about six students commute from outside the district (one is from 
Los Angeles County), but many more are expected this year, says coordinator 
Brandee Lara, who also teaches dance at SPA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting panicky calls from people who are just hearing about us," she 
says. "I tell them it's not too late, as we'll be holding more auditions." 
(Other auditions are scheduled for May 21 and June 4.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lara, formerly a professional actress, says SPA is one of about 16 public 
performing arts high schools in California. The only other one in the county is 
Orange County High School of the Arts (OCHSA) in Los Alamitos, a 
well-established program but a longer drive for South County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At SPA, students may take up to three programs from a menu that includes 
theater/drama; dance; chamber ensemble/orchestra; chamber/jazz choir; technical 
theater; musical theater and show choir; keyboard/electronic music/song writing 
and media/TV-video. 
</P>
<P>
 Each program meets for five hours a week plus additional rehearsals for 
productions that this year included "Little Shop of Horrors," a Christmas 
musical, dance concerts, a talent show, an evening of one-act plays, an 
original show for Westminster Mall, and a joint production with Golden West 
Community College of "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
 The school also is working with Golden West on a unique program whereby SPA 
students can use SPA classes as prerequisites to go immediately to advanced 
performing arts college classes. Similar arrangements are planned with the Cal 
State and UC systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara says the typical SPA student is "bright, creative, passionate, responsive 
and self-confident at least to the point where they recognize some kind of 
self-identity. It may not be the identity they end up with, but they recognize 
it, and this is the place to express it." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the program gives a needed place to bond with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some just plain need to communicate," she says. "It's their gang, so to 
speak. They don't all come from the best backgrounds: Here -- working long 
hours with each other -- they get that familial experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Girls outnumber boys 3 to 1. Why? Boys are receive negative peer pressure, 
says Lara. "No one wants to be the first one," she says. "But that's changing 
now as a result of our taking (productions) on tour to the other (district) 
schools. Suddenly singing and dancing wasn't just this sweet thing that boys 
perceived it to be. Now they're coming in to audition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lara, who before coming to join the eight-member staff of SPA was laid off 
from Huntington Beach High School because of budget cuts, says she's glad to be 
back in the district where she attended school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe in this," she says. "It's like working in (the movie) 
'Fame.' You walk around and hear singing in one room, musical instruments in 
another room, rehearsing lines in another and tap-dancing in the halls. It's an 
exciting conservatory atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledges that the new school isn't perfect. Grant money is needed, she 
says, to continue "at a high quality." That's why her priority now is to take 
the time to find more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 OCHSA had grants, she says, but SPA just started with $150,000 from the 
district to get the entire program off the ground, including renovations, a 
dance floor, a student center and staff salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much in our society is hard cold facts and very sterile things," she says. 
"If there aren't outlets for creative and inventive things, what will the 
future of society be? It's frightening to think of what could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program was the brainchild of Steve Schwartz, an SPA theater instructor 
who first proposed the idea five years ago when he worked as district 
coordinator. He says he then saw an alarming trend developing with regard to 
district performing arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were losing sections districtwide," he recalls. "One year, there'd be five 
drama classes, the next year three or four. Classes were literally disappearing 
for various and sundry reasons including budget cuts and state requirements for 
(non-arts) academic classes." 
</P>
<P>
 So Schwartz proposed a performing arts magnet school, an idea that was turned 
down by parents and teachers alike. "Even some teachers didn't think there 
would actually be a trend," he says. "There wasn't a lot of support, so I put 
the concept on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got worse, he says, with everything he predicted coming to 
fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whole departments were gone, then teachers were going to two schools to try 
to keep remaining programs going, a problem given that performing arts teachers 
need to do after-school programs," Schwartz says. "And you had things like 
music teachers also teaching drama. The quality greatly diminished, and kids 
were not getting experienced instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the district's "top talent" was leaving to go Los Alamitos, which 
further decimated district coffers, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Schwartz again proposed the idea, which was then studied by 
committee. The final proposal was approved by the school board in February of 
1993, despite opposition from some Fountain Valley parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were opposed even though they didn't even have a dance teacher," says 
Schwartz. "They still wanted their own programs. So we resolved that they could 
keep their introductory drama and vocal programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 300 who auditioned last year, 225 were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones who aren't accepted are ones who'd be psychologically hurt by being 
accepted," he says. "It's terrible to put a kid in a program over their heads. 
Self-esteem suffers. So we tell some to go back to their schools, take some 
introductory classes and then try again." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's more than satisfied with the level of SPA's productions but 
doesn't see SPA as yet on the level of OCHSA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a success, but it's going to take a couple of years to get there," he 
says. "We're still infants crawling, but our philosophy is different here. All 
of our staff are credentialed teachers plus professional performers. Over 
there, the majority are professionals who get an allowance to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing instructions from coordinator Lara, Sarah Miller walks with her 
mother to her drama audition. She will perform two monologues, she says, and 
has practiced her lines over and over in the car coming here today. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighborhood school drama department is not really good anymore," she 
says. "We have classes but no productions. It's important to be on stage and in 
front of people." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she first starting acting and singing while in elementary school and 
now aspires to be like Jodi Foster. "She plays a lot of strong woman roles," 
she says. "I don't want to be like Sharon Stone; she makes women look bad. I 
want to portray women in good ways -- as intelligent and strong -- rather than 
as stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 What if she doesn't get in? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'll do," she says. "Los Alamitos is too far away. But no 
matter what, I'll always do something in this field." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the long hours she'd have to work if accepted? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth it," she says. "I don't mind anything, as long as I get to act."

CAPITAL GAINS; IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IN THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, SEVERAL GENEROUS FRIENDS OF GEORGE AND THE GOP BECAME ENVOYS. 
NOW, SEVERAL FRIENDS OF BILL AND THE DEMOCRATS -- SOME WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE 
IN THE FOREIGN-SERVICE ARENA -- ARE GETTING APPOINTED TO VERY PLUM POSTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for a spring break far away from Washington's cold March rains and the 
incessant drip of Whitewater, President Clinton picked the seaside California 
home of M. Larry Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 A convenient vacancy had just freed up the 35-room mansion in the affluent 
community of Coronado, as Clinton well knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a week earlier, Lawrence, owner of the Hotel del Coronado and a major 
contributor to and fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, had moved to 
Switzerland to take up his new job as head of the U.S. Embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years of complaining about Republican appointments, it's the 
Democrats' turn to pass out high posts in pleasant places to contributors, 
friends of the First Family and others who provided timely support during the 
Clinton campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spoils system is alive and well," a senior foreign service officer 
complained. "The only difference between this Administration and the last is 
that the appointments are a bit less unqualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 86 Clinton nominees confirmed in senior diplomatic posts as of March, more 
than 40% have come from outside the career foreign service, State Department 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Many choices have been praised, including that of former presidential 
candidate and vice president Walter F. Mondale. During his brief tenure as 
ambassador to Japan, he has helped resolve a nagging trade dispute over 
cellular phones and soothed worries over gun violence that has claimed the 
lives of several Japanese students in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Establishment also reacted favorably to the announcement March 
22 that the diplomatic plum of plums -- ambassadorship to Britain -- would go 
to retired Adm. William J. Crowe. Backing by the former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff helped candidate Clinton fend off attacks on his lack of 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a splendid choice. Crowe will make a real contribution," said F. Allen 
(Tex) Harris, president of the American Foreign Service Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although every job given to a non-career ambassador takes one away from his 
membership, he said, "Our primary concern is not so much the ratio of career to 
political appointees as the ratio of qualified to unqualified appointees." 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter category, Harris put Lawrence, whose nomination -- alone among 
Clinton choices -- was opposed by every major foreign-service organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the San Diego hotel magnate, who with his family and business gave 
nearly $200,000 to the Democratic Party from 1987 to 1992, has no 
foreign-policy experience. 
</P>
<P>
 During his confirmation hearings, he committed several gaffes, such as calling 
Switzerland a U.S. ally even though the small European country is practically a 
synonym for neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid it's just not a good appointment," said Sen. Richard Lugar 
(R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which, despite 
its Democratic majority, failed to approve the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence passed the full Senate, however, after what foreign-service sources 
said was extraordinary arm-twisting by Republican as well as Democratic power 
brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago when we objected strongly to a number of Bush nominees and it 
looked like some might lose, pressure was applied by the Democrats," a retired 
foreign-service officer recalled. "The Democrats said, 'We have our own fat 
cats so we can't afford to vote against these guys because the wheel is going 
to turn some day.' Four years later, history pretty much repeated itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Switzerland by telephone, Lawrence said he had been unfairly 
targeted and was qualified for his job by virtue of his background in 
international banking, finance and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people identify me with the Hotel del Coronado, but that only represents 
20% of my business," he said. "I've had 56 companies doing business around the 
world, I've negotiated in Mexico and represented Congress in loan negotiations 
with Israel. I've been chairman of an economic advisory board in California and 
done many things in government." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence also said he had raised "millions upon millions of dollars" for the 
Democrats. He said he had been working for the party "since I was walking 
precincts with my mother in Chicago" and noted that he had been offered 
ambassadorships by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson but turned 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clinton's immediate predecessor, President Bush, nominated 11 campaign 
contributors of $100,000 or more to senior diplomatic posts, Clinton has so far 
named five. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lawrence, they are: Ambassador to Austria Swanee Hunt, an oil heiress 
who with her family gave more than $300,000 to the Democrats, according to the 
Federal Election Commission; Ambassador to the Netherlands K. Terry Dornbush, 
an Atlanta investor and contributor of $250,000; Ambassador to Denmark Edward 
Elson, who gave $180,000; and Ambassador to France Pamela Harriman, the doyenne 
of Democratic fund-raisers, who gave $130,000 and raised millions more. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bankrollers awarded ambassadorships are Alan Blinken, who gave nearly 
$50,000, Belgium; and Thomas Siebert, nearly $30,000, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugar, one of the Senate's most respected foreign-affairs experts, also voted 
against Dornbush; Siebert, a well-connected Washington lawyer; and Sidney 
Williams, a Hollywood Mercedes-Benz dealer who is married to Rep. Maxine Waters 
(D-Los Angeles) and got the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared to me there were no conspicuous qualifications of any of the four 
for the countries for which they were nominated," Lugar said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He also expressed reservations about the still-unconfirmed choice of Derek 
Shearer, a professor at Occidental College and brother-in-law of Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, as ambassador to Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doling out ambassadorships this way is a tradition nearly as old as the 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, politicians of the highest order -- Benjamin Franklin and Thomas 
Jefferson among them -- were sent abroad to represent U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But "beginning with Andrew Jackson, continuing through Ulysses S. Grant and 
even Woodrow Wilson, chiefs of U.S. missions were chosen largely from the ranks 
of the president's friends and supporters," wrote former Sen. Charles McC. 
Mathias Jr. in an article reprinted in the book "The Modern Ambassador." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassadorial caliber improved after the creation of a career foreign service 
in 1924. The ratio of career to non-career appointees has steadily increased, 
from about 50-50 between the two World Wars to 70-30 in most recent 
Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every distinguished non-career ambassador, such as W. Averell 
Harriman, late husband of the new ambassador to France, there have also been 
"ticking time bombs," in the words of Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md). 
</P>
<P>
 One that exploded was Vincent de Roulet. 
</P>
<P>
 An article by George Crile reprinted in "The Modern Ambassador' says that de 
Roulet, named ambassador to Jamaica after contributing $75,000 to Richard 
Nixon's 1968 campaign, got off to a less than rousing start when he referred to 
Jamaicans as "children," denigrated the island as a tourist destination and 
jeopardized its other key industry, bauxite, by delaying approval of U.S. loan 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 When de Roulet claimed before Congress to have gotten a promise from 
then-Prime Minister Michael Manley not to nationalize U.S. bauxite interests, 
Manley declared the ambassador "persona non grata." This after the American, 
hoping for a posher post in Europe, had already promised Nixon's lawyer, 
Herbert Kalmbach, $400,000 for the 1972 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmbach pleaded guilty in 1974 to trying to "sell" a European embassy to 
another U.S. ambassador in the Caribbean for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Administration brought other embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
 Oilman William A. Wilson was forced to resign as envoy to the Vatican after it 
was revealed that he met secretly in 1985 with Moammar Kadafi, the Libyan 
leader whose country and compound U.S. forces later bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend of Ron, Sam H. Zakhem, a Colorado politician named ambassador 
to Bahrain, made headlines during the 1987-88 Persian Gulf crisis, when the 
U.S. Navy provided escorts for Kuwaiti oil tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 After U.S. forces sank an Iranian gunboat, Zakhem suggested to reporters that 
the Navy hold captured Iranian sailors hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, he was indicted for promoting the Kuwaiti cause in the 1990-91 
Persian Gulf War without registering as a foreign agent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a senior Senate staffer, the "high water mark" for money-based 
ambassadorial appointments came under President Bush, himself a non-career 
ambassador to China and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, which must confirm nominees, refused to vote on several Bush 
choices, including Joy A. Silverman, a New York socialite whose family 
complained about the size of the ambassadorial residence in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Bush choices denigrated at their nominations turned out well. 
</P>
<P>
 An Australian diplomat recalled that when Melvin Sembler arrived in 1989, 
Australians expected the worst. Long the recipients of non-career ambassadors, 
they dubbed Edward Clark, a pick of Johnson's, "Mr. Ed" after American 
television's talking horse. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sembler -- one of two Florida developers named ambassadors and known 
together as the "St. Petersburg Twins" -- worked hard at the job and wound up 
being widely liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a fool and he had great charm and style," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, actually prefer political appointees on 
the theory that they can more swiftly cut through red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want a ship visit, a call from the White House can work wonders," said 
retired Col. Jim Waggener, who served as defense and air attache in Australia 
under Californians Robert Nesen, a Cadillac dealer, and publisher Bill Lane. 
"If you want to organize a performance or a trade fair, a call to Hollywood or 
Wall Street can work wonders, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a personality-driven thing. If a sense of trust can be 
developed between the political appointee and the career people in an embassy, 
it can work beautifully," Waggener said. 
</P>
<P>
 So how will Lawrence fare so far from Coronado? 
</P>
<P>
 "Time and again these wealthy people turn out to be perfectly able," the 
senior Senate staffer said hopefully. "Besides, rich people give nice parties."

PERSONAL HEALTH; HERE'S THE RUB: YOU HAVE 2 HOURS

 Vigorous exercise can leave even trained athletes feeling achy a day or two 
later, a condition called "delayed onset muscle soreness." Sports massage is 
often recommended to ease the pain, although some studies have concluded it 
does not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, yet another study finds massage does reduce soreness -- and that it is 
best done two hours after exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, 14 subjects exercised the biceps and triceps muscles of their 
non-dominant arm. Two hours later, seven subjects lay still while researchers 
applied cream to the exercised areas. The others lay still while researchers 
applied the same cream and gave them a half-hour massage. 
</P>
<P>
 The massaged group reported fewer muscle aches later, says Lucille L. Smith, 
exercise physiologist at East Carolina University and one of seven researchers 
who published the study in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical 
Therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Massage probably works in part by reducing the movement of white blood cells 
to the exercised area, thought to be the first step in the inflammatory process 
leading to soreness, Smith speculates. KATHLEEN DOHENY

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; SO WHAT'S THE HASSLE?; EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
HAS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT, IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL 
INCIDENTS AND ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES FOR STUDENTS OR STAFF TO FILE COMPLAINTS. 
LIFTING THE TABOOS AND MAKING SUCH INFORMATION AVAILABLE COULD HAVE A 
FAR-REACHING IMPACT, BUT ONLY IF SUCH POLICIES ARE HEEDED.

<P>
 Ever since the highly publicized and controversial Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas 
flap, sexual harassment and its existence in the workplace and educational 
system has received considerable attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the growing concern, studies show that sexual harassment is still 
prevalent in high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent study conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the 
American Assn. of University of Women Educational Foundation, 85% of girls in 
grades eight to 11, and 76% of boys in the same grades reported experiencing 
unwelcome or unwarranted sexual behavior at least once in their school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another study, featured in Susan Strauss' 1992 book, "Sexual Harassment and 
Teens," revealed that 59% of sexual harassment experienced by teen-age females 
came from fellow students, while 30% was from teachers. The book also reported 
that 73% of the sexual harassment experiences were remarks, 59% touches, 52% 
gestures and 7% propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a state law that took effect in 1993, every school district has 
established a written policy on sexual harassment. The policies generally 
outline what is considered harassment and set up procedures for students or 
staff to follow when making complaints. In complying with the law, schools have 
been distributing copies of the policy and educating teachers and students 
about sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 While some instances of harassment are overt -- such as a teacher fondling a 
student -- others can be more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 One Orange County high school student, who asked that her name not be used, 
recalls such an experience. "Almost every day, one of my male teachers would 
comment on what I was wearing. That made me feel uncomfortable," she said. "I 
did not report him to the administration because I was too embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual harassment policy at Foothill High School in Santa Ana was adopted 
in June 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the policy has drifted down to students is a matter of opinion. Even 
though the policy is published in the student handbook, which every student 
receives in his registration packet before the beginning of each school year, 
some students seem unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not heard about the policy, much less seen any (of its) effects," 
Foothill junior Matt Franklin said. "Nobody reads their student handbook, and 
the teachers don't really discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior added, "Most programs enacted by the school board are enforced 
halfheartedly and accomplish little more than paperwork. The sexual harassment 
policy falls in the same sea of laxity that all the others have." 
</P>
<P>
 Like policies adopted elsewhere, much of the policy at Foothill defines sexual 
harassment and the various emotional and psychological effects it can have on 
an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Any) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal 
or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment . . . 
sexual harassment can cause embarrassment, feelings of powerlessness, loss of 
self-confidence, reduced ability to perform school work . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual harassment . . . is considered to be unethical, unprofessional and 
illegal behavior. . . . Violation of (this) policy shall constitute generally 
just and reasonable cause of discipline," the policy states. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy also outlines specific actions a student or faculty member should 
take if they feel they have been sexually harassed, starting with bringing the 
complaint to the attention of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of schools' policies on individual behavior may not be known for 
some time yet, but the mechanism for dealing with harassment is in place.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some Foothill students believe that sexual harassment on campus is 
not a prevalent problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think sexual harassment is a major problem at FHS," said 17-year-old 
Katie Parsons. "The sexual harassment I have felt . . . are casual comments 
among acquaintances or friends. Things that I would probably never act upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Mike Baas agrees. "Sexual harassment a serious problem? No. 
(This) type of problem does exist, but not on a serious scale."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; TIME WILL TELL HOW HE'S RECALLED, BUT TODAY WE 
MISS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Canyon High School in Anaheim.

<P>
 Kurt Cobain is now a member of "the club." The club, as his mother referred to 
it, is a select group of stars and idols such as Jim Morrison, John Lennon and 
Janis Joplin who met (intentional or accidental) untimely deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the world remembers Kurt Cobain, I wonder if his suicide will glorify 
him further. Will he be remembered as a pioneer, a leader of the alternative 
breakthrough on the Seattle music scene and the unwilling voice for a troubled 
youth society, or as a manic depressive who gave up on life and took the weak 
man's way out? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a major Nirvana fan, along with millions of other teen-agers throughout 
the world. Cobain's meaty lyrics -- explicit tales of anger, depression and 
emotional Angst -- brought him to the heights of stardom immediately after 
Nirvana's first release, "Nevermind," in 1991. Cobain became the unwilling 
voice of an anguished teen-age generation of the '90s. Unfortunately, his goal 
was never to become a star. He was never comfortable as the voice of a troubled 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a Rock Star 101 course, I would have liked to take it. It might 
have helped me," Cobain said in an interview earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 His suicide was accepted as a tragedy, but not as a shock. Nirvana's latest 
release, "In Utero," displayed Cobain's anguished lyrics, which told a story of 
anger and depression. For example, one of the first lines on the album 
explained his discomfort with fame: "Teen-age Angst has paid off well. Now I'm 
bored and old." It was also rumored that "Rape Me," one of the more popular 
songs from the new album, was intended as a shot against a reporter who claimed 
that Cobain and wife (Hole front woman Courtney Love) were using heroin while 
Love was pregnant with their daughter, 2-year-old Francis Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony DeCurtis, an editor at Rolling Stone magazine, said, "If Kurt was 
going to go, you just kind of assumed it would be drugs. The thing that is very 
disturbing is the destructive determination that was involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The world has lost a great artist. Cobain, looking past his multitude of 
problems and his suicide, was a man who had so much promise, youth, and was so 
influential to so many. No matter how his death occurred, his missing presence 
will leave a great void within the music scene, and a generation of teens 
searching for their new voice.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; POLICIES THAT AFFECT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sexual harassment policies may differ in length, but content is similar in 
guidelines adopted by school districts across the county.  
</P>
<P>
 Policies, pertaining to both students and teachers, cover a definition of 
sexual harassment, examples of such behavior, how to file a complaint and 
possible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines state that "prevention 
is the best tool for elimination of sexual harassment." School districts have 
held in-service training for teachers, and students at some schools have been 
briefed about the policy at assemblies. Some schools, however, have not taken 
the message directly to students, relying instead on students reading about the 
policy in their handbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a portion of Villa Park High School's sexual harassment policy, which 
is similar to others adopted in the county: 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment may include but is not limited to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Verbal or physical harassment or abuse; 
</P>
<P>
 * Subtle pressure for sexual activity; 
</P>
<P>
 * Demanding sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt promises of 
preferential treatment with regard to an individual's employment status; 
</P>
<P>
 * Offers of sexual favors or advances to secure favorable employment 
conditions or to avoid unfavorable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment does not refer to behavior or occasional compliments of a 
socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, that is 
personally offensive, that fails to respect the rights of others, that lowers 
morale and that, therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment may take different forms. One form is the demand for sexual 
favors. Other forms of harassment include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Verbal: Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, comments on clothing or 
physical appearance, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, 
flirtations, advances or threats, highly personal questions and unwanted notes 
or love letters with a sexual message. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nonverbal: Sexually suggestive cartoons, pinups, graphic commentaries, 
suggestive or insulting sounds, leering, whistling, obscene gestures, graffiti, 
offensive language and displaying sexually suggestive objects or pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Physical: Unwanted physical contact, including touching, pinching, kissing, 
brushing the body, physical interference with movements such as blocking or 
following, patting, hugging, back or neck rubs, coerced sexual intercourse, 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the three high schools in Irvine, students attended assemblies where they 
received the policy on sexual harassment and watched a performance by Live 
Action, a troupe that concentrates on social issues. Live Action also 
distributed a flier on sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from the flyer:  
</P>
<P>
 Remember: when it comes to sexual harassment, it's not your intentions, but 
the impact of your behavior that counts. Sexual harassment can be very hurtful, 
even if you don't mean it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The following types of behavior may be sexual harassment: 
</P>
<P>
 * Name calling, verbal or written, of a sexual nature, such as: hunk, stud, 
fag, ho, etc., when used as sexual put-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sexual threats, demands, teasing, taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pressure for sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blocking movements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Explicit pictures, posters, calendars in class or on notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sexual gesturing, grabbing, pinching in line 
</P>
<P>
 * Comments about someone's sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
 Flirting is different from sexual harassment. There are no rules against 
flirting. Sexual harassment, unlike flirting, is unwelcome or unsolicited. Ask 
yourself the following questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Would I want this behavior to be written up in the school newspaper or 
appear on the evening news? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Would I behave this way if a member of my family were standing next to me? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Would I want someone to act this way toward someone I love? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Is this behavior agreed upon by me and the other person?  
</P>
<P>
 If the answer is no, then you probably shouldn't do it.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; COBAIN'S DEATH LEAVES LESSONS; SUICIDE: HIS 
PASSING SHOULD SERVE AS A WARNING TO TEEN-AGERS NOT TO TURN TO DRUGS TO TRY TO 
IMPROVE A LIFE OR A CAREER THAT'S UNFULFILLING. INSTEAD, MAKE A CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KWOK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Richard Kwok, 16, is a senior at 
Westminster High School. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In mixing drugs and career, Kurt Cobain sadly made the same mistake as 
representatives of earlier generations -- including Elvis Presley, Janis 
Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 His suicide does not set an example for teen-agers to follow; it is, instead, 
a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 With a successful career and rising popularity, Cobain just wasn't happy. This 
depression, mixed with drug use, only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 His music demonstrated his recurring mood swings. In the video "Smells Like 
Teen Spirit," Cobain smiled a lot and jumped around, perhaps a time when he was 
happy. The contrary "Come as You Are" reveals his depression in a song about 
openness and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploring another career might have helped him find the happiness he didn't 
find in being a rock star. His mistake is a guide for us all: Be intent on a 
career that will bring happiness; try another path if the one you are on is 
unfulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain is a symbol of progression and confusion. He changed contemporary rock 
and helped launch grunge, yet that wasn't enough. Such Angst is a common 
feeling among teen-agers. This is why his lyrics appealed to us, because they 
represent the growing-up aspect of life. 
</P>
<P>
 His music touched me and many other teens. Nirvana's albums -- "Bleach," 
"Nevermind," "Incesticide" and "In Utero" -- expressed the collective feelings 
of today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The song "Sliver" described his own youth, in which he was shuffled between 
relatives. The bond he shared with my generation is what made Nirvana's songs 
so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as his music affected people in different ways, so has his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my classmates shared their thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
 "What a bummer. He should have gotten help; he had enough money," said Chris 
Pogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proves that money doesn't buy happiness. No one should kill themselves 
-- it's never that bad," said Nguyen La. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think doctors would have seen it coming with his self-hating lyrics," 
said Steve Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-Nirvana fans expressed themselves, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Plange said she wasn't shocked because the signs of depression were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Maher described her empathy for the man who chose to kill himself 
instead of recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Dicker said Cobain was able to reach a lot of people through his 
music, which is what rock legends are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, nirvana means the highest state of peace and freedom. I'm sure 
most teen-agers, and I for one, can only hope Cobain has found his own nirvana.

IN CONVERSATION, THEY'RE LITTLE BIG MEN; FAMILY: TEEN-AGE BOYS MAY ACT LIKE 
THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT MOM, BUT GOOD COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE -- AS 
LONG AS IT DOESN'T TURN INTO AN INTERROGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They look rather like men and assume postures they think manly. 
</P>
<P>
 Their humor is puerile. They're distant and close-mouthed. And these teen-age 
boys seem to have very little use for their old moms anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women figure there's nothing to do but retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a very common mistake. Because he's not a man, although he's 
becoming one," says Ann F. Caron, a Greenwich, Conn., psychologist and mother 
of six grown children, four of them male. 
</P>
<P>
 These off-putting young men do want to stay connected to their mothers, "but 
they don't want to be absorbed," Caron says. Figuring out the boundaries 
instead of bowing out is one of the best things a mother can do for an 
adolescent son, says Caron, author of "Strong Mothers, Strong Sons" (Henry 
Holt, $22.50). 
</P>
<P>
 While it's natural for a boy to become increasingly independent, his mother is 
still a major influence in his life, Caron says, and boys want close 
relationships with parents as much as do girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with young boys, gender-related communication patterns tend to cause 
problems for mothers, Caron says. Males relate to others primarily by talking 
about experiences or things, while females focus on emotions and relationships. 
A mother, wanting to know what's going on in a son's life, often takes the 
wrong approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents interrogate their kids out of a sense of responsibility but often get 
in a hopeless rut with it. Sometimes parents' talk with teen-agers is mostly 
issuing orders and trying to get information -- "Where are you going?" "Who was 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age boys she interviewed "really couldn't understand their mothers 
wanting to know more about their lives. And it's very understandable why 
mothers, particularly now, want to know more." 
</P>
<P>
 "A mother who wants her son to be able to communicate feelings as well as 
facts faces an uphill but not impossible task," Caron writes. "I think she 
first has to acknowledge that her son has an inner core that belongs to him 
alone. That inner self must be respected. An adolescent boy who retreats from 
his mother's probing is afraid or can't articulate what he is feeling and would 
like to leave well enough alone," at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If interrogation isn't working, you have to find another way of going about 
it," Caron says. "Anything that doesn't work, don't keep doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents need help with listening skills, Caron says, so they don't 
frustrate kids who do begin to talk by jumping in with advice and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 If a mother learns to communicate effectively with her son, she is not only 
more likely to get the information she wants about what's going on but can help 
the boy learn to discuss his inner life. 
</P>
<P>
 But even boys who feel comfortable talking to their mothers will not 
habitually confide, "and a mother must be prepared to accept this from an 
adolescent boy," Caron says. 
</P>
<P>
 She advocates using "the old-fashioned art of conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very helpful in drawing them out -- sharing our lives a little bit with 
them, rather than interrogating," Caron says. 
</P>
<P>
 She also advises: 
</P>
<P>
 * Speak clearly and directly to adolescent sons. Boys often have trouble 
interpreting unspoken messages, she says, and women often speak in an indirect 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that talking is not the only way to form close bonds. Enjoy being 
with him. Boys are generally more comfortable talking about personal issues in 
the context of doing something with you, rather than sitting down for a talk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Respect his confidence in you if he does open up. Do not repeat to others 
what he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't take his silence as a personal rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen attentively to your son, and if you're not sure what he's saying, ask 
for clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be willing to negotiate with him about rules and chores; he'll be more 
cooperative.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: WHEN ROAD GOT GRUNGY, HE CHOSE HIS OWN PATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you were to map the Seattle rock scene by its commercial impact, you'd have 
to say that Andy Davenhall came up on the wrong side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving 10 years ago in the grunge mecca-to-be, Davenhall started playing 
drums in several of the pop-oriented bands that predominated in mid-'80s 
Seattle. At the time, grunge was still something in the sink to be attacked 
with steel wool and elbow grease. 
</P>
<P>
 That soon changed, and as it turned out, grunge, not the pop-rock that 
Davenhall played through the late-'80s, proved to be the mother lode for young 
Northwest prospectors armed with drums and guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Davenhall didn't at least sniff around a mine or two that held a big 
strike. In 1990, he auditioned for the open drum chair in the pre-"Teen Spirit" 
Nirvana. Dave Grohl got the job, and Davenhall got the notion that maybe it was 
time to start a band of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the alternative-rock world, if not Davenhall himself, is the 
richer for that turn of events. Sister Psychic, the band he launched in 1991 
and fronts as guitarist, lead singer and main songwriter, has issued two 
contrasting, many-faceted albums that showcase both a sure, pure-pop touch and 
an ability to rock with noisy authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fuel," the band's 1992 debut release for Restless Records, offered such 
grunge commonplaces as dense, throbbing guitars, brooding anxiety and 
grainy-voiced singing. But Sister Psychic, like Husker Du in the '80s, was able 
to achieve melodic liftoff even amid stormy sonic weather. 
</P>
<P>
 With its just-released second album, "Surrender, You Freak!" Sister Psychic, 
which plays tonight at Our House in Costa Mesa, expands from a blasting trio to 
a nuanced quartet, cleans up most of the extraneous grit and casts its lot with 
the enthusiasm and wistfulness of pure pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of echoing the chesty growls of the late Kurt Cobain or Pearl Jam's 
Eddie Vedder, as he did in a few instances on "Fuel," Davenhall paints softer 
hues with his flexible voice and comes up with a style that has some of the 
dirty-faced choirboy appeal of the underrated '70s rocker Nils Lofgren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to mature a bit," Davenhall, 30, said over the phone recently from 
his Seattle home. "It was kind of a jump to go from a three-piece power trio to 
a quartet. We had to think about arranging the guitars, and we didn't want just 
two barre- chord machines going. We wanted to think about what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The generally dark cast of Sister Psychic's first album may have fit the 
prevailing emotional tenor of Seattle rock, but Davenhall says fashion had 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wrote (the songs on) 'Fuel' I was going through some fairly heavy 
personal stuff that's reflected on the record. I lost a girlfriend to heroin. 
She's still alive, and she's doing well now, living in Colorado. But it was a 
fairly miserable time of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no angel myself, to quote Gregg Allman. We all have our vices, but when 
they take control of your life and it's a living hell, it's no fun. There seems 
to be a lot of it going around in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 Having gotten the songs about that experience out of his system, Davenhall 
said, "I didn't want to stay dark, because I think I'm fairly complex, and I 
want to show different sides of me and express them through music. I really 
don't want to get pigeonholed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on "Fuel," Davenhall made sure to engineer an escape from the album's 
emotional cave. By the end, Davenhall, bassist Christian Fulghum and original 
drummer Ryan Vego could be heard straining to rise from the mire in "Mind Over 
Matter" (the current lineup features a new drummer, Peter Lansdowne, and an 
additional guitarist, Mark Hoyt). 
</P>
<P>
 In the concluding song, "Painting," Davenhall sang a surging, affirmative ode 
to the sense of control and purpose to be found in creative work. 
</P>
<P>
 Find my way a thousand times, painting with my brush. It's my world, do what I 
say, painting with my brush.  
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many rock bands swear by gritty realism, and dismiss all else 
as sentimental pap, the Sister Psychic of "Blue River" dares to offer dreamy 
pop escapism in such songs as "Blue River" (not the Eric Andersen folk-pop 
chestnut of the early '70s). In it, Davenhall sings of an idyll on a river 
bank, where "Our reflection's dancing on the waves / And we're hoping some day 
all our dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
 In that line, and many others, Sister Psychic breaks the first commandment of 
'90s rock, "thou shalt be ironic," and embraces a more innocent ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people would want to have dreams come true," said Davenhall, who 
grew up near Albany, N.Y. "It doesn't necessarily reflect how I feel about the 
band, 'I hope I make it big, blah-blah-blah.' But it is fairly earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing (in 'Blue River') is based on an adolescent acid trip. My 
friend Jim and I would drop acid about twice a year and sit beside the Hudson 
River. We'd sit there and look at the stars and the river and trip out. I'm 
kind of recalling that, diving back into my childhood. It gives me the 
opportunity to reveal a little about myself without being blatant or pompous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davenhall speaks mildly, in soft, polite, almost soothing tones. But he also 
self-consciously strews his chat with deliberately ironic, in-joke phrases 
borrowed from the jargon of the music industry and rock criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-'80s, he said, pop was the dominant alternative-rock sound in 
Seattle. Then the grunge movement arrived, nurtured by the independent label 
Sub Pop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the early days there was a bit of friction" between pop and grunge 
camps (Davenhall's best-known band during the period was Pure Joy, which later 
spun off Flop as well as Sister Psychic). 
</P>
<P>
 "Seattle was just full of pop bands," he said, "then Sub Pop came out and they 
were just that -- the sub, the anti-pop. If anything, we created a backdrop for 
grunge. I enjoy that music a lot, but I'm not going to limit myself. Why be a 
lemming?" 
</P>
<P>
 To start Sister Psychic, he recruited Fulghum, an old friend, whose father is 
best-selling author Robert Fulghum ("All I Really Need to Know I Learned in 
Kindergarten").  
</P>
<P>
 For its first album, Sister Psychic won good reviews but toured little. Now 
the group has more extensive travel plans, Davenhall says. "For the next couple 
of years, we intend to be heavy-duty road hogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenhall says the band was boosted by a recent, well-received set opening for 
Liz Phair at a record retailers' convention in San Francisco, and he noted that 
Peter Buck of R.E.M. turned up to jam with Sister Psychic when it played in 
Seattle on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 The new album's title was inspired by the long odds facing any emerging band 
that hopes to make a living playing original music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with the crazy business we're in, and the struggle between 
trying to make it on your own and surrendering to the norm, to society as we 
know it," Davenhall said. "It's society yelling at us to 'Surrender, You 
Freak,' get a real job."' 
</P>
<P>
 Paying no attention, he recently quit his day job at a music store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just now at the jumping-off stage, and I think I'm going to do this 
professionally," Davenhall said. "Or I'm going to try to." 
</P>

SAX APPEAL; CANDY DULFER FEELS INSPIRED TO MAKE VISUAL AND MUSICAL STATEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might say saxophonist Candy Dulfer's big break came when she gave Prince a 
piece of her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems the Dutch-born Dulfer, already a big star in her native country, was set 
to open for the Purple One on the European leg of his "Lovesexy" tour, when she 
was abruptly canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bang on the nose," she said by phone earlier this week from a hotel 
room in San Francisco. "I had a good name in Holland and I thought he was 
thinking of me as just a support act. It made me angry." 
</P>
<P>
 So Dulfer, who plays tonight at the Coach House, dashed off a note to his 
Princeness, taking him to task for his disregard. To her surprise, Prince 
apologized to her during the show and called her up on stage. Caught without 
her horn, she sent her father home to fetch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out it wasn't his fault at all, but some kind of a technical 
problem," she explained. "But I showed him something by writing the note, and 
he was impressed. It was something I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince was impressed, enough so that he later invited Dulfer to come to his 
Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis to appear in the "Party Man" video. Her 
appearance served as her introduction to U.S. audiences, as Prince croons, 
"When I need trombone / A dog is handy / When I want sax / I call Candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dulfer, 24, has backed such notables as Van Morrison, Dave Stewart of the 
Eurythmics, Aretha Franklin and Pink Floyd, but she is doing very well on her 
own now. Her first album, "Saxuality" sold more than 500,000 copies in the 
United States. Her new one, "Sax-A-Go-Go," which features appearances by the 
J.B. (James Brown) Horns and the Tower of Power horn section, should do even 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's impossible to talk of Dulfer's success without talking about her 
striking good looks. Prince played her appearance up in the video. And Dulfer 
doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to say these things (regarding appearance) about me anyway. 
My looks have only brought me good things and there's nothing wrong with me 
using it to my advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Holland, all the girl musicians have tried to make that fact invisible; 
they looked frumpy and tried to dress like men. It seemed so unnatural. So I 
took it to extremes. I don't advise everybody to go out in short skirts, but if 
they do they shouldn't be afraid of the reactions." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about those album titles that play on the similarities between the 
words "sax" and "sex?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my idea of a joke, to get attention," she said. "I thought I was only 
making the one or two albums and that would be it, so I did it to get the 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She credits percussionist Sheila E. with inspiring her to make a visual, as 
well as musical, statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shocked me when I saw her play," she said. "Here she was playing good and 
looking good as well -- not sexy, but in control. She had a good attitude about 
being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Amsterdam, Dulfer is the daughter of Dutch saxophonist Hans Dulfer. 
She picked up soprano sax at age 6 with his encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have started without him," she said. "He's always done modern 
things, and today leads this speed-metal jazz band. He never said I should 
play, never pushed me. His most important influence was to let me know that 
playing can be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Dulfer's father also booked concerts in Amsterdam, and Dulfer remembers many 
of the American musicians he booked -- Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, Archie Shepp 
-- visiting the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too young to realize what it was all about, but it gave me a 
perspective on things, a chance to see what music is really all about." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her father exposed her to jazz, R & B and avant-garde music. Her 
mother, as well as friends at school, turned her on to pop music. "I think it's 
good to have a diverse input of music. You have to listen to everything." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was 15, she was already leading her own band, Funky Stuff, the 
name her group carries to this day. "I've kept the name because that's what the 
music's supposed to be," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But in those days, she said, funk was out of fashion. "Everybody was listening 
to rock and I hated it. I loved R & B and we were the only band that did it. 
Now, it's immensely popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she claims to admire R & B and all its related forms -- soul, funk and 
jazz -- she doesn't like being labeled a fusion-jazz player. "It makes me think 
of boring music. Fusion used to be good with the Brecker Brothers and 
(saxophonist David) Sanborn, but it's just not interesting anymore. The solos 
just go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like simple music, music with feeling. I like it when there's a concept 
behind it and some emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sax-A-Go-Go" follows suit with a funky program that includes a number of 
beat-minded tunes from Dulfer's longtime associate Ulco Bed as well as the 
Average White Band's "Pickin' Up the Pieces" and Prince's "Sunday Afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her current tour features "more of a big band" and is, she said, much more 
lively than the album. "We do a lot from the albums as well as a Tower of Power 
cover, a J.B. Horns cover. We put everything we like into the gig: ballads, 
jazz-funk, vocal things. We do (Miles Davis') 'So What'. It's sort of like a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes that her success will encourage other women to persevere as 
musicians. "I hope that girls can see, through me, that it's easy to be a 
musician. Not that it won't be hard -- there's still going to be a struggle 
with the sexist thing. But it's not as hard as it looks." 
</P>

CAN COUNTY SQUEEZE IN AN EMPIRE?; NIGHTCLUBS: COSTA MESA BUILDING IS ALL DOLLED 
UP AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS. BUT SOME WONDER WHERE THE CUSTOMERS WILL COME FROM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They've got grand style and plenty of attitude. They've got everything you'd 
ever want to cram into one evening -- from fashionable cuisine to celebrity 
deejays to billiards at $12 an hour -- not to mention valet parking.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They've got fabulous-sounding names such as Metropolis, Roxbury and Bacchus, 
along with a clientele touted by their owners as upscale. They are the 
super-clubs of Orange County and, in less than two years, they've become as 
trendy as shiny Harleys and boxing aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it dates back to 1990 with the Shark Club and the now-defunct NYC, both 
in Costa Mesa, it took until late 1992 for the super-club concept to really 
take off. After NYC unceremoniously shut its doors that year, the Shark Club's 
owners opened Metropolis in Irvine to so much fanfare that it seemed like the 
start of a new chapter in the county's nightclub history. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a string of super-duper nightclubs have opened, all vying for the 
same patronage and offering similar amenities in a glamorous setting. Joining 
the pack over the weekend was the Empire Ballroom, an 18,000-square-foot former 
factory in Costa Mesa where $3 million was spent on renovations to turn it into 
what a spokesman describes as "a New York-style club." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those in and behind the scenes say the burgeoning fad of slick, big 
city-style clubs represents a turning point for a county still developing its 
cultural base. But considering the current economic climate, can Orange County 
sustain another super-club? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think O.C. is getting way overbuilt with nightclubs," said Roxbury's Elie 
Samaha. "There's not enough people here to fill these kind of clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He and his brother, Demitri, opened a version of their trendy Hollywood club 
in Santa Ana in March, 1993. The two-story building includes everything from a 
live music bar to a plush VIP lounge. Theater will be added to the bill soon, 
said Samaha. Experimental works will be showcased before the dance areas open 
for the night.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be very competitive in this recession," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooing scenesters week after week, however, is tougher in these parts no 
matter how many thrills are packed under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Date, a former manager with Roxbury and Newport Beach's Bacchus, blames 
it on a "market that is not as educated in club life as in Europe, L.A. or New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
 "People there go out at 11 at night and stay out until 4 in the morning. And 
they're used to spending a lot of money. Here, the social bit lasts only a 
couple of hours. To run with the rats you have to go to bed early." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than a strong weekend and pricey cocktails for these mega-clubs 
to stay in business, Date said. Although Thursdays tend to prove successful for 
many clubs, getting local party animals to come out to play en masse during the 
week has become a Darwinian challenge of the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be survival of who has the most financial backing," Date said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the multimillion-dollar face lift, the backers of the new Empire 
Ballroom shelled out an undisclosed amount for the 2 1/2 acres the building 
sits on, off 17th Street, near Superior Avenue and Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An even greater secret is who is funding it all. The club's co-managers, Gregg 
Mullholand and Mike Tuomisto, adamantly refuse to reveal the owner's name, and 
public records list only a corporate title of the Empire Club of Costa Mesa. 
(Joel Liebke appears on the form filed in late 1992 for a fictitious name with 
the county, but Tuomisto insists his involvement ceased soon after.)  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Mullholand and Tuomisto (who was a partner at NYC) conceived the 
idea for the club two years ago and have been a guiding force since then, they 
deny any personal financial investment in the project.  
</P>
<P>
 But the two did scout the site. They could have taken Tuomisto's former NYC 
space, only a short walk away from Empire's location and on the 
greater-traveled Newport Boulevard, but, "We wanted to create a new energy and 
excitement that comes with a new building," Tuomisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrugated shacks once dotted the dusty lot, housing an estimated 70 vagrants, 
according to Tuomisto. A 200-space parking lot now covers much of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cleaned up a real eyesore for the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti-covered walls of the old plastics factory have been sandblasted, 
dividing walls erected and new plumbing installed. The club itself will occupy 
13,000 square feet of the building, with the other 5,000 reserved for storage 
and office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch Design's Rick McCormick was enlisted to reinvent the gutted shell. The 
Costa Mesa firm gave Metropolis and the Shark Club their gorgeous combination 
of Baroque-meets-industrial interiors. It also happens that McCormick's first 
nightclub design job was NYC. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Empire Ballroom, the theme is a modern take on the run-down factory 
look so popular in cosmopolitan urban nightclubs.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically taking an old industrial building and giving it a new use," 
McCormick said. "It's another form of recycling. The building has many 
characteristics that are hard to find in Orange County because everything here 
is so new." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Empire serves a "a feast for the senses," Mullholand said, 
complete with male and female go-go dancers. "This is going to be a true dance 
club. The first of the hard-core dance clubs since NYC closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether hard-core in such a grand setting means major attitude is yet to be 
seen. A dress code will be enforced, so leave the sneakers and shorts at home. 
Hot pants are OK. Baseball caps depend on the rest of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's worn with an Armani suit then it's fine. But worn with jeans and a 
T-shirt, no," Tuomisto said, adding that it's not an issue of being snobby. "If 
people don't meet the dress code, they can stand there all night long. People 
just seem to be on better behavior when they get dressed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mullholand: "We're going to be upscale, but not expensive."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, expect a $7 cover charge.  
</P>
<P>
 The buzz among club owners and promoters concerns whether Empire Ballroom can 
bring in the close to 1,000 patrons needed to fill the place, which is open 
only Thursday through Saturday from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The club plays house music exclusively -- a category that weekend clubbies 
here tend to handle in only small doses, as club operators have already found. 
House-music fans usually are limited to weekday installations like Tuesday at 
Metropolis or Thursday at the Shark Club, where owners John and Gregg Hanour 
can be counted among the devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love house, but we found that it just doesn't have a broad appeal for the 
weekend crowd," said Gregg Hanour. "My guess is that (the Empire Ballroom) 
won't be doing only house music after the initial excitement of a new club 
wears off." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, time will tell whether the latest in the county super-clubs can truly 
build an empire from house tunes and staying open only three nights a week. Its 
predecessors have already learned that it takes a little bit of everything a 
load of creativity to entice the fashionable twenty- and thirtysomethings of 
this county to keep coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's really benefiting is the customer, which is what's supposed to happen," 
Hanour said.

CAL REP TO CONJURE UP A 'MERLIN' OF METAPHOR; THEATER: THE LONG BEACH COMPANY 
TAKES ON THE TANKRED DORST EPIC THAT HAS WORLD HISTORY AS ITS CORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merlin is coming, but he's not in Camelot anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the magician-master of King Arthur's court, and you are likely to 
conjure up images of a kindly old man in a long gown, casting a glance over the 
kingdom as the subjects sing a Rodgers and Hammerstein tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, you might think of the more violent and mystical world of John Boorman's 
film "Excalibur." 
</P>
<P>
 You might even think -- if you had the unlucky chance to catch it before its 
quick Broadway demise -- of "Merlin," the Doug Henning version. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipe all of those images away, urges Ronald Allan-Lindblom, director of the 
"Merlin" that arrives tonight at Cal State Long Beach's Studio Theatre, care of 
California Repertory Company. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no conventional visit to the Round Table, but German playwright 
Tankred Dorst's massive treatment of the Arthurian legend as a metaphor for 
world history. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an epic concept at an epic length of seven hours divided into two parts. 
They can be viewed on successive evenings or together in a marathon Saturday 
afternoon-and-evening performance. By any measure, "Merlin" is the most 
ambitious production by the campus's resident professional company in its 
four-year life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorst, who is 68 and still a dominant playwright in German theater, took the 
basic tale, as told by Sir Thomas Malory in "Le Morte D'Arthur," and expanded 
it into a sprawling vision embracing a kaleidoscope of styles from cabaret to 
theater of the absurd to the operatic. 
</P>
<P>
 His version, with his frequent collaborator Ursula Ehler, ran 9 1/2 hours in 
its 1981 premiere at the Dusseldorf Schauspielhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent Dorst versions ran longer or shorter, but in whatever form, the 
epic gained a legendary status even in a national theater scene accustomed to 
the grand gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was visiting Germany in 1988," says Cal Rep artistic director Howard 
Burman, "I would ask what the most interesting play was. Other titles were 
mentioned, but the one people always came back to was 'Merlin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although this marks "Merlin's" American premiere in full production, it first 
crossed the ocean in a 1990 workshop production by director Pavel Cerny at 
Hollywood's First Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The First Stage workshop was when Howard and I first heard the play," 
Allan-Lindblom recalled, "and we found it to be remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Rep has assembled its staging "from the ground up," said Allan-Lindblom, a 
graduate of Boston University and of the first class of the Pacific 
Conservatory of the Arts in Santa Maria-Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work really began with the actors and me, around the table, with them 
looking at me and saying, 'OK, Ron, what the hell are we going to do with 
this?' It was my job to have the answers," he said. "If what you see up there 
doesn't work, blame me, not Mr. Dorst." 
</P>
<P>
 Working from a 229-page script supplied by Dorst's German publisher, 
Allan-Lindblom said: "Such a text, with 265 roles and 97 scenes done in 
completely different styles, can be, well, very intimidating. But I know this 
group -- our pros like Greg Mortensen and Richard Gang and Ashley Carr -- and 
can gauge their emotions. And right now, after nine weeks of rehearsal, the 
cast is on a real high." 
</P>
<P>
 But how to contend with a story that envisions, among other things, Merlin 
fathered by the Devil himself, a pair of dragons bursting from below onto the 
stage, and crowd scenes calling for hundreds? 
</P>
<P>
 "By metaphor," Allan-Lindblom stated calmly. "Everybody keeps saying that this 
is an impossible script. Nah, it's not impossible. Remember, we're doing this 
on a budget." Actual production costs were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are depicting a lot of the spectacle by suggestion, and with Holly 
Harbinger's choreography. For instance, when Dorst writes that a water fountain 
bursts around Merlin and his love Viviane, this is staged with dancers. I want 
to let Dorst provide the spectacle, through his language and action." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan-Lindblom, though, is well acquainted with the theater of spectacle both 
as an actor and collaborator with Josef Svoboda, founder of the revered Czech 
theater, Laterna Magika. 
</P>
<P>
 He played the title role of Svoboda's "The Black Monk" at Detroit's Hilberry 
Theatre (then run by Burman), and subsequently worked in Prague with Svoboda, 
who is known for his use of multiple projection screens and complex visual 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is my hero," said Allan-Lindblom, "and I would say that our 'Merlin' is 
Svoboda-inspired to the extent that he's devoted to metaphors, and not any sort 
of realism, on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you need a real grounding to either direct or sit through a seven-hour 
play," he added. "For me, it's the theme of idealism: how it grows and how it 
collapses. That was a theme in 'Camelot,' too, but with Dorst, it's much, much 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by having Merlin reject his father the Devil for a life of goodness 
already takes the story to a larger realm," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dorst's own pessimism -- the play ends with the Devil describing the death of 
the planet -- derives from his dislike of all ideologies, a by-product of his 
youth in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of this, the Cal Rep artists know, connects with an American 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make this sound impossibly difficult," Allan-Lindblom said, 
"because it can be enjoyed for the rich variety of music (by Justus Matthews 
and Michael Kocab) and dance and the King Arthur legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also know that this might be a crash-and-burn mission, and, artistically, 
we're out on a limb. But I'd rather be doing this, with all due respect to 
Arthur Miller, than another 'Death of a Salesman.' " 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coastline Community College has canceled a 10-year-old program of dramatic 
productions because of a lack of funds, Edward Decker, dean of visual and 
performing arts, announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker estimated the annual cost of the program at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Conrad, who has directed the shows as part of an adult education course, 
said an evening of one-act versions of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" scheduled for May at the Ethel Dwyer Middle School in 
Huntington Beach will not be affected by the cancellation of the program. JAN

the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, as criticizing 
African American images on television. She says her remarks referred 
specifically to historic black images in TV news and on most prime-time

 Rodney G. King was beaten by white policemen because he is black, his lawyer 
argued Wednesday, urging jurors to award him $15 million in a damage lawsuit he 
described as symbolic of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X -- these people were all in the 
civil rights movement voluntarily. (Rodney) King is a symbol involuntarily, but 
no less a symbol," said attorney Milton Grimes in his summation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a race case," Grimes said of the March 3, 1991, police beating that 
inflamed public anger and led to rioting in Los Angeles in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you can separate the Rodney King incident from black people, 
from African American people, from how we feel," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the city's case, Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent said the beating was 
not a racial matter and questioned whether a racial slur was really uttered 
during the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case about one word," he said. "This is not a case about racial 
slurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments were delivered in daylong summations by attorneys, after which 
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies instructed jurors in the law and gave them 
the case for deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 After jurors reach a compensatory damage figure, the second phase of the trial 
will address individual liability by officers and other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent suggested that the beating would not have occurred if King had not 
been drunk and had not broken the law when he led officers on a high-speed 
chase. He said King was not stopped because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes noted that an audio expert had isolated what sounded like the word 
nigger on the soundtrack of the beating videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close your eyes and listen to the tape," he implored jurors. "You can't close 
your eyes and pretend 'nigger' wasn't said on March 3, 1991, because you don't 
want to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said he could not hear the word on the soundtrack but suggested that 
if jurors do hear it, they should consider the feelings of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make the judgment it was said, think about the emotion of those 
officers," Vincent said. "Think of Rodney King saying he wanted to run . . . 
and think about one word. What is one word?" 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that a fair award would be $800,000, four times the medical costs 
incurred so far, but also offered a range of $500,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep emotion out of it," Vincent said. "This is a case where a 
person was stopped for violating the law. He was injured, and we will pay for 
those injuries. We want it to be fair to him and to the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 King's mother, Odessa, briefly disrupted Vincent's closing argument when he 
cited a piece of testimony by a witness who contradicted her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied," she called out, referring to the witness. Davies ordered her to 
leave. On her way out, she muttered: "It's all lies." 
</P>
<P>
 The city admitted liability for King's beating but rejected a demand for $9.6 
million to settle the case. King refused an offer of $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said $15 million would be fair compensation for pain, suffering and 
permanent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 King lives daily with the fear that he will develop more mental and physical 
problems, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes told the jury that King was dehumanized by the officers. "They beat him 
like a dog and then they took his pride away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes and Vincent were a study in contrasting styles. King's lawyer, wearing 
a bold red tie and handkerchief with a dark suit, was dramatic, speaking of 
ghosts haunting King and the history of black oppression. Vincent, a 
gray-haired man in a gray suit, was low-key and straightforward, concluding 
solemnly: "We trust you will do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were charged with King's beating and acquitted of most charges 
in a state trial, sparking the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. Two officers were 
later convicted of violating King's civil rights and sentenced to 30 months 
each in federal prison.
