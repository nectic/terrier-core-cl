 SILVER CELEBRATION: Jean Daffern was one of the first employees hired by Simi 
Valley when it became a city 25 years ago. She helped write the General Plan 
and start up the police force. . . . So what do you give the city's 
longest-serving employee for her silver anniversary? A gold watch, of course. . 
. . The City Council presented Daffern with the watch and a pin this week. 
"It's been a great 25 years," she said. "Thank-you."

<P>
 PAYING TRIBUTE: Oxnard officials Tuesday named a softball park after Oxnard 
Police Detective James O'Brien (B1), killed last year while chasing a gunman 
who shot up a jobs office. Four others, including the gunman, were killed in 
the Dec. 2 incident. . . . Officials are planning to commemorate the 
anniversary of the shootings with a ceremony at a newly planted rose garden at 
the County Government Center. . . . "As the day of the anniversary approaches, 
it's bringing back a lot of memories," Employment Development Department 
employee Bobbie Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 ART LESSONS: A mural dedicated Tuesday at Ventura's Westpark Community Center 
taught "high-risk" students something about art. But it also taught them about 
getting along. . . . The mural was created by students in the Community 
Alliance Program, an alternative school within the Ventura County 
Superintendent of Schools Office. . . . "Often the students come from areas 
that are at odds with each other," said Larry Keegan, head teacher of the 
program. "We at least got to the point where that was forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 MANAGING MONEY: Responding to demands to curb spending, Simi Valley school 
officials are searching for ways to reduce the district's $3.2-million deficit 
(B5). . . . In August, Ventura County school officials asked six districts to 
create deficit spending reduction plans. The Simi Valley Unified School 
District has struggled recently to balance its $75.5-million budget. . . . 
"We're not balancing the budget yet," Assistant Supt. E. Leon Mattingley said. 
"The county just wants to be sure we have a plan in mind."

ART REVIEW; OUT OF STORAGE, INTO MODERNIST LIGHT; NORTON SIMON MUSEUM UNCOVERS 
ITS TREASURED BUT LONG-HIDDEN SCHEYER COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It gives local pride a nice glow to discover that the most important new 
exhibition of modern art in town has been here, unseen, for decades. The case 
in point is the Norton Simon Museum's presentation of "The Spirit of Modernism: 
Galka Scheyer in the New World." 
</P>
<P>
 The Scheyer collection is one of the revered treasure troves of pioneer 
modernist art in these parts and would hold such status anywhere. It consists 
mainly of works by four masters: Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Alexei Jawlensky 
and Lionel Feininger. It was donated to the old Pasadena Museum in 1953 after 
the death of the impetuous, intense German collector and dealer. She moved to 
Los Angeles in 1928 to promote her passion for these Bauhaus artists and became 
part of the city's original tiny circle of modernist bohemians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It included artists like Edward Weston and Stanton MacDonald Wright, 
architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler, 
collectors like Walter Arensberg, Aline Barnsdall and bookseller Jake Zeitlin. 
The history reads like the story of trying to bring civilization to Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheyer's donation included numerous works by artists outside the core group 
such as Picasso, Nolde and El Lissitzky. It totals about 450 works. When the 
Pasadena showcase went upscale becoming the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art in 
1969, its curator, John Coplans, regarded the Scheyer collection as its 
greatest cultural asset. When the financially beleaguered institution was 
absorbed by Norton Simon in 1974, local observers such as then-Times art critic 
Henry J. Seldis wrung their hands over the fate of the Scheyer collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, parts of it were kept regularly on view. Almost incredibly the 
museum never showcased it until now, possibly due to the late collector's 
fondness for concentrating on his own acquisitions. Even more surprisingly, 
Norton Simon chief curator Sara Campbell says she and her staff could find no 
records confirming that the highlights of the collection have never before been 
shown together. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why it looks so fresh. There's a wonderful zest about the nearly 
300 works lining the newly refurbished lower galleries that surround it. 
Everything is modest in scale, energized in impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jawlensky was Scheyer's special friend among the artists. He gave her the 
nickname Galka , which is Russian for blackbird. She posed for him frequently. 
Her heavy features appear in many of those female heads that were his 
semi-exclusive subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially they are loose and colorful, echoing Matisse and the French Fauves. 
With time, their mood moves the clock simultaneously backward to the brooding 
Russian icon and forward to pure abstraction. In the '60s, Jawlensky was 
credited as a precursor of the theme-and-variation serial painting practiced by 
the Minimalists. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings are at once joyous and haunted. It's a curious combination of 
emotions also reflected in the troubled playfulness of Paul Klee. Limpid 
watercolor fantasies have wonderful titles like "The Gate to Hades" and 
"Barbarian's Venus." They try to weld the wonder of a child's vision to the 
wisdom of a mathematical philosopher. They probably succeed so well because 
Klee was an accomplished musician. He also wrote one of the great poetic 
treatises on modern art, "The Pedagogical Sketchbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Klee's immensely smart sense of fun ripples over to Feininger. The only 
American of the Blue Four, Feininger invented the comic strip "The 
Kin-der-Kids." Some of the cartoonist's animated drawing style carried over to 
his abstracted village-scapes and curiously melancholy images of boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandinsky, the overarching inventor of non-objective painting is seen in a 
small early masterpiece, "No. 151 A, Sketch for Deluge I" of 1912. More 
revealing are a set of images on the theme "Small Worlds." These almost purely 
geometric abstractions are a triumph of talent over the often dead surfaces of 
lithography. They investigate the idea of inventing an imagery to match 
cosmological metaphysics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging nearby is a similar set of so-called "Prouns" by Kandinsky's fellow 
Russian, El Lissitzky. Across the way there's a handsome double-framed 
geometric abstraction by Laszlo Maholy-Nagy "AL 3." Taken together they are 
like early forays into the idea of art as an act of perception, an idea 
realized here in the '70s in the work of our Light and Space artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The compression and deft selection of this landmark exhibition makes its title 
entirely apt. The spirit of modernism was all drawn from the same well. It was 
a quest to distill feeling behind the merely visible. It was an act of immense 
idealism in a troubled world. It's the kind of show that reminds admirers of 
modernism what attracted them to it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes with four handsome little monographs of the principal artists 
available boxed or separately. The exhibition has a good long run until next 
fall. It would, however, be a very good idea to leave it up permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Norton Simon Museum, 411 W. Colorado Blvd., through Sept. 10, closed Monday 
through Wednesday (and Thanksgiving Day). (818) 449-6840.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'HEAVENLY CREATURES' A DEVILISH DELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Heavenly Creatures" is what Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme called each 
other, but those are just words, and words, no matter how passionate and 
adoring, can only hint at the intensity of the attachment these two teen-age 
girls felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Inseparable real-life schoolmates and soul mates in Christchurch, New Zealand, 
in 1952, Pauline and Juliet inhabited a symbiotic world that was giddy, 
euphoric and chilling. Frightfully self-absorbed, their conduct unnerved the 
adult world and led, with horrible inevitability, to what is still considered 
the most celebrated criminal case in New Zealand history. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand director Peter Jackson, best known for the cult fright favorite 
"Dead Alive," has nervily translated the Parker-Hulme case into film terms, and 
an adventurous, accomplished piece of business, burning with cinematic energy, 
it turns out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilizing a thoughtful, thoroughly researched script he co-wrote with Frances 
Walsh, Jackson directs in a way that is both tightly controlled and highly 
emotional. Photographed by Alun Bollinger, "Creatures" has a witty, overwrought 
visual style that the girls themselves would probably favor, and it makes good 
dramatic use of state-of-the-art special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Related in voice over taken from a diary kept by Pauline, "Creatures" begins 
with a newsreel of Christchurch, the kind of quaint, bucolic and boring place 
that scandal isn't supposed to touch. The city takes especial pride in the 
Christchurch Girls High School, a classically prim establishment that insists 
on proper uniforms and sensible shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey), her sullen face framed by dark curly ringlets, is a 
bright but quietly resentful ninth-grade student who comes from undeniably 
lower-class stock. Her feckless father, Bert (Simon O'Connor), is prone to 
silly sight gags involving fish, and her hard-working mother, Honora (Sarah 
Peirse), has to take in boarders to pay the family expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 All this ceases to matter to Pauline the day Juliet (Kate Winslet) arrives 
from dreamy England. Totally upper class, knowing more about the intricacies of 
the French subjunctive than her teachers and not shy about proving it, Juliet 
may be outwardly glamorous and confident, but she is as high strung and 
emotionally needy as Pauline. Almost immediately, they bond with a fierceness 
that no one knows quite what to make of. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with a shared passion for Mario Lanza, "only the world's greatest 
tenor," Pauline and Juliet progress to creating elaborate candle-lit shrines to 
their idols. Determined to either go to Hollywood ("It's better than heaven; no 
Christians") or have a novel published in New York, they begin to jointly work 
on a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing "how hard it is for other people to appreciate our genius," the 
girls retreat more and more to an imaginary place they call "the Fourth World," 
which includes a medieval kingdom named Borovnia. With fine use of 
up-to-the-minute effects like morphing, "Creatures" makes it possible for 
audiences to physically enter these worlds with Pauline and Juliet, to 
experience the surrender to fantasy as completely as they do. 
</P>
<P>
 This ability to get inside hysteria and obsession, the skill to make us feel 
sensations as intensely as its protagonists, is what makes "Creatures" 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Helped by remarkable performances by its young actresses (Winslet has worked 
in theater and TV in England, Lynskey is pretty much an absolute beginner), 
"Creatures" insidiously encourages us to side with these two young women. 
Clearly they are so much fresher, more radiant and energetic than their elders, 
who begin to dully suspect that something as mundane as sexual attraction is 
holding these two together. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Pauline and Juliet teeter at the edge of sanity, when their 
infatuation becomes uncontrollable, their willfulness frightening, we go over 
the top with them, horrified co-conspirators almost to the end. "Heavenly 
Creatures" does not romanticize or excuse, it merely presents the inevitable 
and leaves us to shake our heads in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for a chilling murder and some sexuality. Times guidelines: 
The murder is graphic, but the sexual sequence is quite brief. 'Heavenly 
Creatures'

 New Marketing Tack: In what the studio is billing as a "marketing first," 20th 
Century Fox is offering a "money-back guarantee" to lure moviegoers to its John 
Hughes remake of the Christmas classic "Miracle on 34th Street." For all 
showings of the movie today through Sunday, Fox will refund the ticket price 
for any viewer who is not "delighted" by the film. Unsatisfied patrons need 
merely send in their ticket stubs and a self-addressed stamped envelope to: 
20th Century Fox, P.O. Box 900, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90213, Attn: Miracle. Fox 
President Bill Mechanic said the offer shows the studio's "confidence and 
faith" in the movie. No doubt it's also aimed at boosting the film's box office 
-- "Miracle" opened in eighth place on the box-office chart last weekend with 
an anemic take of $2.8 million. POP/ROCK

 The Defense Rests: The defense team for rapper Tupac Shakur and his road 
manager, Charles Fuller, the two accused of sexually assaulting a young woman 
in a New York hotel room last year, rested its case Tuesday without calling the 
men to testify. Shakur's attorney contends the woman's encounter with the men 
was consensual and that she became jealous and went into a rage after seeing 
Shakur with another woman. On Monday, a woman identifying herself as Shakur's 
former publicist testified in the New York courtroom that she heard the alleged 
victim accuse the rapper of cheating on her and vow, "This is not the last time 
you're going to hear from me." The case is expected to go to the jury next 
week.

 Crosby Update: Musician David Crosby remained hospitalized in critical but 
stable condition Tuesday after undergoing a successful liver transplant Sunday 
at UCLA Medical Center. Crosby, 53, who was on the organ donor waiting list for 
39 days, received the liver of a 31-year-old Southern California man who was 
declared brain dead after a traffic accident. Crosby is expected to remain 
hospitalized for several weeks, but his band, Crosby, Stills & Nash, will 
receive the 1994 Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of 
Songwriters during a Dec. 9 ceremony at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. TELEVISION

 Letterman Prevails: Jay Leno ventured into David Letterman's home turf Monday 
night but didn't make a dent in the ratings gap, according to Nielsen figures 
available Tuesday from 32 major TV markets. Beginning a week of telecasts from 
New York, Leno's "The Tonight Show" on NBC attracted 15% of the available 
viewers while Letterman's "Late Show" on CBS drew 19%.

 CBS News: Despite denials last week from CBS News president Eric Ober, CBS 
executives this week are considering turning Connie Chung's weekly 
newsmagazine, "Eye to Eye," into a series of specials, thus making more room on 
the schedule for prime-time dramas, network sources say. The newsmagazine has 
done poorly in the ratings since CBS moved it into the killer Thursday night 
time slot opposite NBC's hospital drama, "ER." The producers of CBS' rival 
hospital drama, "Chicago Hope," meanwhile, are said to want a better time slot 
for their series, now airing Thursdays at 9 p.m., and there has been some 
speculation at the network that Dan Rather's Wednesday night newsmagazine, "48 
Hours," might be moved to accommodate "Chicago Hope." But sources say that a 
change in Chung's show is more likely than moving Rather. A change in "Eye to 
Eye" could come as early as January, although officially, CBS says no decision 
has been made. THE ARTS

 Sales Record: "Sunset Boulevard" has set another record. The musical brought 
in more than $1.4 million on Friday, the day after its Broadway opening, 
setting a high mark for ticket sales on any single day in Broadway history. The 
previous record-holder was "Beauty and the Beast," which brought in nearly $1.3 
million on June 13, the day after the Tony Awards telecast. But Disney's 
"Beast" achieved its record with a top ticket price of $65 compared to $70 for 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset."

 From LACMA to Atlanta: Michael E. Shapiro, who resigned as director of the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art in August of 1993, after less than a year at the 
helm, has been appointed director of museum programs and chief curator at the 
High Museum of Art in Atlanta. Effective Jan. 9, Shapiro will oversee the 
curatorial, education, exhibitions, publications and collections management 
departments at the High Museum, whose facilities, operations and staff are 
roughly one-fourth the size of LACMA's. He will also work with Director Ned 
Rifkin to build the permanent collection. SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; PINKETT THE HIGH POINT IN 'LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although humorous and energetic, "A Low Down Dirty Shame" is about as routine 
as a private-eye action-adventure can get, but it does have a secret weapon: 
Jada Pinkett, a feisty and funny comedian, as witty as she is pretty, who 
lights up the screen. She has already been seen to advantage in "Menace II 
Society" and "Jason's Lyric," having established herself in TV's "A Different 
World," and she's the best reason to see this film. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been cast as Peaches, secretary extraordinaire, at once sassy and 
devoted to Keenen Ivory Wayans' Andre Shame, a seedy L.A. private detective, an 
ex-cop down on his luck. Things seem to be looking up, however, when a DEA 
agent (Charles S. Dutton) hires Shame to track down $20 million in missing drug 
money. At every inevitably convoluted turn, Shame is going to need Peaches' 
endless resourcefulness and spunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayans, who also wrote and directed the film, seems to have overreached. He's 
fine directing others, but could have used some guidance and reassurance in his 
own portrayal. He has presence but seems self-conscious and uncertain in a role 
that ranges from the serious to the comic, with plenty of action and a little 
romance thrown in. What works best is Shame's slow realization that it's 
Peaches who's worthy of his love rather than Salli Richardson's glamorous 
Angela, his lost love, newly resurfaced and about as reliable as Mary Astor's 
Bridget O'Shaughnessy in "The Maltese Falcon." 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, Wayans might well have started telling his story earlier, since 
so much of it has already happened by the time the picture actually begins. 
Dutton, Andrew Divoff as a key heavy and others shine in support. Smartly 
produced and certainly lively, "A Low Down Dirty Shame" is diverting while 
you're watching it, but you're liable to start forgetting it by the time the 
end credits start to unroll.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'LOVE AND A .45': FAST, VIOLENT AND FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 C.M. Talkington's "Love and a .45" sends up the gun-toting lovers-on-the-run 
genre with a gleeful wit, nonstop energy and a refreshing honesty. It's a 
low-budget, stripped-down "Natural Born Killers" that comments on the role of 
the media in making celebrities of criminals without all the hypocritical 
hyperbole of the Oliver Stone film. 
</P>
<P>
 Right at the start, Talkington, in a potent debut, pinpoints the appeal of 
such pictures: Audiences can enjoy condescending to those they consider 
rednecks -- and such couples invariably are none-too-bright hicks -- while 
vicariously experiencing the thrill of a wild spree of reckless adventure and 
passionate sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "My granddaddy told me the only two things you need to get by in this world is 
never to believe anything anyone says and never point a loaded gun," remarks 
Gil Bellows' Watty Watts, petty career criminal, to a wide-eyed 14-year-old 
(Wiley Wiggins) clerk at an East Texas convenience store he has just robbed. 
Watty, however, soon disregards his grandfather's wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he's on the verge of settling down. He's fallen in love with Renee 
Zellweger's giggly, squirmy Starlene, and they're living in a trailer on the 
outskirts of town, not so far from that convenience store. He has his treasured 
'72 Pontiac, and Starlene, despite her demeanor, is more sensible than he is. 
She tries to curb him from doing anything too stupid -- especially with his 
skittish, drugged-out fellow ex-con Billy (Rory Cochrane). 
</P>
<P>
 There's this hitch, though: Watty, carried away with love, has secretly 
purchased a $2,000 engagement ring for Starlene with funds borrowed from an 
underworld type whose crazed, sadistic strong-arms (Jeffrey Combs, Jace 
Alexander) -- who could be right out of "Pulp Fiction" -- are intent upon 
Watty's repayment of the loan in timely fashion. As a result, Watty and 
Starlene are swiftly fugitives, wanted for three murders -- never mind that 
Billy is responsible for one of them and that the other two are in 
self-defense. Billy and the strong-arms seem far more intent than the law in 
catching up with the couple, who in time-honored fashion are heading for 
Mexico. There's a stopover in San Antonio to visit Starlene's hilarious 
suburban hippie parents, played gloriously by Ann Wedgeworth and Peter Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Talkington has roots deep in Texas himself, he writes, as part of his 
satire, quaintly exaggerated dialogue that nobody would speak in real life. 
"Love and a .45" is a comic book, not to be taken seriously, yet Talkington's 
people are real, well-drawn, even though they're caricatures. Talkington not 
only has style but also a terrific way with actors, giving them the confidence 
to go over the top while having fun doing so. Shrewdly, he keeps Watty and 
Starlene as a pair of ultra-sexy innocents in a cold, brutal world. He doesn't 
ask us to like them, but don't be surprised if you find yourself wanting them 
to make good on their getaway.

<P>
 As Watty and Starlene become hyped on TV and in the press, Starlene 
deliriously compares herself and Watty to Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, but 
Watty says it all when he quietly replies, "Everybody gets caught and killed in 
those movies."

MOVIE REVIEW; SOLID PERFORMANCES GIVE POWER TO RAMBLING 'BEANS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" is full of family and place. Adapted from Carolyn 
Chute's 1984 debut novel, it showcases a shambling cast of characters and 
enough backwoodsy local color to double as a documentary. The film, like the 
book, has an almost messianic mission: It wants to give poor rural white people 
their due after generations of caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't really succeed in vaulting cartoonishness, though a few of the 
performers score personal triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Jennifer Warren and scripted by Bill Phillips, the film works up a 
woodsy Romeo and Juliet-style atmosphere. Earlene Pomerleau (Martha Plimpton) 
lives with her family next door to the rowdy Beans, a clan of shaggy varmints 
and ne'er-do-wells including patriarch Reuben (Rutger Hauer) and his mate, 
Roberta (Kelly Lynch), and Beal (Patrick McGaw), who likes to chop wood with 
his shirt off. Earlene, despite her father's almost biblical distaste for the 
Beans, gets pregnant by Beal -- and pulled into the clan. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than she bargained for but, as the years wind on, she becomes one of 
them, and it's not so bad. She finds in the Beans the coziness of family, a 
sense of belonging. Her long-term scrapes with Beal, and her growing attachment 
to Roberta, who has her own brood by Beal, keep her rooted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rootedness is real big in "Beans." But the film does a better job by the roots 
than the plants. The Beans, with the exception of Roberta, never seem like 
full-bodied people. They don't shed their shaggy, scary trappings the more we 
get to know them. Salt-of-the-earth types often come across as stunted in the 
movies, and the Beans are more stunted than most. By comparison, the Joads in 
"Grapes of Wrath" seem like a gaggle of Ph.Ds. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the family-feeling stuff comes through anyway because of the 
performances of Plimpton and Lynch. Jennifer Warren is also a veteran actress, 
and her work with these women is exemplary. Plimpton goes from a randy, 
hormone-driven girl to a caring, full-grown woman. She's worldly in her world.  
</P>
<P>
 Lynch is even better: She's great at conveying how Roberta's lust for Beal is 
cross-wired with her exasperation with him. When Roberta emerges as a 
"respectable" wife, we don't see her transformation as a victory for the 
middle-class over the dirt-poor. It's just a change in circumstance for 
Roberta, and she's as gracious and intuitive in wealth as in poverty. "Beans" 
is a long haul but Plimpton and Lynch pull you through it. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for sexuality and language. Times guidelines: It includes a 
fairly graphic nude scene and a gruesome scene involving backwoods eye surgery.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PAGEMASTER' A LIVE-ACTION ADVENTURE IN WORLD OF BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Pagemaster" is a feature-length, mostly animated commercial for the 
pleasures of library-going. It's rare that a kiddie film makes such a show of 
plumping for the opposition. If the movie succeeds it could backfire for the 
producers. Kids might stay at home reading "Treasure Island" or "Jack and the 
Beanstalk" instead of trooping out to see and re-see "The Pagemaster." 
</P>
<P>
 That wouldn't be so terrible. Despite its admirable intentions, and some witty 
animated sequences, "Pagemaster" seems more like a TV animated show with 
grade-A names. (The voice-overs belong to, among others, Patrick Stewart, 
Whoopi Goldberg and Leonard Nimoy.) Ironically, the film will probably work 
best for children who can't yet read. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins as a live-action feature about Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin), a 
boy so frightened by everything that he won't even eat a tuna fish sandwich 
(it's the mercury). When a storm sidetracks him in the local library, he 
encounters an eerie librarian (Christopher Lloyd) and gets transported into an 
animated world of bookish adventures ranging from "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" to 
"Moby Dick." 
</P>
<P>
 The live-action library has a moldy grandeur that accurately fits how we all 
felt when we first tramped through all those high-ceiling shelves in search of 
our first picture book. There's a wonderfully fluid effect when colors from a 
mural flow into the floor and sweep Richard up in its maelstrom. And Richard's 
book-sized buddies -- the piratelike Adventure (Stewart), the sassy, ethereal 
Fantasy (Goldberg) and the blubbery Horror (voiced by Frank Welker) -- are 
frisky fun. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few other nice things, like the scene where Richard winds his way 
out the belly of a fire-eating dragon by reading "Jack and the Beanstalk." Or 
the way Christopher Lloyd, intentionally no doubt, is a dead ringer for Charles 
Dickens. But producer and co-writer David Kirschner, along with scripters David 
Casci and Ernie Contreras, animation director Maurice Hunt and live-action 
director Joe Johnston, keep the inspirationalism sticky. A little of this 
movie's there-is-no-frigate-like-a-book stuff goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there may be no other way to get kids to read these days 
except to promote books as the ultimate voyage -- a video game of the mind. And 
if it takes Culkin to introduce toddlers to Captain Ahab, I say aye, aye. 
</P>
<P>

scare very little ones.

ART REVIEW; 'EN CALAVERA' OFFERS A LIVELY LOOK AT THE LINARES FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bracing new exhibition at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History tells an 
interwoven tale of the triumph of a group of culturally endangered artists and 
the persistence of one of art's great visual one-liners. It's titled "En 
Calavera: The Papier-Mache Art of the Linares Family." 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly translated, "en calavera" means "as a skeleton." It refers to the 
timelessly resonant image of the coat rack of human bones dressed in the garb 
of the living. The motif tells the species everything it needs to know to make 
it renounce its vanity and violence. Instead, humankind goes its venal way, 
compounding the cosmic joke. We know we're a collection of walking corpses, but 
we just won't take the lesson. No wonder the skull laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The image is historically omnipresent from pre-Columbian skull mosaics through 
medieval memento mori and "alas, poor Yorick." It stalks our streets at 
Halloween, but no occasion uses the motif with merrier macabre abandon than the 
Mexican Day of the Dead. It's a regular carnival of grimacing candy skulls and 
papier-mache bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally these effigies were fashioned by anonymous folk artists living 
hand-to-mouth between the various delirious Mexican fiestas. Over time, their 
situation worsened. Fireworks were banned in 1957. That wiped out the Holy Week 
market for big figures of Judas being burned by exploding firecrackers. 
Mass-produced cheap plastic figures further eroded the market. Mexican folk 
artists became an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Linares family survived through luck, pluck, talent and adapting to the 
times. The clan's lineage as makers of fiesta props around Mexico City goes 
back a century. Their name dates from the 18th Century. An ancestor, Don 
Antonio Chocolpa, chief servant to a wealthy Spanish household, was wrongly 
accused of stealing some silver and banished to the town of Linares. He was 
found innocent and returned, but he kept the name of his place of exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent Linareses stuck together by sticking together paper-and-glue 
papier-mache figures. The patriarch of the present generation was Don Pedro 
Linares, who died in 1992. He lived to see himself and his progeny evolve from 
faceless craftsmen to recognized artists making signed works for the carriage 
trade. Their initial boost came from artists such as Diego Rivera who 
appreciated their exceptional talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Linareses tour the international art circuit and indulge in inter-family 
rivalries. Their works are included in extravaganzas as prepossessing as the 
1989 "Magicians of the Earth" at Paris' Beaubourg center. That show, a melding 
of mainstream and grass-roots art, was a Brobdingnagian disaster largely 
because the earthy directness of the populists made the overworld guys look 
effete. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exhibition had the virtue of predicting the present situation. The end 
of the Cold War sounded a historic call for a new art. Some observers think it 
will come from oppressed ethnic minorities. That would be entirely apt, since 
the modernist subculture is an alienated minority itself. It just got 
bum-rapped as elitist when it was really a meritocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Linareses become exemplary in being the first folk art clan to be 
accorded a one-family show at the Fowler. The show is the brainchild of the 
museum's late Collections Manager, Robert V. Childs, and its organization was 
completed by Susan N. Masuoka, who wrote the affectionate and handsome 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a story with a happy ending. But why are those skeletons still 
grinning? They know the price of success in Vanity Fair -- politics, careerism, 
hollow celebrity and art that is ever slicker and even more vacuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Linareses don't seem headed that way. Maybe it's the constant reminder 
provided by working with subject matter that looks death in the eye and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures known as alebrije provide a ready example. Fantasy monsters of the 
imagination, a chronological grouping shows their evolution from cuddly chimera 
to elaborate dragons of the mind. Miguel and Felipe Linares are particularly 
adept at making these delightfully scary figures. They blend Aztec ferocity 
with the ingenuity of movie special-effects fiends, and they're decorated with 
intricate patterns that look like something invented by a computer doing 
fractal geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 Subject matter grows ever more sophisticated, moving from pinatas to life-size 
tableaux such as "The Aztecs." It poses the timeless question: "Why are these 
proud dead warriors killing each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was virtually fated that the Linareses do tableaux based on the 
revolutionary woodcuts of J.G. Posada, another popular artist who became a 
museum icon. Their flying version of his "Don Quixote" is all the more mordant 
for having a lighter touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to the borders of the fine-art realm expanded the Linareses' field of 
vision to include present-day pop culture, so there are little figures of 
hip-hop skateboarders alongside traditional mariachi musicians, en calavera.  
</P>
<P>
 Any lingering doubts about the expressive status of this work will vanish with 
one look at "Earthquake Scene." Based on the aftermath of Mexico City's 
disastrous 1985 temblor, it's an absurdist masterpiece. Life-size, and 
involving a dozen sculpted figures, it combines the humanity of skeletons 
trying to rescue one another with the horror of a skeleton soldier about to 
shoot a skeleton kid for looting a television set. We just never learn.

THEATER REVIEW; FISHBURNE'S 'RIFF RAFF' A GRITTY EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Riff Raff," the new play written and directed by film actor Laurence 
Fishburne, has the high energy and tight focus of a '90s film noir. The 
creators call it a work in progress, but with its edgy acting and superior 
production values this gritty one-act at Theatre Geo hardly needs a disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is a trashed and abandoned flat on New York's Lower East Side, 
where ex-con Mike (Fishburne) and junkie Torch (Titus Welliver) have fled after 
botching a heroin heist. There they run into Tony (rapper Heavy D), Mike's old 
partner in crime, who may or may not be working for the drug kingpin Mike and 
Torch just robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a tense 24-hour period, with car alarms and police sirens blaring outside 
the hide-out, the trio smoke, eat, reminisce and shoot the breeze as a series 
of betrayals and revelations alters the geometry among the characters. By the 
time the script ratchets down, Fishburne has shown how these urban desperadoes 
are forced to accept their grim destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, Fishburne seems inspired by David Mamet's "American Buffalo." 
"Riff Raff" never matches Mamet's deft, economical use of language, and some 
plot points seem contrived and half-baked. 
</P>
<P>
 But director Fishburne keeps the pace brisk and suspenseful, and all three 
actors turn in crisp, tough portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Riff Raff," Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 p.m. Dark Thanksgiving. Ends Dec. 18.

TV REVIEWS; 'GIVING THANKS' BEFORE TURKEY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What can you make of a show that proclaims its aim is to give the audience a 
"head start on counting your blessings" the night before Thanksgiving when the 
only blessing to be derived will be from skipping this turkey? 
</P>
<P>
 "48 Hours: Giving Thanks" should have been a nice change of pace from the CBS 
newsmagazine's frequently dismal turf of crime, drug abuse, malpractice and the 
like as well as a pleasant diversion the night before you-know-what. Instead, 
Dan Rather & Co. deliver a look at altruism that is irritating when it isn't 
jerking your tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of focus is the problem. "Giving Thanks" mixes up feel-goodism with dabs 
of real journalism to the detriment of both. 
</P>
<P>
 The show starts with the obligatory "48 Hours" star search, in this case 
Rather interviewing Elton John about his AIDS foundation, serving up softballs 
for a solemn John to whack out of the park, taking John's claims about the 
foundation at face value at the same time Rather takes an unanswered shot at 
Dionne Warwick's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 A segment on Michael Christensen's Clown Care Unit comes closest to the show's 
stated theme -- Christensen and his troupe provide a heartwarming alternative 
form of medicine hard to resist. But the good feelings are dashed in the next 
segment about Dance Theatre of Harlem and the fierce competition for dollars; 
the spirit of giving is reduced to a contest to snag the wallets of New York's 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting blessings? How about the segment on a Chicago boy who wins a 
scholarship and then gets murdered on a mean street? Gee, I felt good knowing 
that a foundation gave two scholarships in his name -- especially after 
watching the open casket memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
 Give thanks for remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 "48 Hours: Giving Thanks" airs at 10:10 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). 
(The late start is due to "The Wizard of Oz" running long.)

JAZZ REVIEW; A REDUCED TRIBE STILL STRONG ON INTERPLAY AT LUNAPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lost Tribe's recent "Soulfish" recording is a rhythmically expansive affair 
featuring a varied supply of jazz and hip-hop riffs powered by dual guitars, 
wiry alto sax and strong drumming. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York-based ensemble came up one short Monday at LunaPark.Minus 
guitarist David Gilmore, who remained in New York due to prior engagements, the 
Tribe lost one of its main attractions: the counterpointed attacks of Gilmore 
and guitarist Adam Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 In performance, this loss of density worked in the Tribe's favor, opening up 
its sound to more direct interplay among its remaining four members, while 
emphasizing the improvisational nature of its music. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Brooklyn's M-Base movement, the tough-minded, street-beat jazz genre 
that includes saxophonists Steve Coleman and Greg Osby, will embrace the 
Tribes' accessible, often quirky beats and the inspired, angular play of alto 
saxophonist David Binney. But the Tribe works without the intellectual distance 
that cools much of the M-Base sound. Instead, its material seems designed to 
attract pop audiences albeit while working with definitive jazz sensibilities. 
At the core of this attack is drummer Ben Perowsky, whose muscle and extended 
sense of percussive color -- he substitutes a hubcap for one of his cymbals -- 
kept simple thematic material such as "It's Not What It Is" from feeling 
repetitious. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tribe's best material is more atmospheric. Binney's "Room of Life" 
allowed the saxophonist to build from spare quiet phrases, to soul-baring, 
primal screams. BILL KOHLHAASE

 Was the forecast for scattered votes on Election Day? John Hetts of L.A. 
wonders whether the Nov. 8 election should be invalidated on the basis of a 
"B.C." cartoon strip that ran two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In that feature, an incumbent named Pete keeps opponents from voting by 
bringing rainy weather to their cave openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I guess I'll skip it (the election) this year," says one Cro-Magnon 
fellow who had helped erect such signs as "Delete Pete" and "Oust Peter." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems a bit coincidental, given the miserable weather here in L.A. on 
Election Day and the reelection of Gov. Wilson," Hetts says. "Perhaps an 
investigation into improper contributions from Gov. Wilson's campaign to the 
local meteorologists is in order."

 We hear that Huey, Dewey and Louie are known ticket-scalpers, too: You'll be 
seeing a lot of a duck from the Northwest now that the University of Oregon 
football team has won a Rose Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 If the team's mascot looks suspiciously like Donald Duck, it's because he is. 
But don't worry about the game being held up by an injunction filed by Disney's 
ever-vigilant lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a century ago, Oregon Athletic Director Leo Harris received 
informal permission from his friend Walt Disney to use Donald as the school 
symbol. After Walt's death, Disney's legal eagles drew up a formal licensing 
agreement to get a cut of the Oregon Duck souvenir sales.

a traffic jam, you should feel proud of this area's contributions, as cited in 
"The Prize -- The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power," by Daniel Yergin. Some 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "California, and specifically Los Angeles, was the true incubator of the 
modern service station." (Yergin points out that "east of the Rockies, such 
facilities were called 'filling stations'; west of the Rockies, they were known 
as 'service stations.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 * After the Signal Hill oil strike in the early 1920s, "the next-of-kin of 
persons buried in the Sunnyside Cemetery on Willow Street would eventually 
receive royalty checks for oil drawn out from beneath family grave plots."  
</P>
<P>
 * "By 1920, Shell of California was providing free uniforms to attendants and 
paying for up to three launderings a week. It prohibited the attendants from 
reading magazines and newspapers while on duty, and its manual forbade the 
accepting of tips: 'Air and water is a gratuity which we are expected to render 
the public.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Puzzled young readers should ask parents or grandparents to explain what 
service station "attendants" were. miscelLAny:

TAVRIS ON 'BELL CURVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Carol Tavris' comments on "The Bell Curve" are misleading (Commentary, Nov. 
9). She states the book is based on a "fatal error," that genetic variation, 
which can account for differences among individuals, can also explain 
differences between groups. She says that blacks and whites are like seeds 
brought up in different soil (different environments), which "can" explain 
group differences. 
</P>
<P>
 But since blacks were compared to whites of equal socioeconomic status, she 
must conclude that the children of black doctors, lawyers and professionals are 
exposed to environments as detrimental as that of a ghetto. She says cultural 
groups differ "in a zillion ways," but does not present any evidence to show 
there are sufficient environmental differences across the socioeconomic 
spectrum; her argument boils down to a mere assumption that such environmental 
differences have to exist because she dislikes the alternative. 
</P>

 * I did agree with Tavris when she stated "cultural groups differ in a zillion 
ways that can affect performance on IQ tests." Certainly, if there were IQ 
tests given for each ethnically diverse group that were specifically prepared, 
detailed and written by individuals from that same ethnic group, the results 
would be a better indicator of the IQ of a person from within the cultural 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 I do believe "The Bell Curve" is based on a fatal error of bias and that the 
genes dictate individual differences. Can we rid our country of the old, 
prejudicial, biased IQ tests and implement a new and improved test that can 
truly represent the intelligence of all races? 
</P>

<P>
 * Tavris' analogy between tomato seeds and people is interesting but, 
unfortunately, somewhat oversimplified. For, continuing with her tomato seed 
analogy, we might note that the seeds in one hand differ physically from the 
seeds in the other. Those in one hand are darker than the other. And their 
facial features are different. And they run faster and jump higher. And they're 
susceptible to at least one disease which the lighter seeds aren't. Might they 
not be different in some less obvious ways as well? Intuition suggests the 
answer is, "likely." Perhaps one of those less obvious differences is 
intellect. Perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 Do I consider this an important question? No, I don't. I think that I, along 
with the rest of your readers, can successfully live out the rest of our lives 
without ever having an answer to this question. But the important point is that 
those of us who even ponder the existence of such racial differences are 
quickly labeled "biased." Too bad, but our society's thirst for political 
correctness stands in the way of the search for truth.

PROP. 187 CARTOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The political cartoon by Ted Rall (Commentary, Nov. 16), labeled "California 
Penal Code," was derisive, untrue, inflammatory and racist. The actions of the 
German state in the '30s and '40s were against a segment of their population 
who were citizens of that nation! The actions were torture and extermination! 
To compare that era with a legitimate angst resulting in an attempt to control 
expenditures which are bankrupting our state is mean-spirited and disgusting! 
This issue -- Prop. 187 -- addressed a problem created by illegal immigrants of 
any color, creed, religion or ethnic group.There are legitimate arguments pro 
and con, but this type of attack is below contempt.

 * The cartoon showing a section of the infamous Nuremberg laws with the word 
"Jew" replaced by "immigrant" was right on target. Prop. 187 was the closest 
thing the world has seen to Nuremberg laws since 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 I only hope that legal challenges will result in nullification of this unwise 
and downright evil measure before we slide down the slippery path of Hitlerian 
Germany. It was easy then, as it is now, for a goat to be chosen as the focus 
for all our troubles. The problem with "goatism" is that it is so easy to 
change the object of our scorn. In the past the goat was the Jews (and Gypsies, 
trade unionists, communists and homosexuals) who, when the dust cleared, 
numbered more than 10 million as victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Beware, my beloved state! Speak out now about those who would blame an entire 
group for societal problems.

 * CIA Director James Woolsey obviously has to go, as suggested by Marvin Ott 
(Commentary Nov. 8), and a major overhaul is needed to avert future disasters. 
It is crucial to recognize that combining intelligence and operational

oversight -- especially if funding is generous and accountability lax.

 Among CIA in-house schemes that cost thousands of lives, billions of dollars, 
and still plague U.S. foreign policy, have been the 1953 overthrow of Iran's

in 1954 and the awful fiasco of the 1961 invasion of Cuba's Bay of Pigs.

PHILIP MORRIS CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am disgusted by the heavy spending by the tobacco giant Philip Morris in 
the state Assembly district represented by Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach). The 
Times reported that the giant tobacco company poured $125,000 into the campaign 
of Karnette's opponent, Steve Kuykendall, with the full awareness of Republican 
Jim Brulte (Rancho Cucamonga), the wanna-be Speaker of the Assembly (Nov. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that Karnette served the will of her district on smoking issues. As 
a constituent of the 54th District, I'm pleased that my assemblywoman showed 
the courage to vote for the toughest state ban in the nation on smoking in the 
workplace. I'm also pleased that Gov. Pete Wilson promptly signed this measure 
into law. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Kuykendall also seemed to be a critic of tobacco and special 
interests. As a city councilman in Rancho Palos Verdes, he voted to oppose 
Prop. 188 and to also ban smoking in restaurants. He also focused his campaign 
wrath against "special interest money." 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, it seems that all of the high-sounding talk by Kuykendall was 
simply a hypocritical front. The truth is that he was willing to instantly put 
aside his earlier public record and so-called principles when some really big 
special interest money came his way the weekend before election. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoke and mirrors behind this buy-off by the tobacco industry is 
revolting. At approximately $2 a pack, the Philip Morris contribution would buy 
more than a pack of cigarettes for each person who voted for Kuykendall. Why 
risk losing a courageous civic leader like Karnette to someone who should have 
simply been honest and stood outside the polling booths passing out loose 
cigarettes to any interested voter?

Philip Morris will have its own representative in the California Assembly, 
Kuykendall, in the 54th District, to protect the corporation's interests. So 
nice of Philip Morris to donate that last-minute $125,000 to Steve's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), who resides in the same town 
as Philip Morris headquarters, I guess just down the street, now takes over the 
chairmanship of Energy and Commerce, which so badly treated those tobacco CEOs 
because they denied nicotine is addictive.

subcommittee on health he will "snuff out" congressional investigations of the 
tobacco industry. "I don't think we need any more legislation regulating 
tobacco," Bliley is quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 The article goes on to reveal that Philip Morris is the largest employer in 
Bliley's district and that Bliley's campaign received "substantial 
contributions" from the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of virtuous government, free from the influences of special 
interests, that we can expect from Newt Gingrich and his Republican gang.

LOST SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Two weeks after the happy day on which we became U.S. citizens, we learned 
that we had lost our life savings of $90,000. We wish to thank you for the 
excellent reporting a few months ago about the First Pension scam. 
</P>
<P>
 We had done what any good American should do -- work hard and honest and save 
for our retirement. Now in our 70s, we are reduced to existing on Social 
Security and in December we will have to give up our apartment; in addition my 
wife, who had enjoyed good health, had to be hospitalized with a nervous 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that our sad experience will remind other seniors to be very careful 
when they place their hard-earned savings.

AND STILL THE SURVIVORS WAIT; SNARLED COMPENSATION IN BHOPAL UNDERLINES THE 
PROBLEMS THAT RETARD INDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 10 years have passed since that awful night when lethal, milky-white 
fumes seeped out of the Union Carbide fertilizer plant in the central Indian 
city of Bhopal, crept stealthily into the pathetic cardboard shacks of the 
adjoining slum called J. P. Nagar and dealt terrifying deaths to the sleeping 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters who rushed there the next day found a horrifying scene: draped 
corpses on funeral pyres, wheezing survivors of the asphyxiating gas, hapless 
lines before makeshift outdoor clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Later came the flocks of American liability lawyers looking to make a killing 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters and the international ambulance-chasers are long gone now. But 
the Bhopali victims remain. And with a dreary predictability, impoverished 
survivors and families of the dead still await proper compensation -- five 
years after the Union Carbide Corp. of Connecticut agreed to a $470-million 
settlement with the Indian government. Only about $100 million has yet been 
paid out. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for this speak volumes about the endemic corruption that, 47 years 
after independence from Britain, still retards India's efforts to modernize its 
economy and corrodes its vaunted democracy. A sclerotic bureaucracy affects all 
aspects of life. By one estimate, 20% to 30% of the Carbide money paid out so 
far has evaporated in the form of bribes to government officials, magistrates, 
lawyers, doctors, even secretaries and clerks. Meanwhile, some of the most 
severely disabled are under intense pressure to accept minimal awards and 
subsist in their hovels unless they pay kickbacks to get more. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, it was apparent this would happen. Just days after the 
tragedy, a clerk in a municipal government office in Bhopal wheedled an $8 
bribe from an American reporter for an English-language version of the city's 
master plan, which showed that Union Carbide had been allowed to violate 
numerous laws to put its plant so close to an urban center. 
</P>
<P>
 And very soon many residents of Bhopal, a rather pretty city of elegantly 
manicured parks draped over hills and surrounding two picturesque lakes, were 
claiming compensation for everything from lumbago to psoriasis. There are 
639,000 personal injury claims in a city of 1.6 million, most of them obviously 
bogus. With bodies quickly cremated, no one will ever know how many really 
died, but the figure was at least 2,000, perhaps 4,000 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of the Congress 
(I) Party has made substantial economic reforms, trying to free the economy 
from state control to make India more inviting to foreign investors and to 
entrepreneurial growth. Those reforms are welcome, but the depressing Bhopal 
story suggests that it will take much more.

IS THIS MAN SERIOUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), soon to be chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee and self-appointed interpreter of the American military mind, is at 
it again. Not content with opining the other day that neither he nor "the 
people in the armed forces" believe President Clinton is qualified to be 
commander in chief, Helms in an interview Monday implicitly threatened the 
President with bodily harm if he visited any military base in Helms' home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The heedless recklessness of this statement lifts it above the permissible 
level of partisan tough-talk. What Helms said was politically irresponsible and 
stupid. After a furor erupted, he had sober second thoughts. He admitted he had 
"made a mistake" when he said "Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down 
here (to North Carolina). He'd better have a bodyguard." 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said he wouldn't repeat such comments. Maybe not, but something similar 
wouldn't be unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, promptly 
expressed sharp disagreement with Helms' view about how "people in armed 
forces" feel. But the damage may already have been done. Foreign observers, 
especially those in hostile countries who understand little about the U.S. 
tradition of civilian control over the military, are left to wonder about the 
loyalty of the American military to the commander in chief. That's "commander 
in chief," senator, as in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which 
every member of the military and every senator swears to uphold and defend.

A TREATY MUST BE MORE THAN WORDS; MIDDLE EAST: JORDANIAN TRUST IN THE ACCORD 
WITH ISRAEL AWAITS REAL CHANGES 'ON THE GROUND.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAMAL NAFFA, Kamal Naffa is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Fullerton 
College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Jordanian American, I watched history being made a few weeks ago while I 
was visiting relatives and friends in Amman, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace treaty, signed by Jordan and Israel on Oct. 26, witnessed by 
President Clinton in Wadi-Araba and ratified by both the Israeli Knesset and 
the Jordanian Parliament, has paved the way for various modes of economic 
cooperation and trade, the exchange of ambassadors, bridge-crossing openings, 
tourism and joint projects to build a new, peaceful and prosperous Middle East 
after decades of hostility, wars, pain and deep suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Jordanians, including a former prime minister, opposed the treaty; 23 
members of the 80-member Parliament including a powerful bloc of Muslim 
fundamentalists, voted against the treaty. Jordan, proud to call itself a 
democracy and a pluralistic society, experienced an intense debate about the 
merits and shortcomings of the accord with Israel. The forces of moderation and 
realism won, and immediately King Hussein joyously journeyed to the shores of 
the Sea of Galilee to exchange the ratification documents with Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jordan, there was a general acceptance of Israel as a neighbor, but no 
celebration. Many Jordanians welcomed the peace treaty in large measure because 
of their faith and trust in their popular leader, King Hussein. But it was 
guarded optimism. To suddenly celebrate a peace treaty after 50 years of 
animosity, wars, deep-seated suspicions and negative indoctrination was 
psychologically and emotionally not possible. What was possible, however, was 
the readiness of the people for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the peace treaty endure? Yes, if certain conditions follow.  
</P>
<P>
 First, comprehensive peace needs to be achieved. Peace with Jordan is 
conditional on meaningful full autonomy and self-determination for the 
Palestinians. Also, it is conditional on peace between Syria and Israel. 
Currently, Israel is negotiating peace treaties with each Arab state. But no 
lasting peace is possible unless a comprehensive peace is accomplished -- soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Another condition for the peace process to work is speed. Islamic religious 
radicals are well-organized, well-financed and determined to wreck any 
reconciliation with the Jewish state. The best way to weaken their power is for 
the peace treaty to start paying dividends as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is a need for restitution. The Palestinians must be compensated for 
their losses. This is a monumental task that will involve the United States, 
the United Nations, Israel and Arab countries. The magnitude of this refugee 
problem is great; 457 Palestinian towns and villages have been destroyed by the 
Israeli authorities to make room for settlements since occupation of the West 
Bank in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Another condition for peace requires determining the fate of Jerusalem. This 
is possibly the thorniest problem. Because of the great emotional and religious 
attachment of the Jews and the Arabs to Jerusalem, the fate of this city could 
determine the fate of one or all of the peace accords. There is no reason why 
Jerusalem should not be the capital of both Israel and Palestine. However, it 
will take the wisdom of many Solomons to resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a need to transform attitude and outlook. Both Arabs and Jews 
need to dispel their negative mythologies, stereotypes and fears and start 
seeing each other as human beings. Arabs need to accept that even though Israel 
is an outpost of Western civilization, there is much good in that tradition. 
Israelis must learn that although their neighbors have not yet been fully 
liberated from centuries of Ottoman and colonial rule, they are the heirs to a 
great civilization that enriched and illuminated Europe in the Middle and Dark 
Ages.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the responsibility of the Arab and Jewish communities in the 
United States. The American Jewish community is very powerful politically, 
financially and socially; it has been and is still strongly committed to the 
state of Israel. A symposium of reconciliation and exploration of the 
possibilities of peace should be sponsored by the American Jewish community in 
cooperation with the American Arab community. This would be a fitting 
undertaking to advance the cause of peace by bringing together the best minds 
of both peoples for the first time in 50 years. A peace of dynamic active 
involvement by all would usher in a golden age in the biblical lands of milk 
and honey.

POLITICS THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS; NAME-CALLING AND VILIFICATION BY BOTH THE 
LEFT AND THE RIGHT ARE STRIPPING THE CIVILITY AWAY FROM OUR LIVES.

 Sometime during the stormy election season just past, as an exercise in 
open-mindedness, I began tuning in to Rush Limbaugh's radio talk show. 
Limbaugh's main targets are "femi-Nazis" and "militant environmental wackos," 
and I am proudly one among them, a political progressive who believes that a 
legitimate role of government is to help the less fortunate. From my liberal 
elitist perch, I anticipated that listening to Limbaugh would bring at most a 
bitter laugh. Instead I find the experience oddly liberating. In Limbaugh-land, 
everything I think of as good is bad. Every hero of history, according to 
Limbaugh's term, is the devil. For a few brief moments, my whole world turns 
upside down and I feel immediately the power of adrenalin (pardon the 
expression) rush. 
</P>
<P>
 If the content of our concerns makes me and Limbaugh polar opposites, in 
respect to tactics we are peculiarly alike. The same anger, resentment, sense 
of powerlessness and moral rectitude that has embedded itself into the Limbaugh 
audience and the leadership of the newly victorious political right seem eerily 
familiar to me from the years when Republicans controlled the White House. The 
difference is that in those days, the left spoke to one another in 
consciousness-raising call-in shows over the tiny Pacifica Radio network, not 
across the megawattage of commercial radio where the right now holds forth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message has a familiar ring. Which shouldn't be a surprise. The 
relationship between the new right and the former baby-boomer generation is 
clear, part of the unfolding Clinton-Gingrich dialectic (even their silver 
haircuts are similarly airbrushed.) This generation, which historian 
Christopher Lasch termed "the culture of narcissism" because it expects society 
to ceaselessly meet its demands, is still angry and still counterculture, in 
this case rebelling against a culture that has failed to provide the economic 
stability and opportunity baby boomers felt were promised them at birth. There 
are still white men among the political left, but the numbers are thinning. As 
for women, they are either failing to vote at all or, as in the case of the 
Kathleen Brown gubernatorial bid, going 52% to Gov. Pete Wilson. Which is why 
it is rare to find a day when Limbaugh doesn't boom out, "Welcome to our side," 
to some self-confessed former leftist who now sees the conservative light. 
</P>
<P>
 And in that light, we are finding the resurfacing of many of the 
counterculture attitudes and tactics. There is the same tendency to demonize 
the opposition, willingness to destroy a person's reputation for the sake of a 
political goal, obsession with conspiracy, lack of respect for authority and 
basic unwillingness to engage in a debate on facts. These characterized the 
left during the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush administrations, when we were the 
outsiders filled with rage, "megadittoing" each other with stories of 
conspiracies and dunderheads lurking everywhere. Now the politics of resentment 
has settled in at Congress, and its effects are unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the right's obsession with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton the mirror of 
the left's with Nancy Reagan? Are the putative "conspiracies" surrounding Vince 
Foster's suicide and Whitewater a way of getting even for 30 years of 
Watergate, Iran-Contra and the failure of the thrifts? And will the younger 
Gingrich Republicans turn on their father-figure Bob Dole, just as the left 
spit out L.B.J.? 
</P>
<P>
 It's harder for the left to draw ethical distinctions about the behavior of 
its adversaries, having played the game of "gotcha" so often ourselves. And 
it's difficult to mount the flag of moral superiority toward Limbaugh's and 
Gingrich's use of sophomoric names for enemies ("femi-Nazi" and "McGoverniks") 
when we on the left have done a fair share of adolescent name-calling ("male 
chauvinist pig.") The septic system of politics sullies us all. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of resentment is not pleasant, no matter who plays it. Worse, it 
may be built into the fabric of American reform, an organizing tactic for those 
cast into the role of outsider. How long will we allow the corrosion to 
continue? As the new Republican majority is soon to discover, an attitude of 
resentment is not easily abandoned when outsiders finally win their way back 
in. Our modern political thuggery is exacting a high price and demands that 
each of us share the responsibility if civility, that paper-thin layer that 
separates us from the jungle, is ever to be restored.

HARPER KEEPS CLIPPERS LOCKED UP IN 0-10 START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Harper has a lot to be thankful for. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper wakes up every morning and gives thanks that he escaped from the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The prodigal former Clipper guard, who was suspended for one game after he 
compared playing for the Clippers to being in jail, returned to face his former 
team for the first time since he signed a $19.4-million, five-year deal with 
the Chicago Bulls last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who came into the game averaging only nine points, had 10 points in 
the first quarter and went on to score 21 as the Bulls handed the Clippers 
their 10th loss in as many games this season, 105-93, Tuesday night before 
9,080 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bulls trailing, 85-82, in the final quarter, Harper helped trigger an 
18-0 run, making a three-pointer and a layup and setting up B.J. Armstrong for 
a three-pointer, as Chicago took a 100-85 lead with 3:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Booed before the game, Harper made his first two shots, both three-pointers, 
to silence the crowd. He made six of 11 shots, including three three-point 
shots, and had five rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about the fans," Harper said. "I'm happy to be where I'm at. 
I've still got some fans here. If they knew what happened here, they would be 
booing them (Clipper management)." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dehere, who inherited Harper's spot in the Clipper starting lineup, had 
trouble guarding Harper and was replaced by Harold Ellis seven minutes into the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere, who missed all five shots he took in the first half, wound up missing 
eight of 10 shots and scoring nine points, all of which came in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper seemed to enjoy his homecoming, bantering with his former teammates, 
the officials and fans throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After faking a three-pointer, Harper set up teammate Will Perdue for an easy 
dunk and ran up court laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I didn't talk trash tonight," Harper said. "If I'd have talked 
trash I'd have talked way more than I talked. I didn't talk tonight. Tonight we 
just came out and played." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls came out and played in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who led, 82-78, going into the final quarter, scored only three 
points in the first 8:15 of the fourth quarter, missing eight of nine shots 
before rookie forward Eric Piatkowski was credited with a basket with 3:24 left 
when Greg Foster of the Bulls accidentally tipped it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Outscored, 27-11, in the final quarter, the Clippers shot 27.8%, missing 13 of 
18 shots in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are eight losses away from recording the worst start in NBA 
history. The expansion Miami Heat lost its first 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating," said Clipper forward Loy Vaught, who had 15 
points and 11 rebounds. "That's all people talk to you about on the street. The 
media wants to talk about that. It's difficult to talk about. It's something 
you want to avoid, but that's what keeps coming up. It's not fun to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who helped lead the Clippers to back-to-back playoff berths in 
1992-93, hopes the Clippers win a game soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't no bad guys over there," Harper said. "They're all friends of mine. I 
hope they don't be too bad this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bull center Will Perdue was taken to Daniel Freeman Marina Medical Center with 
a broken nose. Perdue was injured when he was accidentally hit by Clipper 
forward Tony Massenburg. Coach Phil Jackson said Perdue will return to Chicago 
for further treatment. . . . Although former Clipper Dominique Wilkins said he 
thinks the Clippers will break the NBA record for most losses in a season (9-73 
by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73), Harper refused to second Wilkins' 
opinion. "I ain't got nothing to say about Nique's comment that he made," 
Harper said. "That was Nique's opinion. I (chose) not to voice my opinion. I 
just wish them all the luck. I don't know and don't care."

NHL TRIES NEW APPROACH WITH UNION

<P>
 and no season -- if they insist on imposing a payroll tax, are softening their 
stance and are suggesting alternatives, such as taxes on free-agent signings 
and rookie salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ideas were believed to have been presented to union chief Bob Goodenow 
on Tuesday at the end of a five-hour session in Boston. The next meeting is 
scheduled Friday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could move forward, or there's a good chance it could get derailed," a 
management source said. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins, a pessimist throughout the 
process, said Tuesday, "There is hope." 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources on both sides said no issue has been agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a deal being done in a day's time," Goodenow said. "There's an 
awful lot of work yet to be done for there to be an agreement, and there are 
some real sticking points." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman will update the league's Board of Governors today in 
a conference call. "We're trying to build some momentum," he said. "Obviously, 
based on the schedule, time begins to run out in the not-too-distant future." 
</P>
<P>
 If players reject the alternative taxes, owners might still allow the season 
to start if the union compromised on salary arbitration and entry-level 
salaries and agreed to negotiate a tax by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly looking better than it has in a while," a union source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a neutral source: "There's a bunch of pieces to the puzzle to put 
together. But what's clear is the wall (the payroll tax) is gone. They're being 
civil in finding other ways. The question is, when is it enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's believed Goodenow will wait as long as he can to extract a better deal 
from owners who are becoming increasingly anxious about their lack of revenue. 
Even if the regular season is extended to late April, play would have to begin 
by Jan. 1 to squeeze in 50 or more games.

NBA ROUNDUP; TRAIL BLAZERS END PERFECTION FOR ROCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Houston Rockets won't have another perfect November. 
</P>
<P>
 So they won't duplicate their 15-0 start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 So don't tell Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich it was only one game in a long 
season. And don't tell him the pressure is off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit I've been spoiled," Tomjanovich said after the Rockets fell, 
102-94, Tuesday, to Portland at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team has been great, very focused. I'm proud of them, but it hurts to 
lose a home game when we've won so many tough ones on the road. I feel no 
relief. I thought if we played our game we should win." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler scored 30 points to lead the Trail Blazers, who snapped 
Houston's 23-game November winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good road win for us," said Drexler, who had sat out two games 
because of an injured right ankle. "It was a victory that not many teams get. 
Not many people beat them in their own building. We did it in the fourth 
quarter and that's encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Portland outscored the Rockets, 15-9, over the final 5:21. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (9-1) got 27 points from Hakeem Olajuwon and 20 from Vernon Maxwell. 
Cliff Robinson added 29 points for the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the first for the Rockets in November since a 108-99 defeat by 
the Utah Jazz on Nov. 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 112, Minnesota 79 -- Mark Price scored 17 points to lead seven 
Cavaliers in double figures in a victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Minnesota's worst loss in a season in which eight of its nine defeats 
have been by double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 116, Boston 94 -- Vin Baker came home to Hartford, Conn., to score 
20 points and team with Todd Day, who had 23 in leading the Bucks to a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston guard Dee Brown left the game in the second quarter with a bruised left 
knee and did not return. He appeared to have been injured when he tripped over 
a television cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 102, Philadelphia 99 -- Stacey Augmon scored 23 points as the Hawks 
kept Philadelphia winless on the road (0-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 102, Golden State 98 -- Hersey Hawkins scored seven of his 18 points 
in a fourth-quarter stretch at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 104, New Jersey 97 -- Gary Payton scored a season-high 26 points, 
including a layup that put the SuperSonics ahead to stay with 3:04 left at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, a full year before tip-off, the NBA expansion Vancouver 
Grizzlies and Toronto Raptors are at risk of becoming endangered species 
because of a league requirement that they sell 12,500 season tickets by Dec. 
31. By Friday, the Grizzlies had sold only 8,110 tickets and the Raptors had 
sold about 6,500. . . . The NBA Players Assn. has filed a grievance on behalf 
of San Antonio forward Dennis Rodman. . . . Phoenix Sun guard Elliot Perry, who 
suffered a concussion in Monday night's loss to the Jazz, was released from a 
Utah hospital. . . . Charlotte's David Wingate will have arthroscopic knee 
surgery today and be sidelined indefinitely.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is remarkable how well the Notre Dame Fighting Irish perform for Coach Lou 
Holtz the week of the USC game, in his classroom and on the field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 None has failed the quiz on the rivalry, according to Jerome Bettis of the 
Rams, who played for Holtz. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And none has lost to the Trojans. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, Coach Holtz gives the rookies a packet on the history of the USC 
series," Bettis said. "Then they're tested. Anyone who flunks the test isn't 
supposed to suit up for the game, but it seems like everyone always passes." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman in 1990, Bettis passed with flying colors and then gained seven 
yards in his only carry in the Irish's 10-6 victory over USC at the Coliseum. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he rushed 24 times for 178 yards and two touchdowns in a 24-20 
victory at South Bend, Ind., prompting Trojan Coach Larry Smith to call Bettis 
the greatest college fullback he had seen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he rushed 18 times for 89 yards and a touchdown in a 31-23 triumph at 
the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the only thing that stopped him from making it four in a row was the 
NFL draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He bypassed his senior season and, as a 1,429-yard rusher for the Rams, split 
NFL rookie-of-the-year honors with his former Notre Dame teammate, quarterback 
Rick Mirer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the USC and Michigan games were always the biggest on our schedule," 
Bettis said. "The rivalry with USC is tremendous. And I'm from Detroit and had 
to decide whether to go to Notre Dame or Michigan. Originally, I wanted to 
attend Oklahoma, but they were put on probation." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since Holtz replaced Gerry Faust before the 1986 season, the Irish have 
extended their winning streak over the Trojans to 11 games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Holtz is a great motivator and disciplinarian who wants things done his way," 
Bettis said. "But USC's talent is improving and Notre Dame's is slipping." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 So how does he see the outcome of Saturday's game at the Coliseum? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Notre Dame by three points in a squeaker," Bettis said. . . . *

FISHING REPORT: ANAHEIM ANGLER HAULS IN 29-POUND STURGEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that trout can't resist Power Bait, but this is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Burqueno of Anaheim put a glob of the rainbow-colored goop on his hook 
and hauled in a prehistoric-looking sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturgeon are rarely caught at Irvine Lake, and Burqueno must have thought he 
hooked into a monster trout. The fish pulled him around for 1 hour 45 minutes 
before coming to the surface. It was netted and brought to the scale alive, 
weighed in at 29 pounds, then released.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: WILD TURKEY SEASON ISN'T OVER THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are not the best of times for turkeys, and things won't get much easier 
on the birds after Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting season in California lasts until Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't waste your pity. Wild turkeys are far more wary than their domestic 
cousins, and their acute eyesight and hearing make them some of the most 
elusive game the state has to offer. Especially in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty in fall hunting involves locating areas where winter flocks 
have gathered," said Jesse Garcia of the Department of Fish and Game. "The 
flocks usually consist of a hen with her brood, or a small gang of gobblers. A 
group of turkeys may spend an entire winter in a single canyon no larger than a 
square mile." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't count on locating the tom by mimicking a hen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adult toms are usually on their own and won't respond to the hen calls that 
attract them during the spring breeding season," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did offer some tips for first-time hunters, however. 
</P>
<P>
 They include studying audio and visual tapes that demonstrate the proper 
calling techniques for fall; searching areas with good bird dogs and looking 
for places where acorns, pine nuts or dogwood trees are plentiful as well as 
depressed areas where water might collect. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you flush a flock, search the immediate area," Garcia says. "Sometimes a 
stray bird or two will hold, like quail." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, sit uphill from where the birds were and try the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flocks that have been dispersed will try to regroup, so they tend to respond 
well to the 'kee-kee' call, which is the call of the lost jake (young male); 
and an assembly call, or cluck, which is the call of a dominant hen," Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who don't find their turkey don't have to go home empty-handed. Wild 
pigs share some of the same habitat and the season on those hairy beasts -- 
which can be taken by shotguns loaded with single slugs -- is open year-round, 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it's hunting season, it's poaching season as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody could have expected a caper as brazen as that pulled off recently 
in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sets of trophy antlers were stolen from the "Stop Poaching" display at 
the Wyoming Game and Fish regional office in Casper. 
</P>
<P>
 The racks, from two mule deer and an elk, had been confiscated from poachers 
and put on display "to demonstrate the severity of Wyoming's poaching problem," 
the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not given up hope of retrieving the antlers, though, and hopes to get 
some clues through its hot line. Assuming that nobody has stolen the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more than three years since the toxic spill that all but killed 
the upper Sacramento River, and the healing continues, both natural and 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game this month has scheduled a revegetation 
project that includes the planting of more than 2,000 willow and cottonwood 
trees along the 38-miles stretch of affected river, above Shasta Lake. The 
trees, it is hoped, will "refill gaps in the blue-ribbon trout stream's 
riparian vegetation" that were created when a railroad tank car spilled an 
herbicide into the Sacramento at the Cantara Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- The striped marlin bite off Cabo San Lucas did not develop as 
expected, but dorado and tuna have been keeping anglers busy. Some of the tuna 
have been pushing 100 pounds and the dorado are averaging 20 to 45 pounds. 
Noteworthy catches: three yellowfin tuna weighing 170, 153 and 130 pounds, 
aboard Gaviota V; a 172-pound striped marlin aboard Tracy Ann, and a 132-pound 
sailfish aboard Ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape/La Paz: Dorado, tuna and sailfish are abundant throughout the 
region. "There's so many dorado down here right now they don't know what to do 
with them all," said Bob Butler of the Fisherman's Fleet in La Paz.  
</P>
<P>
 Loreto: There are still some dorado, but the prominent catch has been 
cabrilla, one of the tastiest fish in the sea. Yellowtail are beginning to 
show, but the fish are small, with few weighing more than 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- The Long Beach Rod & Gun Club, in cooperation with the Long 
Beach Parks, Recreation and Marine Department, has scheduled its annual Kids 
Fishing Derby for Dec. 3 at El Dorado Park in Long Beach. Prizes will be 
awarded for largest fish -- last year it was a nine-pound carp -- and other 
categories. No cost other than $5 park entrance fee. Details: (310) 598-2403. . 
. . Prospective hunters can obtain their hunter-safety certificate in one day, 
thanks to a 10-hour class being offered Dec. 10 at Mike Raahauge's Shooting 
Enterprise in Norco. Details: (800) 773-4868.

MAUI INVITATIONAL; BIG SECOND HALF SENDS SUN DEVILS INTO FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Frieder knew what was coming and thought about simply sending a message 
about beating an old employer Tuesday. After all, he had left the job at 
Michigan on something other than cordial terms, but that was a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he decided that wasn't the best way to explain Arizona State's 79-62 
victory over the No. 13 Wolverines in the semifinals of the Maui Invitational 
in Lahaina, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieder coached Michigan from 1981 until being forced to resign just before 
the 1989 NCAA tournament when he had accepted the job at Arizona State. Steve 
Fisher was appointed interim coach and led the Wolverines to the national 
championship that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think too much was made of this nonsense," said Frieder after his Sun 
Devils had earned the right to play Maryland for the tournament championship. 
The Terrapins beat Utah, 90-78, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very minute two hours in a lifetime. It was not Frieder vs. Fisher 
or Frieder vs. Michigan. It was Arizona State against Michigan, period." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils (2-0) dominated play from a 38-38 halftime tie, starting the 
second half with a 13-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said coming in the key would be if we could force an up tempo, and it was," 
Frieder said. "Our quickness and athleticism prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan (1-1) missed 10 of its first 11 shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland's Joe Smith matched his career high with 33 points, most from down 
low where he got Utah players in foul trouble in leading the No. 7 Terrapins 
(2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 When the Utes cut the lead to 73-68 with 7:02 to play, Smith scored 10 of the 
Terrapins' next 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Van Horn, Utah's leading scorer, scored 28 points in 22 foul-plagued 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation bracket, No. 11 Indiana (1-1) was a 92-79 winner over 
Chaminade (0-2) and will play Tulane (1-1), a 76-74 winner over Texas A&M 
(0-2), for fifth place.

EXHIBITION BASKETBALL; UCLA HAS TO RALLY PAST ATHLETES IN ACTION, 95-94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Athletes in Action team taking full advantage of UCLA's defensive 
lapses, the Bruins needed two free throws with six seconds left to pull off a 
come-from-behind victory, 95-94, in an exhibition at Pauley Pavilion Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA opens its regular season Saturday against Cal State Northridge, and Coach 
Jim Harrick was not pleased with his sixth-ranked team's final dress rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 AIA, a group of traveling former college and professional players that 
included Shon Tarver, a Bruin starter last season, had gone winless in nine 
previous games against college teams this year. Against UCLA, AIA made 10 of 24 
three-point shots and had a three-point lead with 3:16 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon, who made five of 13 shots from the floor, was fouled on UCLA's 
final possession, and made the two free throws to give the Bruins the victory. 
But the man he defended in the game, Robert Sewell, led all scorers with 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not a very good basketball team right now," Harrick said. "Our 
defense is suspect. . . . Ed and Charles (O'Bannon) and Tyus (Edney) are really 
not playing the kind of basketball we need them to play." 
</P>
<P>
 A bright spot for UCLA was the play of freshmen Kris Johnson, who led the team 
with 18 points, Toby Bailey, who made three of four three-point shots, and J.R. 
Henderson, who scored 11 points. TIM KAWAKAMI

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; BALL DECEIVES WITH HIS SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look at Jerry Ball and the word quick doesn't exactly come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge. Imposing. Immovable. Those are more likely descriptions of the 6-1, 
300-pound defensive lineman, who has most often been compared to a fire 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask the New Orleans Saints and they'll tell you how well Ball moves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's game at the Coliseum, Ball crossed the line of scrimmage so 
quickly after the center snap on one occasion that it appeared he was offside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball has been appearing in opposing backfields with such regularity that even 
his own coach, Art Shell, is surprised. Shell conceded in training camp in 
Oxnard that he didn't realize Ball, who was signed as a free agent in the 
off-season, was such a good pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who played previously for the Detroit Lions and the Cleveland Browns, 
was supposed to be a backup lineman for the Raiders, who figured they were set 
up front with Chester McGlockton, Anthony Smith, Nolan Harrison and Scott 
Davis, who was attempting a comeback after a two-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Davis took two weeks off because of personal problems one week into 
the season, Ball moved in and isn't about to be budged from the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry Ball is awfully quick off the ball, an explosive individual. He's right 
over the ball. He sees that center squeeze the ball and," Shell said, snapping 
his fingers, "he's gone right now. Tough thing to block a guy like that when 
you're sitting in the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ball and McGlockton in the middle, the Raiders have moved into the AFC 
lead and are third overall in the NFL in run defense, yielding 84.5 yards per 
game. In the last two games, against the Rams and Saints, the Raiders have 
given up a total of 38 yards rushing. STEVE SPRINGER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; WASHINGTON MAY PLAY SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Robinson said Tuesday that tailback Delon Washington "certainly" will 
play in any bowl game for USC, and indicated there's a slight chance he could 
play against Notre Dame on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what kind of shape he's in, so I don't know if he can play 
Saturday, although that's not out of the question," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington, the freshman star in USC's opening-game victory over Washington, 
had his eligibility restored Monday. USC had removed him from competition after 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and another freshman player, Ken Cooper, were accused of having 
someone else take their American College Testing exams. Washington said Monday 
he had taken the test again and received an acceptable score.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Cooper failed to score high enough to gain reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson took the blame Tuesday for USC's poor play in Saturday's 31-19 loss 
to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made errors, and that's coaching," he said. "We roughed their kicker on a 
key play, we kicked the ball out of bounds, we got sacked three times in two 
series. . . . it was a whole series of events like that. We were embarrassed 
and disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he wondered early last week about possible emotional fatigue 
with his team, after hard-fought, back-to-back victories over Washington State 
and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we seemed a little tired in practice last Tuesday, but by Saturday 
I thought we were fine," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We felt our young players had matured a lot, that they were on fire . . . and 
that fire was doused. They didn't play well, and that's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's defensive coordinator, Don Lindsey, also felt his players showed 
signs of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Obvious question: Can mental fatigue be eliminated before Saturday, when USC 
tries to snap an 11-year losing streak to Notre Dame?  
</P>
<P>
 Said senior linebacker Jeff Kopp: "If you're emotionally drained when you run 
out of that tunnel before 93,000 people and Notre Dame is waiting there for 
you. . . . Well, something is wrong with you. I'll be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, on being asked which is bigger, USC-UCLA, or USC-Notre Dame: "That's 
like asking which was bigger, World War I or World War II?" . . . Fullback 
David Dotson has a hamstring injury and will not play Saturday. Robinson said 
Terry Barnum will start at fullback, backed up by LaVale Woods. EARL GUSTKEY

 Pat Jones resigned as Oklahoma State's football coach Tuesday to let someone 
else guide a program still trying to recover from NCAA sanctions leveled 5 1/2 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones won 62 games in his 11 years, more than any coach in school history. But 
the Cowboys had six consecutive losing seasons and have gone winless in the Big 
Eight during three of the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said victories and losses had far less to do with his decision than the 
need to upgrade facilities and improve funding in order to put the Cowboys on 
equal footing with other Big Eight schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' resignation leaves the state's two major universities without coaches. 
On Monday, Gary Gibbs resigned at Oklahoma, effective at the end of the season.

 Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier will not receive an extra year of college 
eligibility to make up for a season cut short by recurring blood clots. The 
NCAA administrative review panel denied Frazier's appeal for medical hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior, Frazier played in the Kickoff Classic as well as regular-season 
games against Texas Tech, UCLA and in nine plays of the first quarter of the 
game against Pacific before being hospitalized with a blood clot in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Another clot formed about a week after drugs dissolved the first clot. Frazier 
has stayed sidelined because the blood thinners he must take prevent him from 
having contact in practice or a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The university argued that the Kickoff Classic should be considered like bowl 
games, and Frazier's play in that game should not be counted toward his 
eligibility.

LOS ALAMITOS; IN BIG RACE, YOU GOTTA HAVE HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been called a legend in the world of quarter horse racing. His mounts 
have won more than $26 million. His name has long been associated with leading 
trainers and champion horses. He is jockey Kenny Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart reached another milestone when he rode Meter Me Gone to victory in the 
$36,800 QHBC Far West Futurity last Friday night, winning his 2,200th quarter 
horse race at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart is the leading active rider at Los Alamitos, and is second only to former 
jockey Danny Cardoza in victories there. Cardoza, who now trains at Los 
Alamitos and, coincidentally, trains Meter Me Gone, won 2,528 Los Alamitos 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of competition could have led to an intense rivalry, but instead, 
Hart and Cardoza are good friends, as well as colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny Cardoza and I have been the best of friends since I came (to Los 
Alamitos) in 1969," Hart said. "For years and years we were 1-2 (in the 
standings), and everybody tried to make it a rivalry between us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything together -- we hunted together, we fished together . . . we 
took vacations together." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much riding experience between them, what does trainer Cardoza tell 
jockey Hart before the race? 
</P>
<P>
 "He just laughs," Hart said. "He tells me how the horse has been doing, and 
stuff like that. Just like if I was training and I had Cardoza on the horse. I 
could tell him anything I wanted to, that doesn't mean he's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has been doing things his way since he started riding match races at 11. 
By the time he was 16 and old enough to get his jockey's license, he knew 
riding was what he wanted to do. Thanks to an established rider, Hart got his 
chance in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perry Walker picked me up and took me under his wing and started me in the 
races at Ruidoso (Downs in New Mexico)," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 After ending his first season at Ruidoso Downs as the leading apprentice, Hart 
moved to Los Alamitos, where he rode for, among others, eventual father-in-law 
and trainer Gene Chambless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw Kenny when he first got started," said Chambless' widow, Gwen. "(Gene) 
thought he was one of the best jockeys around. We always encouraged him to be 
in thoroughbreds, but he wanted to be in quarter horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart isn't entirely sure he made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of chances to go thoroughbred, and I just wasn't smart enough," 
he said. "There'd have been a lot more money in (thoroughbreds). I wouldn't 
have had to do half as good as I have in quarter horses, and I'd have made 50 
times the money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart has done well enough in quarter horse racing. He led the jockey 
standings at Los Alamitos 11 times before moving back to Texas in 1988, when 
the lack of a Bay Meadows quarter horse meeting left California jockeys with 
six months off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart now lives in Capitan, N.M., near Ruidoso Downs, and works on the cattle 
ranch of R.D. Hubbard and Don Ferris. He rides at Ruidoso Downs during the 
summer meeting, then commutes to other tracks the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart is the all-time leader in money won, and has ridden such champions as 
Florentine, Town Policy and Special Leader. He is the leading stakes rider at 
Los Alamitos with 131 victories, and has influenced dozens of young jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, who recently turned 47, is often asked about his plans for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what else I could do that I could have more fun at," Hart said. 
"I've had a lot of spills, but I still get around good and I still enjoy 
riding. I'd like to ride another couple of years, as long as I'm doing good." 
</P>
<P>
 And he still has at least one unrealized goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only big race I haven't won is the All American (Futurity)," he said. "I 
rode that son of a buck, like, 16 times, and not won it. I've run everywhere 
you can run in that race, and not won it. I'd like to win the All American 
before I quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey G.R. Carter was involved in a spill in the sixth race Saturday night, 
then returned and won the 10th race, the QHBC Far West Derby. Carter rode 
Follow The Sign to victory for owner Patricia Visscher and trainer H.J. 
Visscher. . . . There is no live racing at Los Alamitos on Thanksgiving. Racing 
will resume Friday, with a 7:15 p.m. post time.

 Complaint Against U-Haul Ads Referred to FTC: In an unusual move, the National 
Advertising Review Board, the advertising industry's self-regulatory agency, 
referred to the Federal Trade Commission a complaint against the company's 
advertised "guaranteed reservations" claims. The board said it made the 
referral after U-Haul International Inc. failed to indicate that it would 
comply with the board's recommendation to quit using the potentially misleading 
claim in its Yellow Pages ads.Phoenix-based U-Haul, the nation's biggest 
consumer truck-rental firm, denied that the ads are misleading. The company 
also said it needs more time to review the panel's ruling and that it would not 
be rushed into a decision. The dispute centers on interpretations of the word 
guaranteed. The Better Business Bureau of Western Washington challenged the 
U-Haul ads after receiving complaints from consumers who didn't get vehicles 
they had reserved despite what telephone directory ads promised. U-Haul argued 
that it provides the requested vehicle 99% of the time and is able to satisfy 
most of those whose trucks or trailers are not available with comparable 
vehicles at the same prices and often with more amenities.

 Indiana to Launch 11 Casino Boats: State authorities said they will award 
licenses soon for the riverboats to ply waters from Lake Michigan to the Ohio 
River, making it the sixth state to allow floating games of chance.The state's 
Supreme Court cleared the way this week by ruling against a legal challenge to 
last year's vote in which riverboat gambling was approved by residents of two 
Indiana cities and five counties. Five of the 11 casino boats will cruise the 
waters of Lake Michigan within a short driving distance of Chicago, with the 
first launch likely in the spring. Some plans put forward by gambling companies 
call for huge floating casinos, accompanied by dockside hotels and 
entertainment.

 7.8% Rise in Health Care Spending Reported: Health care spending rose to 
$884.2 billion in 1993, up 7.8% over the previous year, the Health and Human 
Services Department reported. The amount was equal to an estimated average of 
$3,299 per person for the year, with the per-person spending up $205.The 
department said that although the rise in 1993 was the slowest since 1986, the 
increase was still 2.4% faster than the growth in the overall economy. Because 
of this, the share of the domestic national product spent on health care rose 
to 13.9% in 1993, up from 13.6%. Department Secretary Donna Shalala attributed 
the slow growth in health spending to very low inflation in the rest of the 
economy rather than to permanent changes in the health sector. However, Mike 
Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, 
which helped defeat the Clinton Administration's cost-control proposals for 
health spending, said the low growth figure demonstrates that "the market is 
working better and can work. And if we remove some barriers, the market can 
work even better."

 Gaylord Entertainment Says It's Not for Sale: USA Today reported that the 
entertainment company -- which owns the Nashville Network, Country Music 
Television, the "Grand Ole Opry" and other properties -- is on the block and 
could fetch as much as $3 billion. But Gaylord Entertainment Co. said Tuesday 
that it is not for sale, despite reports that Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting, 
Tele-Communications Inc. and Tribune Co. had expressed interest in buying 
it."The company has from time to time in the past engaged in preliminary 
discussions about potential transactions involving the company as a whole, but 
the company is not for sale and is not engaged in any discussions with any 
party regarding its sale," Gaylord said. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst who 
follows media companies for Josephthal Lyon & Ross Inc. in New York, said 
Gaylord has had discussions with other companies but has not entered into 
serious negotiations. "There's a big bridge to cross to get from a discussion 
to a negotiation. A discussion agrees you're for sale, then a negotiation says, 
'How much?' " McAlpine said.

REGULATORS ADOPT S&L CONVERSION RULES; BANKING: FDIC, OTS WANT TO CURB 
PROFITEERING BY EXECUTIVES WHEN DEPOSITOR-OWNED THRIFTS GO TO STOCK OWNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bank and thrift regulators finalized rules Tuesday aimed at curbing 
profiteering by bank executives when depositor-owned savings institutions 
convert to stock ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of 
Thrift Supervision also are meant to ensure that depositors -- already hurt by 
the thrift debacle -- don't get hurt again when their "mutual" savings banks or 
thrifts go public through a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are similar to draft proposals issued earlier this year and adopted 
on an interim basis. They impose curbs on the benefits insiders can reap from 
the deals and give depositors a greater voice in approving any plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and others say insiders at the institutions have netted windfalls at 
the cost of depositors by setting the stock offering price well below the value 
of the institution or by taking a disproportionate number of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, those who could buy big chunks of stock typically saw the 
prices of their new holdings jump roughly 25% on the first day of trading  
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Congress, regulators now want to make sure depositors get 
a fair crack at the financial payoffs from the conversion of a depositor-owned, 
or mutual, institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the more egregious stuff we've seen in the past is coming to an end," 
banking consultant Bert Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC, which oversees state-chartered savings banks, and the OTS, which 
regulates federally chartered thrifts, did make a key change from the initial 
plan: A mutual institution planning to convert will not have to give a 
preference to local depositors if a conversion stock offering is 
oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial proposal had given preference to depositors in an institution's 
"local community" or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the 
converting bank. Some investors had put small deposits in many mutual savings 
institutions nationwide in hopes of scoring a profit through a conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The final rules, which will take effect Jan. 1, also provide the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposed conversion must be approved by at least a majority of an 
institution's depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 * The use of so-called "running proxies" will be banned. These are proxies 
obtained by an institution from depositors at the time they open accounts and 
later used by management without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term depositors must be given first chance to buy the stock of a 
converting institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * An institution wanting to convert must give regulators a business plan 
spelling out what will be done with proceeds the deal generates. The plan must 
also give an earnings projection for the new institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regulators must receive a full appraisal report. Appraisers or their 
affiliates are generally barred from also serving as underwriters or selling 
agents in the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, thrift regulators eased rules covering conversions in hopes 
of spurring investors to pump new capital into the thrift industry, then awash 
in red ink. Since then, however, the industry has become profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs have already appeared indicating that the conversion process has slowed. 
This is in part a reflection of higher interest rates. In addition, though, 
experts said, higher appraisal values for converting institutions have cut the 
opportunity for investors to net big profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the conversion process is not a very exciting thing," said Paul 
Bauer of Bauer Financial Reports, a bank research firm in Coral Gables, Fla.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; THE ADVENTURES OF A TRAVELER ON THE TRAIL OF A TALISMAN; 
THE AFGHAN AMULET: TRAVELS FROM THE HINDU KUSH TO RAZGRAD BY SHEILA PAINE ; A 
WYATT BOOK FOR ST. MARTIN'S PRESS $21.95, 278 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Man instinctively regards himself as a wanderer and wayfarer," wrote Thomas 
Merton, "and it is second nature for him to go on pilgrimage in search of a 
privileged and holy place." 
</P>
<P>
 There's something of the pilgrimage and the quest at the heart of Sheila 
Paine's "The Afghan Amulet," an account of her journeys through Asia Minor in 
search of the origins of a rare and remarkable amulet that shows up in clothing 
and jewelry from Afghanistan to Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these devices protected the wearer from the djinn ," she explains, "whose 
evil spirits that in Islamic mythology lurk among men and angels, ready to 
attack but known to be frightened by dazzle, by colour, by curving lines and by 
the tinkling of a woman's clothing as she moves." 
</P>
<P>
 So we learn right away that Paine is a sophisticated observer of both folkways 
and fashion; she is an intrepid traveler who is not afraid to trek into the 
farthest reaches of the Hindu Kush or the most desperate precincts of 
battle-ravaged Afghanistan. And she is a writer whose work is full of high 
spirits, subtle wit and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Her quest begins in a London shop, where she first sees a tribal garment that 
features the intriguing amulet design -- "a triangular motif dangling with 
tassels." Because none of the so-called experts can tell her what she wants to 
know about the amulet -- was it a fertility symbol, a soothsayer's badge, a 
cosmological map, a talisman to ward off the evil eye? -- she vows to find out 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its origin remained a mystery," she writes of her motive for a truly heroic 
undertaking. "It was a mystery that intrigued me." 
</P>
<P>
 The places that she visits embody a great swath of geography that stretches 
from Pakistan to Turkey to Bulgaria, a vast sweep of history that reaches from 
the armies of Alexander the Great to the Afghan guerrillas and Kurdish refugees 
of our own times. 
</P>
<P>
 Paine's adventure is not merely a lark. She ventures, alone, into war zones 
and police states and punitive theocracies, and she often finds herself in 
remote places "still beyond the law" where lone Europeans tend to disappear and 
show up dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iran is closed," a Pakistani official shrieks when Paine announced her 
intention to cross the border into Iran. "You will be killed there. Or taken 
hostage. It will be bad for the Department of Archaeology." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paine is undaunted, and she describes journeys that bring her into contact 
with people and places that we might expect to find in a musty old volume of 
Rudyard Kipling. Indeed, the secret of the amulet is ultimately far less 
important than the mighty efforts she undertakes to unlock its secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she is recruited for wifely duties by a local potentate in the 
Hindu Kush whose symbol of authority is a Kalashnikov rifle. Later, she is 
interrogated by a Pakistani police officer who confides to her that "one of my 
ancestors . . . was knighted by Queen Victoria's son." And she narrowly escapes 
an encounter with a band of Islamic Guards who troll the marketplace in search 
of women wearing a trace of lipstick or showing a strand of loose hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The punishment if you're caught is a fine of 200,000 rials, a day shackled in 
prison and 40 lashes of the whip," she learns. "They let you off the whip if 
you're pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 Because textiles are Paine's real passion, she pauses to describe what is 
being worn -- and why. She notices when women in a mountain valley, far from 
the ravages of technology and popular culture, are garbed in polyester. And she 
spots the Coca-Cola bottle caps and military buttons that are sewn into the 
ceremonial hoods worn of an obscure pagan cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Paine is impressed by much of what she sees, but she does not offer up local 
color merely for its curiosity value. One moment she may compare a verdant 
valley to "a casual Miro brush stroke," but a moment letter, she describes the 
sight of a dying baby in a village square. And even when her prose takes on the 
rhythms and images of poetry, she remains clear-eyed and unsentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "If India is a land of labyrinths, a maze that at the turning grasps the heart 
with a flick of sari, with an intensity of colour, with sharp musky scents, 
marigolds and dusty beggars," she writes, "Pakistan is a corridor with violence 
as its walls, stained with blood like spat betel juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Paine places herself squarely in a tradition of English literary travel 
writing that ranges from Charles Doughty's "Travels in Arabia Deserta" to Bruce 
Chatwin's "The Songlines." Perhaps the highest praise that I can bestow upon 
"The Afghan Amulet" is to say that Sheila Paine clearly belongs in such grand 
company -- and, in fact, she brings something new and unique and distinctive to 
the genre.

QUAKE THEFT PROBE TARGETS FIREFIGHTERS; INVESTIGATION: UP TO 13 SCRUTINIZED IN 
INTERNAL INQUIRY IN SANTA MONICA MAY FACE DISCIPLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 13 Santa Monica firefighters face disciplinary action after 
allegations that they took items left behind by tenants forced to evacuate an 
earthquake-damaged apartment building, fire officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure by Santa Monica Fire Chief Richard Bridges came after the Fire 
Department concluded a monthlong investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ease public concern about the integrity of its firefighters, 
Santa Monica officials announced that they have asked the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to conduct an independent criminal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have utmost confidence in (those) who serve the department," said City 
Manager John Jalili, "but in this instance the public needs to be reassured 
that the matter is being handled thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal probe was initiated after guards for a private security firm 
reported seeing firefighters removing furniture, clothing and other items from 
the 178-unit Sea Castle Apartments on Oct. 4, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former tenants had been allowed into the red-tagged building between Sept. 
19 and Oct. 1, under supervision, to retrieve their belongings. Fire officials 
have said that on the day the alleged thefts occurred, firefighters had 
returned to remove household hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Bridges nor Jalili would comment about the findings of the Fire 
Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources familiar with the probe said that investigators interviewed 
30 firefighters and that the actions of 13 were under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Although careful to avoid the appearance of condoning the alleged incidents, 
city officials have suggested the allegations are partly the result of 
confusion about the status of the abandoned property. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the probe said some firefighters told investigators 
they saw nothing inappropriate in taking the items -- which allegedly included 
a baseball card collection and a television -- because they thought their 
owners did not want them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firefighters said that they accepted some items as gifts and that they 
removed others with the intent of donating them to charity, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that firefighters may have helped themselves to property left 
in the building has drawn a mixed reaction among the building's former tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were things I left behind that I would have liked to have taken," said 
Stephen Brown, who lived in the building for 10 years. "I would have liked to 
have had another chance to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
 But another former tenant said the firefighters were getting a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether they violated their own rules," said Nan Faessler, a 
13-year resident. "But they did everything possible to accommodate us. People 
who left things either didn't want them or were too stupid to take advantage of 
their opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Castle was sealed off after the Jan. 17 earthquake caused major 
structural damage. After the building was shored up, each former tenant was 
given four hours to recover belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Faessler said that despite the time limit, fire officials allowed 
residents as much time as they needed to remove items during the cleanup 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Castle is among 81 quake-damaged buildings in Santa Monica to be 
shored up as part of a program to allow residents to retrieve their property. 
There have been no similar complaints from any of the more than 1,500 other 
apartment dwellers affected by the program.

BITTER PAGE OF HISTORY; KOREATOWN LIBRARY OPENS TO SERVE AS MEMORIAL TO 
'COMFORT WOMEN' TAKEN BY JAPAN IN WWII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a century after as many as 200,000 Asian women were forced into sexual 
slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army, a memorial library has been established 
in Los Angeles' Koreatown to carry on an international campaign to bring 
justice and reparations for the victims of one of the cruelest chapters in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's opening of the library by the Los Angeles-based Coalition Against 
Military Sexual Slavery by Japan coincided with the visit of prominent South 
Korean human rights leader Hyo-Chae Lee, who has been instrumental in bringing 
the issue to the attention of the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 The library contains books, photos and other materials documenting the 
government-run brothels, and interviews with survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that the first memorial to the women should be in America," Lee 
said. The retired sociology professor has battled the Japanese and South Korean 
governments over the issue of reparations for the victims of what, she said, 
"can only be defined as a crime of genocide against the Korean people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is co-chairwoman of the Seoul-based Korean Council for Women Drafted for 
Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, which is demanding that the Japanese 
government fully disclose what happened and how many women were involved. It 
also wants Japan to set up a program to enable victims to file claims and to 
pay $40,000 in reparation to each victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the Koreatown photo exhibit that shows Japanese soldiers lined up 
for their turn outside a battlefield brothel, Lee said the brutality committed 
against the women, 80% of whom were Koreans, cannot be dismissed simply as one 
of the "horrors of war" because Korea was a Japanese colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan's crime against the women is unprecedented, even among the brutal war 
histories of humankind, because this enslavement of Korean women was carried 
out systematically as an official policy of the Japanese government," said Lee, 
70. She says she, too, could have been a victim, had she come from a less 
privileged background. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Historians believe 100,000 to 200,000 women from Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan, 
the Philippines and parts of Southeast Asia were conscripted by the Japanese 
government to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese troops from the 1930s to 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of denial, the Japanese government in 1992 admitted its 
involvement. The admission came after Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest 
newspapers, printed documentary evidence unearthed in government archives by 
Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the growing pressure of international public opinion, the Japanese 
government announced a multibillion-dollar program in September to indirectly 
compensate victims of Japan's wartime atrocities by setting up a foundation 
that will build and operate youth centers in Asian countries to train young 
people, promote exchanges and collect historical materials.  
</P>
<P>
 News media in Japan and Korea have reported that the Japanese government is 
considering a plan to establish a $100-million, privately financed fund from 
which to make direct payments to the surviving women. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee and other human rights activists say the reparations must be made by 
the Japanese government, and accompanied by an individual apology to the 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee returned to Seoul this week after conferring with local supporters in time 
to attend a conference of Japanese and Korean Bar associations to discuss the 
issue in the South Korean capital. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other leaders have been critical of South Korean President Young-Sam 
Kim's position that his country would take the "high moral ground" by not 
seeking monetary compensation for the women, and instead pay them monthly 
stipends from the South Korean treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The local coalition is conducting a petition drive to gather 1 million 
signatures to submit to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it 
convenes in February in Geneva. The commission, which has been investigating 
complaints lodged with the agency by a consortium of human rights and women's 
groups from South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and the United States, is 
expected to have an interim report. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a commission recommendation is not legally binding, it does have 
"moral and political authority," said Charlotte Bunche, director of the Center 
for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University, which has been working 
with the coalition. Bunche said the international pressure has made the Tokyo 
government come as far as it has. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaksook Chun Kim, co-leader of the Los Angeles group, who has met with 
survivors in South and North Korea, said some of the so-called "comfort women" 
were 11 and 12 years old. Kim, retired director of the Korean Studies Center at 
UCLA, said the girls were shipped as "military supplies" and transported on 
military trains and ships to front line battlefields where they endured sexual 
abuses at the hands of Japanese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung-Ja Noh, now 72, said that when she was 16 she was abducted from her 
Korean village and taken with 38 other girls to China amid the Sino-Japanese 
war. The girls were forced to have sexual intercourse, sometimes with as many 
as 30 soldiers a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, during former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's state 
visit to Seoul, Noh overcame the shame and humiliation she had felt for more 
than five decades and joined demonstrators at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Noh, most "comfort women" did not live to return home after the war, 
according to Lee and other researchers. They died in the front lines with their 
oppressors in China, Manchuria, the Philippines, Burma, Okinawa and the Solomon 
Islands. Some were killed by Japanese soldiers bent on destroying evidence, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan's defeat in 1945, the remaining women were dumped, according to 
Chung-Ok Yun, the other co-chairwoman of the Korean Council for Women Drafted 
for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. She has researched the subject for two 
decades and tracked down dozens of survivors throughout Asia. Young women, many 
of them burdened with babies fathered by Japanese soldiers, were left to wander 
in Asia, she said. Only a few returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, at least 400 survivors -- all in their late 60s and 
70s -- have come forward publicly to recount their nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried a river when I met with survivors," said Los Angeles attorney Inja 
Kim, who visited Pyongyang last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in her 70s told Kim how Japanese soldiers made a group of Korean 
girls in one "comfort station" submit to them. "A lieutenant who was met with 
resistance from one girl, cut off her arms, legs and head and showed it to the 
other girls," Inja Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kim, noting Japan's announced yearlong period of self-reflection 
leading to the 50th anniversary of Japan's defeat next Aug. 15, said it's time 
the country stopped evading its "moral, political and legal responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how rich Japan is, it can never stand tall in the community of 
nations," she said, as long as it does not clear its past and make peace with 
its Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the observance, Kim suggested that the Japanese government create a 
monument to the victims in the heart of Tokyo. "That should serve as a reminder 
that this atrocity against women must never repeat itself," Kim said.

FLEISS DEFENSE RESTS, CLAIMS ENTRAPMENT; TRIAL: ALLEGED HOLLYWOOD MADAM AND 
JURY SHARE LAUGHTER OVER SCENES IN VICE STING VIDEOTAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wrapping up with another dose of unintentional comic relief, the defense 
rested Tuesday in the Heidi Fleiss trial, reiterating its claim that the 
alleged Hollywood madam was entrapped by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss -- looking healthier than she has in two years and attired once again 
in a business suit and spectacles -- broke her impassive facade only once, 
laughing with the jury as they viewed more scenes from an often hilarious 
videotape of the vice sting that resulted in her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old alleged madam has pleaded not guilty to charges of pandering 
and possession of cocaine for sale. Her case is expected to go to the jury 
after closing arguments next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' lawyers pressed their contention that it was the police -- not Fleiss 
-- who initiated the assignation that ended in her arrest in June. In that 
incident, Detective Sammy Lee, a slight, mustachioed Beverly Hills vice officer 
who used his own Ferrari as a prop, posed as a Honolulu textile heir who needed 
four call girls to clinch a deal with some Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has testified that he sought out Fleiss through one of her girlfriends at 
a party at the Rangoon Racquet Club, getting her telephone number and later 
calling her to set up the fateful date. In June, 1993, he testified, Fleiss met 
him at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, telling him that procuring women and some 
cocaine would be "no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting and the assignation were secretly taped by police. On Tuesday, 
defense attorneys sought to prove the crime would not have occurred had 
authorities not set it up, pointing out scenes in the video that depict 
undercover vice cops -- not call girls -- raising the subject of paid sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, however, seemed more impressed with the goofy spectacle provided by 
both the cops and call girls, as yet another American-born vice cop was shown 
doing a bad impression of a Japanese businessman, while his would-be consort 
took her best shot at appearing sophisticated beyond her years. 
</P>
<P>
 In one encounter caught on tape, confessed call girl Brandi McClain -- who has 
said in interviews that she became a weekend "Heidi girl" to put herself 
through a San Diego community college -- accepts fifteen $100 bills from Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who pretends that he is the only businessman in the group who can speak 
fluent English, has the 23-year-old McClain sitting demurely in a chair while a 
fellow officer, posing as his middle-aged Tokyo investor, sits in his shirt 
sleeves on a corner of the king-size hotel bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Steven Takeshita testified Tuesday that he did 
his best to convincingly play his role as the investor, even though he speaks 
very little Japanese. At one point in the video, he tries to get McClain to 
explicitly solicit him by asking in broken English: "You no do certain type?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Like what?" the 23-year-old in the conservative pantsuit asks earnestly. Lee 
urges McClain to "tell him what your plan is" and McClain draws another blank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like what?" she repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad-libbing, Takeshita fumbles for a moment and then blurts out the Japanese 
word for "rear-end." McClain looks at him quizzically and he stammers in 
English, "Um, backside!" 
</P>
<P>
 "My backside?" she laughs incredulously. "What about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita testified that he and Lee were trying to coax McClain into detailing 
which sex acts she would or would not engage in for pay. The jury burst into 
uncontrollable giggles as the tape showed the two officers ad-libbing before 
McClain in ersatz Japanese, making up words for various sex acts as the 
wide-eyed McClain marvels, "Oh, is that what that means?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sting, which was filmed via hidden camera and monitored by up to 20 police 
officers from an adjoining room, culminates in a suggestion by Lee that each 
man choose a young woman. "And get naked!" McClain interjects merrily. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Lee asks the women to do a striptease. They self-consciously 
comply, simultaneously giggling and singing because of a lack of music to 
undress by. 
</P>
<P>
 Two are topless and the rest are in underwear when police burst in. On the 
stand, Takeshita said the request to disrobe had been planned in advance to 
buttress evidence that the women intended to have paid sex. The dancing, 
however, was not necessary to make the case and was added to the request on a 
whim, he said.

U.S. JUDGE EXTENDS BAN ON PROP. 187; COURTS: ORDER EMPHASIZES THAT STATE CANNOT 
BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION. L.A. COUNCIL EASES STAND ON MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court ban on implementing most portions of Proposition 187 was extended to 
mid-December by a federal district court judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In setting a Dec. 14 hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction, U.S. 
District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made it clear that the state cannot issue 
any regulations to enforce the initiative's cutoffs of public education, health 
and social welfare services for illegal immigrants before that session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the most important thing of all: There shall be no regulations 
published or disseminated without the further order of the court," Pfaelzer 
said after an hourlong hearing featuring legal jockeying by attorneys in four 
cases that have been filed to thwart the state initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a sharply divided Los Angeles City Council softened its stand on 
the measure, calling on City Atty. James K. Hahn to clarify its impact on the 
city rather than seek to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 9-5 vote Tuesday came after more than a week of heated phone 
calls from many constituents who objected to tax money being used to challenge 
the measure, which was approved by 59% of voters on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the council action, however, the city will not immediately drop its 
attempt to join the federal lawsuit before Judge Pfaelzer on the side of the 
the American Civil Liberties Unnion of Southern California, the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and others seeking to overturn the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because Hahn, the city's chief legal adviser, has said that a legal 
challenge is the best way for the city to learn how it should administer a host 
of social service programs not specifically addressed in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said Tuesday that he intends to proceed with the city's effort to 
intervene in the case. But he said the new council directive will cause him to 
pursue other avenues for clarifying the law as well. One alternative might be 
seeking an opinion from the state attorney general's office, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council motion approved earlier in the day calls on Hahn "to take only the 
actions necessary to clarify the legal issues concerning those aspects of 
Proposition 187 that impact the city's operations." That contrasted with the 
council's stand the day after the initiative was approved to "set aside the 
provisions of Proposition 187 . . . by challenging its constitutionality." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine council members who support the proposal said it would make clear 
that they do not intend to thwart the will of the voters. But the five who 
voted "no" said it was merely a political expedient that they believed would 
not change Hahn's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said he would drop the challenge if the City Council ordered him to do 
so. "Under the City Charter, the council directs all litigation," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, who headed the effort to reverse the city's stand, 
said he believes that Hahn will find another way to clarify the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs had been supported by council members Laura Chick and Hal Bernson in 
opposing the council's previous hard stand against Proposition 187. They were 
joined Tuesday by six others -- John Ferraro, Zev Yaroslavsky, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Marvin Braude, Nate Holden and Rudy Svorinich Jr. -- in 
softening the earlier action. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking by their earlier call for a constitutional challenge were council 
members Jackie Goldberg, Ruth Galanter, Richard Alarcon, Mike Hernandez and 
Richard Alatorre. Councilwoman Rita Walters was absent Tuesday but previously 
voted to challenge the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. issued a temporary 
restraining order -- which Pfaelzer extended until Dec. 14 -- halting 
implementation of all portions of the measure except its stiffened sanctions 
for the sale and use of fraudulent citizenship documents. Byrne said that some 
provisions may conflict with federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's status conference before Pfaelzer, who will continue to handle 
the case, state Assistant Atty. Gen. Charlton Holland said Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren and Gov. Pete Wilson would be willing to extend Byrne's restraining 
order indefinitely while the state prepared regulations for the initiative's 
enforcement and made motions to dismiss the case or move it to the state court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer, however, noted that the process could take months or years and that 
a swift decision on a preliminary injunction is proper on a voter-approved 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction -- designed in 
this case to block the initiative until its legality is eventually determined 
-- can be appealed to higher courts. Pfaelzer said she would prefer that the 
appellate process, if needed, be started quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 By scheduling a swift preliminary injunction hearing, Pfaelzer will also be 
ruling on whether the initiative, in the form it was approved, should be 
enjoined -- rather than having to factor in regulations prepared by state 
agencies to enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Lungren has indicated that portions of Proposition 187 
are vulnerable to legal challenges. State government agencies, at the direction 
of Wilson, who was a leading proponent of the initiative, would almost 
certainly seek to prepare regulations designed to overcome those legal 
questions, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys fighting the measure said after the hearing that they will 
resist any effort by the attorney general's office to move the case to the 
state court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case raises the most significant federal court issues since Roe vs. 
Wade," said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal director of the ACLU of Southern 
California.

 Capt. Margaret York, the latest Los Angeles Police Department officer to come 
under the O.J. Simpson defense team's scrutiny, never investigated a detective 
whose conduct the Simpson camp has questioned, according to a sworn declaration 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that declaration represented a setback for the defense, Simpson's 
attorneys won a victory late in the day. Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
ruled that prosecutors may not call a defense expert to the stand even though 
that expert is one of the nation's foremost DNA authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In her declaration, York said she does not recall investigating Detective Mark 
Fuhrman or a group of West Los Angeles officers who called themselves MAW, 
short for Men Against Women. York was assigned to West Los Angeles as a watch 
commander in 1985, when Fuhrman was working as a patrol officer and the LAPD's 
Internal Affairs Division was concluding an investigation into the treatment of 
female officers at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not recall that at any time during my assignment at West Los Angeles was 
I given an assignment, instruction or charge of that nature," York wrote, 
confirming what police sources said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although York's declaration sets back the defense team's attempts to have her 
testify about any role she might have played in investigating Fuhrman, 
Simpson's lawyers vowed to press ahead. They are focused on Fuhrman because he 
testified at the preliminary hearing that he was the officer who discovered a 
bloody glove behind Simpson's Brentwood home a few hours after the June 12 
slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although defense attorneys are expected to file a motion next week explaining 
why they want to question York, the captain's declaration suggests that she 
would have little if anything relevant to offer about Fuhrman, whom she said 
she only vaguely remembers as a "productive officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting York on the witness stand is particularly problematic because she is 
married to Ito, who is presiding over the Simpson trial. If she were to testify 
during the Simpson trial, it might force Ito to recuse himself. Because of 
that, Superior Court Judge Curtis Rappe is presiding over the York issue and 
has set a hearing for Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ito and the lawyers are pressing ahead with the process of 
selecting alternates for the Simpson jury and with the array of legal issues 
that have cropped up as the two sides prepare for opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest of those was resolved in the defense's favor after Simpson's 
lawyers successfully fought to keep prosecutors from calling an expert defense 
witness. The witness, Edward Blake, is one of the nation's most respected DNA 
scientists. Prosecutors had hoped to have him testify for them about a form of 
DNA testing known as PCR analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers complained that it was unfair for prosecutors to call a 
defense expert as a government witness. Such a move would violate the 
attorney-client privilege and undermine Simpson's right to effective assistance 
of counsel, they said, in part because Blake has access to information about 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors responded by saying that Blake historically has testified for the 
prosecution in arguing for the admissibility of DNA evidence and by pledging 
that they would limit their questions to areas outside his employment by 
Simpson. Although Ito did not resolve the matter in court, he issued a written 
order granting the defense request. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, there has been no showing that Dr. Blake is a material witness 
whose testimony is essential to one party or the other and is not available 
from any other source," Ito ruled late Tuesday. "It is also critical to note 
that Dr. Blake adamantly opposes being called as a witness by the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling clears the way for Blake to testify on Simpson's behalf, and a 
declaration submitted by Blake hints at the approach that defense attorneys may 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with many substantial criticisms that will be offered by defense 
experts about the methods employed by the laboratories that performed DNA 
testing in this case," said Blake, signaling that although he may not criticize 
the types of DNA tests employed by the prosecution, he may find fault with how 
those tests were performed and the results they produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, only three prospective jurors were questioned in a day halted early 
for the hearing on Blake and for the Thanksgiving recess. 
</P>
<P>
 A 36-year-old Latino from Pico Rivera was cleared for further service after he 
indicated that he knew a great deal about the case but insisted that he could 
judge evidence fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other panelists were excused, one after he said he was versed in the 
science of DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another panelist interviewed said he had followed the Simpson case closely, 
partly by watching tabloid television. From his viewing, that man said he 
learned that police repeatedly had been forced to come to Simpson's home to 
respond to incidents of domestic violence 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responded to a 911 call at Simpson's home in 1989 and found Nicole 
Simpson crying and badly bruised, with a handprint on her neck, police reports 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have been out here eight times before, and now you're going to 
arrest me for this?" Simpson is quoted in one report as saying. "This is a 
family matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson pleaded no contest to charges growing out of that incident, 
his attorneys maintain that he never struck Nicole Simpson. Tuesday, the 
prospective juror appeared to refer to the reported history of beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the police) have been called out there so many times," the man, a 
26-year-old house painter from Santa Monica, said. "I heard 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the prospective juror's description of his relationship with his 
ex-wife, an apparently angry Simpson raised his arms in exasperation, leaned 
back in his chair and rolled his eyes to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you see how upsetting this is to him?" Cochran asked the prospective 
juror, prompting Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark to object. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito responded that he had informally asked Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's other 
lead attorney, "to caution his client." The prospective juror was excused 
because Ito said he had been "exposed to too many things about this case."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY PANEL 
OPTS NOT TO ALTER STEEL-FRAME BUILDING STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite widespread evidence that construction techniques for steel-frame 
buildings proved inadequate during the Northridge earthquake, building owners 
will be allowed to use the same methods to repair the damage, Los Angeles city 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concern about the high cost of inspecting and repairing such buildings, 
a city panel recommended that building owners be allowed to devise their own 
inspection and repair plans using current repair methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials defended the decision, saying that current technology kept 
steel-frame buildings from collapsing. They added that government-funded 
studies of quake damage have yet to provide new repair methods. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, engineers were surprised to hear widespread 
reports of cracks in the joints of steel-frame buildings because such frames 
are designed to bend with the enormous force of an earthquake without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers emphasized that no steel-frame buildings came close to collapsing in 
the quake. However, an 11-story Westside structure was evacuated two weeks ago 
after engineers discovered that its steel frame had been dangerously weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of about 300 steel-frame buildings in the high-damage areas of the 
San Fernando Valley and the Westside will be required to conduct their own 
inspections of steel joints within three months of notification by the city, 
under a recommendation approved by the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on 
Earthquake Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners will be allowed to use current repair methods, pending a 
case-by-case approval by city inspectors. It will be up to each building owner 
to use higher repair standards to increase the strength of steel joints so they 
can withstand future earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Repairs must be completed within two years of the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection charges alone can range from $10,000 to $60,000 a building. But the 
cost can be cut if building owners devise inspection and repair plans tailored 
to their particular structures and the amount of damage suffered, said Richard 
Holguin, assistant chief of the city's building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials previously had suggested a strict set of rules for 
inspecting steel joints and recommended a one-year time limit for owners to 
make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin rejected suggestions that building owners and their engineers might 
take advantage of the liberal guidelines and make only minimal repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A structural engineer who does that would be putting his license on the 
line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Assn., 
representing 1,500 members throughout Los Angeles County, said the proposal 
"made a lot of sense" and echoed Holguin's sentiments that current repair 
methods are adequate. HUGO MARTIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN-AGE BABY-SITTER 
SURRENDERS WITH TODDLERS MISSING SINCE SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age girl who disappeared Sunday with two toddlers she was helping to 
baby-sit called police Tuesday night from a South-Central Los Angeles market to 
surrender, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamicia Lynette McGee, a 16-year-old with the mental capacity of a young child 
and what authorities described as "an admiration for small children," gave 
herself and the children up to police in front of a market in the 5800 block of 
South Hoover Street about 7 p.m., said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ed Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said McGee and the children were waiting in front of the store when a 
squad car pulled up. By nightfall, they had been reunited with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Victor Guzman, commander of the Police Department's Southeast Division 
detective bureau, had said earlier in the day that McGee, "who acts more like a 
10-year-old," was not considered a kidnaping suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't fear that she's hurt the youngsters," Guzman said Tuesday afternoon. 
"She has an admiration for small children, and likes to act the role of the 
mother. She's like a little girl, playing with her dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Guzman said, the teen-ager was assisting a friend who was caring 
for 3-year-old Desiree Denise Nelson and her 19-month-old half brother, Anthony 
Leon Bolden, in an apartment at the Imperial Courts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "At about 8 a.m. Sunday, the 16-year-old walked out with the two little 
children," the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning home to find the children gone, their mother, Nikiasha 
Hampton, issued a tearful plea for their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the teen-ager had a history of running away from her family 
and had been absent from her home for the past month, living with other 
relatives and friends. Officers said that in the past she had convinced others 
that she has children of her own, and may have done so again.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL GIVES 
PRELIMINARY OK TO TIGHTER EXPENSE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New rules to prevent city lawmakers from using their "officeholder account" 
funds to pay for personal meals and travel or to subsidize their reelection 
campaigns won preliminary approval Tuesday from the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The tighter rules were sought by the city Ethics Commission after it had 
identified and documented what it believed were expenditure abuses by several 
lawmakers but found itself powerless to discipline them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officeholder accounts were originally devised as a way for council members to 
raise up to a maximum of $25,000 per year from political contributors and spend 
this money with virtually no restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the $25,000 cap, the money in these accounts has not been governed 
by the city's campaign finance reform rules, enacted in the mid-1980s to 
regulate political fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are often used to supplement a council member's taxpayer-financed 
office budget -- thus enabling him or her to hire additional staff, purchase 
office supplies or attend educational trips. Such uses are widely accepted as 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 9-3 vote, the council agreed to approve the new officeholder rules but 
not until it had lifted some of the restraints recommended by the Ethics 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council took a step in the right direction, but they could have taken a 
bigger step," said city Ethics Commission Executive Director Benjamin Bycel. 
The reforms also were generally applauded by California Common Cause, the 
nonprofit ethics watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the new rules requires a second council vote, expected next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, lawmakers would be required to disclose more about their 
travel and meal-related expenditures from their officeholders accounts. For 
example, the new rules call for lawmakers to disclose the names of all guests 
at meals costing $50 or more that are paid for with officeholder account money. 
</P>
<P>
 For trips costing $100 or more, the lawmakers would be required to identify 
whose travel expenses were being paid with the money and the purpose of the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disclosures, according to Bycel and the five-member Ethics Commission, 
should make it easier to identify and prevent potential abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the commission questioned officeholder expenditures made by 
Councilmen Hal Bernson, Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez and John Ferraro. 
Bernson was questioned about the propriety of officeholder expenditures to pay 
for his membership in a Jewish temple, a trip to Hawaii and his wife's 
membership in a nonprofit women's group. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules also would place a limit of $1,000 on how much money can be 
contributed to the accounts by any individual, and require quarterly reports of 
officeholder account financial activity. At present, no contribution limits 
exist, and officeholder account financial activities are reported only 
semiannually -- except during election season.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH PASADENA; WOMAN 
WINS LEGAL BATTLE TO KEEP CARING FOR SQUIRRELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A squirrel showdown that pitted a South Pasadena woman against state game 
wardens ended Tuesday as officials in Sacramento issued a permit that will 
allow her to continue caring for the bushy-tailed creatures at her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal charges against Paula Drake will be dropped, said Jeff Weir, 
assistant deputy director of the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake will be allowed to keep up to 18 squirrels at her Kolle Avenue home; the 
permit can be modified if more sick or injured animals are sent to her, Weir 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 12 years, Drake has treated about 500 squirrels. She has 
consulted on the treatment of another 4,000 animals, she said. Last week, she 
moved 18 injured squirrels to "safehouses" after officials threatened to 
confiscate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake, who has launched a "Squirrel Legal Defense Fund" to pay off a $2,500 
legal bill caused by the fight, said she is relieved. "I won't have to be 
quivering in my boots all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weir: "We hope Paula Drake and her squirrels live happily ever after."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDENA; 2 CONVICTED OF 
MURDERING MAN AT HIS FRONT DOOR

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Carson gang members face 30 years to life in prison for gunning down a 
Gardena man when he answered his doorbell Nov. 16, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance Superior Court jury convicted Jeremiah Angel DeGuzman, 20, and John 
Paul Madrona, 19, of murder after deliberating for about four hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men shot Tracy Takahashi, 30, in a case of mistaken identity. DeGuzman 
and Madrona thought Takahashi was a rival gang member when he opened the front 
door of his apartment on South Dalton Avenue about 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory D. Jennings said he will seek the maximum prison 
sentence for both men. Sentencing is set for Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week trial was held before Judge John P. Shook. 
</P>

 Attorneys for the defendants could not be reached for comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: AGOURA HILLS; PARKS 
CONSERVANCY REJECTS SETTLEMENT WITH UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choosing combat over compromise, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy early 
Tuesday rejected a tentative settlement with Soka University, vowing to press 
ahead with its lawsuit to seize part of the school's campus for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed more than five hours of angry testimony from homeowners, 
environmentalists and elected officials who blasted the conservancy for even 
considering surrender in its fight to condemn Soka's scenic property to use as 
a park visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejection of the compromise means lawyers for both sides will face off this 
morning in Los Angeles Superior Court to argue over whether the conservancy has 
the right to seize 245 of the school's 662 acres at Las Virgenes Road and 
Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said the decision marks the 
first time the conservancy has exercised its power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said the school will continue to work with the 
community, but will aggressively defend itself against the condemnation 
lawsuit, which has already dragged on for two years.

STATE PROBES FATAL STUNT AT PARAMOUNT; MOVIES: INQUIRY INTO DEATH OF STUNTWOMAN 
IS PROMPTED BY FIRE SAFETY OFFICERS' LAWSUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 A movie stunt that resulted in the death of a Paramount Studios stuntwoman is 
being investigated by the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, a state official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuntwoman Sonya Davis landed on the corner of an air bag after she leaped 
several stories from a building this month. Part of Davis' body hit the 
pavement, leaving her critically injured. She died of her injuries Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was performing the stunt for Paramount's upcoming film, "Vampire in 
Brooklyn," which is being directed by Wes Craven, the writer and director of 
the original "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rice, spokesman for the Department of Industrial Relations, the agency 
that oversees Cal/OSHA, said that the department received notification of the 
accident Nov. 4 and is interviewing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not much can be said at this time because we really aren't at liberty to 
discuss ongoing investigations," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was revealed at a news conference Tuesday announcing a lawsuit 
filed by a group of certified fire safety officers. The officers are trying to 
force the city to overturn a set of new regulations that replaces their 
inspections with random spot checks made by uniformed fire officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of Paramount's filming permit notes "Dummy from building onto parked 
car" as a special effect being performed on the day of the shoot but does not 
list Davis' stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bobenko, senior permit coordinator with the city Film and Video Permit 
Office, said that ideally, movie companies should list all stunts on the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not something we would have been overly concerned with because when 
it comes to the safety of their own crews we assume that they (production 
companies) would be responsible," Bobenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Chavez, deputy state fire marshal in charge of the film division, said 
stunts should be coordinated with whatever government agency has jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it was not specifically spelled out in the permit, no government 
agency was aware of the stunt," Chavez said. "Whether a government agency being 
aware of the stunt would have helped at all, that is difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount declined to comment pending the completion of its investigation of 
the accident.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; CRAWLING THE MALLS 
TO CATCH SHOPLIFTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mean streets of LAPD Officer Ken LeDuc's beat are dotted with neon signs, 
Gap stores and elevators, and snake through food courts and Robinsons-May. 
</P>
<P>
 LeDuc is one of three officers assigned to the West Valley mall detail, which 
is stationed in Topanga Plaza and is also responsible for the Woodland Hills 
Promenade and Fallbrook Mall. While other officers are cruising the dark and 
dangerous districts of Los Angeles, the mall detail battles shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 22 shopping days left until Christmas, that battle is expected to 
escalate, as malls fill up with the annual influx of both shoppers and petty 
crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what some might consider a boring berth, the officers on the mall 
detail say they've seen it all. "I've arrested pimps, prostitutes and a porn 
star," says LeDuc, 39, who's had two two-year tours on the mall detail. "I've 
arrested a CEO of a major entertainment industry company and a firefighter." 
</P>
<P>
 All were nabbed on suspicion of shoplifting, the top mall crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the shoplifters that LeDuc busts are first-time offenders 
lifting petty items -- the CEO, LeDuc says, was stuck in a long line and simply 
walked out rather than wait to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the professionals, who are flown in from training "academies" 
in South America and put up at swank hotels by crime rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're predators, with criminal histories going back to when they're 12 
years old. These people need to be in jail, and I get a lot of satisfaction out 
of putting them there," LeDuc said. On the other hand, he also sees a lot of 
beginners, often children. "I honestly try to get them to see what they've 
done, to take responsibility for what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Malls employ private security forces to keep the peace within their walls and 
inside their parking lots, but LAPD officers in substations like the one in 
Topanga Plaza get involved whenever an actual crime is committed, be it 
shoplifting, domestic violence or carjacking. Suspects are brought to the 
Topanga substation, which sports its own booking facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall detail usually makes 50 to 70 arrests a month, but holiday arrests 
balloon to around 120. Mall security officers are hard-pressed to keep things 
calm amid the influx of shoppers; last year they had to pry apart two 
middle-aged men duking it out over a coveted parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Things become even more challenging for store security trying to catch 
shoplifters and LAPD officers eager to arrest them. Traditionally, LeDuc said, 
on the busiest shopping day of the year -- the Friday after Thanksgiving -- no 
arrests are made. There are simply too many people in the stores to catch any 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional shoplifters, however, rarely do business during the holidays. 
LeDuc said these crooks wait until stores have smaller staffs during the 
off-season. Then they strike, typically lifting $1,500 from a store, and 
hitting around three or four per day. LeDuc remembers one incident in September 
when officers were chasing a squad of professional shoplifters from Topanga 
Plaza. One of the crooks' getaway cars wouldn't start, so they left it behind. 
Inside that sedan, officers found $17,000 worth of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shoplifters, though, don't plan as well or take as much as the 
professionals, LeDuc said, but "everybody tries to get away with something 
sometime." Adult shoplifters, he said, are frequently women, and generally 
steal because they are short of money for something they want, telling 
themselves "I deserve this" as they eye a blouse or pair of pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although shoplifters are usually the only crooks to frequent malls, and 
Topanga Plaza is, according to its security director, statistically the safest 
mall in the city, that doesn't mean it isn't occasionally hit by violent crime. 
Last year a jewelry store was held up at gunpoint. Two years ago a woman was 
shot and killed in a parking lot carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, though, the halls of the Topanga Plaza are a far cry from the 
gritty streets of the central city. Which suits LeDuc fine. He isn't looking 
for a glamorous job in the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's going to save the world," he says. "All I can do is do my part."

'TIS THE SEASON FOR GOLFERS TO BE JOLLY -- UNOFFICIALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a look at the golf calendar and it's pretty clear what day it is. It's 
payday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's that time of year again. You know, when money hits the golf courses 
like leaves dropping off the trees and just lies there, waiting for somebody 
with a rake. Or a nine-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that time between the official end of the old season and the official 
beginning of the new. And a wonderful time it is, all right, steeped, as it is, 
in the great golfing tradition of the rich getting richer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the PGA Tour season ended with the Tour Championship Oct. 30 and 
doesn't begin again until the Mercedes Championship Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 And it used to be that players rested during November and December, getting 
ready for the long grind ahead, starting in January. Now, they can't afford to 
rest. There are big-money exhibition tournaments to be played before the year 
turns. And who cares if the money to be won isn't "official"? It still spends. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Azinger, for instance, is having a busy off-season. He is playing in the 
$540,000 Skins Game this weekend, and the $650,000 Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge 
and the $2.1-million Diner's Club next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is plenty of money to be made this time of year," Azinger said. "You 
can really rack up the dough in the off-season events, so you probably ought to 
play 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, that's sound advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, the leader in the clubhouse, has won so much money in three 
weeks of special events that he needs a financial adviser more than he needs a 
caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago in Hawaii, he won $180,000. Two weeks ago in Puerto Rico, he 
won $250,000. Last weekend in Thousand Oaks, he won $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice a trend here? It pays to play and Couples isn't done yet. He still has 
the Skins Game, the Three-Tour Challenge and the $2.7-million Johnnie Walker 
Championship left on his unofficial earnings schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday was a real busy "unofficial" day, with four special events being 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 At Miyazaki, Japan, Jumbo Ozaki earned $270,000 by winning the $2-million 
Dunlop Phoenix. At Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Couples and Brad 
Faxon split $300,000 for winning the $1.1-million Franklin Funds Shark 
Shootout. At Mexico City, Chris Perry won $100,000 at the Mexican Open. And at 
Pebble Beach, Robert Gamez won $40,000 at the Pebble Beach Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 On one weekend, $3.9 million was up for grabs on the golf course. Next year at 
those tournaments, the players' courtesy cars will be Brink's trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle of millionaires playing for more millions may or may not suit 
you, the television viewer, but the producers of these events sure hope they do 
because that is why they are being played. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there's nothing wrong with golf as television programming or 
players making money, neither idea being exactly new. There is a problem, 
though, with the effect these special events have on the West Coast portion of 
the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more players are turning their backs on a significant portion of the 
tour in January and February, instead beginning their golf seasons in March in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the final leaderboard at last year's $1.2-million Hawaiian Open, won 
by Davis Love III the second week of January. Finishing behind Love were, in 
order, Robin Freeman, Brett Ogle, Morris Hatalsky, Tom Lehman, Lennie Clements, 
Mike Reid, Jay Don Blake, Sean Murphy and Craig Parry. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, most everybody else was resting after making a killing in November 
and December. Couples said he simply can't play everywhere, so he has to 
choose. He chose the lucrative special events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is what I'd rather do," he said at the Shark Shootout. "I'd 
rather play here than a tournament on the West Coast. I still have my favorite 
(West Coast) tournaments, the Bob Hope, L.A., La Costa if you get in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, from Seattle, has been a regular at the Mercedes Championship, the 
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and the Nissan L.A. Open, three of the eight stops on 
the PGA Tour before it goes to Florida March 2-5 for the Doral-Ryder Open. 
Couples indicated he will play those three again in 1995 as part of his 
22-tournament schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, who joins Couples, Payne Stewart and Tom Watson in the Skins Game 
this weekend at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, doesn't think golf is hurting 
itself on the West Coast, despite the increasing number of off-season events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't think so," he said. "There's so much golf on TV that it 
kind of runs into each other a little bit. I think Pebble Beach still holds its 
own on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Riviera always holds its own as the site of the L.A. Open and it should be 
especially inviting to players in 1995 because the PGA Championship will be 
held there Aug. 10-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there's the off-season. There are still more birdies -- and money 
-- to be made. Stewart, who had a miserable year on the tour, can make up for 
it at the Skins Game, even though, he said, playing it is a bit of a sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it very difficult for the guys participating to be able to spend 
Thanksgiving with their families," he said. "I'm talking about their whole 
families. Thanksgiving is a very important family tradition in my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stewart has won $760,000 in the six days of the last three Skins Games. 
</P>
<P>
 And, after all, making money is another important family tradition for 
golfers.

ON THE FAST TRACK; BOZEMAN'S SUCCESS IN RECRUITING, COACHING PLAYERS AT CAL 
ATTRACTS CRITICS WHISPERING QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If being one of college basketball's good old boys is a little like being a 
middle-aged frat guy, then it's a pretty decent bet that Todd Bozeman won't 
ever be tossing down beers with Bobby Knight or trading secret handshakes with 
Dale Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, not long ago, when coaches were refusing to even shake 
Bozeman's hand after a game, dismissing the routine gesture of sportsmanship. 
It started with then-Washington Coach Lynn Nance shortly after Bozeman had been 
named California's interim coach after Lou Campanelli's startling in-season 
firing the season before last.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown elected to do the same when the Golden Bears beat Louisiana State 
in the first round of the 1993 NCAA tournament. Last season, Bozeman and 
Arizona's Lute Olson openly sparred in the glare of national television. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, one could attribute this to being a product of Bozeman's rugged 
initiation into the often-narrow world of college basketball coaching, a 
natural result of the clumsy circumstances surrounding the Campanelli-Bozeman 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems to be more than Mr. Outside merely replacing the consummate 
insider. What happened was that Bozeman immediately lost the interim tag and 
started winning a little too quickly and easily -- games on the court and the 
hearts and minds of America's top recruits.  
</P>
<P>
 For starters, he has built a 33-10 record and is 21-6 in the Pacific 10 
Conference. The Golden Bears reached the final 16 in the NCAA tournament in 
1993, the school's first such appearance since 1960. Last season, California 
finished ranked No. 16 in the Associated Press poll but flinched under the 
pressure of increased expectations, losing to Wisconsin Green Bay in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a five-year contract extension through the 1998-99 season. When it 
expires, Bozeman will be all of 35. When he replaced Campanelli, Bozeman was 
29, which made him the youngest head coach in Division I basketball. In the 
Pac-10, he's the only coach in the conference who was born in the '60s. His 
closest peer -- in terms of age -- is Washington's Bob Bender, who is 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the steady procession of talent that Bozeman has recruited 
-- Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray in seasons past, Alfred Grigsby and Monty 
Buckley in the present, and an incoming recruiting class considered the second 
best in the country by at least one publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Applause outside Northern California has been in short supply, however. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, college basketball is not a feel-good, supportive place. Instead of 
admiration for Bozeman's efforts, the buzz is that Cal must be doing something 
outside NCAA boundaries, especially since the school is short on grand 
tradition and has no high-tech facility to dazzle potential recruits.  
</P>
<P>
 Without evidence, no coach will raise his voice above a whisper. But sneaker 
sage Sonny Vaccaro voiced such suspicions during a recent Southern California 
radio interview, saying that Bozeman recruited on the shady side and raising 
the usual questions about rumors of irregular recruiting. Naturally, word 
filtered back to Bozeman, who happened to be in Los Angeles for the Pac-10 
media day the day Vaccaro was interviewed on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told me about that," Bozeman said. "You have to look at the source. 
When you look at someone making comments, sometimes you have to look at the 
person. If a convicted criminal was making comments, how much weight would his 
comments have? 
</P>
<P>
 "With some people, they might not look at it that way. They'd say, 'Wait a 
minute, where is this coming from?' I know who he is. There's a story behind 
it. A lot of petty jealousy and stuff like that.  
</P>
<P>
 "How does a guy who didn't have a job at one time end up coming up and being a 
sneaker guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is entitled to their own opinions and I'm not about to stand up and 
try to defend myself against everybody. The most important things are my 
family, my players, who are an extension of my family; my friends and my 
employers. Nothing else matters. Nothing else will distract me from what I'm 
trying to do."  
</P>
<P>
 In Bozeman's view, one has to start somewhere. As an assistant at Tulane, his 
vigorous recruiting helped bring the Green Wave program back from the dead, 
almost literally, as it had been disbanded for four years in the aftermath of a 
point-shaving scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to that, injecting life into Cal's program was a layup, particularly 
with the likes of the now departed Kidd and Murray. Hoop dreams are made of 
this. Bozeman doesn't mind when people ask: Why Cal? His answer is: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask me, 'How did Cal come from nowhere?' I say I've seen programs 
grow and I have seen people have that vision when no one else has had it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley, a 6-6 senior guard from Sacramento who averaged 12.8 points last 
season, wonders why there are questions about the program's evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, (Bozeman) is a young guy coming in and doing well," Buckley 
said. "They don't question why other coaches get players. Every program has to 
start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley, who was benched for an exhibition on Saturday for disciplinary 
reasons, says he doesn't think Bozeman is cocky, but he's confident "in a good 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bozeman, "I've never said anything about any other coach. I've never 
criticized a coach and I won't. I won't criticize a program. I never get into 
that. A lot of times people dislike things they wish they had and that's the 
way I rationalize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Anwar McQueen frowned when asked why the college basketball 
fraternity considers Bozeman to be cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's false, negative and almost a rude perception of things," McQueen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the first time Bozeman called McQueen at his home in Washington, 
D.C., during the recruiting process, they spoke very little about Bozeman and 
the basketball program at Cal. McQueen said they talked for about three hours 
and spent 20 minutes discussing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened up," McQueen said. "My whole senior year in high school was very 
frustrating. With other coaches, it was brief. Cut and dried. It was funny. 
Talking to him was like talking to one of the homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman is a young 30 and an old 30 at the same time. A father of two, he met 
his wife, TeLethea, at a high school sock hop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sock hop sounds like the '50s, doesn't it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he listens to jazz and rap and understands when his players start talking 
about music. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a framed picture of Malcolm X on his office wall and a book about 
Spike Lee's films atop a shelf. If nothing else, Bozeman is trying to teach his 
players about the outside world and has brought in a variety of speakers, among 
them a district attorney, a woman who is HIV positive, a nutritionist and a 
television producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been there before," Buckley said. "He already knows what we're going 
through because he's done it already." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the most significant people in his life, Bozeman does not hesitate 
and speaks about his parents, Ira and Martha, who both worked multiple jobs 
when Todd was growing up in Washington so they could send him and his brothers 
to a private school.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's why working hard is not foreign to me," he said. "Being in this 
business, I want to try to be the best. But I take from a lot of different 
coaches. There are coaches I owe a lot to. People like John Thompson, George 
Raveling, Nolan Richardson, Coach (John) Chaney. Their success predated me. Had 
they not had success, I might not have got an opportunity to even coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozeman doesn't care much what the outside world thinks about him. Hey, it 
just gets in the way of the task at hand. The results are the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always easy when you are on the outside looking in," Bozeman said. "I 
say everybody has a different way. There's always a lot of factors involved; 
unless you are there you don't know. There's no right way or perfect way."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; PEPPERDINE WAS JUST FINE, BUT TOM ASBURY 
DECIDES . . . ; HE'LL TAKE MANHATTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his old office at Pepperdine, Tom Asbury could look out the sliding glass 
doors and see the Pacific Ocean's waves lapping at the beach at Malibu. Now, on 
a raw, rain-bitten day outside his new digs at Kansas State, he can see his 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to winter. And welcome to the Big Eight Conference, where newcomer 
Asbury already has ticked off archrival Kansas by describing revered Allen 
Fieldhouse, basketball cathedral of the Jayhawks, as "an old dump." 
</P>
<P>
 "The K-State people thought that was great," says Asbury, who scored serious 
brownie points by sticking it to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he said the same thing a few years ago about Gonzaga's Martin Centre, 
nobody would have noticed. And even if someone had, nobody would have cared. 
That's how it was -- and still is -- in Asbury's old league. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is different. Asbury is different. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving around campus in his dealer-loaned BMW, Asbury can't quit gushing 
about all the wonderful things at Kansas State. So proud is Asbury of the 
place, that you half expect him to hand out cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, I'll give you the Cook's tour," he says, after pulling into his 
private space at Bramlage Coliseum, a mostly cozy 13,500-seat facility that is 
more than four times the size of Firestone Fieldhouse back at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "See our bench?" he says. "I had it moved to the student side. Caused a big 
stir, but the students love it." 
</P>
<P>
 No dummy, Asbury also had the visiting team's bench moved a few feet from 
K-State's students, legendary for standing the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I did it," he says, smiling, perhaps at the thought of some 
Russian lit major from Topeka yelling farm vulgarities at, say, Coach Eddie 
Sutton and the rest of the visiting Oklahoma State team. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury, wearing sweatpants and a Kansas State sweatshirt, sticks his head 
inside the Wildcat locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gonna get it redone and put the new logo on the wall," says Asbury, who also 
redesigned the Wildcats' road uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the stairs he goes, into the ritzy lounge overlooking the football field. 
"Nice, huh?" he says. "You can bring folks up here before the game and relax. 
And look at this. I think I've got the only key to this room." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury opens an unmarked door just outside the lounge. Inside is a smaller, 
more private room with a view, complete with all sorts of electronic components 
for watching the game. This is for the recruits' visits. And although it isn't 
Malibu, it will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour director Tom then drives back toward the middle of campus, to ancient 
Ahearn Field House, where the basketball offices are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gonna spend about $100,000 to fix up everything in here," he says. "New 
furniture, carpet, flooring." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing. The guy is effervescent. Then again, this isn't the same Tom Asbury 
of a year ago. This is the newly inspired Tom Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years at Pepperdine -- nine as an assistant, six as a head coach -- 
Asbury found himself in a groove as deep as a ditch. He averaged nearly 21 
victories in those six seasons, took the Waves to the NCAA tournament three 
times, the NIT twice and generally ruled the West Coast Conference. Plus, there 
are worse fates than taking Pacific Coast Highway to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kansas State squeezed out the decent, but dreadfully dull Dana Altman. As 
that was going on, Iowa State was trying to find a nice way to ask Johnny Orr 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that went unnoticed by Asbury, who had long since realized that 
Pepperdine's drop-dead vistas didn't mean much to the nation's best recruits. 
If scenery were so important, Syracuse wouldn't get one signed letter of 
intent. In fact, Asbury had concluded that the picture-postcard stuff didn't 
mean that much to him, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had stopped looking at the beauty," Asbury said. "We stopped looking at 
the view, at the beauty of Malibu. We never went to the beach. Anyway, I needed 
a bigger challenge and I wanted a better league. I just needed a change." 
</P>
<P>
 And then fate and a friend stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State Athletic Director Max Urick first approached UCLA's Jim Harrick 
about the Wildcat opening. Harrick wasn't interested, but he knew Asbury would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 So Urick contacted Asbury, who also was keeping an eye on the Iowa State 
situation. They met at the Final Four in Charlotte, after Asbury had dined with 
Lon Kruger, the former Kansas State star guard and coach who left Manhattan to 
rebuild Florida's program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger, sort of the Richie Cunningham of coaches, didn't say a word about the 
remoteness of Kansas State -- it's a two-hour drive from Kansas City -- or 
living in the constant shadow of the Jayhawks. The way Kruger figured it, they 
weren't going to move the campus and KU certainly wasn't going to relocate out 
of state, so why bother with the negatives? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there was talk of Kansas State's own rich basketball tradition, of 21 
NCAA appearances -- but only one in the round of eight in the last 17 years -- 
of the fans' passion for the program, of the facilities, of the commitment made 
by the school administration. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a nice chat, but Asbury still wasn't convinced. Take a drive on 
Interstate 70 and you'll know why. 
</P>
<P>
 There on I-70, as you pass the Lawrence exit, the sign reads: 
</P>
<P>
 University of Kansas  
</P>
<P>
 1988 NCAA National Champions  
</P>
<P>
 Home of Dr. James Naismith  
</P>
<P>
 Inventor of basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Pass the Manhattan exit and it says: 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State University  
</P>
<P>
 1991 National Debate Champions  
</P>
<P>
 1993 National Debate Champions  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I saw them," Asbury said. "But not until after I had taken the job." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Urick flew him in and out of Manhattan for the interviews. Not 
that it mattered. Urick said he could sense that Asbury was ready to make a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know Tom had reached the point where he thought, 'Maybe I ought to open 
my mind up a little bit and look for a change,' " Urick said. "And the timing 
was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was perfect, but not for the supposed obvious reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought it was because of the personal tragedy we had," 
Asbury said. "That wasn't the case. It was just time for a change. It probably 
had been time for a change prior to that. There were other years when there was 
nothing available and other years where we figured we couldn't move because of 
Stacey's illness." 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey, the older of Asbury's two daughters, died Sept. 12, 1993. She was 22 
and had long battled anorexia nervosa, an acute eating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in what has to be considered one of his finest seasons as a coach, 
Asbury led the Waves to a WCC tournament championship, received an NCAA bid and 
nearly upset Michigan in the first round. But if it was his proudest season, it 
was also his most trying and emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years in one place is too long," he said. "We were fortunate to get 
out of there, to be able to have maintained a level of success where we hadn't 
started on a downhill slide. When you look back at what you were able to do 
there, you think, 'Geez, is this ever going to be able to be done again . . . 
under any sort of conditions?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Asbury accepted Urick's five-year deal. He thought about waiting out the 
Iowa State situation, but then decided Kansas State had more to offer. And 
nothing against Altman, he said, but following the legendary Orr at Iowa State 
would have been difficult, especially when the three senior starters graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Asbury is in for his own long season. The Wildcats lost four 
seniors, including their top scorer (Askia Jones), top defender (Deryl 
Cunningham) and team leader (Anthony Beane). They have no inside game, no 
proven perimeter game and no chance in the Big Eight. Alabama breezed by them 
last week in the first round of the Preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a good year for us play in the NIT," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. His lineup at times is intramural-league small: 5 feet 10, 6-3, 
6-4, 6-7 and 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me nervous to be looking down on what appears to be my two starting 
forwards," said the 6-6 Asbury, who added that this year's Pepperdine team 
could beat his Kansas State team.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's a scary thought," he said. "But if they had great players here, there 
wouldn't be an opening." 
</P>
<P>
 There also wouldn't be the view. From Asbury's new office he can see it 
clearly. There it is: a fresh start.

GONE, WISCONSIN?; BADGERS MIGHT BE SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE IF COACH STAYED AND 
STAR PLAYERS LEFT FOR NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rumors of impending departures hit the Wisconsin campus last spring and 
immediately began multiplying. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Stu Jackson, the former New York Knick coach who had brightened the 
school's dismal modern basketball history by taking the Badgers to the NCAA 
tournament for the first time since 1947, was leaving, people felt sure. For 
Iowa State, for the San Antonio Spurs, for the Portland Trail Blazers . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Finley, the sleek forward seldom seen on national TV but already 
pegged as a first-round draft pick by NBA scouts, would surely give up his 
senior year to play for pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashard Griffith, the 6-foot-11 freshman with an NBA body and an overdose of 
the adulation that surrounds Chicago high school hoop stars, was unhappy and 
turning pro at 19. Or transferring. All because he didn't think he had been 
given the ball enough as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wisconsin's own sports publication, Badger Plus, wondered if the fight 
song "On Wisconsin" should be replaced by the Clash's "Should I Stay or Should 
I Go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing, Finley didn't go anywhere, letting the exodus of Big Ten 
undergraduates -- Glenn Robinson, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose -- proceed without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith came back too, after getting some comforting and a dose of reality. 
He probably will be a fine pro one day, but he isn't ready yet. With those two 
back, the Badgers are ranked 15th and have a shot at the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just turned down a position that would offer me twice -- twice! -- as 
much money as I'm presently making," he told a reporter after Iowa State had 
courted him last spring. "To say I'm leaving any time soon is a misnomer." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was soon to be a fact. After counseling Finley and Griffith to 
stay in school, Jackson took a job as general manager and vice president of 
Vancouver's NBA expansion franchise in July. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a move that met with howling charges of disloyalty by fans who had been 
waiting for Jackson to jilt them almost from the day he arrived. "How could you 
do this to us?" demanded one outraged fan in a phone call to Jackson. Many of 
the players understood, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been mad if he was leaving to go coach another college," said 
Griffith, who patched up his relationship with Jackson while playing for him in 
the U.S. Olympic Festival last summer. "I wasn't mad he was going to be general 
manager and vice president in Vancouver. That's a career move. I couldn't be 
mad at him for bettering his position in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, one day I'm going to leave for the NBA. It might be next year, it 
might be the year after, it might be my senior year. I'm going to leave. That's 
a career goal for me. That's me making myself better financially, improving my 
life. I look at it from that perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson: "Griffith and Mike understood why I was leaving. They were 
mature in the way they handled it, and the players handled it a lot better than 
some other people did." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Jackson was the one Wisconsin basketball could most afford to 
lose. Sure, in two years he took a program with only three winning seasons 
since 1950 -- though the Badgers won the NCAA title in 1941 -- and put it on 
the right track. Who else but Jackson, with his NBA aura, could have led 
recruits into decrepit Wisconsin Fieldhouse, an old barn decorated with NCAA 
boxing banners from the 1940s and 50s, gaze up toward bleacher seats with gaps 
large enough for a child to slip through, and say, reverently, "Reminds you of 
Chicago Stadium, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson insisted that the basketball offices be renovated to look big-time, 
and he landed Griffith, one of the top couple of big men in his recruiting 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Finley -- who by staying has risen to a potential lottery pick next 
June -- or Griffith had left, the team probably would have fallen back into its 
accustomed spot in the lower reaches of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Jackson, the team simply turned to Stan Van Gundy, a bright, 
little-known 35-year-old assistant with coaching in his blood. His brother, 
Jeff, is a Knick assistant, and his father, Bill, is a junior college coach in 
New York State. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing and turmoil helped Van Gundy land a plum job that might otherwise 
have gone to a more veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody deserves a job like this," Van Gundy said. "If you say that, it's a 
very arrogant thing to say, because I know there's a couple hundred guys out 
there, some of them high school coaches, some of them small-college coaches and 
whatever have you, as qualified as I am. And that's not trying to be humble, 
because I think at the same time, as you're coming up in the profession, you're 
looking at the people above you and saying, 'Geez, I could do as good a job as 
that guy.' And it's true, it goes both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, Jackson left a torched reputation, thanks to his decision to leave 
and the Griffith saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith -- who averaged 13.9 points and 8.5 rebounds as a freshman and had 22 
points and 15 rebounds in a first-round NCAA tournament victory over Cincinnati 
-- blindsided Jackson and his teammates when he told a Chicago reporter while 
he was home for spring break that he was leaving Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big surprise, for the mere fact that I didn't know he was as unhappy 
as he was saying he was," Finley said. "It kind of hurt me. It seemed to come 
out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson went into crisis mode, but it wasn't until nearly two months later 
that Griffith announced that he would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "People got the impression Stu was catering to Rashard and the whole thing, so 
he took a beating," Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for what he did. Rather than get caught up in the 
public-relations image part, he did what was right. If (Griffith) didn't come 
back, Stu would have looked great for a couple of weeks in the paper with his 
principles and his image and the writers would have loved it. But the bottom 
line is, it wouldn't have been better for our program or for Rashard, and I 
think Stu understood that and did what was right instead of what was good for 
his image. I think it worked out best for everybody except Stu." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith's reputation suffered too, and some people expect him to be booed on 
his home court this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are going to look down on Rashard because of what went on in 
the spring," Finley said. "People don't want to give him a chance, but I say, 
knowing Rashard off the court, give him a chance. Don't just jump down his 
throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith's frustration apparently grew once he was back around the entourage 
of advisers, brokers, would-be agents and hangers-on who surround a player who 
can brag he had "my choice of five high schools" as an eighth grader before 
choosing Chicago's Martin Luther King. The implication Griffith resents most is 
that all his decisions are made by his mother, Elaine, who reportedly clashed 
with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we had a misunderstanding, a miscommunication," Griffith says of his 
relationship with Jackson. "I told him a couple of times I wasn't getting the 
ball and he addressed it, but it would go right back to that. That was kind of 
frustrating for me. The kind of player I am, I want to see the ball. I might 
not shoot every time. I'm not selfish, that's not me. I'm not going to force it 
up, that's not how the game is played, that's not how championships are won. 
</P>
<P>
 "My thinking was, I feel I can score, I can rebound, I can block shots, I can 
play defense, I can do all that. Just don't have me out there, limiting me, 
just playing and defensive rebounding. I can score 20 points, I can grab 13, 
14, 15 rebounds, I can block five or six shots a night. Just let me play. Just 
don't stop me from playing my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gundy and Finley, and even Jackson, defend Griffith, saying he's a likable 
person, even an unselfish player, who got some bad advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very simple," Jackson said. "He's a 19-year-old man that is influenced, 
like most 19-year-olds, by outside influences. When faced by that, he almost 
made some decisions regarding his future that might not have been very mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, eager to take Wisconsin beyond the second round of the NCAA tournament 
before he leaves for the NBA, knows what one of the keys will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said, "we've got to keep the big boy happy this year."

NHL TRIES NEW APPROACH WITH UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL owners, realizing there will be no agreement with players and no season -- 
if they insist on imposing a payroll tax, are softening their stance and are 
suggesting alternatives, such as taxes on free-agent signings and rookie 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ideas were believed to have been presented to union chief Bob Goodenow 
on Tuesday at the end of a five-hour session in Boston.The next meeting is 
scheduled Friday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could move forward, or there's a good chance it could get derailed," a 
management source said. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins, a pessimist throughout the 
process, said Tuesday, "There is hope." 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources on both sides said no issue has been agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a deal being done in a day's time," Goodenow said. "There's an 
awful lot of work yet to be done for there to be an agreement, and there are 
some real sticking points." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman will update the league's Board of Governors today in 
a conference call.

YOUNG GUNS; STATE-SPONSORED PHEASANT HUNT AIMS TO ATTRACT THE HUNTERS OF 
TOMORROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joshua Rose took to the field dressed in a bright orange vest and matching 
cap, worn backward of course. Rose is 9.  
</P>
<P>
 Not 4 feet tall but carrying a shotgun big enough to blow a full-grown man off 
his feet, the youngster from Moreno Valley moved through the brush as 
cautiously as if he were stalking lions, not birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very serious about this," said his mother, Theresa, watching from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently so. When a dog flushed a pheasant, Rose performed with the 
precision of a veteran hunter, swinging to his right and leading the bird just 
enough before squeezing the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the blast rang through the hills, but the bird made it 50 yards 
more before falling to the ground, apparently only a single pellet in its 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Without changing expression, Rose followed the dog to the bird, grabbed his 
prize by the feet and lugged it back to camp, in this case on a dirt road 
within the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, a 5,000-acre state-run facility east of 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose dropped the bird at his father's feet then became a child again, running 
to play in the dirt with his younger brothers, Michael and Dylan.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was one of 65 hunters 16 or younger who visited San Jacinto Wildlife Area 
recently to participate in the state-sponsored junior pheasant hunt program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to attract potential hunters at an early age during a 
time when dwindling numbers of young people seem to be engaging in the sport. 
Since hunters generate much of the revenue that helps California manage 
wildlife, and because hunters are responsible for much of the habitat 
restoration and conservation projects that have benefited wildlife over the 
years, a shrinking pool of hunters is the last thing the state wants. 
</P>
<P>
 And this sort of recruiting technique seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of years, we only had about 15 kids," said Tom Paulek, 
manager at San Jacinto. "Now we've got all we can handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the program, sponsored by the California Department of Fish and 
Game, has expanded in seven years to accommodate more than 2,000 young hunters 
at 29 state wildlife areas and private hunting clubs. Only those picked in a 
drawing can participate, so many more are turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, refuse to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Jacinto headquarters on the morning of the recent hunt, a dozen or so 
young hopefuls, their fathers waiting in the wings, stood around like groupies 
at a rock concert, hoping to find a way in. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Cowan, 10, was so intent on adding pheasant to the list of birds he 
has hunted -- he shot seven doves on opening day in September -- that he 
hounded the wildlife area's Tom Trakes until Trakes finally told him, minutes 
before the hunt, that there were 10 no-shows and, therefore, 10 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, cool," Cowan replied, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Mike, who like most of the others has a hunting background, was 
equally pleased. It was a graduation of sorts for his son, who left his .410 
shotgun at home in favor of dad's larger single-shot 20-gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to use a big-guy gun," Mike Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staring into an army of children clad in camouflage pants and shirts, wearing 
blaze orange vests and caps and carrying shotguns of various power, Gary Burke 
gave a sort of pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people, the (dog) handlers, myself and the other gentlemen out there -- 
we don't want to get shot," said Burke, one of a few dozen volunteers from the 
sportsmen's group, Quail Unlimited, that has been instrumental in the success 
of the program. "We don't want our dogs shot and we don't want any spectators 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 To the young shooters, he added: "If we say no, that means do not shoot that 
bird because the bird is flying in an unsafe manner: too low, it has a dog on 
it or it is flying toward somebody. You need to back off and let that bird go. 
We want a nice, clean harvest here -- then everyone will have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the DFG's Paulek, Trakes and Lupe Zamora started the trucks and the 
caravan began across the reserve and into the fields, beneath the rocky ridge 
known as the Bernasconi Hills, which separates San Jacinto from Lake Perris 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The pheasants, bought from a game breeder, had been planted in the brush to 
give the dogs and young hunters a chance to find the birds quickly, both to 
keep their interest and to make sure that all 65 youngsters got a chance to 
shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters, accompanied by a volunteer and a dog, took to the field two at a 
time, with one acting as the primary shooter and the other as a backup.  
</P>
<P>
 Most found their birds within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Slaney found his before his dog did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost stepped on it," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bird flew, and Slaney hit it from a fair distance. It continued to fly 
about 200 yards before falling to the ground. The dog, a German shorthair, ran 
it down and came bounding back to the young hunter, the bird hanging from its 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun hunting with the dogs -- you saw how far he went to get that one," 
Slaney said. "I hunt, so it's just a lot of fun. I like hunting birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Derick Schlarb, 11, of Riverside, stumbled upon a pheasant that refused to 
fly, choosing instead to run, as if it knew what would happen when it took to 
the air.  
</P>
<P>
 Not sure what to do, Schlarb took aim and shot the bird as it sprinted across 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, 10-year-old Sean Driscol was preparing for his first pheasant hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the others, he was not without experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start my boys early," said his father, Steve, a life sponsor of Quail 
Unlimited. "I take them out when they're 5, and the first two years I have them 
pick up shells and just stick around with us. At 6 or 7 I start letting them 
carry a BB gun. And by 9 years old, I start letting them carry a .410 
(shotgun)." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Johnson, 16, of Riverside, was here for the third consecutive year. He 
bagged his limit of two pheasants on both previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the chase," he said. "It's a lot of fun, you know, when the pheasant 
jumps up there." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Charles, had other reasons for bringing him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get to learn how to hunt with dogs," he said. "They have to use more of 
their common sense and their safety skills when they hunt with dogs, because, 
of course, you don't want to shoot the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches them that, and it teaches them to be alert, to respect the 
wildlife and proper handling skills. . . . You know, you can do classroom 
teaching of safety, but out here it's the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Rose was in the field with Sarah Martin, a 12-year-old from Oceanside 
who drew the No. 1 slot, and they behaved like veteran hunters when a bird was 
flushed from the bushes and flew to their right, where an observer had 
unwittingly wandered. 
</P>
<P>
 As they swung their guns, they caught a glimpse of the man and resisted the 
temptation to shoot, even though their guns were aimed well above the man's 
head. They missed the bird but passed a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is not so much that the kids put a bird in the bag, but that 
they learn the lesson they just learned, which is you're going to have to let 
birds go if it's not safe," said Bob Collins, of Quail Unlimited's Riverside 
chapter. "We don't want to make game hogs out of them. All we want to make is 
safe hunters." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys will be boys, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Given, 15, of Joshua Tree, aimed at a pheasant when it suddenly turned 
in flight and flew right at him. He shot it from about 10 feet away, sending a 
cloud of feathers across the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The other children howled with laughter. A red-faced Given seemed to enjoy the 
attention, though. "Well, there isn't much left -- but that was fun," he said.

WEST COAST CONFERENCE / THE OTHER TEAMS; IN A RACE THIS CLOSE, COACHES WILL 
TAKE ANY EDGE THEY CAN GET 
</P>

 Coach Jim Brovelli and the San Francisco basketball team were blessed by Pope 
John Paul II during a tour of Italy last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not guarantee the Dons their first West Coast Conference 
championship since 1981 but it's at least enough to include them among the 
favorites in a conference that "is taking parity to almost comical heights," 
according to one preseason college basketball publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Gonzaga and Pepperdine, hard hit by graduation after winning the WCC's 
regular-season and conference tournament championships last season, have not 
been mentioned as title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody is saying they won't have an impact on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzaga has won 27 consecutive home games, the nation's third-longest streak, 
and Pepperdine has finished below .500 only once since the 1977-78 season, 
having won eight WCC titles in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you asked eight of us (WCC coaches) to pick who we thought would win the 
championship, you might get eight different answers," said Dan Fitzgerald, who 
begins his 13th season at Gonzaga. "There's no clear-cut favorite. If you're at 
Santa Anita, it's a race you stay away from." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the teams, other than Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, in 
order of last season's finish: GONZAGA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 22-8 overall, 12-2 WCC 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs have only one starter back from their first WCC championship 
team. Guard John Rillie averaged 12.3 points a game, making a school-record 91 
of 200 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our physical ability isn't too bad," said Fitzgerald, whose team hasn't lost 
at home since 1992. "But we're so incredibly inexperienced." SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 17-11, 8-6 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons will build their team around All-WCC guard Gerald Walker, who is said 
to be fully recovered from a broken leg he suffered during the conference 
tournament last March, and Art Wallace, a 6-foot-10 center who led the 
conference in blocked shots last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little deeper than we've been in the past, and we're a little bit 
bigger," said Brovelli, whose team is 1-1 after beating New Mexico and losing 
to Memphis last week in the Preseason NIT. "So, we'll see what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Dons falter? 
</P>
<P>
 "Every loss this year goes to the Pope," Brovelli said. "I've already told our 
alums, 'It's on him, not me.' " SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 18-11, 7-7 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreros led the conference in three-point baskets last season but had 
their NCAA tournament hopes dashed when a three-point shot clanked off the rim 
in the final seconds of a 56-53 loss to Pepperdine in the WCC tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Doug Harris, an All-WCC pick as a sophomore, is the Toreros' only 
senior. CoachBrad Holland -- on the job only two months since taking over from 
Hank Egan, who took ajob with the San Antonio Spurs -- has eight freshmen and 
sophomores among his 12 scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transition has gone very well," said Holland, who was 23-31 in two 
seasons at Cal State Fullerton. "It's been difficult at times, but I think 
we're beyond that transitional period and ready to go." PORTLAND 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 13-17, 6-8 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots welcome back the strongest nucleus in the conference -- All-WCC 
forward Canaan Chatman averaged 16.4 points and 8.1 rebounds, 6-10 center Chris 
Ranta averaged 14 points and guard Ray Ross averaged 12.1 points -- but they 
have not finished above .500 since the 1981-82 season, never placing higher 
than fourth in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Said new Coach Rob Chavez, who was 28-27 in two seasons at Maryland Eastern 
Shore: "Regardless of talent or ability, we've got a lot of work to do to 
develop the type of mental preparation it takes to be successful." SANTA CLARA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 13-14, 6-8 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos have a winning tradition dating to the 1950s and a potential star 
in guard Steve Nash, a starter for the Canadian national team who has moved to 
the point this season. Brendan Graves, a 6-10 transfer from California, 
continues to be slowed by a knee injury that required surgery last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not where we'd like him to be yet," Coach Dick Davey said. "He's a big 
factor, I think, in whether or not we'll have any success at all." ST. MARY'S 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 13-14, 5-9 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaels have 11 lettermen back from last season and won the R.L. Jones Cup 
tournament in Taiwan last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ernie Kent, in his third season, is counting heavily on All-WCC guard 
Chris Johnson and forward A.J. Rollins, co-MVPs in the Jones Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time since I've been here that we feel like we're right 
there with everybody else in the conference," Kent said. "I think we're ready 
to turn the corner this season."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; LOYOLA MARYMOUNT; OLIVE SAYS SEASON WON'T 
BE THE PITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In his first two seasons at Loyola Marymount, even as the Lions endured a 
19-game losing streak, routinely suffered double-digit losses and twice 
finished last in the West Coast Conference, Coach John Olive remained 
optimistic, talking of brighter days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive, 13-41 as a head coach, is still bullish about the Lions' future, but 
this season he is also excited about the present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a chance to be a very successful team," he said. "Physically, we're 
as gifted as any team in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Four starters are back from last season, when the Lions' 6-21 record included 
victories over Gonzaga, the WCC's regular-season champion, and Pepperdine, 
winner of the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among the returnees is Wyking Jones, a 6-foot-7 senior forward who 
averaged 19.7 points and eight rebounds, made 57.4% of his shots and was voted 
to the all-conference team last season after finishing among the top four in 
the WCC in scoring, rebounding and shooting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyking Jones is going to be one of the top players in the league," said San 
Francisco Coach Jim Brovelli, who watched Jones score a season-high 39 points 
against the Dons last January. "We couldn't handle him at all, and I don't 
think many other teams could handle him." 
</P>
<P>
 The other returning starters are 6-5 senior swingman Robin Kirksey, who was 
the Lions' No. 2 scorer with a 10.3 scoring average; 6-9 junior center Ime 
Oduok, who ranked fourth in the conference with an average of 7.5 rebounds, and 
5-10 sophomore point guard Jim Williamson, who last season became Loyola's 
first WCC freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth starter will be 6-5 sophomore Mike O'Quinn, who averaged 7.8 points 
and 4.1 rebounds in nine games last season before he was ruled academically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 John Anthony, a 6-7 sophomore who made 43.6% of his three-point shots last 
season, is the top reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to contribute are Cobi McElroy, a 6-2 senior guard who averaged 
6.4 points last season, and Kenny Hotopp, a 6-10, 215-pound redshirt freshman 
center who grew about 1 1/2 inches and added about 20 pounds while sitting out 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a group that Olive is eager to show off to Loyola alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's announcement that freshmen Terryl Woolery and Will Jones have been 
suspended for the season because of a "violation of the university's Student 
Conduct Code" has only slightly dampened Olive's enthusiasm. As part of their 
punishment, sources said, Woolery and Jones will forfeit a season of 
eligibility if they remain at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, I'm one to play probably eight players in a game, so everything 
should be fine," said Olive, who has nine scholarship players available. "But 
it leaves us a little thin if anything should happen -- injuries or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having the ability to absorb injuries -- that's a little scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we really feel like we have a complete basketball team," 
said Olive, whose teams have won only six of 22 conference games. "We have all 
the components. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's a lot more that goes into winning championships than 
physical talent. It's all the other things that are going to make the 
difference. Are we mature enough, mentally tough enough, to handle what it 
takes to be a conference champion?" 
</P>
<P>
 If they expect to challenge for the WCC title, the Lions will have to play 
better defense and take better care of the ball than they did last season, when 
they gave up a WCC-high 90 points a game and led the conference with an average 
of almost 22 turnovers. Loyola Facts and Figures

BADGERS' FINLEY RISES TO TOP OF CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put Wisconsin's Michael Finley on a team with the best college basketball 
players in the country, and Finley stands out every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he played on the Goodwill Games team, coached by George Raveling, 
with Scotty Thurman and Corey Beck of Arkansas, Alan Henderson of Indiana, 
Cherokee Parks of Duke, Shawn Respert of Michigan State and Damon Stoudamire of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading scorer? Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer before, Finley played on the World University Games gold-medal 
team. Once again, he was the U.S. team's leading scorer, and USA Basketball 
named him its male athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Finley -- a versatile 6-foot-7 forward and potential NBA lottery 
pick -- is far better known by NBA scouts than college basketball fans is that 
only three of Wisconsin's regular season games were on national television last 
season, and he has played in only two NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he had three 30-point games last season, among them a 36-point effort 
in a loss to Missouri in a second-round NCAA game. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley wasn't the star at Chicago's Proviso East High School's Class AA state 
champions. Donnie Boyce, now of Colorado, was. Finley signed early with 
Wisconsin, then coached by Steve Yoder. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Raveling and Dick Vitale consider Finley one of the 
country's best-kept secrets, though word has spread enough that he's a 
preseason first-team All-American and on some short lists for player of the 
year. Still, even after Finley averaged 20.4 points and 6.7 rebounds as a 
junior for an 18-11 Wisconsin team, his hometown Chicago Tribune confused him 
in its preseason coverage with teammate Rashard Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 His NBA stock -- already high -- will be enhanced by his reputation with the 
many coaches he has played for, from Stu Jackson and Raveling to Jim Harrick 
and UC Irvine's Rod Baker, who were assistant coaches on the World University 
Games team. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ability is only matched by his character," Jackson said. "He's a 
tremendous young man who does not need the game of basketball. He's only going 
to get better because he's very goal-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Coach Stan Van Gundy says "there may be guys in a single game who 
are capable of putting up bigger numbers or really exploding. But when you look 
over the course of 30 games, 29 games, whatever, he'll get more done than 
almost anybody in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do so many things besides score. He can rebound, he can defend, he can 
pass the ball, he's got great leadership ability. I mean he's a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the people of Wisconsin pay attention this year because he's not going 
to be here for many more games and there aren't going to be many guys like him 
come through."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: HOME CROWD GIVES TITAN SOCCER TEAM 
LIFT 
</P>

<P>
 A year ago, Cal State Fullerton battled its way to the final four of NCAA 
soccer tournament the hard way, winning three consecutive road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Al Mistri is happy he can look forward to his team's second playoff game 
at home this time. The Titans (13-6-2) will meet San Francisco (10-6-4) at 1 
p.m. Sunday at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest thing in our favor right now," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri felt the home crowd gave his team a lift in Saturday night's 3-1 
overtime victory over San Diego. "Our team was really pretty down at the end of 
regulation play, but being at home helped us come back in the overtime," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 2,787 at Fullerton was the largest of the three NCAA playoff 
games played on the West Coast. The San Francisco-Fresno State crowd Sunday was 
2,493. UCLA's game at home against Alabama Birmingham attracted fewer than 
1,000. In comparison, top-ranked Indiana drew 4,496 for its game in Bloomington 
against Notre Dame. That was the biggest crowd of the 16 first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our standpoint, we were fortunate that San Francisco beat Fresno State 
because I have no doubt that the NCAA would have given Fresno the game because 
of their stadium," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri says the two home playoff games could go a long way to show that soccer 
has a following on the Fullerton campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "For soccer to prosper at Fullerton, we need to show that it's a viable thing 
and has the support to pay for itself," he said. "Saturday's game went a long 
way to show that." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's game brought in about $14,000, but the NCAA takes 75% of the 
receipts, leaving the host school 25% after expenses. Although the financial 
report is not complete, Fullerton should show a small profit on Saturday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri said he is hoping for an even bigger turnout among students for 
Sunday's game. "Our students are from a generation that has had some exposure 
to soccer, so it's a game that they have some identification with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri expects the Titans to face a strong challenge from San Francisco, even 
though the Dons will be without three players because of penalties against 
Fresno State. Defender Jason Wescott and forward Erik Vadopals received red 
cards, and forward David Kurtz-Reyes had two yellow cards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri made the trip to Fresno Sunday to scout the game and was impressed by 
the Dons' strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco is a team very similar to ours," Mistri said. "First of all, 
they never give up. They're tough and well-disciplined, and they've played very 
well late in the season with their backs against the wall. And secondly, they 
have an outstanding striker in Staale Soebye from Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 Soebye has 16 goals and 10 assists. No one else on the team has more than nine 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're solid defensively too," Mistri said. "Their sweeper and blocking 
backs are very tough on balls in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri calls San Francisco goalkeeper Scott Thompson "small by Division I 
standards" at 5 feet 8. "But he has a very aggressive posture," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri said the midfield could be the Dons' strength. "They pass the ball very 
well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, are playing solid soccer. They appeared to have Saturday 
night's game won in regulation before San Diego striker Guillermo Jara scored 
with 28 seconds left, but Fullerton rallied behind forwards Eddie Soto and Matt 
Bradbury to win in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto has been on an offensive tear. He has scored 10 of his 18 goals for the 
season in the last six games and had two in overtime Saturday. With his second 
goal against San Diego, he established three more school records: single season 
goals (18), single season points (41) and career points (96). He had broken the 
career goal-scoring record earlier, and now has 38 in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri's biggest concern at this point is the lack of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played Saturday's game with only 13 people and that's a long way to go 
with only two substitutes," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players who sat out last week for disciplinary reasons, goalkeeper Mike 
Kornock and midfielder Martin Palos, will be back, but Adrian Cortes is out 
with torn ankle ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans lost standout sweeper, Demian Brown, with an injury at midseason. 
That forced Mistri to move standout midfielder, Alfred Partida, into the 
defender position, where he continues to play well. "He's been a very steadying 
influence for us," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; UCI TURNS UP HEAT IN TIME, TO WIN, 88-79

<P>
 UC Irvine, which in the first half suffered from what Coach Rod Baker calls 
"the cool factor," rallied to beat Cairns-Australia, 88-79, in an exhibition 
game in front of 1,419 Tuesday night at the Bren Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Cairns, which has beaten USC and Loyola Marymount and is 5-4 in exhibitions, 
shot 48% from the floor in the first half to take a 41-32 lead at the 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our cool factor was up way too high in the first half," Baker said. "We were 
beating them on cool and they were beating us on the scoreboard. We weren't 
running, rebounding or defending." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters turned up the heat in the second half, however. Point guard 
Raimonds Miglinieks had eight second-half assists. Senior Chris Brown, who was 
suspended from Irvine's first exhibition because he missed a team study 
session, made two of three three-pointers and scored 12 second-half points as 
the Anteaters pulled away from the Australian club team. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Brian Keefe continued to make his bid for regular role, hitting all 
three of three-point attempts and grabbing five rebounds in just 13 minutes. He 
hit consecutive three-pointers to lift the Anteaters into a tie, 48-48, with 
12:45 to play. Then Miglinieks, who was four of five from three-point range and 
scored 16 points, hit a three-pointer to put Irvine ahead for good. JOHN WEYLER

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION II; LAGUNA BEACH WINS 
THIRD TITLE IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Laguna Beach won its third consecutive Southern Section Division II 
girls' tennis title with a 12-6 victory over Los Alamitos Tuesday at the 
Claremont Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Coach Debbie Fleming made some roster moves and stacked her doubles 
teams in hopes of getting the points she needed from the teams. She paired her 
No. 2 singles player, sophomore Danielle Brandlin, with junior Erin White, 
anticipating Laguna Beach's "awesome" singles would sweep and hoping her 
doubles could do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming predicted the match almost perfectly, except she didn't get the sweep 
she needed in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Michelle Bray, Amanda Hastings-Phillips and Lindsay Weiss, who have 
played on all three championship teams, were outstanding in singles. They swept 
all nine matches, and lost only 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, fighting off leg cramps in her second match, overcame a 5-4 deficit 
against Los Alamitos' top singles player, junior Melissa Rosenthal, and won the 
set, 7-5. Still in pain, she then came out and finished her day with a 6-0 
victory over senior Gina Ronzello. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray was on top of her game, quickly dismissing her opponents, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1. 
And Hastings-Phillips used her powerful two-handed backhand to place shot after 
shot exactly where she wanted to defeat her opponents, 6-3, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Hastings-Phillips said after her team's victory. "It feels 
just as good the third time."  
</P>
<P>
 In doubles, Fleming's strategy almost got her the sweep she wanted, but 
juniors Sarah Cohen and Vanessa Zajfen came away with three victories for 
Laguna Beach (23-1). Down, 3-4, to the Griffins' Alison Miller and Michelle 
Schneider, Cohen and Zajfen broke serve and went on to win, 6-4. They won their 
final two sets, 6-0, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos (21-2) won the remaining six sets. The doubles team of Miller and 
Schneider won, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2; senior Laura Springosky and junior Sonia Ralli 
won, 0-6, 7-6 (7-0), 6-4, and Brandlin and White won, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins won the title in 1991 and have made it to the finals in 1990, 
1992 and 1994. They also reached the Division III semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists' three titles came by beating Arcadia (12-6) in 1992, Edison 
(11-7) in 1993 and the Griffins. Laguna Beach returns seven of nine starters 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really good year for us," Artist Coach Bob Walton said. "There has 
been a lot of pressure on the girls with everyone saying it was a foregone 
conclusion that we would win again. That is a lot for high school kids to deal 
with. We aren't (Palos Verdes) Peninsula. They hung in there all year long. I'm 
really proud of this group."

LA REINA BOUNCES NORDHOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The showdown between Nordhoff and La Reina highs for the Southern Section 
Division V team tennis championship Tuesday had elements one would expect from 
a title match: a large crowd, great shot-making, some upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 But drama and excitement? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina won it in a rout, 15-3, at the Ojai Valley Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams came in expecting the fourth-seeded Regents (16-3) to win the 
match, based on the fact that they had beaten the Rangers (14-7) three times 
within the past year -- once in a practice and twice in official matches that 
ended with 16-2 scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question was by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it wasn't in the bag, but we had a really good feeling," said La Reina 
junior Vicki Hull, who swept three sets at No. 1 doubles by scores of 6-2, 6-1, 
6-1, in the round-robin event. "They've improved a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers still weren't good enough to push Hull and partner Katie Nelson. 
Then again, nobody has been. Hull and Nelson are 69-0 over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents swept all nine doubles matches, winning two in tiebreakers and one 
by a 7-5 margin. La Reina clinched the title after the second of three rounds, 
when its No. 3 doubles team of Katie Grabowsky and Erin Masterson knocked off 
Nordhoff's No. 1 team of Sarah Blake and Cara Dunston, 7-6 (7-1). That made the 
score 10-2 with six points remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Upsets? 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina freshman Kristin Dickey, who plays at No. 3, was the only singles 
player to win all three sets. She overwhelmed Nordhoff's No. 3 Brianne Chapman, 
6-0, surprised No. 1 Stacey Roberts, 6-3, and pulled the rug from under No. 2 
Haley Wilbur, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I felt a lot of pressure," Dickey said. "But I was consistent and had 
a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur said she was emotionally and physically drained after upsetting La 
Reina's No. 1 player, Kristy Bear, 6-2, and No. 2-rated Cindy Bear, 6-4.

CHATSWORTH VICTIM OF EARLY FINISH; GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL: MIRA COSTA OUSTS 
CHANCELLORS IN FIRST ROUND OF STATE PLAYOFFS, 15-11, 15-4, 15-11. 
</P>

<P>
 Chatsworth High had every reason to come out flat against Mira Costa in the 
first round of the Division I State girls' volleyball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days ago, the Chancellors defeated Palisades in an exhausting five games 
to clinch the City Section 4-A Division title. As a reward, Chatsworth played 
host to the Mustangs, the second-ranked team in the state that was smarting 
from a blowout loss in the Southern Section Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a few inopportune moments, seventh-seeded Chatsworth was able to 
compete with Mira Costa (30-2) before falling, 15-11, 15-4, 15-11, Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were dead when they came in for practice Monday," Coach Bud Dow said. 
"They were exhausted, and beat up from Saturday. But we were serious about 
trying to win this match." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitters Jennifer Joseph (10 kills) and Nicole Snell (six kills) made 
Mira Costa defenders dive to retrieve kill attempts, but excellent passing to 
setter Mandy Lawson kept the Mustangs ahead in each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth had trouble getting the ball to middle blocker Jennifer Hodges. 
Hodges, dominant in the City playoffs, had only one kill after two games and 
finished with three kills and two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's first lapse came late in the second game, when Kristen Sigel 
served six straight points to clinch the game. The Chancellors handled Sigel's 
jump-serve but several passing and hitting errors did in the Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (14-5) rallied from a 9-5 deficit to tie the third game at 11-11, 
but Hodges and Joseph misfired on kill attempts and two setting errors by Karla 
Campo finished the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really hurt and disappointed," Hodges said. "I'm really upset about the 
way we played at times. We came together at the beginning but then we lost it. 
We could have beaten this team if we all played together the whole time."

Invitational.She placed third in the Ventura County championships on Oct. 28 
before winning three consecutive races, capped by the Division III title in 
Saturday's Southern Section championships at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Canchola covered the three-mile course at Mt. SAC in 17 
minutes 35 seconds, breaking the freshman course record (17:37) set by Agoura's 
Deena Drossin in 1987. Canchola led the Rangers to victory in the Division III 
championships. "I thought she'd be a 19-minute runner by the end of the 
season," Nordhoff Coach Ken Reeves said. "But I had no idea she'd run this 
fast."

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION I; PENINSULA DOMINATES 
CORONA DEL MAR, WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Coming to CIF, you pretty much compete for second. It's pretty much a given 
(Palos Verdes) Peninsula's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's Megan Wachtler couldn't have summed up any better her team's 
17-1 loss to Palos Verdes Peninsula on Tuesday at the Claremont Club. For the 
fourth consecutive year, Peninsula won the Southern Section Division I girls' 
tennis championship in convincing fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar junior Alissa Scott, who won only three games in three sets, 
said she's getting a little tired of Peninsula's act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun being humiliated," Scott said, sarcastically. "I guess it's supposed 
to be a good experience. They just nail every single shot. You feel about 10 
times smaller than them when you walk on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 And the difference in talent might about 10 times greater for Peninsula, which 
had its entire team together -- many play in juniors tournaments all over the 
world -- for the first time all season. That team consists of five nationally 
ranked players, and two world-ranked players in Amanda Augustus and Amanda 
Basica. Basica was at a tournament in New Zealand last year during the section 
team finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (24-0), which has won all 96 of its dual matches, became so dominant 
when Miraleste, Rolling Hills and Peninsula High Schools merged four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they combine three different schools?" Scott asked. "We should 
combine (Newport) Harbor and Corona. We'd have a gnarly team. I think we could 
do OK, especially in doubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Basica, ranked 12th in the world in International Junior Tennis Federation 
girls' 16 rankings, doesn't apologize for her team's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unfair because we all work hard," she said. "They do too. We just 
have a lot of talent in one place." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peninsula Coach Tom Cox said that won't always be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing a lot of girls," Cox said. "The replenishing isn't occurring. 
There just isn't any nationally-ranked players coming up. We'll stay 
competitive, but not with the same dominance." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Corona del Mar (17-4-1) hoped to be a little more competitive, 
but its top singles player, Nina Vaughan, was in St. Louis for the girls' 14 
national indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably wouldn't have made a difference if Nina was here," said Wachtler, 
who took Vaughan's place at No. 1 singles and lost, 6-2, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings' only points came in the last round from the No. 1 doubles team 
of Jenny Glasgow and Christie O'Meara, who defeated Peninsula's No. 3 team of 
Beth Hannemann and Andrea Avent, 6-3.

 SOUTHERN SECTION WATER POLO FINALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's schedule: At Long Beach Belmont Plaza, Division I (8:15 p.m.) -- 
Corona del Mar vs. Long Beach Wilson; Division II (5 p.m.) -- Servite vs. 
Esperanza; Division III (3:30 p.m.) -- Whittier La Serna vs. South Pasadena; 
Division VI (2 p.m.) -- Brea-Olinda vs. Rowland Heights Rowland. At UC Santa 
Barbara, Division IV (3:15 p.m.) -- Santa Barbara vs. Santa Barbara San Marcos. 
At Mira Loma Jurupa Valley High School, Division V (4 p.m.) -- Riverside Poly 
vs. Jurupa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's finish: Division I -- El Toro 10, Corona del Mar 9 (OT); 
Division II -- Riverside Poly 9, Sunny Hills 5; Division III -- South Pasadena 
12, Costa Mesa 11 (OT); Division IV -- San Bernardino 18, Los Amigos 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Division I -- Top-seeded Corona del Mar (22-4) and No. 3 Wilson 
(23-4) have much in common. Wilson Coach Ricardo Azevedo is the main assistant 
coach of the U.S. National team; Sea King Coach John Vargas is also a national 
team assistant. The teams have played four times this year, each winning two. 
They also each lost to Foothill and San Clemente. Wilson is led by driver Pat 
Cochran, who has scored 118 goals, two-meter man Adam Wright (94 goals) and 
two-meter defender Micah Miller. The Sea Kings are led by Neil Hueston (85 
goals, 22 assists), James Palda (75 goals, 20 assists), Adam McFarland (63 
goals, 62 steals) and Thad Buzolich (46 goals, 17 assists). Vargas has reached 
the final eight times in 12 years as the Sea Kings coach, winning four titles; 
Azevedo reached the final in 1990, losing to El Toro, 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Division II -- Top-seeded Esperanza (20-7) and No. 2 Servite (22-7) are also 
quite familiar to each other. Many of the players from both sides compete for 
the club team run by Servite Coach Jim Sprague and Esperanza Coach Doug 
Kimberly. Servite was top-ranked for most of the season, but Esperanza won 16 
of its last 17 games, including a 11-9 victory over Servite in the 
regular-season finale. The Friars are led by Jerry Smith (114 goals, 30 
assists), Brian Heifferon (85 goals) and Rob Mattivi (70 goals, 21 assists). 
The Aztecs, who won the Division II title in 1992, are led by Mike Stanley (113 
goals), Jason Mericle (67 goals) and John Zinn (45 goals, 59 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 Division VI -- Brea-Olinda (25-4), the top-ranked team in the division from 
the beginning of the season, and third-seeded Rowland (23-6) each had never 
advanced beyond the quarterfinals of the water polo playoffs. Early this 
season, the Wildcats beat Rowland, 9-6, in the semifinals of the Rowland 
tournament. Brea-Olinda is led by Tad Murphy, who holds school scoring records 
for a single season (126) and a career (246), Eric Matthews (90 goals), 
two-meter defender Tucker Lowe and goalkeeper Tim Bischel, who has a 
goals-against average of five. MARTIN BECK

UNBEATEN GLENDALE UNHAPPY WITH 3-1 VICTORY; MEN'S SOCCER: VAQUEROS SURVIVE SOME 
SCARY MOMENTS AGAINST SAN BERNARDINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most teams are pretty happy when they win a match and advance in postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Glendale College men's soccer team, it was hard to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't happy with our performance," Vaquero Coach Joe Agoston said after a 
3-1 victory over visiting San Bernardino Valley on Tuesday in the first round 
of the Southern California Regional at John Ferraro Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Vladislav Kosynsk went ever further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to win," he said. "But we played poorly. We dominated the 
entire game and couldn't capitalize on a very weak defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros have come to expect a lot from themselves after allowing only one 
goal while steam-rolling through the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (15-0-5) will meet Rancho Santiago on Saturday at 1 p.m. in a 
second-round match-up at Rancho Santiago. The winner will advance to the state 
championships at Cosumnes River College Dec. 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros last qualified for the semifinals in 1986, Agoston's first season 
as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino is a team that has left many opponents scratching their heads 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (12-5-3) didn't even have a team in 1992 and '93 because of 
budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first season back -- and with a new coach and a team of new players 
-- they finished second in the South Coast Conference behind top-rated East Los 
Angeles and moved on to the regional for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have accomplished a lot for a first-year program," Agoston said. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if the Indians might continue to cut their teeth by taking a 
chunk of the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino's Francisco Arevalo headed a free kick from Alberto Valenzuela 
past goalkeeper Erick Alvarado to tie it, 1-1, in the 50th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Vladimir Duran almost put the Indians ahead, but his shot 
bounced off the right post. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kosynsk scored on a direct free kick from close range in the 72nd 
minute after San Bernardino's George Ambrossi was called for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very fortunate to get a free kick that close," Kosynsk said of the 
tie-breaking goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Vrezh Shakhbandaryan beat Indian goalkeeper Victor Hipolito 
from 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Barranco scored in the 26th minute for Glendale, when he lofted a high 
shot over Hipolito. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after that goal, Hipolito pounced on a ball in the muddy goal mouth, but 
Barranco kicked it out of his hands and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was disallowed and Barranco was called for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the second half, Barranco had another apparent goal nullified, this 
time by an offside call.

SIDELINES: GRANZOW AND FAITH BAPTIST WERE COLD BUT NOT COLD-HEARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mercy rule took on new meaning for the Faith Baptist High football team in 
last week's 52-0 victory at Lone Pine. The eight-man game was called at 
halftime because of the 45-point mercy rule, thus putting the winning team out 
of its misery. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature in Lone Pine, with the wind chill, was 14 below zero. Coach 
Greg Weiss said winds were gusting at 30 miles per hour. His quarterback, Judd 
Granzow, came to the bench begging to go home early after Faith Baptist built a 
30-0 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granzow said, 'Let's score two touchdowns and get outta here,' " Weiss said. 
"We rented three portable heaters and we couldn't use any of them because the 
generator wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said he would have played his second string, but none of them wanted to 
take off their coats. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen the look in their eyes," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Granzow had three touchdown runs and threw two scoring passes, no doubt trying 
to stay warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Not up to snuff: Smokeless tobacco use during games has been banned by the 
NCAA for some time, but you'd never know it by tracking the brown trail of 
dugout drool left by many college ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring, that will change at Cal State Northridge: Baseball Coach Bill 
Kernen has outlawed the use of snuff. Kernen, known to put an occasional pinch 
between cheek and gum himself, also has gone cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quit seven months ago and haven't tried it since," he said. "I'm not sure 
how (players are) handling it, but I know they're not doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bar chords: Buena High football Coach Rick Scott, whose team lost to Diamond 
Bar in the first round last week, had some interesting advice for Westlake 
Coach Jim Benkert on what to look for during the Warriors' quarterfinal against 
the Brahmas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diamond Bar's band is worth a touchdown," Scott said. "They are out there 
playing while you're calling your signals. You can't hear a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Benkert toyed with the idea of bringing loudspeakers to 
practice in preparation for Diamond Bar's 450-member band, but there is no 
power supply on the Warrior practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar Coach Terry Roche said he doesn't give the band any instructions 
(Play louder when the other team has the ball?), but it is an advantage for the 
Brahmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a great band," he said. "The best band in the world. They just get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the rib: The Burroughs High boys' basketball team held a scrimmage 
Friday. Final score: white team 1,256, red team 1,202. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon fund-raiser for the program tipped off at 7:30 p.m. and ended at 
5 a.m. Star of the night was junior center-forward Danny Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pressing people full court and throwing down dunks at 4:30," Coach Art 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court likely lost a few pounds in the process, although at 6-feet-4, 160 
pounds, he needs all the weight he can get. The event claimed only one 
casualty. Sullivan, who played most of the night, suffered a broken rib when he 
was elbowed by a player. Quotebook

 Newbury Park High football Coach George Hurley, whose team lost its 
first-round Southern Section playoff game because he opted to go for the 
victory with a two-point conversion rather than kick an extra point to force

democracy. The three assistants all have one vote . . . and I have four." Stats 
</P>
<P>
 When Amy Skieresz of Agoura High won the Division II girls' race in the 
Southern Section cross-country championships, she became one of only seven 
runners to have won three consecutive Southern Section titles during their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Cook of Alemany, the 2-A Division champion from 1978-80, and Melissa 
Sutton of Newbury Park, the 4-A champion from 1984-86, are the others from the 
area to have accomplished the feat. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge senior quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin, a preseason 
All-American, and kicker Matt Ornelaz were selected the American West 
Conference offensive and special-teams players of the week, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin passed for 278 yards in last week's 23-22 loss to Cal State 
Sacramento. Ornelaz, a sophomore, kicked three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Wilson, a defensive lineman, recorded six tackles and finished his 
career ranked second on the school's sack list with 15. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected the team's defensive player of the week. Freshman defensive 
lineman Jeff Bodholt was named the Matadors' special-teams player of the week 
and O'Laughlin earned offensive honors. Things to Do

DIVISION I GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL REGIONAL; NEWPORT HARBOR GETS ON BALL, BEATS 
MILLIKAN IN FOUR GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Long Beach Millikan gave Newport Harbor a wake-up call Tuesday night in the 
first round of the Southern California Division I Regional volleyball 
tournament at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the top-seeded Sailors they listened, and came away with a 
10-15, 15-5, 15-4, 15-8 victory. They will play host to Rancho Bernardo in the 
next round. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as if it would be a typical Newport Harbor victory, when Sara 
Fairborn served an ace to open the match. But from that point on, the Sailors 
seemed out of control and unable to put any scoring runs together. The Rams 
took advantage of 11 unforced errors by the Sailors and won, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously didn't play well in the first game and we started panicking," 
Sailor Coach Dan Glenn said. "They wouldn't believe me when I told them that 
Millikan was good. After the first game they knew they were good. That's when 
we got in our groove." 
</P>
<P>
 After their brief scare, the Sailors got into a rhythm and took control. 
Trailing, 4-3, in Game 2, Misty May served for three consecutive points to give 
Newport Harbor a 6-4 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 An error by the Rams (16-3) gave the Sailors the sideout and middle blocker 
Melissa Schutz came up with a block and a huge kill to give Newport Harbor an 
8-4 lead. Millikan's only other point came on a service ace making it 8-5, but 
the Rams were beginning to look out of sync. From that point on, it was all 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 3, the Rams played good defense, but were unable to put any scoring 
drives together, while Schutz had four kills and May sealed the game with a 
slam into the center of the Ram defenders. May finished with 26 kills and 
Schutz added 15 from setter Jenny Hecker's 52 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan came out strong in the final game, taking an early 3-0 lead, but 
Newport Harbor (30-1) behind the serving of Fairborn and Kelly Liebengood, 
built a 10-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan made a last-ditch effort behind 6-foot-1 Hillary Gunsaulus, who 
finished with 19 kills, but the Sailor defense stalled them at eight points and 
Newport Harbor went on to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I match: 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield 3, Laguna Beach 2 -- Third-seeded Bakersfield won, 15-7, 9-15, 
16-14, 13-15, 15-6 and advanced to play Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, a winner in 
three games over Chatsworth. Laguna Beach ends 16-3.

Tuesday at Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fourth-seeded Chargers lost the first game before plodding their way 
to a 6-15, 15-6, 15-3, 15-8 victory in a Southern California Regional Division 
II first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asleep out there," Edison Coach Dave Mohs said. "We were terrible. We 
kept asking them if they wanted to play or go home, anything . . . we got no 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby Clemens had 11 kills and Kari Hogancamp had six kills and 14 digs for 
the Chargers in the error-filled match. Despite the sluggish performance, 
Edison advanced to the second round to play at Huntington Beach on Saturday. 
The Oilers defeated Escondido San Pasqual in three games Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach received the top seeding for the division although Edison 
(20-3) won the Sunset League and the Oilers finished second. The teams split 
their two league matches, but Edison was ranked higher in the final State 
Coaches Poll (seventh); Huntington Beach was ranked 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The odd seedings could have distracted the Chargers, or they might have 
experienced problems trying to bounce back from Thursday's four-game loss to 
Newport Harbor in the Southern Section Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "North was off, too, tonight, but they had a three-hour bus ride down here," 
Mohs said. "(North Coach Vicky Van Campen) said that was their worst match of 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Amanda Smith got the Stars (16-10) off to a fast start, posting six of her 
11 kills in Game 1. North took a 10-6 lead before three service aces helped 
close out Game 1, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking at some balls like they were grenades," Mohs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohs implored his team to get back into the match, mentally and physically, 
and the Chargers got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Kelli Liniger, setter Jill Butts and Hogancamp each had two 
blocks in Game 2, sparking the Charger defense. Back-row specialist Heather 
Dubay served eight consecutive points to give Edison a 12-2 lead, then a kill 
by Jennifer Porterfield closed out the game, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 North's sloppy play continued in Game 3, helping Edison score the first 10 
points before a service winner by Clemens gave the Chargers the game, 15-3. 
Edison took a 7-1 lead in Game 4, then won the final three points of the match 
off North errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we were looking past North toward a rematch with Huntington 
Beach," Mohs said. "But it's a 'W.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division II match: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 3, Escondido San Pasqual 0 -- Melissa Wendt had 16 kills to 
lead top-seeded Huntington Beach (17-4) to a 15-8, 15-2, 15-12 victory.

GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL STATE PLAYOFF ROUNDUP; CALVARY CHAPEL SERVES UP VICTORY OVER 
CLAIREMONT

 Julee Elliott had eight of Calvary Chapel's 18 aces as the top-seeded Eagles 
easily swept San Diego Clairemont, 15-4, 15-1, 15-3, in the first round of the 
girls' volleyball Southern California Regionals Tuesday at Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles never trailed in the match, which took only 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a repeat of last year's first-round matchup, which Calvary Chapel also 
swept en route to the Division IV State final, which the Eagles lost in four 
games to San Jose Archbishop Mitty. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (18-4) will play host to Holtville a winner in four games over 
Sierra Madre Maranatha, in the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clairemont (16-5) was the runner-up in the San Diego Section Division IV 
playoffs, but was clearly not the caliber of team Calvary Chapel faced in the 
Southern Section, which the Eagles won Saturday against Santa Ynez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play every game like it's important," Calvary Chapel Coach Jim 
Downey said. "We have to keep going out there and try to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles took a 6-2 lead in the opening minutes as Whitney Hoover started 
the game with two aces and Sara Roberts and Jenny Roberts had two kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Eikermann's kill then made it 14-4 and Lynn Lovingier finished the game 
with another ace for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles continued to serve tough in Game 2, getting eight aces. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott rotated in the game and aced five of the last seven points for Calvary 
Chapel.  
</P>
<P>
 Clairemont seemed to adjust to the serves early in the third game, but Elliott 
again rotated in and had three aces for a 15-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Roberts led the Eagles with seven kills and Courtney Owens added four. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Division V match: 
</P>
<P>
 La Jolla Bishop's 3, St. Margaret's 0 -- The Tartans lost, 15-6, 15-4, 15-4, 
and end with an 11-6 record.

</P>
<P>
 Romeo, last year's Orange League coach of the year, returns only one starter 
from last year's team that advanced to the Southern Section III-AA 
quarterfinals. Losing all-leaguers Barbara Mathews and Whitney Torregano leaves 
a huge hole on defense and in experience. Romeo says Magnolia will have to 
overachieve in order to match the accomplishments of last year's squad. Picchi, 
the lone returning starter, is back for her fourth year in the starting lineup. 
She will be joined by Mary and Michelle Tuazon and Chairez, who will help out 
with ballhandling. Despite Picchi (5-11) and Tewell (5-11), the Sentinels lack 
physical size. Pickett was last year's junior varsity MVP and Williams should 
back up Mary Tuazon at point guard. Romeo says in order for this team to be 
successful, the newcomers will have to adjust to the varsity level in a hurry. 
If they avoid injuries, the Sentinels should still be in contention for a 
return trip to the playoffs. SCHEDULE

<P>
 For the second consecutive season, Higashi returns two starters. This season, 
unfortunately, he doesn't have the luxury of building from a 12-12 team that 
reached the playoffs. The Rebels managed only one league victory last season, 
but should be improved this season. Klingelsmith and Miller are back for their 
senior years. Klingelsmith averaged nine points last season and earned 
all-league honorable mention honors. She will be joined by Stevens and 
Hernandez in the post. Stevens who was a part-time starter last season, will 
earn the starting job at center by the time the season starts. Pendergraft is 
also expected to help fill the holes left by graduation. The abundance of 
seniors should offset the team's lack of height, but the Rebels will have a 
tough time hanging with Valencia, Western and Magnolia for the league's third 
playoff berth. With five girls on the volleyball team and two playing tennis, 
Higashi is glad to finally have a full team at practice. Higashi said this 
year's squad is deeper than a year ago's. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 The Colonists may be the most oldest team in the league, but unfortunately for 
Giroux, that doesn't always translate into victories. Giroux enters her third 
season with five seniors and one junior returning from last year's last-place 
team. She says the experience should help boost confidence, considering the 
Colonists won six games last season after going winless two seasons ago. Tu'ua 
will be one of the team leaders, off a junior season that saw her average eight 
points and win all-league honorable mention honors. Durrett will also be looked 
to for scoring, after averaging three points last season, as well as Todoroki. 
Replacing the point production from four-year starter Maricela Roque at forward 
will be one of Giroux's biggest challenges. The Colonists add seniors Koo and 
McClelland to help with backcourt duties, but they lack size and depth in the 
post. The lack of size and scoring, along with some stiff league competition, 
might be too much to overcome for the Colonists to reach the playoffs. SCHEDULE

<P>
 Mercer inherits three starters from last year's fourth-place team. First-team 
all-league selection Jennifer Christensen is back at guard for her senior year. 
She will be relied upon to not only run the offense, but also contribute points 
on the board. Herrera and Brandy Mercer are also expected to help with the 
scoring. Coach Mercer says guard Mercer is one of the best freshmen in the 
county, and that's not because she's his daughter. Sister Pearl, a transfer 
from Loara, will add experience, along with fellow senior Siefken. Inexperience 
is Mercer's biggest concern, and rightfully so. Most of the newcomers have 
never played varsity ball before. Team speed could help alleviate the lack of 
experience. Ray, a transfer from Troy, will add to the depth in the backcourt. 
Mercer says a playoff berth would be nice, but it's not a priority. Another 
.500 record is the team's first priority. Expect the Sentinels to battle with 
Savanna and Western for a playoff berth. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 Corbitt has plenty of high hopes entering his first season at Valencia. He 
inherits five starters from a third-place team that advanced to the second 
round of the Southern Section II-A playoffs. This group looks to be better than 
last year's and is a unanimous pick by the rest of the league to finish second. 
However, Corbitt says the starting positions are not etched in stone. Alexander 
and Judd were all-league selections last season and join Snavely and Katz as 
returning seniors. Alexander averaged 11.8 points and Judd averaged 7.5. Lee 
could break into the starting lineup, as could Stumph and Gamba; Nevares and 
Hoppe are expected to play a lot. Corbitt says the emphasis this season will be 
on a strong defense and outside shooting. A deep bench, good inside game and 
strong underclassmen make the Tigers even stronger. Since he's unfamiliar with 
the league, Corbitt is content to call his team the dark horse, but believes it 
will able to contend with any team in the county. SCHEDULE

<P>
 The 12-time defending league champions enter the season with a new coach for 
the third consecutive season. Every time the Ladycats lose a handful of 
seniors, a letdown is expected. And every time a letdown is expected, the 
Ladycats respond. The team enters the season riding a 54-game winning streak, 
one short of the team record set from 1989-91. Another undefeated season would 
break the Southern Section record of 84 in a row by Riverside Poly from 
1978-82. Sink is no stranger to winning. He won 11 league and two state titles 
in 14 years at Lathrop High in Fairbanks, Alaska. Moulin, who averaged nine 
points last season, earned all-league and all-CIF honors. Miller, also an 
all-league and all-CIF selection, averaged 11 points. Helping fill the void 
left by Nicole Erickson, Colleen Hudson and Co. is Saari, who will run the 
offense, Metz and Zachry. Bradley averaged 18.5 points as a freshman on the 
junior varsity. Another league title should be a lock. A fifth state title, 
maybe not. SCHEDULE

 Charger Coach Bobby Ross said Tuesday that quarterback Stan Humphries should 
be ready to start against the Rams on Sunday despite undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery on his left elbow Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The swelling was minimal and the pain is minimal," Ross said."Stan is fine. 
We're expecting him to work (today). They took some loose bodies out of his 
elbow which was causing a lockup. It was an uncomfortable feeling to step 
underneath the center and have your elbow lock on you. It was a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was locking up on him two or three times in practice and then in the game. 
The final time was after the game when he went to put on his pants to leave. It 
locked up on him for about five minutes. They were concerned about 
deterioration to his elbow, and that's why the surgery was now."

 The Buccaneers are for sale and have been courted by St. Louis and Baltimore, 
two cities also vying for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Donlan, one of three people listening to bids for the Buccaneers, has 
been a long-time friend of Shaw's, and Shaw said he stopped by for an update on 
the Rams' situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are continuing to examine documents related to a possible move to St. 
Louis. Though St. Louis would like a decision by Dec. 1, Shaw said he does not 
expect a final determination before Dec. 5. T.J. SIMERS and MIKE REILLEY

CEASE-FIRE GETS OFF TO WOBBLY START IN ANGOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cease-fire to end Angola's 19-year civil war got off to a shaky start 
Tuesday as government forces and UNITA rebels battled on, each accusing the 
other of violating the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fighting appeared to subside later Tuesday, a few hours after the 
truce was to begin at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire is part of a power-sharing deal signed Sunday in Zambia, the 
third peace accord between the rebels and the government, who have been 
fighting since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The last pact failed in 1992 when UNITA, the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, lost multi-party elections and returned to war. 
</P>
<P>
 The new treaty gives the rebels four Cabinet posts, six ambassadorships and 
three provincial governorships, a U.N. official said Tuesday.

 About 1,000 people a year may be going without lifesaving transplants because 
medical examiners refuse to release organs from the dead, usually for no good 
reason, a study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people die each year awaiting organs, and many more linger on 
waiting lists, hoping that organs will become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The study did not try to estimate directly the number of lives lost because of 
medical examiners' refusal to release organs, but most transplants are reserved 
for people with terminal or potentially deadly conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical examiners believe that they might lose needed evidence in legal 
cases if they release organs, the researchers said in today's issue of the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in areas of the country where medical examiners routinely release 
organs, apparently no legal case has ever suffered, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for this loss of human life to protect the judicial system. 
It's not necessary," said Teresa Shafer, lead author of the study and regional 
director of the LifeGift Organ Donation Center of North Texas in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical examiner's offices may lack the money or staff to tackle the 
extra work involved in releasing organs, such as having a medical examiner 
attend the surgery in which the organs are removed, Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that the rate at which medical examiners denied organ releases 
increased 65% from 1990 to 1992.

 Dade County police were on the lookout Tuesday for a pair of thieves who held 
six adults and 70 preschoolers at gunpoint and then robbed their day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men wearing ski masks walked into Skipper Chuck's Child Care Center in 
Carol City, a neighborhood north of Miami, on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As teachers begged the crying children to duck, one man grabbed teachers' 
purses and cash and checks from a register. The two then ran from the building 
and drove away. Teachers said they tried to calm the children by telling them 
the crime was a practice drill.

DEMOCRATS FILE COMPLAINT ON KUYKENDALL; POLITICS: PARTY SAYS GOP ASSEMBLY 
CANDIDATE DID NOT PROMPTLY REPORT LAST-MINUTE $125,000 CONTRIBUTION. CAMPAIGN 
SAYS IT DID NOTHING WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Democratic Party, stinging over the apparent loss of the 
Assembly to Republicans, filed a complaint Tuesday with the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission about a late $125,000 donation by tobacco giant 
Philip Morris that may have swung a key Assembly race in Long Beach to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats accused Republican Assembly candidate Steve Kuykendall of 
failing to promptly file a campaign finance report showing that he received the 
$125,000 Philip Morris donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall's campaign said it did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign followed the letter of the law. This is just another desperate 
attempt by the Democrats to maintain power in the Assembly," said Lynn Harder 
of the Sacramento firm of McNally-Temple, which ran Kuykendall's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall apparently has unseated Democratic incumbent Betty Karnette in the 
Long Beach seat, pending a final count of absentee ballots. Although a few 
thousand absentee ballots remain to be counted, Kuykendall's apparent victory 
helped the GOP seize control of the lower house by a 41-39 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also named Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte. Brulte, who is 
seeking to unseat Willie Brown as Assembly Speaker, called the complaint 
"frivolous" and a waste of tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall reported to the secretary of state that he received the money the 
weekend before the Nov. 8 election. Because he filed the report so close to 
Election Day, voters were unaware of the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaint, the Democrats, citing a Times story quoting Brulte, charged 
that he knew Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, planned to 
donate the money to Kuykendall a month before the check was sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The law) is pretty clear that when you get a commitment, you're supposed to 
report it -- and they didn't," said state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press. 
"When 'deep pockets' tells you that you'll have $125,000, that's money in the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Press said Democrats are also considering a recall of Kuykendall over the 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kuykendall's lead over Karnette widened to 665 votes Tuesday as the 
Los Angeles County registrar of voters continued to tally absentee ballots. 
Counting is expected to continue at least through the end of today. Three 
Assembly races elsewhere in the state also depend on absentee ballot counts.

 DISNEY DISASTER: Many of Disneyland's attractions have been axed (E1), but the 
worst flop was Walt Disney's idea. . . . The park's authorized history says 
Disney ignored staff protests and ordered up the Mickey Mouse Club Circus in 
1955. Soon llamas escaped and flocked onto the railroad track. A panther 
attacked a tiger during a parade. A chariot nearly collapsed the circus tent. 
Worst of all, attendance was low. . . . Within weeks, the circus had closed, 
proving, an aide said, that "people came to Disneyland to see Disneyland. " 
</P>
<P>
 BEST OF THE FIELD: Walt Disney Co. has chosen a business executive, movie 
producer and arts adviser to fill the late Frank G. Wells' spot on its board of 
directors. But maybe you know him best as an actor. . . . Newest board member 
Sidney Poitier, now 67, won an Academy Award for "Lilies of the Field." He 
stays busy running his own company but sits on several corporate or educational 
boards. Says Disney chairman Michael Eisner: "Sidney's talent is more than 
screen deep. He's an exceptional man." 
</P>
<P>
 DOLLY'S DOUBLE: Dolly Parton, still a major headliner after 27 years of chart 
hits, never does anything small. She appears Sunday afternoon at Brentano's 
Bookstore at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa to promote two new books she has 
out. . . . One is her autobiography, "Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished 
Business." The other is her children's book, "Coat of Many Colors," based on 
her hit song. . . . One catch: To get her autograph, you have to buy one of the 
books there, or show a receipt that you bought one there earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 NO LONGER ABSENT: The final finals are finally in on counting absentee ballots 
for the Nov. 8 election in Orange County. The result: 146,786 people voted 
absentee -- 12.5%. That's 4,370 fewer than for the 1992 general election, but 
that was a presidential race. . . . With the state's election rules relaxed on 
who can vote absentee, the numbers were triple what they were in 1986.

 SAGGING STOCKS: From Wall Street to Woodland Hills, stocks plunged Tuesday in 
the market's worst day since Feb. 4 (A1). And local issues shared the hurt. . . 
. Lockheed, the aerospace firm in Calabasas, tumbled $2.125 to $68.375; IHOP

 PROFIT KING: Things at the Walt Disney Co., however, are just ducky. The 
Burbank company, despite declines in the theme park and resort business, posted

Monroe job last spring, and, presto, the team made the playoffs for the first 
time since 1988. It faces Birmingham in a quarterfinal game tonight (C8).

<P>
 STUFF IT: You can say sayonara to one turkey that didn't make it through 
customs -- a real turkey, that is. Rick Watanabe, who works for a Burbank 
software firm, tried to ship a frozen bird to a friend in Japan, but Japanese 
officials wouldn't let the animal clear customs because it didn't have the 
proper health certificate (B7). . . . Watanabe doesn't want it back, so the 
turkey will probably be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 OUR TURN: Forget about "Melrose Place," and "Beverly Hills 90210." Hollywood 
may soon give the Valley a crack at the big time. Twentieth Television is 
looking for buyers for its late-night show, "Sherman Oaks," which revolves 
around a documentary filmmaker who finds problems in an upscale family. . . . 
The show may be on -- somewhere -- as early as this spring.

MIKE PENNER: INMATES RUNNING ASYLUM AND HEADLINES PROVE IT

<P>
 Let us take a timeout, so to speak, to review this Chris Webber caper, which 
has shaken the basketball world like nothing we have seen since Dennis Rodman 
first dyed his scalp vermilion. 
</P>
<P>
 OK: Basketball player is paid big money to sign with Team A, spends one 
tumultuous season with Team A, feuds constantly with Team A's coach, decides he 
can no longer play for Team A and leaves to sign for big money with Team B. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
 In college basketball, this happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber is notable, simply, for taking the NCAA's time-honored redshirt concept 
and introducing it to the NBA. The only appreciable difference is that in the 
NBA, the player sits out before he leaves, not after. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, all we have heard is vitriol about Webber's head (too big), 
Webber's bread (too much), Webber's gall (6 feet 10 and growing) and Webber's 
sense of loyalty (to Chris Webber, Chris Webber and, ultimately, Chris Webber). 
Taking a break from that discourse, we inevitably lapse into the Webber Vs. 
Nellie debate -- who comes first before the eyes of The Team, star player or 
head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitle: Are the inmates running the asylum? 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion herewith: Yes they are, and we had better get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 A potential NBA championship contender, Golden State, has been forced to store 
that potential in the cooler. Meanwhile, a rebuilding NBA have-not, Washington, 
was prodded into mortgaging its future so Webber and college buddy Juwan Howard 
can be reunited -- maybe for only a year, since those are the terms of Webber's 
Bullet contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A landmark case, this was.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL '94-'95 / SMALL COLLEGE MEN'S PREVIEW; POSTSEASON PLAY 
ASIDE, CHAPMAN STILL WANTS TO IMPROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before playing a game this season, the Chapman men's basketball team was 
eliminated from contention for an NCAA Division III playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Panthers haven't been caught leasing cars for players or scalping 
tickets -- remember, this is the purest level of college athletics -- but the 
NCAA has ruled Chapman ineligible for the postseason because it didn't play a 
Division II schedule last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the 1993-94 Panthers, who were still technically a Division II 
program despite not having a player on athletic scholarship, needed to play at 
least half of their games against other Division II teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Bokosky knew the rule and scheduled mostly Division III teams 
anyway. It was a matter of mercy. In Bokosky's first year, Chapman played in 
the Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn. and finished 4-10, 7-19 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year against mostly Division III teams, Chapman finished 17-8, the 
program's first winning season since 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky was willing to lose a shot at the playoffs this year to have a 
successful season last year. The players gained confidence and it would have 
been a gamble last year to assume the 1994-95 team would be good enough to 
qualify for the playoffs if eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw the dice, for what? I didn't even have enough money to bet," Bokosky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have three seasons like most teams -- the preseason, the conference 
season and the hope for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys are disappointed of course but I don't think people are going to 
decide to come here because of the lure of the NCAA tournament. It would be a 
nice bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at local teams: 
</P>
<P>
 CHAPMAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 17-8 
</P>
<P>
 With a solid returning nucleus in Stefan Mumaw, a 6-foot-8 center, Edgar Diaz, 
a 6-6 forward, swingman Toby Curto and guards Adam Dzierzynski and Anthony 
Gonzalez and a strong recruiting class, Bokosky believes this team has the 
potential to be better than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers absorbed a blow when Umahl Anderson, who averaged 10 points last 
season, injured his knee in a pickup game this fall. Anderson had 
reconstructive surgery and is a redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But leading scorer and rebounder Mumaw (15.7 points, nine rebounds) is excited 
about his senior season, mostly because of how fast sophomore point guard 
Dzierzynski is pushing the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He absolutely will not walk the ball up the court ever," Mumaw said. "He's 
going to push it and push it and push it, and the other teams are just going to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 New Panthers who should contribute are Greg Vanden Ordel, a 6-9 center who 
played for Fountain Valley High and Golden West College; Corey Klinke, a 6-7 
forward who played at Trabuco Hills, Rancho Santiago and was a redshirt last 
season at San Diego State; Jim Falletta, 6-5 from Troy High and Cypress 
College, Jeff Reeves, a guard who played for Southern California College and 
Mira Costa, and Ramin Bastani, a first-team, All-Sea View League guard from 
Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 CONCORDIA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 17-14, 5-7 in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Greg Marshall returns for his fifth season with the Eagles, who finished 
in a three-way tie for fourth last season. With only one starter -- leading 
scorer Craig Martin (16.1 points) -- and one other player who received 
significant playing time -- Tim Morris, a 6-8 forward -- returning, Marshall 
needs some immediate help and he thinks he has found it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to fit together," Marshall said. "We were picked fifth in the 
conference coaches poll and we are working really hard to improve on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Pharoh Jones, who averaged 19.8 points for Los Angeles Southwest, is 
6-4 and 226 pounds and Jeff Putnam, from Phoenix College, is 6-7. Guard Tarik 
James, also from Phoenix College, averaged 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Barajas, a first-team All-Southern California Conference selection at 
East Los Angeles College, will probably start at point guard after he recovers 
from an injured hand. Sam Sabbara, from Western High, Cypress College and UC 
Riverside, and Kevin Christian, a freshman from Bellflower St. John Bosco, are 
also strong additions. 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 25-14, 10-1 in the California Coastal Conference 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals lost in the title game of the National Christian College Athletic 
Assn. Division II tournament last season; this time they might have the team to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time NCCAA All-American Charles Ross returns for his senior season. Ross, 
a 6-3 guard/forward, has averaged 32 points and 15.5 rebounds in the last two 
seasons. Chuck Henderson, a 6-4 honorable-mention All-American who averaged 18 
points also is back, but seniors Eric Bajus and Ruxton Schmietenknop aren't, 
each deciding he needed to work instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Lee Erickson has added three freshmen who will play a lot: Mike 
Schanzenbach, a 6-4 forward from Sacramento Foothill, the Division III State 
champion; Paul English, 6-3, from Phoenix and Dan Shields, 6-2, from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Tillett, a 6-2 guard from Fresno College, should also help. Steve 
Siefken, who transferred from Cypress last season, is the Royals' most improved 
player and is starting at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 14-17, 3-9 in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards were decimated by injuries last season and posted a losing 
season for the first time in Coach Bill Reynolds' 12 seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds got some help by bringing in Chris Kostoff, a long-range shooter from 
Capistrano Valley High, Irvine Valley College and University of San Diego; 
Chauncey Woolridge, a 6-5 forward from Santa Ana High, Cal State Fullerton and 
Orange Coast; Mike Guevara, a point guard from Santa Margarita High and 
Cardinal Stritch (Wis.) College, and Kevin Carlson, a 6-5 forward from Katella 
High and Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical redshirts Mike Ruble, a 6-8 center, and guard Jon Naro also return and 
Mike Weitala, a 6-9 transfer from Christian Heritage, will become eligible in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds worries that other conference teams might have improve more than 
the Vanguards and that the coaches who picked SCC to finish last in the 
conference again might know what they're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real challenge to improve our league standing a lot, but I 
think we will have a better ball club," Reynolds said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL '94-'95 / SMALL COLLEGE WOMEN'S PREVIEW; AFTER DISAPPOINTING 
SEASON, THINGS LOOKING UP FOR CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the least the Chapman women's basketball team won't run out of healthy 
bodies this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mary Hegarty has made sure of that with a roster of 18 for home games 
and a traveling squad of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, her first as a head coach, Hegarty had nine players available in 
November and seven in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year if anybody missed practice the assistant coaches would play and I 
was trying to drag people off the street to scrimmage," Hegarty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Game nights also were a struggle -- the Panthers won only six of their 24 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 But 12 new players, including 10 transfers from four-year or community 
colleges, have Hegarty thinking a winning season is within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at local teams: 
</P>
<P>
 CHAPMAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 6-18 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Panthers' significant depth, Hegarty plans to pick up the tempo 
this season. "We are pretty fast on the perimeter," Hegarty said. 
</P>
<P>
 So fast that leading scorer Melody Earle (16.9 points), now battles to finish 
third in conditioning drills she won easily last season. Sig Lo, who was a 
redshirt last season, will start at point guard and Denise Dal Ponte, whom 
Hegarty credits for the team's high conditioning level, will play off-guard. 
Faye Cruz, a transfer from Sierra College in Rocklin, Calif., and Amy Feniello, 
from Laguna Hills High and Saddleback College, also are expected to play a lot 
at guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Deb Nilsen, last season's point guard, will get a lot of playing time backing 
up Lo. The Panthers are also deep in inside players, with seven posts. Shawna 
Parkinson, who was a standout freshman last season, will come off the bench. 
Alana Conyers, 5-10 from Yavapai (Ariz.) College, will start and one forward 
and Melissa Starr, a 5-10 sophomore will start, at the other. 
</P>
<P>
 CONCORDIA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 15-13, 5-5 in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach David Wolter comes to the Eagles from Valparaiso, a Division 
I school in Indiana, where his 1992-93 team led the nation in scoring at 92.4 
points. He takes over a Concordia team that will be playing without three-time 
NAIA All-American Gitte Mejer for the first time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolter, who also teaches history at the university, has brought in a young 
group to begin a new legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles have seven freshmen and one redshirt freshman to go with several 
returning players and a key community college transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Kravik, a first-team All-Orange Empire Conference selection from 
Golden West, which lost in the State title game, has stepped in at forward. 
Wendy Johnson, Jennifer Zylstra, who sat out last year, and Cara Stephens are 
returning players who will contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 9-17  
</P>
<P>
 The Royals' program hasn't had a true recruiting class in about four years, so 
first-year Coach David Nelson, who is also the college's dean of students, will 
work with what's available on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Ramos, a junior forward, is back from last season's team and Cori 
Schweikert, a senior center, played two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get a couple more players in, we'll be all right next year or the 
year after," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 24-8, 6-4 in the Golden State Athletic Conference 
</P>
<P>
 Last season was the best in school history for the Vanguards, who finished 
third in the conference. But injuries and the loss of Sanja Simidzija, who 
averaged 13 points and eight rebounds but didn't return for her senior season, 
have hurt the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Randy Hawkins has had to take over the team for the first few 
games because of an illness in Coach Dean Cooper's family. Hawkins said the 
Vanguards are being carried by their perimeter players: returning seniors Tina 
Southard (13-point average), and Heather Brannan (9.5 points and 5.5 rebounds) 
and Alisha Blomker, a freshman point guard.

ADDITION BY SUBTRACTION; CORONA DEL MAR'S SLINGSBY BOOSTS HIS RESULTS IN 
CROSS-COUNTRY BY DROPPING TRIATHLONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-for-one trade can often be a risky transaction. But Corona del Mar 
standout Brian Slingsby chose that sacrifice and his biggest gamble has paid 
huge dividends in cross-country this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of his senior year, Slingsby traded in the triathlon gear of 
goggles and a bicycle helmet to concentrate solely on the roads and trails of 
high school cross-country this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The promising three-event career he had built since his freshman year would 
have to wait, at least until he found out just where those roads and trails 
led. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, he made a full commitment to cross-country," Sea King Coach Bill 
Sumner said. "He said, 'Tell me what you want and I'll do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound desire for the sport, along with dropping the brutal five-hour a 
day triathlon regimen, has made Slingsby not only one of Orange County's top 
prep runners, but one of the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't come back from training that hard and try to be outstanding and 
consistent in cross-country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistency was a liability for Slingsby for the first three years of his high 
school career, so the decision to "put on hold" his prosperous triathlon agenda 
was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time in the fall, he'd be in great 10,000 (meter) shape, but that was 
part of the problem," Sumner said. "He could run 5:30 (per) mile but no faster, 
and 16:30 wasn't getting him where he wanted to be. He could run that two times 
in a row, but, hey, everyone is already done." 
</P>
<P>
 So the remodeling of Slingsby began, beginning with the loss of 20 pounds to 
his current 150-pound frame, and the formula that Sumner and his athlete used 
has worked to perfection during his final season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge Invitational, the first race of the season for Slingsby, was a 
15:39 three-mile clocking, 1:25 faster than his time on the same course as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 The success continued at the County Championships, where Slingsby finished 
sixth, five places ahead of his 1993 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Sea View League and Southern Section finals where the fruits of 
his labor really paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 After running with the leaders in the first two miles at Irvine Regional Park, 
Slingsby ran away with the league title in a personal best of 14:49 over three 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said I should win before the race," Slingsby said. "I wasn't going in 
saying this was an easy win. There was just an opportunity and I took it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sumner: "That was one of our targets when we started his training this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Success continued at the section preliminaries and finals, with Slingsby 
posting times in both races, winning the prelims in 15:45 then finishing second 
in the Division III-A finals in 15:25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect him to run under 15:30 as easily as he did," said Sumner, 
whose pupil posted the second-fastest county time in the race behind Capistrano 
Valley senior Adalberto Sanchez (14:55). 
</P>
<P>
 Improvement was never more evident in the senior than in the last three weeks, 
as he improved 10 places from his junior year at the league meet and 1:43 at 
the section race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past is a past thing and there's probably reasons and menial things why 
for all the occurrences, but I just don't let losing get me down," Slingsby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The harder he tries, the luckier he gets," Sumner said. "Brian has tried hard 
and he's getting his just due." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just that effort that enabled Slingsby to get to the top of the 
triathlon circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the encouragement of Bill Leach, a world-class Master's triathlete and 
teacher at the high school, Slingsby "screwed around" with it as a 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of aerobic and physical strength over the next three years, 
Slingsby was the first 18-and-under finisher in the World Triathlon 
Championships in Manchester, England, in August before his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 The race featured the world's top professional and amateur athletes in the 
run-swim-bike event, in which Slingsby helped the American contingent win the 
20-and-under team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his immediate plans include collegiate running, the triathlon is not 
a dead issue. "The (Hawaii) Ironman?" Slingsby said. "I could do it but it 
would destroy my body." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he'll just stick to being Corona del Mar's Ironman.

SYLMAR SURVIVES LONGEST DAY, WILL PLAY TONIGHT; FOOTBALL: CITY MAKES NO 
DECISION, FOR NOW, ON POSSIBILITY SPARTANS USED INELIGIBLE PLAYER. 
</P>

<P>
 Sylmar High, already on probation for violations of City Section football 
rules, survived an intensive daylong investigation into an eligibility matter 
and passed muster -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing ouster from the 4-A Division playoffs for possibly using an ineligible 
player, a section official said Tuesday night that a violation may have taken 
place, but that there wasn't enough evidence immediately at hand to remove the 
team from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a cross-fire of "conflicting evidence," City Commissioner Barbara 
Fiege decided prudence was the proper tack. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a 24-hour time period, I can't (order Sylmar's removal)," Fiege said. "Is 
it done with? No. Will they be playing (tonight)? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (11-0) is ranked ninth in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and is the 
top-seeded and only undefeated team in the 4-A playoffs. The Spartans play host 
to Banning in a quarterfinal game tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege on Tuesday morning began investigating whether Joe Gonzalez, a reserve 
linebacker and fullback who transferred to Sylmar from Saugus in midseason, 
satisfied California Interscholastic Federation residency requirements. In 
order to maintain athletic eligibility, students who transfer must change 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez played in last week's 46-0 first-round victory over University. Had 
he been declared ineligible, Sylmar would have forfeited the game and been 
bounced from the postseason picture. 
</P>
<P>
 When enrolling at Sylmar on Oct. 20, the Gonzalez family claimed to have moved 
to a residence in Sylmar. The family supplied Sylmar administrators with a copy 
of a lease agreement, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said another family also lives at the Sylmar address. As a result, Fiege 
made trips to the Gonzalez family homes in both Sylmar and Saugus. In Sylmar, 
she found some of Gonzalez's clothes and his jersey hanging in a bedroom 
closet. The Gonzalezes' neighbors in Saugus, however, said the family continues 
to live there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under CIF rules governing dual residency, a family or athlete may not maintain 
two residences for the purpose of establishing eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times reporter saw three members of the Gonzalez family drive away from the 
Saugus home at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The player was not in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape submitted anonymously to Fiege that purportedly shows Gonzalez 
leaving the Saugus residence on Monday was inconclusive, she said. Fiege said 
she couldn't tell from the tape who was driving the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't make a ruling based on what my instinct is," she said. "Can I prove 
there were misdeeds? I can't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I have problems with it? Yes. Who do I believe? To knock them out of the 
playoffs, I have to be sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's father, Joaquin, told Fiege that his son spent Sunday night in 
Saugus because he had a haircut appointment and because he suffered a sprained 
wrist in last week's game. Gonzalez's father is a chiropractor, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's father told Fiege that the family moved to Sylmar because their 
home has suffered earthquake damage.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that because he is having marital problems, members of the family 
sometimes stay at the Saugus home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Gonzalez, reached Tuesday night, said he had not heard from Fiege and 
had no comment. He said the family was staying at the Sylmar house on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation knocked the Sylmar program off stride, Coach Jeff Engilman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caused the kids a lot of problems," said Engilman, who called Gonzalez "a 
third-stringer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big distraction not knowing what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 As a part-time starter for Saugus at fullback last season, Gonzalez (6 feet, 
200 pounds) rushed for 93 yards in 29 carries. This season, Gonzalez was slowed 
by a lingering hamstring injury and his playing time for the Centurions was 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Charles, an assistant coach at Saugus, said Gonzalez missed a meeting at 
midseason and refused to accept team punishment. Gonzalez quit the team, 
checked out of Saugus later in the week and enrolled at Sylmar, Charles said. 
Gonzalez already had a Sylmar uniform in his possession when he withdrew from 
Saugus, Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the kid's playing, it's wrong," Charles said. "It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Marquez, who started at quarterback for Saugus a year ago, moved with his 
family into the Sylmar attendance area over the summer and is the Spartans' 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, a senior, has completed 64 of 108 passes (59.3%) for 1,235 yards and 
19 touchdowns for Sylmar. He passed for 1,134 yards and 10 touchdowns in 1993 
at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Coach Jack Bowman expressed concern over the player exodus and seemed 
mystified about how Gonzalez received clearance to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I can tell, the City lets everything go," Bowman said. "Do they 
even have rules? (Sylmar) will probably get another six years of probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's eligibility review marks the fourth time in 15 months that Sylmar 
has been forced to defend the actions of administrators, coaches or players. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Sylmar held a team meeting over the Labor Day weekend, a violation of 
City rules. Engilman claimed he was handing out uniforms to his players. 
However, a videotape taken by an assistant at a rival school showed the players 
lifting weights. The team was ordered by the City to forgo two practice 
sessions and was placed on probation for the remainder of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, during an undercover drug sting conducted by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, at least three Sylmar football players were among 18 students 
arrested on suspicion of felony sale of narcotics. One player was a senior who 
has graduated, and the names of the two minors who had remaining football 
eligibility were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior district administrator Dick Browning investigated the matter and ruled 
that the players did not receive preferential disciplinary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 14, Sylmar was placed on probation for one calendar year after 
participating in a passing-league game against players from Pierce College. 
Engilman said he was unaware of the rule prohibiting high school players from 
competition against college-age players.

MONROE'S DOCTOR; AS HE DID WITH 3 OTHER PATIENTS, CUCCIA CURED VIKINGS OF 
MALADIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Make no mistake about who is responsible for the turnaround in the Monroe High 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Fred Cuccia. And wherever this coach turns up, success is almost 
sure to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia, who turned around three high school football programs in the last 
dozen years, took his magic to Monroe last spring -- and the Vikings have been 
blossoming ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe, which had won no more than two games in each of the past five seasons, 
earned its first playoff berth since 1988 in Cuccia's first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the Vikings make the playoffs, they have advanced to the City 
Section 3-A Division quarterfinals with a 34-6 victory over Gardena in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at 7:30, the Vikings (6-5) will play Birmingham (5-5-1) at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited," said Jackie Wyse, vice principal in charge of 
athletics at Monroe. "The school spirit is really positive right now. I don't 
know how they're gonna fare (against Birmingham), but it sure has been a 
tremendous turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an added element of drama in tonight's game. Former Monroe Coach Dave 
Lertzman, who resigned his coaching position last year after a five-year stint, 
is now an assistant to Coach Chick Epstein at Birmingham. Epstein announced his 
retirement last week and Lertzman has expressed interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Monroe players are under the impression that Lertzman, who still 
teaches at Monroe, has been bad-mouthing the upstart Vikings, going so far as 
to predict the Braves' margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's personal now," said Jair LaFon, a starting guard. "We want to get him 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Lertzman denies making any derogatory remarks about his former team and even 
went so far as to say how much he likes the Monroe players. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're saying (that I said that), then some adult is telling that to them 
to get them fired up," Lertzman said. "It's just not true. I have and I will 
continue to conduct myself in a professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who wins tonight, Monroe can savor its turnaround -- and look 
forward to the future. Monroe's junior varsity finished 9-1 and earned the 
Valley Pac-8 Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe is not the first team to benefit from Cuccia's tutelage -- and the way 
Cuccia gets around, it probably won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia has worked his magic at Hoover, South Pasadena and Poly in the last 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 His salvation streak started at Hoover in 1983, when he took over a team that 
scored only seven points in league play the year before. Three years later, the 
Tornadoes posted an 8-2 record and were ranked second in the Coastal Conference 
at the end of the regular season. They were bumped from the playoffs after they 
were forced to forfeit games for the use of an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Cuccia moved on to South Pasadena and inherited a team that had won 
only one game in the previous two seasons. In his second season, Cuccia led the 
Tigers to a 7-2-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-year stint at California High in San Ramon, where his team went 
4-6, Cuccia took over at Poly just four days before the start of practice in 
1989. His task was to turn a team that had won only four games in two seasons 
into a champion. It took Cuccia two seasons to accomplish that feat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 1-8-1 finish in his first season at Poly, Cuccia led the Parrots to an 
11-3 record and a City 3-A championship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Monroe) team reminds me a lot of the Poly (championship team) in how 
well they work together," Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's instant success has turned many heads -- including Cuccia's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (surprises me) because this team is not as talented as the ones (Monroe) 
has had in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Cuccia chose to coach at Monroe was its talent base. He 
always has been aware of the strength of the basketball and baseball teams at 
Monroe and felt that building a football program would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But the coaching transition was not widely accepted from the get-go. Several 
Vikings, including Quincy Brooks, were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning I was like, 'Is he gonna do any better?' " Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a couple of victories in passing league games, Brooks had his 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who moved from tailback to quarterback after the Vikings' second game, 
said the difference between this year and last is discipline. Last year, he 
said, players strolled onto the practice field whenever they felt like it. And 
that attitude showed itself in games as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year it was all about yourself," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 And roaming the halls among disappointed classmates didn't exactly provide 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would say things like, 'There's no use in you going out there, you know 
you're gonna lose,' " Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structure and individual instruction were two benefits of the coaching change, 
according to LaFon and senior linebacker Omar Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do something wrong, he tells you what you did wrong and how to correct 
it," LaFon said. "He talks to you, not at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pacheco: "The staff and coaching has been a lot different. The coaches 
work hard with us. They take us and work with us individually." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia credits much of his success to a crew of assistants who have been with 
him off and on for nearly the past decade. Randy Stage has been with Cuccia 
since his days at Hoover, and Don Senegal, Louie Flamingo and Tony Robinson 
came aboard during the Poly years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a staff that our kids look up to and we all are on the same 
page," Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simplicity has been the key this season, according to Pacheco, who added that 
last year he didn't know what he would be doing from day to day. "(The coaches 
would) tell us one thing and then, bam, it's a new thing all of a sudden," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco, however, was not the only Viking confused by the old regime. While 
Pacheco said he played just about every position but quarterback last season, 
Brooks wasn't really sure where he played. "I was more of a wingback, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his short-term memory loss, Brooks said the Vikings are quite 
clear about their intentions. "We want to win for Cuccia," Brooks said. "He's 
done so much for the team, we don't want to let him down now."

PARENTS' EFFORTS WILL PAY OFF AT LAST FOR VOLLEYBALL COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of lobbying by parents and players, the Ventura Unified School 
District voted Tuesday to pay stipends for boys' volleyball coaches at Buena 
and Ventura highs. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-0 vote, the board moved to appropriate $7,575 for the current school 
year.The boys' volleyball season runs from February through May. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board currently pays all coaches in all sports except walk-on 
assistants and boys' volleyball coaches at Buena and Ventura. Parents and 
players previously raised about $5,000 each season for varsity and junior 
varsity coaches through fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Russell, who gave up the boys' coaching job at Ventura to become coach of 
the girls' team, was among 40 parents and students who voiced support at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Boys' coaches) go out and they fund-raise like crazy and they don't really 
see the rewards of their labors," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Berk, boys' coach at Buena the past season, likewise was pleased with 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never experienced fund-raising at that level before," Berk said.  
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Joseph Spirito said asking coaches to conduct fund-raisers was 
"not the way to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asking for coaches to come in and not know where their salary is 
coming from," Spirito said. "They were selling cakes or (conducting) 
carwashes."

CROWLEY URGES MORE CONSISTENCY IN RULES FOR PLAYOFF PARTICIPATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley used Tuesday's proposed hearing by 
University High School as an opportunity to lobby for changes within the 
section that will lead to more consistent rules governing playoff 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 University administrators requested the hearing to address what it considered 
an unethical decision by Suburban League principals to allow top-seeded La 
Mirada to continue in the Division VIII football playoffs despite forfeiting 10 
games because of an ineligible player. But before the hearing began, Crowley 
said the section determined Tuesday morning that the player in question was, 
indeed, eligible and the team would not forfeit its victories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crowley was uneasy about 11th-hour accusations and differences in league 
rules determining who goes to the playoffs and who doesn't; the day after La 
Mirada beat University in the first round, Suburban League principals -- under 
the impression La Mirada would be 0-10, 0-5 in league after forfeiting its 
games -- voted 4-0 (with two abstentions) to allow the Matadores to continue in 
the playoffs. There was not enough time to meet before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of my recommendation (to the Executive and Blue Book committees) is 
going to be that leagues have a mechanism whereby they verify eligibility 
during the season," Crowley said. "Then, when league entries are submitted, 
they're bona fide league entries with eligibility intact. And after the 
pairings are released, we deal only with the ineligible athlete. . . . Forfeits 
really penalize kids. An administrator makes a mistake and 70 kids are 
penalized. Is it too stringent? Is it a fair rule?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that each league determines who represents it until the first 
playoff game is played, and the section can't exercise its power until the 
playoffs begin. Crowley noted the Empire League's decision to prohibit El 
Dorado from going to the playoffs, and the Suburban League -- and last year the 
Golden League -- allowing teams with inferior records to go to the playoffs 
after being in apparent violation of section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time we release those pairings, this office has to have the 
authority (to make decisions about participation); right now it doesn't," 
Crowley said. "We can't be moving teams in and out (once the playoffs begin)."

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995: ORANGE LEAGUE; MOULIN HAS TOUCH TO KEEP BREA 
GOING; BASKETBALL: SENIOR SHOOTING GUARD IS CONFIDENT THAT THE LADYCATS WILL 
CONTINUE WINNING DESPITE LOSS OF LAST SEASON'S STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It still seems sort of strange. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day Brea-Olinda senior shooting guard Lee Moulin takes the court for 
practice, she has to look twice. 
</P>
<P>
 She is no longer surrounded by Nicole Erickson, Colleen Hudson and Sarah 
Beckley. 
</P>
<P>
 Her supporting cast now consists of Jennifer Saari, Dawn Metz and Sarah 
Zachry. 
</P>
<P>
 And the man running the drills isn't Mark Trakh or John Hattrup, it's Coach 
Jeff Sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird not playing with them because when I started really playing on the 
team, Nicole and the rest were the leaders on the team," Moulin said. "It's 
kind of different when you go out there and you are used to seeing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin is one of three returning seniors and one of only two starters back 
from last season's 33-0 Division III State champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the three senior starters leaves doubt as to whether the Ladycats 
can win their fifth consecutive State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Jody (Anton) graduated, everyone said, 'Oh, you guys aren't going to 
win,' and after Nicole graduated, everyone said the same thing," Moulin said. 
"What we lose in some ways I think we make up in others. I think it's going to 
be a tough season. It's really a rebuilding year for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different team. Last year's team was really good, but we have a 
better, overall deeper bench. I think this year everyone is just a little 
better, but last year's is a pretty hard team to top." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats still have Moulin, considered one of the best outside shooters to 
ever play for Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Moulin was a first-team All-Orange League selection, averaging 
9.2 points. She was also seventh in the county in three-point percentage 
(41.9%) and ranked among the county leaders in field-goal (48.1%) and 
free-throw (69%) percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A shooting touch like hers, to a degree, is natural ability," Sink said. "But 
the finesse, stroke and smoothness of hers is due to hours of practice by 
herself. She has an excellent work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of five seniors to graduation, Sink said Moulin will be required 
to be a Jack-of-all-trades this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the first time in her career, she will be asked to do many 
things," Sink said. "She is primarily a scorer, so we want to maintain that, 
but she will also be posting up against man defenses because she is tall for a 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going to have to rebound and really play both ends of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin believes she is up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to play good," Moulin said. "If that's scoring a lot or 
rebounding or passing, that's fine. I just really want to win for the team. It 
doesn't really matter individually." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin said she thinks this season -- her third full season as a Ladycat after 
being called up for postseason play as a freshman -- will be her toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the team goes, everyone's just as excited and ready to go for the 
season," she said. "It's hard to tell right now, but I think we have the desire 
and I think that you should never count Brea out, no matter who we lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Sink agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be a stressful year in many ways," Sink said. "But Lee is 
quite an outstanding emotional leader. She is exciting to coach. She helps 
everyone and looks at this season as a positive challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 After her senior year is complete, Moulin won't be straying far from home. She 
announced two weeks ago that she will attend Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and there wasn't anything that I 
didn't like. But I think, for me, Cal State Fullerton is better." 1993-94 / IN

Fullerton, Magnolia, Bishop Montgomery and Newport Harbor by an average of 46 
points. Brea had little trouble in the Division III State tournament as well. 
The top-seeded Ladycats topped San Diego Scripps Ranch, San Luis Obispo and 
Newport Harbor--again--for their fifth title in six years. Magnolia got past La 
Habra and Rancho Verde in the first two rounds in the III-AA playoffs before 
falling to Brea-Olinda. Valencia also fared well in the postseason, beating La 
Mirada on the road in the first round of the Division II-A playoffs. The Tigers 
then lost to eventual champion Mission Hills Alemany, 61-30, in the second 
round. . . . Brea's Nicole Erickson earned the league's Player of the Year 
award and was named Times Orange County Player of the Year for the second 
consecutive season. Erickson averaged 15.7 points and eight assists. She was 
also among the county leaders in field goal, three-point and free-throw 
percentages. Brea's other four starters, Colleen Hudson, Sarah Beckley, Lee 
Moulin and Kiyoko Miller, were also all-league first-team selections. 
Valencia's LaQuinta Alexander and Cindi Judd earned first-team honors, as did 
Jennifer Christensen and Isabel Rojas from Western. Magnolia's Doug Romeo was 
named league coach of the year.

RECREATION / STEVE HENSON; SOUTHLAND SKIERS ALREADY HAVE IT HOMEMADE EARLY IN 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Winter, ever elusive in Southern California, is on sale at nearby ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch: Low prices, easy access, manageable crowds and enough snow. Not to 
mention -- cross your fingers -- clear blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the snow is man-made because the local ski resorts turn on the 
snow-making machines full blast as soon as the temperature drops to freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hail Mountain High, which has opened ski season with something of a 
100-snowgun salute. 
</P>
<P>
 About six inches of fresh man-made snow has been blown on top of the real 
stuff for a powder pack of 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 feet on the upper mountain. About 500 
skiers on weekends and 200 on weekdays have visited Mountain High, near 
Wrightwood in the Angeles Crest Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers will increase along with the snowfall, but the first real crunch 
will occur over the upcoming Thanksgiving weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of people on weekends should go up steadily and then there is a 
real surge around Christmas vacation," said Tracy Henry of Mountain High. 
</P>
<P>
 Also due to increase are prices, which are currently at off-season levels. 
Tickets per day for adults are $29.75, $15 for children. Adult tickets drop to 
$25 after 1 p.m. and there is night skiing for $21.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Five runs on the upper mountain are open but the lower mountain probably won't 
open until mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have enough skiers for that area when schools let out (for winter 
break)," said Henry, who added that preseason prices will remain in effect for 
at least another week. Regular prices will be about $40 a day for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Also open are the three resorts near Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino 
Mountains -- Bear Mountain, Snow Summit and Snow Valley. All three have about a 
two-foot base of machine-groomed hard-packed powder that includes about eight 
inches of natural snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Mountain opened Nov. 4, the first Southern California resort to open, and 
has been making snow for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have excellent conditions for this time of year and have had good interest 
so far," said Polly Lieberman of Bear Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news from Snow Valley is that Slide Peak, the area's most popular 
run, is open. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that regular rates have been implemented, meaning that a day 
of skiing costs $39 for adults and $22 for children over age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Bear Mountain, where the rates are $38 for adults and $21 
for children over 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason rates will be in effect through this weekend but could go up any 
time at Snow Summit. Ten chairlifts are operating, including the new high-speed 
quad chair, which was christened one morning last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little champagne at 8 a.m. never hurt anybody," said Bonnie Tregaskis at 
Snow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's the ticket: How does bypassing those lengthy lift-ticket lines and 
heading directly to the chair sound? 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Mountain is utilizing a system developed by Ticketmaster called 
"Permanent Ticket," a reusable plastic card similar to an ATM card. It is worn 
like a lift ticket and is activated by making a telephone reservation with a 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 The card, issued free to skiers, includes a personal identification number and 
an electronic bar code that is scanned with a hand-held computer by chairlift 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Summit has a deal with RealTime, which has made lift tickets available 
for purchase at 21 Southern California sporting goods stores -- including Sport 
Chalet, Chick's Sporting Goods and Newport Ski Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The system involves the use of ATM-like kiosks from which lift tickets are 
obtained via credit card with the touch of a few buttons. RealTime's system 
also will be in use at several Lake Tahoe-area resorts, as well as in areas in 
Utah, Colorado and the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Available exclusively at Snow Valley is a system called "Park-and-Ski." Skiers 
can purchase lift tickets over the counter at more than 100 Southern California 
sporting goods stores -- including Big 5, Oshman's and Newport Ski Co. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ski reading: Exasperated by brochures that make every ski resort sound perfect 
for everyone? A set of books published by World Leisure Corp. aims to separate 
the truth from the snow jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing America and Ski Europe are the nation's best-selling ski guidebooks. 
The 1995 editions includes prices, ski school programs and day care at all 
major and most smaller resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 A third book written by the same author, Charles Leocha, is WomenSki. 
</P>
<P>
 "This book empowers women to embrace the sport and enjoy it," Leocha said. 
"Women need to be comfortable skiing their own way, without intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
 The books take no advertising and do not shy away from criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: 800-444-2524.

</P>
<P>
 Giving youth a lift: November skiers are early starters, but for a really 
early starter, look up the slope and find Matthew Miller, a 9-year-old from 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished ninth in the state in the National Standard Race (NASTAR) in 
the 1993-94 season, making him one of the fastest ski racers in the nation for 
his age. 
</P>
<P>
 NASTAR ranks the top recreational racers nationally and in all 50 states by 
timing them on a modified slalom course. Each racer is given a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250,000 people raced NASTAR last ski season.

O.C. POLITICIAN AND EX-SENATOR KUCHEL, 84, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas H. Kuchel, U.S. senator from California for 16 years and the last major 
officeholder from the progressive Republican line in state politics that 
stretched back to Earl Warren and Hiram Johnson, has died at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County politician died Monday night at his home in Beverly Hills of 
lung cancer, Dick Arnold, Kuchel's law partner and friend, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend and protege of Warren, Kuchel was appointed by Gov. Warren as state 
controller and as U.S. senator before he was elected to those posts in his own 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel first was elected to public office at 26, winning an Assembly seat from 
Orange County. By 52, he was the Republican whip in the Senate -- the second 
most powerful Senate leadership post in his party. But for the four years he 
held that office, he refused to endorse four leading Republican candidates for 
public office in those years: Richard M. Nixon for governor of California in 
1962, Barry Goldwater for President and George Murphy for the U.S. Senate in 
1964, and Ronald Reagan for governor in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Kuchel lost his bid for a third full term, beaten in the Republican 
primary by right-wing educator Max Rafferty, who was then defeated by Democrat 
Alan Cranston in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafferty's defeat of Kuchel was the Republican right-wing's revenge for 
Kuchel's recalcitrance toward conservative candidates, and it spelled the end 
of the proudly outspoken progressive era in California's Republican Party. 
Later, when the essentially moderate Pete Wilson was elected to the U.S. Senate 
as a Republican, he was careful to support Reagan and other candidates of the 
Republican right. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel never apologized for being out of step with the rightward drift of the 
GOP, which was particularly marked in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview long after his retirement, he extolled the virtues of 
progressivism, the essence of which he said had been defined in the 19th 
Century by British statesman Benjamin Disraeli, who remarked that the main 
purpose of government was to "distribute the amenities of life on an 
ever-increasing scale to an ever-increasing number." 
</P>
<P>
 "Progressive Republicans brought to politics the philosophy of governing for 
the many," Kuchel said. "What comes particularly to my mind is Medicare. If it 
weren't for Medicare today, there would be tens of thousands of Americans 
living in the poorhouse, with no care. It was a baker's dozen progressive 
Republicans in the Senate who agreed we would vote for Medicare. . . . I was 
their spokesman, and we provided the necessary margin for passage." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel also expressed particular pride in the progressives' support of civil 
rights bills for the enfranchisement of blacks and desegregation of public 
facilities during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said with characteristic disdain, the main feature of 
"right-wing Republicans," as he understood them, "was militant anti-communism. 
. . . They seemed convinced we were about to be invaded by the communists." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel was born Aug. 15, 1910, in Anaheim, where his father, Henry Kuchel, was 
a newspaper publisher who had crusaded against the Ku Klux Klan. His father 
became blind the year the senator-to-be was born, and as a boy Kuchel used to 
read the Congressional Record to him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kuchel spoke at a graduation ceremony at UC Irvine in 1969, he talked 
about his ties to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This county has been my family's home since before the Civil War," he said. 
"My immigrant forbearers came here seeking freedom. And the kind of guidelines 
they sought to give their descendants would surely not be dissimilar from those 
on which the University of California was founded." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduated from USC in 1932 and from USC Law School in 1935, Kuchel's debut in 
politics came in 1936 when he was elected to the State Assembly to replace 
Edward L. Craig of Brea. In that year of the Roosevelt landslide, he was the 
only Republican candidate to be elected to partisan office in Orange County, a 
fact he credited largely to the good name of his father, who was publisher of 
the Anaheim Gazette for 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel defeated his Democratic opponent, James H. Heffran, a sports writer for 
the Anaheim Bulletin, by a mere 1,159 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel's next move up the political ladder came in 1940 when he won a State 
Senate seat vacated by Democrat Harry Westover. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 30, Kuchel was elected chairman of the Republican State Central 
Committee, the youngest man ever to hold that position. 
</P>
<P>
 When World War II erupted, Kuchel joined the Naval Reserve and was called to 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, when his Senate term ended, Kuchel was still in the Navy. However his 
friends nominated him for a second term in the Senate. Although his mother had 
to do his campaigning, he was easily reelected and became senator in absentia. 
He was known as Orange County's Phantom Senator until 1945, when he was able to 
return to office. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during his legislative years that he first met Warren, who became state 
attorney general in 1939 and governor in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him quite often," Kuchel later recalled. "I was single and living in 
the Sutter Club during the legislative sessions, and he'd stay there too when 
he was in Sacramento. We developed a good friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be the decisive relationship in Kuchel's career. When state 
Controller Harry B. Riley died in 1946, it was Gov. Warren who called Kuchel, 
then a state senator fresh from World War II Navy service, and told him, "It's 
a fine job, and I think you have the qualifications." Six years later, when 
then-Sen. Nixon was elected vice president, it was Warren who insisted, despite 
some reluctance from Kuchel, on appointing him to the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren was shortly to go to Washington himself, as chief justice of the United 
States, where he became a leading judicial liberal and eventually came under 
bitter attack from the far right. It was appropriate that his protege, Kuchel, 
was to emerge as the Senate's most outspoken Republican foe of the far right. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal matters, the senator was a conservative. He strongly supported 
American involvement in Vietnam for a long time. Even after the devastating Tet 
offensive by the North Vietnamese in 1968, he remarked, "I don't want this 
senator, or any U.S. senator, to indicate by his words that there is dissension 
among us" on Vietnam policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But he worked hard for such moderate causes as the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 
favored the atomic test ban treaty and other steps toward detente with the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel always traced his trouble with the political right to his response to a 
surge of mail that he got from members of the then-obscure John Birch Society 
shortly after John F. Kennedy became President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got thousands of letters telling me that Chinese communists were in Mexico 
preparing to invade California," he recalled. After checking with military 
authorities, Kuchel penned a short form letter in response. "We have no 
evidence of communists gathering in Mexico, Chinese or otherwise," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Kuchel learned that he was being labeled a "Comsymp," a 
term he had not heard of until then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little teed off, and prepared a carefully researched speech critical 
of the John Birch Society and that kind of mentality," Kuchel remembered. "I 
kicked them around, and they never forgave me." 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Kuchel's refusal to endorse his fellow Republicans began 
to nettle not only the party's right wing, but also many of the more orthodox 
conservatives who made up the majority of the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nixon announced his plans to run for governor of California, the same 
year that Kuchel was standing for reelection to the Senate, the former vice 
president said he would run an independent campaign and endorse no one else on 
the Republican ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel, feeling turnabout was fair play, decided to avoid endorsing Nixon. But 
when Nixon ran into trouble against Democratic incumbent Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown, the senator was pressured to give him a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote Kuchel a pointed letter, asking 
what kind of Republican he was for not giving such support. Eisenhower backed 
off when Kuchel responded forcefully that in California it was traditional to 
run one's own campaign and not get involved with others and that Nixon had been 
first to restate the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Tom," Eisenhower responded. "Thanks for straightening me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel was reelected that year, 1962, by more than 700,000 votes. Nixon lost 
to Brown by 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, when Goldwater ran against President Lyndon B. Johnson, 
Kuchel refused to endorse him, explaining later, "I would have been a hypocrite 
if I had campaigned for Goldwater, so I kept my mouth shut and campaigned for 
other Republicans across the country. I considered myself the Republican. I 
considered what Barry Goldwater was saying was hardly Republican doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 On his refusal to support George Murphy, who ran successfully as the 
Republican candidate for the other Senate seat from California that same year, 
Kuchel said, "I never coveted public office enough to become a wholesale 
hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, when Reagan ran for governor, Kuchel withheld his 
endorsement. He said he had given a Reagan emissary, Leonard Firestone, an 
assurance that he would endorse the future President but only on condition that 
Reagan repudiate the John Birch Society. When Reagan would not do so, Kuchel 
made no endorsement, even though he said he had been told at one point that if 
he did, Reagan would guarantee that he would have no primary opposition in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 That certain elements of the far right would stop at nothing to get Kuchel was 
indicated during his last term of office, when his Los Angeles assistant 
received an affidavit claiming that the senator, who was married and had a 
daughter, was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel was shaken. "My God," he said years later, "I almost dropped. I flew 
out to California within two days, and I asked for a meeting with the district 
attorney and the Los Angeles chief of police. They said they would undertake an 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, with little press notice, a Los Angeles police officer who had 
assisted in preparing the affidavit was fired. He and a New Jersey publisher 
pleaded no contest to charges of libel filed by the authorities. They claimed 
that it had been a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuchel later said, "It damaged me. Even though the perpetrators took a 
plea, it hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some political insiders felt that the senator lost much of his zest for 
political life after that episode. But there appeared to be other reasons as 
well for his inability to put on a dynamic defense of his seat when he was 
challenged by Rafferty in the 1968 GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kuchel admitted, "My Achilles' heel was money raising. I hated to indulge 
in it, and my campaign expenditures usually were the lowest amount of anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 With Rafferty charging hard, declaring up and down the state that Kuchel was 
not a true Republican, the senator seemed on the defensive, and often 
inarticulately so. A dispatch by then-Times political writer Richard Bergholz 
said of the incumbent: 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked in generalities, haltingly, with little force or emphasis. . . . 
(He) later conceded that he was something less than brilliant. . . . 'I was 
tired,' he explained. . . . It was midafternoon on a campaign day which had 
only one appearance earlier in the day." 
</P>
<P>
 When the votes were in, on a primary day most remembered for the assassination 
that night in Los Angeles of Democratic presidential contender Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy, Rafferty had defeated Kuchel by 69,000 votes of 2.2 million cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator went to New York to attend Kennedy's funeral. There, he ran into 
an aging Warren, who only a year later was to retire as chief justice. He told 
Kuchel, "I just feel so badly about your defeat, I can't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the Senate, Kuchel expressed pride in his record, even though it 
appeared to have contributed to his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the votes I have cast I know have been very costly to me 
politically," he told the Senate on Oct. 14, 1968, in his formal farewell. "I 
think, however, if there is one measure of satisfaction in the life of a 
legislator, it comes at the time he tallies the votes which he believed in his 
own mind were right, just and appropriate, even if he knew that the balance of 
public opinion was against him, and, sometimes, violently against him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is not only permissible but, indeed, vital that the Senate of the 
United States lead public opinion instead of following it. That is the 
difficult path but the only one to tread if our republic is to remain." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Kuchel joined the law firm headed by Eugene Wyman, a former 
Democratic National Committee member from California. After several years of 
representing the firm in Washington, he returned home to California and 
practiced law with the firm in Los Angeles until his retirement as a partner in 
1981, although he continued to be active. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchel is survived by his wife, Betty; their daughter, Karen Peterson, and two 
grandsons, Jason and Peter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A public memorial service is planned for 3 p.m. Nov. 30 at All Saints 
Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.

ACTIVISTS CITE BOY'S DEATH AS FIRST PROP. 187 CASUALTY; IMMIGRATION: O.C. 
PARENTS SAY THEY DELAYED CARE OUT OF FEAR. MEASURE'S BACKER SKEPTICAL; AUTOPSY 
RESULTS PENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino community leaders Tuesday cited the death of a 12-year-old Anaheim boy 
as the first casualty of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cano, a seventh-grader at Sycamore Junior High School, died after his 
illegal-immigrant parents delayed seeking medical treatment -- out of fear, the 
parents said, that a hospital would report them to immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for Proposition 187, the first day he felt sick we would have 
taken him to the hospital," said his father, Constantino, who has a different 
last name than his son and spoke on the condition that he not be fully 
identified because of his illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 allows for emergency health care but denies other health 
services to illegal immigrants, along with public education and other social 
services. It requires that health care workers report suspected illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Coffey, head of a group that worked for passage of Proposition 187, said 
Tuesday that the Anaheim family's story is not believable. Coffey suggested 
that the family was "probably thoroughly coached by somebody with a very vested 
interest in seeing Proposition 187 defeated." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what language they speak," said Coffey, president of Stop 
Immigration Now. "Everybody knows this is not in effect yet. Not one step has 
been taken as far as denying medical services to anybody. Over and over it's 
been repeated. It will be years before it (litigation over 187) is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino activists said that even though enforcement of the law is currently 
being blocked by a court order, many illegal immigrants are unaware of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio fell ill early last week, complaining of a cough that sent pain shooting 
through his bowels. But his father said he and his wife were afraid to go to a 
hospital and postponed seeking help until they could raise the $60 to take 
Julio to a private doctor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday morning, the boy was dead of unknown causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy results are pending and it was not known Tuesday whether the boy's 
death could have been prevented if his family had sought free medical attention 
earlier at a community clinic or hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists say Julio's case highlights the extent of fear and 
misinformation swirling through the immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
 "For goodness' sakes, this is a case that should never have happened," said 
Amin David, the chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, which focuses on 
Latino community issues. "The victims of Prop. 187 are preponderantly children, 
and here it is." 
</P>
<P>
 David said the group will take the issue up at its meeting today and plans to 
ask Spanish-language newspapers to spread the word that it is still safe to 
seek government-provided care. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, an official with the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund in Orange County, said that while his organization is still 
gathering information about the case he believes that Proposition 187 is 
keeping people away from medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing is clear . . . people are not sure whether or not to go to a 
hospital or community health clinic because of the passage of Proposition 187," 
Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the family's one-bedroom apartment Tuesday, Julio's mother, Rosa, sobbed as 
she cradled her month-old baby and welcomed a stream of visitors, including the 
boy's art teacher and the principal at his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Their son was a shy, bright boy who wanted to be a lawyer, picked up English 
quickly and tutored other recent arrivals who spoke only Spanish, said 
Principal Pat Savage. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff and students at the school collected $800 for the family Tuesday. 
Anaheim firefighters had raised $600 for the family, and several churches have 
begun fund-raising efforts. Constantino said they don't have the money to claim 
Julio's body from the morgue, let alone pay the $2,800 costs of burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the students were devastated. He was good friends with so many of 
them," Savage said. "He always came to class with a smile and he was always 
willing to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Savage said that Julio was out sick last week. On Wednesday, he came to school 
for about three hours and complained of feeling ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to a health clerk (at the school) twice, but he had no fever at all," 
Savage said. "He would not tell anybody what was wrong because he knew that his 
parents didn't have the money to take him to the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino and Rosa moved to Orange County from Acapulco four years ago. 
Julio and the couple's other older children, ages 13 and 11, were born in 
Mexico and joined their parents here only three years ago. They are all 
undocumented, Constantino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's youngest children, age 1 month and 1 year, were born in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the passage of Proposition 187, the couple was unsure where to 
seek medical care, they said. The three eldest children carry Medi-Cal cards 
ensuring only emergency and pregnancy-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino and Rosa said Thursday that a daughter had been denied care at a 
Garden Grove hospital once because her condition was not deemed an emergency, 
and Rosa said she went to UC Irvine Medical Center seeking a free pregnancy 
test once and was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two babies here who were born here. If they deport us, what would the 
smaller children do without us?" he said. "We were worried they would ask us 
for our documents." 
</P>
<P>
 The father said he waited until Friday to take his son to the doctor because 
that is payday at the factory where he works. They went to the Family Medical 
Clinic, a private facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Physician N. Radd Radparvar said he had treated the boy Friday for 
constipation and rectal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor said Julio came into the office needing to be physically supported 
by family members, and left "in good condition," walking on his own. "The 
mother and father, they were grateful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor, a general practitioner, said he administered a "small enema" and 
gave the boy antibiotics and vitamins to take at home. He said he told the 
family that if the youngster's condition did not improve, they should "rush" 
him to a hospital emergency room. The clinic is closed on the weekends, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino said that Julio was "up all night going to the bathroom" Friday 
after he took an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was going to work at 5 a.m. on Saturday, he had just come out of the 
bathroom. I asked him, 'How do you feel?' and he said he felt well," 
Constantino said. "So I went to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa said her son's condition worsened quickly. She left the house to get him 
a drink from the store and when she returned he could not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "His jaw was very tight. He couldn't open his mouth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gutierrez, an Anaheim Fire Department captain and paramedic, said Julio 
wasn't breathing and his heart was not beating when his team arrived at the 
family's home Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 After paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive him, the youngster was 
transported to Anaheim Memorial Hospital where further attempts at 
resuscitation failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy on the child was completed Sunday and results will not be 
available for several weeks, said supervising deputy coroner Cullen 
Ellingburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he learned from a friend of the family at the hospital that 
Julio's father was behind in his rent and had been working weekends to make 
ends meet. Moved by the family's tragedy, Gutierrez returned to the home Sunday 
on off-duty time to see what he and the Anaheim Firefighters Assn. could do to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother said, 'I wish you could have brought my son back,' " he said. "I 
think she was just in anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he sensed that the father was blaming himself. "He shared with 
me that his son had gotten sick on Tuesday and (the family) did not want to 
take him to a clinic for fear of 187. . . . He waited until Friday to take him 
to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I think you and your wife did everything you could.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez stressed that Proposition 187 played no role in the firefighters' 
decision to help, but that the child's death has emotionally affected everybody 
on his crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody on our crew has children ranging from infants to grown 
children who are out of the house. Everybody was able to envision or see Julio 
as their child." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Constantino flipped through a quilted photo album that contained more 
than half a dozen awards from teachers commending his son on his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julio was the brightest one of the whole house," he said. "He spoke the best 
English. He was very dedicated to his studies. He wanted a degree so he could 
be a lawyer."

JUANENO RIFT IMPERILS O.C. INDIAN BAND'S TRIBAL STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing rift among the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians is threatening to 
split them into factions and imperil their long-sought goal of establishing 
their own sovereign government as a federally recognized tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Southland's oldest Native American groups, the Juanenos have fought 
for federal recognition for decades. Representatives of the U.S. Bureau of 
Indian Affairs are due to come here early next year -- believed to be one of 
the last steps in granting recognition -- but officials may find a people in 
disarray, as evidenced by a recent lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute is former tribal leader David Belardes, who was 
elected in the 1980s but was recently ousted in a vote of the general council. 
Head of the rival faction is Sonia Johnston, who says Belardes has consistently 
exceeded his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, 47, has refused to step down, and now he and Johnston are 
controlling separate factions. Belardes hired a security guard to ban members 
of the rival faction from a recent meeting at Mission San Juan Capistrano and 
is seeking an injunction to re-establish his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Fullerton Superior Court is expected to rule on the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sonia Johnston wants my job," Belardes said last week. "She's been around 
before, and when she hasn't gotten her way, she's come and gone. I guess this 
is her last hurrah." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said Belardes was removed from his post as far back as March, 1993, 
but continues to represent the Juanenos -- before the BIA, the state of 
California, various city councils and the media -- "because he chooses to. And 
under the First Amendment, who can stop him?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a further attempt to lobby the government, Belardes even met with President 
Clinton at a special White House reception Oct. 29. But his authority, Johnston 
said, extends only as far as a tribal member's. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's entitled to his say, but you don't lock people out -- that's 
unconstitutional," she said, referring to the meeting at the mission. "A good 
leader just doesn't do that. Our wish is to keep our people together. But if 
bylaws aren't being protected, what choice do we have? We have to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he was appointed head of the three-member tribal council -- the 
Juanenos' governing body -- in April, 1993. But Johnston said it was "only a 
voice vote" and thus not binding under the terms of Indian law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was duly elected," Belardes said. "Voice vote or no." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnston said the general council later declared the tribal council 
nonexistent and at a meeting last month appointed her interim spokeswoman, 
pending new elections Dec. 17. It was earlier this month that Belardes barred 
her and others with the help of a security force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will hold the role of tribal spokeswoman until our elections are completed 
in December and new tribal officers put in place," Johnston said. "David has 
been nominated (to the soon-to-be-named tribal council) and could get elected 
-- if, that is, he accepts the appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes maintains that "a majority of people still support me and the 
existing tribal council. There's always a fly in the ointment, though, and 
that's Sonia. We'll deal with her as we need to. We're the established tribal 
council -- the established governing body. We'll continue to function in that 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Velasquez, tribal chieftain of the coastal Gabrielinos -- who also are 
seeking federal recognition -- said the vote against Belardes appears to be 
binding, under the terms of Indian law. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they submitted their application to the federal government for federal 
recognition, they submitted their tribal constitution and bylaws," Velasquez 
said. "And if elections are not held according to that constitution, then 
that's an attempt to defraud the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, David should not be the tribal chairman because the general 
council voted him out. They're a valid council -- they're a quorum of 25 
people, with one-eighth or more Indian blood, and they lawfully defeated 
David." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Johnston said she believes the lack of unity constitutes "no 
splinter group -- no split," and will have no bearing on recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You occasionally have problems in your family, but does that destroy your 
family?" she said. "The U.S. government has internal problems and conflicts, 
but does that destroy its ability to self-govern, or mean it shouldn't be 
recognized? No way." 
</P>
<P>
 But other members of the Southland's Native American communities see the 
controversy in more damaging terms. Velasquez said that, had the rift not 
developed, the Juanenos were almost certain to be recognized, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they would risk federal recognition over such a silly 
dispute," he said. "They've fought for recognition for so long, and they really 
deserve it. Why ruin it now?" 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the BIA in Washington declined comment on the dispute, 
noting, however, that the Juaneno Band is due to be placed on a list of 
candidates under "active consideration" for recognition sometime in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've completed all of their paperwork and are ready for the next step," 
said Alicia Sandoval of the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The "on-site visit" to tribal headquarters takes place during "active 
consideration," and in the Juanenos' case, Sandoval said, the visit should be 
completed by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition would grant the Juanenos their own sovereign government, giving 
them the right to establish their own schools and courts. It could greatly 
enhance their possibilities for expanded health care and job possibilities, 
while opening the door to owning Orange County's first Indian-run casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said that ownership of a casino -- and the vast potential profits it 
promises -- are at the root of the Juanenos' dispute and the reason Native 
American groups in Los Angeles and Orange counties "appear to be in a race" for 
federal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes disagrees, saying "the cons outweigh the pros when it comes to 
casinos -- I don't know if it's worth compromising our peace of mind to get 
involved in something like that. If it's for the benefit of the tribe, well, 
certainly, we should consider it. We're looking at federal recognition, and 
beyond that, at nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he speaks for the Juanenos as a whole, claiming the majority of 
its 2,000 members scattered across the country will stand behind him and that 
Johnston was appointed interim spokeswoman through an "improper" vote of the 
general council. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the injunction he seeks is, he said, to prevent Johnston and 
other members of the general council from using the Juaneno name, "from sending 
out letters to tribal members (on Juaneno letterhead) and upsetting the whole 
apple cart at the worst possible time. Sonia has a lot of families upset. We're 
so close to recognition, and here she comes, disrupting the whole situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes filed the lawsuit by naming the nonprofit arm of the Juaneno Band of 
Mission Indians as plaintiffs, "but tell me," Johnston said, "how he's legally 
able to do that. He no longer holds an elected position. I guess we'll all sort 
it out in court." 
</P>
<P>
 "Her role at the moment is nothing more than instigator . . . troublemaker," 
Belardes said. "I can't get inside of her head and figure out what her motives 
are. It's just her personal agenda, her dislike of me. It's just an awful time 
for her to surface again."

HELMS STIRS FUROR WITH WARNING TO PRESIDENT; POLITICS: SENATOR SAYS CLINTON 
'BETTER WATCH OUT' IF HE VISITS N. CAROLINA BASES. HE LATER ADMITS TO 
'MISTAKE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) set off a bipartisan tempest Tuesday by warning that 
President Clinton had "better watch out" for his safety if he travels to 
military bases in North Carolina, prompting the White House to suggest that 
Helms be denied chairmanship of a key Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After GOP leaders delicately distanced themselves from Helms' provocative 
remarks and Democrats loudly demanded an apology, the fiercely combative 
lawmaker, who is in line to chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
conceded that his comments had been "a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stopped well short of a genuine apology. "Of course, I didn't expect to 
be taken literally," he said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview published Tuesday morning in the Raleigh (N.C.) News & 
Observer, the 73-year-old conservative asserted that Clinton is extremely 
unpopular among armed forces personnel stationed at the six military bases in 
his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here," the newspaper quoted 
Helms as saying. "He'd better have a bodyguard." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, asked about Helms' remarks during a White House news 
conference, called them "unwise and inappropriate." While asserting his 
authority in matters of foreign affairs, he said that it is up to Republicans 
to decide who will speak for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President oversees the foreign policy of the United States and the 
Republicans will decide in whom they will repose their trust and confidence," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a vintage performance for Helms, a conservative ideologue who has built 
a career based on pugnacious rhetoric and flamboyant attacks. But his critique 
of Clinton prompted soul-searching among some Republicans who fear that Helms, 
by his intemperate remarks, will bolster Democratic charges that the GOP is a 
party of extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesse," said a former senior official in the George Bush Administration, "has 
been for most Republicans an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Helms' comments were published on the 31st anniversary of President John F. 
Kennedy's assassination, adding to the embarrassment of Republican lawmakers. 
Most declined to comment directly, noting only that each of the Senate's 100 
members speaks only for him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
 No such restraint was observed by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who is 
locked in a race to lead the Senate's new minority Democrats. He called on 
Helms to issue a formal apology to the President and to members of the armed 
forces, whose loyalty and patriotism, Dodd said, were called into question by 
Helms. 
</P>
<P>
 "To suggest on this day of all days . . . that an American President's life 
might be in jeopardy (if he) were to visit an American military base, would 
suggest that my colleague from North Carolina doesn't seem to know what country 
he's living in," Dodd said. "This is not a banana republic." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the first time that Helms has provoked a political furor. He once 
accused former Secretary of State George P. Shultz of "playing footsie with the 
Communists" by opposing apartheid in South Africa. In a floor debate over 
funding for AIDS research, he bluntly characterized homosexuals as "perverted." 
</P>
<P>
 Helms often storms onto the Senate floor to rail against abortions and erotic 
art and regularly angers both Democratic and Republican colleagues by 
threatening to waylay measures that he dislikes by engaging in a one-man 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This senator," he once told fellow lawmakers, "did not come to Washington to 
gain popularity with his colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest remarks came just four days after a television interview in which 
Helms questioned Clinton's fitness to serve as commander in chief of the armed 
forces. Those comments drew muted criticism from Republicans and a vigorous 
denial from Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Secret Service, which is responsible for the President's 
safety, confirmed that it is seeking a transcript of Helms' interview with the 
News and Observer. But officials were quick to caution that they do not view 
Helms' remarks as an effort to incite violence against the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials in North Carolina, where Clinton visited in April, took 
pains to disassociate themselves from Helms' comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is the commander in chief. He is welcome on any base in the 
military that he chooses to visit," said Capt. Bruce Sprecher, public affairs 
officer at Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Helms' newspaper interview, the White House publicly questioned 
his suitability for the Foreign Relations chairmanship. White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta urged Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who is expected to be 
majority leader in the new Congress, to ignore tradition and pass over Helms in 
choosing the next chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those comments are not only reckless but they are dangerous and 
irresponsible," Panetta told a small group of reporters. "And I think they 
raise a very serious question as to whether (Helms) ought to assume the 
chairmanship of that committee. I think the Republican leadership needs to take 
a very hard look as to whether or not they want somebody with these kind of 
extreme views to chair one of the most important committees in the Congress of 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said that Helms' remarks and Republican leaders' response to them 
"will tell us an awful lot what kind of course we're going to take in the next 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of Republican leaders generally fell short of the repudiation 
that Democrats are seeking. Neither Dole nor incoming House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), asked about the flap at a Republican Governors Assn. session 
in Williamsburg, Va., would criticize Helms directly. "The President's welcome 
to come to any state," said Dole. "That's the way it should be, that's the way 
it is, that's the way it will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said that Republicans would welcome any Clinton visit as an 
opportunity to engage in debate over the nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that (Clinton) would feel that all Americans want to respect and 
honor the President and that they want to welcome their President in their 
neighborhood and their community any time he wishes to come and visit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans were more blunt in their criticism of Helms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he hadn't said it," said Republican political consultant Lyn Nofziger. 
"If it did anything, it creates a little sympathy with the prez, and I'm not in 
favor of that. . . . It gives people something to shoot at. And it distracts a 
little. But is it a permanent damage? No." 
</P>
<P>
 While some Republicans stewed, Senate insiders suggested that Helms' 
legislative career likely would suffer little. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no effort to muzzle anyone," said one key Republican aide. 
"That's the way this body operates. These folks are very independent people. It 
would be very inappropriate for someone to try to quiet Sen. Helms. And there's 
a great deal of deference to committee chairmen and seniority."

</P>
<P>
 This is a statement by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) on Tuesday regarding his 
remarks about President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
 I made a mistake last evening which I shall not repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In an informal telephone interview with a local reporter I made an offhand 
remark in an attempt to emphasize how strongly the American people feel about 
the nation's declining defense capability and other issues in which the 
President has been involved and for which he is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course I didn't expect to be taken literally when, to emphasize the cost 
and concerns I am hearing, I far too casually suggested that the President 
might need a bodyguard, or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 And let me say that President Clinton will of course be welcomed by me and 
other citizens of North Carolina and other states any time he chooses to visit 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter asked my opinion and I tried to be candid in my response. The 
President has serious problems with his records of draft avoidance, with his 
stand on homosexuals in the military and the declining defense capability of 
America's armed forces -- the secretary of defense recently acknowledged that 
three U.S. Army divisions are not now combat ready. 
</P>
<P>
 I reiterate that I now wish that I had engaged in a terse interview with the 
reporter. I did not. As is my custom, we had an informal conversation from 
which he extracted an informal quote that should not have been taken literally, 
let alone published. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not fault him. I fault myself. From now on, such contacts as I may have 
with the media will be entirely formal.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES PUSH DOW DOWN 91 POINTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears of lower corporate profits and an economic slowdown caused by higher 
interest rates sent stocks plunging Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial 
average plummeting 91.52 points for its biggest one-day drop in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors sold stocks in favor of earning an attractive and steady return 
on government-backed bonds and certificates of deposit -- a trend that, if 
continued, could be ominous for the stock market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are thinking this is a good time to be playing it safe," said James 
Solloway, research director at the investment firm Argus Research Corp. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged to 3,677.99 on Tuesday, 
giving the widely watched index a two-day decline of 137.27 points, or 3.6%, 
and pushing it to its lowest level since July 6. Many other market indexes also 
fell sharply Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the Dow average's worst single-day setback since it fell 96.24 
points on Feb. 4, the day the Federal Reserve began lifting short-term interest 
rates in an effort to brake the economy's growth and curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has raised lending rates five times since then, most recently 
a week ago. Those actions, in turn, have led to rising savings rates as well as 
higher borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And those higher rates took most of the blame for the latest selling wave that 
shook Wall Street. The rates have made yields on government bonds, money-market 
funds, bank certificates of deposit and other fixed-income investments -- many 
of which are government insured and hence risk-free -- increasingly appealing 
relative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much competition from the fixed-income market," said Peter 
Canelo, chief market strategist at NatWest Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 That competition was evident in the bond market Tuesday, where investors 
sharply bid up prices of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond by more than 1 
point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value. That dropped the bond's yield to 
8.01% from 8.12% late Monday. The bond had yielded less than 6% in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to work hard to earn 9% on stocks each year, and along comes Uncle 
Sam with 8% for 30 years," Canelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The climb in interest rates sparked heavy stock selling for another reason: 
There's a consensus building among investors that the higher rates spell 
trouble for the nation's economic growth and hence corporate earnings, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while stocks of all stripes were hammered Tuesday, those that are 
particularly sensitive to an economic downturn -- such as auto, paper and 
chemical stocks -- were among the hardest hit even though their most recent 
profits have been robust. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Chrysler, Dow Chemical and International Paper all lost 1 
1/2 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Gary Schilling, who runs an investment firm bearing his name in 
Springfield, N.J., said other factors made stock investors skittish Tuesday, 
including comments by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), who joined Republican 
conservatives in urging postponement of a vote on a new global trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd said the pact, negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, should be taken up next year in the Republican-controlled Congress 
rather than during next week's session of the lame-duck Congress still led by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schilling said investors are mainly concerned that the Fed's interest rate 
actions will halt the economy's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing all the signs of an impending recession," he asserted, noting 
that some Fed efforts to ratchet up rates ultimately stifled economic growth. 
But even if a recession is not on the horizon, "the market is sensing that 
(corporate) earnings aren't going to hold up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is all the more reason why investors are tempted by the yields they now 
see on government bonds and other fixed-income investments, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market's session Tuesday mirrored Monday's activity in that much of 
the decline came in the final 90 minutes of trading, when high-volume 
computerized selling by Wall Street's big investment houses exacerbated the 
market's declines. 
</P>
<P>
 That arcane but influential practice, called "program trading," often is 
triggered when investment firms buy or sell stocks to take advantage of price 
differences between complex futures and options contracts and the actual 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On both days, the computerized selling prompted the New York Stock Exchange to 
restrict program trading once the Dow Jones industrials had lost 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas that "circuit breaker" helped halt the market's slide Monday, it 
couldn't keep stocks from tumbling further Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrials, 
for instance, plunged 35 points in the final 12 minutes alone. 
</P>
<P>
 That last-minute dive indicated selling pressure on stocks was coming from 
much more than technical factors related to program trading and signaled a 
sharply growing sentiment among all types of investors to shed stocks, several 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's loss Tuesday left the blue-chip indicator with a 76-point loss for 
the year to date. But many broader measures of the market, which already were 
sporting declines for 1994, came under continued selling pressure as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.21 to 450.09, and the Nasdaq 
composite index -- populated with many of the nation's smaller firms -- plunged 
16.53, or 2.2%, to 741.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Argus' Solloway said the Dow's decline is "only catching up with what's been 
happening to the broader market" in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, that (broader decline) was a sign that there would be trouble 
with the widely watched averages" such as the Dow, he said. "The troops were 
leading the generals."

COLUMN ONE; THE FOOD ANGEL OF 42ND STREET; MAE RAINES LOADS AN OLD PICKUP WITH 
DONATED FOOD AND HANDS IT OUT IN SOME OF THE CITY'S POOREST AREAS. 'WHEN I CAN 
EASE SOMEONE'S PAIN, I FEEL GOOD,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the children running excitedly after her rusty blue 1978 Dodge pickup for a 
piece of bread, or an orange, she is Mother Raines or the Muffin Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae Raines' food truck pulls to a stop in South-Central Los Angeles and she 
begins the task of easing hunger. "A lot of kids don't know what a snack or 
lunch is," says Mae, who watches some children devour whole bags of bread. 
Women sometimes sob when she puts food in their hands. Men bow their heads and 
say thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 At 71, when most are quietly enjoying their golden years, Mae spends her time 
hauling truckloads of food to some of the most dangerous streets in Los 
Angeles, places many people in the City of Angels avoid. In her mind, she is 
simply a good Christian. "God said: Take care of the poor and the widows. I do 
what the Word says," says Mae, a widow herself. To her neighbors, she is the 
food angel of 42nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a crisp autumn morning with wisps of clouds in the sky, Mae arrives at the 
Los Angeles wholesale produce market's "charity dock," where she gets donations 
of fruits, vegetables and bread. An ample woman, Mae -- clad in flowing purple 
culottes, black high-top sneakers and a royal blue beret covering 
salt-and-pepper hair -- points two of her foster sons at boxes of food to load. 
The boys pile the scratched and scarred Dodge with loaves of bread, sweet corn, 
oranges, pumpkins, even doughnuts. And they never forget an item children in 
her neighborhood south of the Coliseum count on Mae to bring: English muffins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need radishes, four boxes," Mae prods her foster son, Donell. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, Mae and the children scramble into the cab of the truck. The 
squeaky doors clang shut. She grasps her window and pushes it down by hand. 
Peering out the shattered windshield, she eases away from the concrete loading 
dock, heading south, through the warehouse district near Downtown, over two 
railroad tracks, past rubble-strewn lots and graffiti-marred walls, zigzagging 
into the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling past low-slung houses, Mae's food wagon brakes at her first stop. Most 
who converge on her truck are very old or very young. 
</P>
<P>
 One 4-year-old boy, Minor Beli, can barely believe it when Mae holds out a box 
of doughnuts. "Do you want it?" she asks. For a moment, Minor hesitates, then 
reaches out, tightly grasping the box. His eyes look lovingly at the treat, 
then at Mae. Minor's mother, Ana Beli, 27, says she must often limit how much 
her children eat to stretch their food to the end of the month. "When I pay the 
rent, there is little left," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belis pay $350 a month for a room in a house they share with another 
family. Her husband works for minimum wage as a garment worker. Last night, she 
says, Minor, 2-year-old Jennifer and Angel, 7 months, ate one egg each. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Ellis, an 83-year-old with tufts of gray hair peeking out from under 
her cap, hobbles down the block to Mae's truck. Mae thrusts a bag of bread, 
radishes and tomatoes into trembling hands. "Oh lordy, lordy. Thank you! Thank 
you!" the woman says, beaming at Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Lockheed Corp. riveter and housecleaner says that there often isn't 
enough food, so she skips meals. The rent eats up $400 of her $645 Social 
Security check. Utilities consume most of the rest. Someone swindled her out of 
her meager retirement savings, she says. Her house was emptied of furniture in 
a recent break-in. She leans heavily on her brown cane and stares hard at the 
ground. "I've never lived like this," she says, confessing to no one in 
particular. "I feel like taking a gun and shooting my brains out." 
</P>
<P>
 The stooped woman hobbles away. But as word gets out, her neighbors emerge 
from their homes, creating a crowd. "Are you selling this?" one woman asks. Mae 
turns to her with a warm smile. "No," she says, "I'm giving it away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh! There's my girl," Mary Washington squeals at Mae, who has helped her ever 
since she fell and broke her neck a decade ago. A former cook and janitor, she 
points to a long surgical scar that runs the length of her neck. Her head tilts 
to the side. Ever since the accident, seizures have made it hard to keep a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll dress you. She'll feed you," she says, stroking Mae's shoulder as her 
friend fills a bag with radishes and corn. Each month, she tries to survive on 
$212 in welfare -- which lets her rent a room in a house -- and $103 in food 
stamps. Collecting cans and bottles from trash bins brings in $15 more, which 
buys some food for the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae is her buffer against hunger: "She bring us food. She sure do. She's the 
grace of God." Grasping a pumpkin with fingers horribly bloated by diabetes, 
she coos with delight as Mae eases a can of pork and beans into her bag. "Thank 
you a lots!" Mary says, her eyes twinkling. 
</P>
<P>
 The bags of bread begin to steam in the midday heat. Mae has fed 25 families, 
some Latino, most black. 
</P>
<P>
 She hands food bags to a grandmother in a tattered polyester skirt and a gang 
member covered in tattoos who hugs and kisses her, saying he can't find a job 
and must hustle the streets to feed his four children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vendiendo or regalando? " one woman asks tentatively. "Selling or giving?" 
Mae, who doesn't speak Spanish, hands the woman a white enamel cup, raises four 
fingers, and points her to a large bag of red beans. The woman scoops out four 
cups. "All right! That's it!" Mae says, chiding herself because she has given 
out so much in one stop that others may go without. She crawls back into the 
cab of her truck, and rolls on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mae began this journey when she was a little girl in Dallas. As a child during 
the Depression, she helped her grandmother carry home tin buckets of 
government-issued milk. By 11, she was working, washing dishes for $1.50 a week 
after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father was a chauffeur for a priest. "My daddy cared about people," Mae 
says simply. "If we had plenty, we could only keep so much." At Thanksgiving, 
when the family received five baskets of food from the priest, her mother kept 
two. Three went to needy neighbors. Year-round, Mae's home was open to 
strangers -- from visiting church members to black circus employees who were 
barred from local hotels. To accommodate the constant stream, Mae and her 
siblings often slept on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mae was 18, her father moved the family to Los Angeles -- hoping that 
discrimination against blacks would be less pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 She first glimpsed the face of hunger at a South-Central bread store where she 
worked much of her early life, bagging and selling loaves for 15 cents. One 
8-year-old boy, whose father had died, stopped at the store every day, asking 
her for work, saying he had nothing to eat. "After him," Mae says, "I started 
to notice." She lobbied the company's owner to let her give to the hungry some 
of the day-old or over-baked loaves being sold for hog feed. Many parents broke 
the stale bread with their children right in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teacher's aide in Los Angeles schools in the 1970s, she saw that hunger 
was ever-present. One preschooler tucked half his lunch into his pants pocket, 
stowing away something -- cereal, or a piece of liver wrapped in napkins -- to 
take home to his younger sister. Mae brought bags of fruit, a tray of cookies 
and four dozen cupcakes each Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, at 56, she retired after an accident led to back surgery to remove a 
disk. She retired, that is, to begin hauling truckloads of food several times a 
month through the streets of Watts, Compton and her own neighborhood. She pays 
for some of the food herself, with money from Social Security and a meager 
retirement fund; most of it, however, is donated by World Opportunities 
International, which operates the charity dock at the produce market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae -- who raised three children of her own -- often takes some of her four 
foster children on her food runs. Chris, 11, and Cee, 13 -- who are from 
Thailand -- were removed from abusive parents. Donnie, 18, is autistic and is 
unable to speak or perform life's most basic functions without help. Donell, 
26, has been with Mae for 10 years. His birth mother said she wanted nothing to 
do with him when Donell, who is mentally retarded, turned 18 and was released 
from foster care, Mae says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at 69, Mae took in a 2-day-old crack baby for a year. She has 
had 10 foster children over the years, and also has taken in 10 other 
neighborhood children off and on, occasionally sleeping on the living room 
window seat to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the tough grandmother feels fear on her food runs. Once, she had 
driven her truck Downtown to Skid Row, parked and begun laying out pans of 
homemade rice, chicken wings, cheese toast and cobbler. Chris and Cee were at 
her side, wrapping forks and spoons in napkins. A group of homeless men 
gathered around her menacingly. Mae quickly solicited one of the ragged men to 
help her. "You can come here anytime," he said, staring down the others. "I 
guarantee no one will take advantage of you and your children." She fed 200 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae's neighborhood is rough, too. In recent years, two neighbors' sons -- 
neither one in gangs -- were killed in drive-bys, shot through the back and 
neck. One, an 18-year-old boy, was buried in a grave site Mae had purchased for 
herself. The Menlo Avenue School one block from her home has a "gunfire 
evacuation plan." Its schoolyard has been sprayed with bullets 10 times in the 
past year and a half, once just as kindergarten was letting out, says Principal 
Arthur W. Chandler. Police helicopters often hover overhead, tracking clashes 
among the 18th Street Gang, the Rolling 40 Crips and increasingly violent 
tagging groups such as the Dirty Old Men. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty is another mounting concern. Part of Mae's route traverses an area of 
South-Central in which more than one in four residents didn't have the 
resources to feed themselves the entire month, according to a UCLA study. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1980s, as a growing tide of poverty has left more people hungry, the 
efforts of nonprofit groups and individuals have become increasingly critical 
in curbing hunger's toll. "The government cannot do it all. If it weren't for 
the private sector, the tragedy would be, I think, unbelievable," says Roy B. 
McKeown, president of World Opportunities. Requests from people like Mae, he 
says, have become more urgent in recent years as joblessness in the inner 
cities has skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mae's drive through this hungry landscape often includes a stop at her 
neighborhood Unocal gas station. "C'mon baby," she beckons to a man furiously 
washing windshields one recent day. Word spreads like wildfire down the street. 
Soon, the truck is surrounded by homeless women and men, many of whom have 
known Mae for years. She plucks oranges, apples and bread from boxes around the 
rim of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 One bag goes to Tyrone Richardson, a 32-year-old unemployed construction 
worker. Taking the food, he fishes a wadded-up dollar bill from his pants. He 
stuffs it into Mae's shirt pocket. "This will help you get gas to help others. 
Sometimes I don't have a dime. Today I do," he says. The gift amounts to half 
of his total assets. Mae vehemently refuses the money. But, cradling a 
watermelon in his arm, he walks away, saying only, "She got a good heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we do," Mae says simply, stuffing more plastic bags with food. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the problem? Tell me?" Mae quietly asks Sheree Wilson, 31, who has 
been homeless for three months and was headed to Jack-in-the-Box to eat a free 
packet of jelly when she noticed Mae's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my baby," the woman says, pulling from her jacket a crumpled 
photograph of her 1-year-old boy, Joshua, beaming from his crib. She stops 
peeling her orange and begins to sob, explaining that she left the baby with 
her mother because she is addicted to crack and "going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her best friend, who was on the streets with her, was recently 
arrested for prostitution and drug dealing. Now that she's alone, the streets 
are wildly dangerous. She's not sure how to get out, or if she has the will to 
leave crack behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae pulls out a small coin purse, counts out four quarters. Then, standing by 
her truck, Mae lays her hand on the woman's chest and leads her in prayer. "You 
are gonna be all right. Nothing is too hard," she urges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith," Sheree says, lovingly fingering the picture of her son. "I 
just went the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Mae pulls out of the station, leaving behind a destitute crowd on the 
blacktop, all of them munching apples. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not long before Mae happens upon Rosa Ramirez, 20, with her two children, 
Marbella Heredia, 1, and Jose Heredia, 2. Her husband, she explains, gets 
sporadic work in the garment industry. Now, things are slow and he brings home 
as little as $50 a week. Marbella virtually inhales an orange she grasps in her 
tiny right hand. The juice cascades down her chin, trickling onto her white 
sweater. "I try to feed them something every day. Sometimes, it's just rice and 
beans," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae prepares to leave, but Jose's brown eyes look pleadingly at her as he 
stuffs the orange into his mouth. "More?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mae's last stop of the day is Tarlee McCrady's house on Raymond Avenue. Mae 
peers inside the two-story house from her truck and, seeing no sign of life, 
drives on. But a loud pleading wail comes from behind the front door: "I'm 
here! I'm here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mae parks in the shade. "You want a pumpkin?" she asks. The woman, who has 
sweptback gray hair, runs out and nods. 
</P>
<P>
 A 65-year-old living on Social Security, she met Mae in church nearly two 
decades ago. When her body is up to it, she goes out on the truck with Mae, 
helping distribute food. Today, she says, she is fretting over how to pay her 
water bill. She, too, gets much of her sustenance from Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the help, she says, "I'd be down on Skid Row. What else would I 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't do a lot of talking. But she does a whole lot of doing," says 
Brenda White, who works at Church of the Harvest, which Mae attends. She says 
she's seen Mae take a bed out of her house -- even the food in her own 
refrigerator -- and give it away. Brenda, who has two daughters, was divorced 
six years ago and had a breakdown, leaving her temporarily unable to work at 
her hair salon. She was too embarrassed to ask for help from relatives. Mae 
didn't need prodding. Every other week, she began to bring bags of food. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her Social Security, Mae receives a modest income from caring 
for her foster children. Everything that's left after paying bills -- about 
$100 a month -- is put in a coin purse and slowly given out to people in need. 
The only handout she's taken from the government is some cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have millions of dollars, they die, and their children fuss over it. I 
give my surplus money for children," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae, nearing exhaustion, steers her truck home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeling into her driveway, Mae still has a third of the food. "Hi, Mother 
Raines!" a little girl from next door cries, waving. Other neighbors drop by. 
"What kind of bread you need? Brown bread? White bread? Your grandma feel 
better today?" Mae asks Erick, 8. He nods. Mae knows that many neighbors skip 
some meals each day but are too embarrassed to ask for food. "I know which ones 
won't come out," she says. "Some people would rather die than ask for help." 
For these, she packs boxes, which Donell begins delivering on people's stoops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in the shadows of an inner city overrun by gangs and riotous living. 
But when I can ease someone's pain, or can encourage them, I feel good," Mae 
says. "If I never do anything for the community I live in, why am I here? I 
don't want to hear the baby next door cry from lack of milk or see a child walk 
by without shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hopeless. Everyone isn't extending themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving Day, Mae says, she will bake 17 traditional dishes. In the 
morning, her natural and foster children will gather, and read prayers. 
"Thanksgiving is for my family," Mae says, closing her front gate as the last 
of the food is dispensed and dusk approaches. That said, Mae concedes that last 
year, she gathered her leftovers at the end of the day, some paper plates and 
plastic silverware and summoned her children to help. She went to the corner of 
her street and served food to the thankful until every crumb was gone. About

U.S. TAKES OVER URANIUM CACHE FROM KAZAKHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States has brought more than half a ton of highly enriched uranium 
to this country from Kazakhstan that otherwise might have found its way to 
Third World countries for use in nuclear weapons, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which is expected to be announced today, was the result of months of 
negotiations between Clinton Administration officials and Kazakh leaders, who 
have pledged to adhere to international standards in dealing with leftover 
nuclear stockpiles of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official described the operation as "a huge success 
story" for U.S. efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the uranium, which was flown to the United States in huge 
military C-5A cargo planes, will be reprocessed into commercial-grade material 
and used to help fuel nuclear power plants here and in other countries. The 
final shipment from Kazakhstan arrived earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the weapons-grade material could have been used to 
manufacture up to 20 nuclear bombs. They said it was poorly protected and could 
have easily been smuggled or sold on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it was the largest cache of uranium from a former Soviet Bloc 
country that has been brought to the United States in this fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary are scheduled to disclose details of the 
operation today. 
</P>
<P>
 American intelligence agencies confirmed last year that Iran had sent 
purchasing agents to Kazakhstan in an effort to buy weapons-grade uranium for 
the Iranian nuclear weapons program, but U.S. officials said at the time that 
they did not believe Iran was able to buy any. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Kazakhstan's leaders approached the Administration about 
how to dispose of the material. The uranium was contained in a huge cache at 
Ust-Kamenogorsk, in a remote section of the country.

<P>
 In October, a 24-member team that included representatives of the Pentagon, 
the State Department and the Energy Department traveled to Kazakhstan to 
supervise the inventorying and packaging of the uranium. The transportation of 
the material to the United States began shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been working for months to help safeguard the nuclear 
stockpile of the former Soviet Union -- the actual weapons and the materials 
needed to manufacture them -- in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, the White House announced agreement on a tripartite treaty 
among the United States, Russia and Ukraine on the dismantling of former Soviet 
warheads then being kept in Ukraine. Since that time, Ukraine has sent about 
600 warheads to Russia for dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the negotiations with Kazakhstan -- kept secret until this week 
-- were carried on by the same interagency team that shepherded the tripartite 
accord. Monies for the effort are being provided under a program designed to 
help former Soviet republics dispose of their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the effort to persuade Kazakhstan to ship its uranium to 
the United States for reprocessing took on added urgency earlier this year when 
economic hardship there led to civil unrest and ultimately to a breakdown of 
law and order. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. analysts had feared that, in an effort to obtain more cash, Kazakhstan's 
nuclear weapons teams might seek to sell weapons or uranium to Third World 
governments such as Iran or Iraq, which want to become nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation was given the code-name "Sapphire," Washington officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazakhstan has signed an agreement pledging to adhere to international 
safeguards for nuclear materials and has agreed to accept inspections by the 
Geneva-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the organization that sets 
rules for nuclear energy around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Soviet republic, Kazakhstan was the site of dozens of nuclear weapons, 
processing centers and uranium stockpiles. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the 
weapons remained in the new country. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium, which officials said Tuesday totals about 600 kilograms, will be 
reprocessed at the U.S. Energy Department nuclear facility at Oak Ridge, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication how long it will take to complete the 
process.

FBI'S VENTURE INTO FILM BUSINESS LESS THAN BOFFO; CRIME: UNDERCOVER COMPANY SET 
UP TO SNARE MOBSTERS IN THE INDUSTRY DIDN'T GET MANY -- BUT IT ALMOST MADE A 
MOVIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barely one minute into his stint on the witness stand, FBI Agent Garland 
Schweickhardt was asked how he prepared to pose as a movie producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he recalled, he spent two weeks in "undercover school" at the FBI 
Academy in Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 And 12 weeks at UCLA studying film production. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the sessions with a cooperating movie industry veteran who 
served as his private tutor. And consultations with producers, screenwriters 
and the like, "to teach me about the trade" -- most totally unaware that he was 
being groomed for one of the most glamorous undercover assignments ever given 
an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweickhardt was the point man in Dramex -- for "Drama Expose" -- the FBI's 
five-year effort to smoke out organized crime influence over labor unions in 
the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 After setting up phony offices in Santa Monica -- with a Rolls-Royce at the 
ready to give him credibility -- he crisscrossed the country armed with scripts 
that demanded location shooting in such target cities as Dallas, New Orleans 
and Las Vegas. At each stop, he waved envelopes of cash before reputed mob 
figures and union leaders, bribes designed to buy "sweetheart" labor agreements 
allowing him to film with cheaper non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which culminated in one trial, now under way in federal court in 
Boston, with just two defendants facing mere two-year sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, three reputed New England mob associates were originally set to be 
defendants as well. But then "Champagne" Dennis Lepore was allowed to plead out 
to an 18-month term. And his fancy-dressing partner in crime, Tommy Hillary, 
was accepted into the Witness Protection Program in return for his insider 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 So when illness incapacitated the No. 1 defendant, Frank Salemme Jr. -- son of 
New England's reputed Mafia boss -- that left only a pair of gray-haired former 
Teamsters officials at the defendants' table. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly a boffo Hollywood climax to the risky sting in which Schweickhardt 
came within a hair of being exposed -- and also came within a hair of actually 
making a movie in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty good script too," the gangly agent recalled wistfully in the 
federal courthouse here, where he has been recounting, for the first time in 
public, how the FBI got into the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, federal law enforcement officials insist the elaborate ruse was 
well worth the small fortune spent on it. They note how it snared an associate 
of the one-time president of the Teamsters, and cite its "deterrent value" on 
other union leaders. And they cite potential "future prosecutions" that may 
result from the flipping of Hillary -- who was almost a second son to the late 
Raymond L. S. Patriarca, the leader of the New England Mafia family. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even before the trial, some questioned whether the government got much 
bang for its buck. They wondered whether the FBI's Los Angeles office may have 
gotten so caught up in the novelty of the sting -- whose props included limos, 
yachts and champagne dinners -- that they did not see potential shortfalls; how 
unsubtle offers of cash may have been a tip-off to all but the dumbest hoods, 
or how Schweickhardt, for all his training, may not have been the most 
convincing Hollywood dude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It created a lot of animosity in the bureau," recalled former federal 
prosecutor Richard A. Stavin. "(Some thought) these agents were basically on a 
holiday for the better part of four years . . . bumbling to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes that there is a long history of organized crime infiltration 
of unions, or that Hollywood has felt its sting. 
</P>
<P>
 So it did not seem outlandish when, in 1985, a member of Los Angeles' "Mickey 
Mouse Mafia" was overheard boasting to an FBI informant how he could "secure 
labor peace in the motion picture industry," according to a Justice Department 
memo. "Money talks and bull---- walks," the man declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to bribe a Teamster friend so he would not insist that 
a film project use $1,300-per-week union drivers on the set and on location. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials decided an agent should check out the boast -- and "Gar" 
Schweickhardt, a 20-year-veteran, got the nod. A Virginia native trained as a 
lawyer, he was 6-foot-4 with thinning blond hair and a craggy face that made 
him a ringer for actor Richard Widmark. Though a bit stiff, he had the 
advantage of being new to the Los Angeles office; there was little risk he 
would be recognized in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He posed as Garland Hoffner, "an investment counselor for wealthy individuals 
who desired to produce a non-union film," and paid several thousand dollars to 
the mob braggart and his teamster friend -- only to discover that the El Monte 
union in question did not work on movies; its members trucked fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the charade itself had worked, and there was no shortage of other leads 
out there -- mob guys were always bragging about their influence. So, said 
former prosecutor Stavin, "Dramex was born." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI was intent on doing it right this time. Schweickhardt now took the 
name David Rudder, got his schooling in the biz, then rented offices on 
Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica. A waiting area was staffed by a female 
agent posing as his secretary, and past her was a conference room, "Rudder's" 
office and a locked storage area crammed with electronic gear -- the 
camera-in-the-ceiling variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody came into the office," Schweickhardt testified, "we could record 
their conversations and also have a videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 Though no one who encountered "Rudder" confused him for one of the hip crowd 
-- one mob guy called him a "geek" -- his lack of polish was considered a plus, 
a law enforcement official insisted, because "if he was too smooth it might 
have been more suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
 And to his credit, Schweickhardt even years later was able to lapse into 
character, as they say, rattling off projects Rudder Productions hoped to make 
-- giving the pithy pitches expected in a field where attention spans are 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give us credibility, we had several scripts," he explained when he first 
took the stand last month. Four actually: "The Knockdown," "Cartunes," "The 
Convention" and "Love at Second Bite." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe "The Knockdown" wasn't likely to get a thumbs-up from Siskel and 
Ebert. "It was about a building being torn down," he related, "and the efforts 
of preservationists to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Convention" had possibilities, a mystery "to take place in Las Vegas, 
being a convention city, in which a group of record makers were coming (and) . 
. . a chemical was killing people off and they didn't know whether it was 
murder, accidental or what." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the script (for) 'Cartunes'?" asked Assistant U.S. Atty. Fred M. Wyshak 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cartunes' was kind of a romantic comedy involving a road show, a musical 
group that was traveling throughout New England with bookings managed by a 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
 And "Love at Second Bite"? 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a sequel to 'Love at First Bite,' which was about the vampire -- 
comedy about the vampire Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
 Schweickhardt never said what the FBI paid for scripts, but officials have not 
disputed a $25,000 price tag for the vampire sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 The make-believe company's films had budgets from $1 million to $3 million, 
except the Vegas project, because "Rudder" promised name actors in that one -- 
he floated Angie Dickinson and Roy Scheider -- and "you have to pay for the 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
 The agent has only hinted at the frustrating early stages of Dramex because 
his first efforts are beyond the scope of this trial. But by all accounts, he 
visited a series of cities without finding takers for his bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just threw the net out there. A very wide net," said former prosecutor 
Stavin, now in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Stavin saw the problem as the cash-bribe approach. He suspected real 
corruption was more refined -- a union official might insist a film hire his 
relatives, or his own catering company. In return, his men would not picket 
film sites for using non-union crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to recommend that the plug be pulled," Stavin said. "But the 
agents would always come up with a remarkable (mob) conversation, pull some 
rabbit out of the hat." 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbits they finally snared were served up on a platter by the remarkable 
Robert Franchi. He was a thick-necked Bostonian who had fled to California -- 
to escape loan sharks, he said -- then walked into FBI offices and volunteered 
his services. Soon he was carrying a recorder in a wad of bills while making 
the rounds of Los Angeles' mob hangouts -- and the FBI was paying him $5,000 a 
month, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchi's tapes generated dozens of drug and robbery cases. Then a trio of old 
homeboys came visiting and seemed infatuated with the Hollywood crowd -- prime 
fodder, in other words, for a particular FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the moment Franchi mentioned in March, 1989, that he knew some 
producers looking for help with the Teamsters, Thomas L. Hillary chomped at the 
bit to meet them. "Any union is no problem," Hillary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary was a con artist and cocaine dealer always looking over his shoulder 
for hints of surveillance while making the bar scene in his Armani suits. 
"Looked like Johnny Gotti!" was his greatest compliment to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary's best buddy was Dennis D. (Champagne) Lepore, a Patriarca Family 
soldier who was paranoid about germs and once used a health food store as his 
base in Boston's North End. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was swaggering Frank Salemme Jr., whose father, "Cadillac Frank," 
was said to have taken over the New England crime family after spending 15 
years in jail for planting a bomb under a lawyer's car. "I'm going to 
gangsterize the movie industry!" Salemme Jr. vowed in one taped conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Things moved fast after Franchi made the introductions. The FBI decided it was 
time for some scripts with New England scenes, and soon "Rudder" was off to 
meet the trio on their own turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone recordings caught Hillary boasting how they took him cruising on a yacht 
in Boston Harbor, drinking Cristalle champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got him bombed. He was out of his mind," Hillary reported. "(We) had to 
send him home in the limousine. . . . He was in la la land." 
</P>
<P>
 On the witness stand, though, Schweickhardt made clear it was not exactly a 
party for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He told how he was hustled into a bathroom at a first meeting, "and searched 
from head to toe." 
</P>
<P>
 There was another close call at a Cambridge, Mass., hotel, when Hillary 
spotted a surveillence van, and a man with a camera, clicking away "like I was 
f------ Johnny Gotti." But Hillary and his friends let greed overcome caution 
and continued to deal with "Rudder." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next year, he paid $65,000 in bribes to the trio, who in turn 
introduced him to two leaders of New England's largest Teamsters local. William 
Winn was Local 25's transportation captain, and James Moar its vice president 
-- and an associate of the president, William J. McCarthy, who from 1988 to 
1991 also headed the entire 1.6-million-member International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salemme Jr. also led "Rudder" on trips to Las Vegas and New York, promising to 
use his father's mob contacts to set up meetings with officials of the 
Teamsters and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). 
But the sit-downs fell through in both places. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government's opening statement, Assistant U.S. Atty. Brian T. Kelly 
theorized that the failure in Nevada was because "Rudder's" new friends, 
"didn't have the clout . . . (and) the union officials out there correctly 
believed he wasn't a movie producer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the agent could not be faulted in his efforts to make the operation look 
real in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a good producer, he spoke to the Massachusetts and Rhode Island film 
bureaus, seeking advice, then set up a field office in the latter state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually hired location scouts to look for locations to film," 
Schweickhardt told jurors. "We hired production managers in order to hire 
people . . . to work for us, individuals such as technicians and cameramen and 
so forth." 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked, "And did these people know that you were in reality an 
undercover agent?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 It was so authentic, they once had to halt the operation because "we didn't 
have a completed script," Schweickhardt explained. "There was a writers' 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intended to do a movie at that time. We had all the hopes and intentions 
to do a movie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the defense attorneys, Miriam Conrad, asked him, "You didn't say, 
'Wouldn't it be fun for the FBI to make a movie?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to get concessions," Schweickhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some law enforcement officials still believe the Feds should have gone all the 
way and made the film. But "Rudder" phoned Salemme Jr. in June, 1990, and, in 
effect, fired him. There had been enough of those costly road trips with no 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the FBI had made that damn movie in Providence," one official insisted, 
"we would have gotten a lot more (arrests)." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officials patiently waited for informant Franchi to complete his 
secret taping in other investigations, then unsealed the Dramex indictment in 
1992, with only four defendants: Hillary, Lepore, Salemme Jr. and Winn. Later, 
Moar was added to the case, which alleged a conspiracy to bribe labor 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it promised to be a blockbuster trial, especially after Hillary, 49, 
was tracked to Florida -- where he was broke and in hiding -- and agreed to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lepore also was in no mood to fight. Already serving a 14-year term on an 
unrelated racketeering conviction, he took a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, this summer, Salemme Jr., just 38, was reported "gravely ill" with an 
undisclosed ailment. Prosecutors, by nature skeptical of such claims, were 
convinced this diagnosis was real -- and suggested the trial be held without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 So the show had to go on without its star performers, though that did not 
prevent prosecutor Kelly from putting his own best Hollywood pitch on the 
proceedings. "This is a case," he began his Oct. 20 opening statement to 
jurors, "about organized crime, the movie industry and two corrupt Teamsters . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials say they cannot comment on the Dramex investigation until after 
the trial, which still has weeks to go. Until then, many details remain 
unknown, including the overall cost. Salemme Jr.'s lawyer once alleged that the 
government spent "millions." 
</P>
<P>
 "They could write a book about it, 'How the Mafia scammed the government,' " 
quipped Albert C. Bielitz Jr., who represents Winn. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys portray the case as idle puffing by mob guys squeezing money 
from a free-spending mark -- "Rudder." They concede that the Teamsters 
eventually agreed to filming with non-union labor, but say they gave in only 
because he was so persuasive as a producer trying to hold down costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Along these lines, defense attorney Conrad has had Schweickhardt lead the jury 
through the minutiae of film production: shooting with "second units" to take 
"external shots," for instance, or how "above the line" costs work. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad's argument is that his films were so small that the Teamsters had 
little to gain, but hoped he would be successful and return to New England with 
bigger projects -- able to afford union crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad pestered the agent about how he kept pleading poverty as a producer, 
saying he couldn't risk "going over the money you had from your investors." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we didn't have any investors," Schweickhardt retorted. "We were the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Government operation or not, real film or not, he seemed offended when Conrad 
suggested that the FBI's movie was going to be so "super low budget" that it 
would go straight to cable. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare she. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put it out in the theaters (first)," he lectured, "then you sell it to 
the cable . . . HBO, Showtime . . . foreign . . . the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the court took a break and he retreated to a corridor and a hard wooden 
bench. A 29-year FBI veteran now, he was nearing the time when a pension 
becomes attractive and he could consider getting into "the biz" for real. 
</P>
<P>
 Gar Schweickhardt laughed at that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think so," he said. "Not in the film industry."

2 FBI AGENTS, DETECTIVE KILLED IN D.C. SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two FBI agents and a District of Columbia police detective were shot and 
killed Tuesday afternoon as gunfire erupted in the squad room of an elite 
homicide unit at Washington's downtown police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth person, believed to be the gunman, was also found dead at the scene, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not assign a motive to the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Police Chief Fred Thomas said that the gunman, who had a 
semiautomatic rifle, and two other people were being interviewed by members of 
the squad. He said that the three were "either witnesses or suspects" in cases 
but declined to give their identities or further details. 
</P>
<P>
 One knowledgeable source said that the dead gunman apparently was a suspect 
who was questioned a week ago by homicide detectives in a recent triple slaying 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other two being interviewed by the police team, one was wounded and the 
other was unharmed but in custody. Another FBI agent in the room at the time, 
John David Kuchta, had surgery for leg and chest wounds suffered in the 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources took pains to deny an early report that the gunman was 
a former member of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither was it clear how the gunman died, whether he shot himself or was shot 
by others. "There were a lot of guns in that squad room," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings broke out around 3:30 p.m. in a third-floor office that served 
as the meeting place for a crack group of detectives known as the "cold case" 
squad, so named because they investigate the most difficult unsolved murder 
cases -- many so old that they are considered "cold," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI agents were participants in the "cold case" task force, according to 
Susan Lloyd, a bureau spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the shootings broke out, police SWAT team members arrived and 
sealed off the floors above and below the third floor and, after a room-by-room 
search, made contact with the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half an hour later, Thomas said, SWAT team members forced their way 
into the squad room and found the two FBI agents, one male and one female, as 
well as the D.C. policeman, mortally wounded. The three were later pronounced 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the shootings, emergency medical workers descended on the 
massive, five-story granite building five blocks from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 National Park Service police helicopters ferried shooting victims to area 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that there was no effective security in the police 
headquarters building, which also houses city offices where Washingtonians go 
to obtain driver's licenses, automobile license plates and birth certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said that the building's lobby is staffed by uniformed but unarmed 
personnel and does not have metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the District of Columbia police union complained Tuesday night 
about the lack of security. "They talk about budget cuts but they've got no 
metal detectors down here, no security," said J.C. Stamps, president of the 
Fraternal Order of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more protection just like anyone else and they should see that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the shootings were hard to come by late Tuesday, there was 
no dearth of unofficial reports. At the time of the incident, police officials 
were conducting a press conference down the hall and within minutes a gaggle of 
reporters and camera people converged on the scene, adding to the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reporters later said outside police headquarters that SWAT team 
members had fired tear gas before entering the squad room where the shootings 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 By early evening, as darkness settled over the nation's capital, a lone 
Washington police officer emerged from the building and wordlessly lowered the 
U.S. and District of Columbia flags to half staff on the flagpole in front of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain FBI agents were identified as Martha Dixon Martinez, 35, a 
seven-year veteran, and Michael J. Miller, 36, an eight-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of two agents were the worst loss of life in a single occurrence 
for the FBI since a shootout in Miami in April, 1986. In that case, agents were 
chasing two bank robbery suspects who opened fire, killing two agents as they 
were stepping out of their own car. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, more than 40 agents have been killed in the bureau's 86-year history. 
Although no FBI agents died, the government's initial raid on the Branch 
Davidian compound outside Waco, Tex., in February, 1993, resulted in the deaths 
of four agents assigned to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead District police officer was identified as Detective Sgt. Hank Daly, 
51, a 28-year veteran. A Washington Hospital Center official said that Daly had 
suffered two gunshot wounds, in the head and neck, and was dead when he arrived 
at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly was supervisor of the "cold case" squad, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an outstanding police officer," former D.C. Police Chief Isaac Fulwood 
said on local television. "He really understood homicides. He had an 
outstanding ability to interview. He got along well with people. . . . He will 
be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulwood said that Daly's name was "one of first to come up" when the "cold 
case" unit was created several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police officers didn't have a chance," he added. "There's nothing like 
when a police officer gets killed. it just devastates a department."

CLINTON REJECTS GATT VOTE DEAL; POLITICS: PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL NOT BACK A TAX 
CUT ON CAPITAL GAINS IN EXCHANGE FOR DOLE'S SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL TRADE ACCORD. 
HE ALSO OPPOSES SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, still battling to secure congressional approval of a new 
global trade agreement, declared one potential deal off-limits Tuesday, flatly 
rejecting a Republican effort to link the trade accord to a capital gains tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing for the first time the capital gains horse trade suggested by 
incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Clinton expressed optimism that he 
would be able to reconcile his differences with the Kansas Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the two men come to terms, he said, the GOP-backed tax cut would 
not be part of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree that there should be some deal cut regarding capital gains," 
Clinton said during a news conference in the Old Executive Office Building 
adjacent to the White House. "I don't think that's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, which would create a World Trade Organization as a successor to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as the referee for the global trading 
system, "is an important agreement on its own merits," the President said. By 
gradually reducing protectionist tariffs that limit commerce between nations, 
the expanded trade agreement would stimulate economic growth and job creation 
in America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone concedes it will lead to hundreds of thousands of jobs," Clinton 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 With President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine at his side, Clinton sought to 
delineate under what circumstances he would be willing to compromise with the 
new Republican leaders of the House and Senate, and under what circumstances he 
would resist. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he would fight any move to pass a constitutional amendment 
providing for school prayer. Similarly, he promised to resist moves to repeal 
handgun purchase restrictions, the new ban on some assault weapons and the new 
law requiring companies to provide unpaid family leave to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton considers all three measures centerpieces of the first two years of 
his presidency. But all three face likely attack by the new Republican 
congressional majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The President expressed confidence that he and congressional Republicans would 
be able to cooperate on efforts to restrict lobbying practices, reform campaign 
finances and give states more flexibility over the federal programs that they 
administer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a compromise continued to elude Clinton on his most pressing legislative 
objective: approval of the GATT accord during a special lame-duck session of 
Congress set to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the pact is endorsed by Congress before the end of the year, many trade 
specialists contend, the 124-nation agreement could unravel. Many signatory 
nations are awaiting the outcome of next week's congressional debate before 
taking final action on the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 While the House is widely expected to approve the trade accord, its prospects 
appear dicey in the Senate. A White House vote count taken Tuesday indicated 
that 26 senators, including Dole, remain undecided. Another 14 were said to be 
leaning against the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Republicans traditionally have supported tariff reductions, the 
politics of trade has become more polarized since Election Day. Clinton is 
trying to win the support of middle-of-the-road Republicans and Democrats while 
Dole holds back his own crucial backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole suggested Sunday that he would be more likely to support GATT if the 
White House agreed to an accounting change to make it easier for the 
Republicans to seek passage of a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding GOP legislative objective, the capital gains measure would 
reduce taxes paid by investors, landowners, entrepreneurs and businesses on 
profits from sales of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 By introducing the tax measure into the trade debate, Dole put Clinton in a 
political bind. Yielding on capital gains would cost the President support 
among his Democratic base while providing only questionable support from 
Republicans, a senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Dole's suggestion has not produced a capital gains groundswell. Sen. 
Phil Gramm of Texas, who is expected to challenge Dole for the GOP presidential 
nomination in 1996, said that Dole's effort to link the trade plan to the tax 
cut "is not a good pairing." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides pressing the capital gains issue, Dole has suggested other concessions 
that might win his support for the trade accord. One would involve establishing 
a procedure for Congress to monitor the actions of the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole and a diverse group of opponents, ranging from conservative firebrand 
Patrick J. Buchanan to consumer activist Ralph Nader have expressed concern 
that the trade organization would be able to overrule U.S. laws that protect 
the environment, labor and public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 One trade official said that Dole seemed close to accepting a plan under which 
a group of retired U.S. judges would determine whether the global trade body 
treats U.S. interests fairly. If the judges believed that it did not, Congress 
presumably could vote to withdraw from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that more talks between Dole and a Clinton team 
including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen would be needed before they would be convinced that they could count on 
Dole's support. The Senate leader's vote is considered critical because it 
would provide cover for other Republicans who are anxious about supporting 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as they worked toward reconciliation with Dole, White House officials 
suffered a setback when Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Senate's 
senior Democrat, said that he would try to use parliamentary procedures to 
defeat the trade plan -- or at least delay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said that 
he could count only 41 senators favoring or leaning strongly toward supporting 
the agreement. That would leave it 19 votes short of the 60 needed to win a 
crucial procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton tried to clarify his view on school prayer, which he had 
muddied with remarks at a press conference last week in Indonesia. Saying that 
he was tired when he appeared to endorse a constitutional amendment making 
prayer or a moment of silence legal in schools, Clinton said that he opposes 
such an amendment as "inherently coercive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always supported a moment of silence," Clinton said. "When I was a 
governor, I supported the moment of silence legislation. I do not believe that 
we should have a constitutional amendment to carve out and legalize teacher- or 
student-led prayer in the classroom. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, a coalition of religious groups delivered a letter 
to Clinton opposing a school prayer amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations, which include Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups, said 
that the proposed constitutional change would weaken separation of church and 
state while drawing unnecessary attention to children who refuse to take part 
in the prayer.

MENTAL EXAM MAY BLOCK RAPIST'S PAROLE IN COVINA; PRISONS: STATE INCREASINGLY 
USES LAST-MINUTE TESTS IN EFFORT TO BYPASS SENTENCING LAW. POLITICAL CLIMATE IS 
A FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Serial rapist Reginald Donald Muldrew has a crucial test coming. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 4, Muldrew -- who is suspected in more than 200 sexual attacks -- is 
scheduled for parole in Covina after spending the last 15 years in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the day he walks out of Pelican Bay State Prison in Northern 
California, he must pass a psychiatric exam. If he fails, he goes back behind 
bars for up to a year of psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the law requires the test. But in this year's charged political 
climate, state officials have begun administering day-of-release psychiatric 
exams to high-profile rapists. The tactic is a sometimes desperate attempt to 
circumvent the state's 1977 determinate sentencing law, which requires specific 
release dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March, five high-profile sexual offenders -- all scheduled to be paroled 
in Southern California -- have had their paroles revoked after failing 
eleventh-hour psychiatric exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although attorneys representing convicts condemn this "psychiatric return" 
tactic as a violation of their clients' rights, corrections officials call it a 
last line of defense. The determinate sentencing law -- passed by the 
Legislature to take away judges' discretion to impose lenient sentences -- also 
had the effect of taking away the authority of the parole board to keep 
dangerous rapists off the streets. The average sex offender in California 
spends less than 3 1/2 years in prison, corrections officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're releasing people who . . . are going to kill people . . . you 
have no recourse or (immediate) way to retain them unless it's under this 
guise" of psychiatric return, said Jerome DiMaggio, regional parole 
administrator for northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other prisoners, convicted rapists serve a set time, with days off for 
good behavior and work credits, and are paroled automatically unless a state 
psychologist or psychiatrist steps in. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina is the latest battleground. On Monday night more than 3,000 Covina-area 
residents protested the scheduled parole of Muldrew, 46, who was convicted on 
six counts of sexual assault in Los Angeles during the 1970s. Police Chief John 
Lentz, who said state officials have notified him that Muldrew is to be paroled 
in Covina, urged residents to register their protests with Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy follows other day-of-release psychiatric exams administered 
to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Christopher Hubbart, 43, a rapist who was scheduled for release to his 
parents' home in Claremont in March. In and out of prison since 1973, Hubbart 
has been linked to nearly three dozen rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Keith Donelson, 48, a child molester who was scheduled for release in 
an unspecified Orange County city in April. He boasted of molesting more than 
150 children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joe Caro Jr., 74, a child molester who was scheduled for release in Downey 
in July. He was to move into a motel within walking distance of two preschools 
and a junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Stanley Lee, 45, a rapist and multiple felon who was scheduled for 
release in San Bernardino in July. He told a prison psychiatrist that he would 
go on a "killing spree" when paroled. In Lee's case, corrections officials went 
one step further by scheduling his psychiatric exam while he was in prison, 
rather than waiting for his release date. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donald Bartsma, 26, a rapist who was scheduled for release in Lancaster in 
April. Bartsma told a prison psychiatrist that he had dreams of raping and 
murdering women. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Steven Fama of the Prison Law Office, an inmates rights nonprofit 
group in San Rafael and co-counsel on a state Supreme Court case challenging 
the psychiatric return procedure, said prisoners have become pawns in a process 
in which rapists "become a potential embarrassment to the people running for 
governor, and get . . . thrown (back in prison)" as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Goya, a deputy regional parole administrator, denied that the system had 
been manipulated in Muldrew's case or the other five. Parole officials weigh 
each case individually, based on the nature and frequency of the offense, and 
the perceived danger to the public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're inferring that there's some sort of pattern, that we're using 
this as a ploy to get people to stay in prison. That's not true," Goya said. 
"On each individual case, they appear to warrant (the psychiatric exam). Should 
we stop doing evaluations because it looks bad? No." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 228 of 90,268 parolees -- a minuscule 0.25% -- qualified for 
psychiatric return to prison. Corrections officials do not know how many of 
those parolees got their psychiatric exams on the day of their release. But in 
each of the state's four parole regions, administrators could cite only a few 
if any last-minute psychiatric tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole administrators began ordering the exams after rediscovering a 
little-known state code that allows psychiatric testing of parolees. The code 
does not specify when parole administrators can order the psychiatric 
evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, officials usually gave parolees a few weeks or months of freedom 
before authorizing an evaluation. In fact, the code requires the evaluator to 
consider the "parolee's adjustment" and "ability to maintain himself or herself 
in the community" -- hardly qualities that can be measured when someone has 
only a few hours of freedom and is never outside the custody of parole agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of freed rapists riveted public attention in March, when Wilson came 
under heavy fire for paroling serial rapist Melvin A. Carter to a prison work 
camp just outside the town of Alturas in the northeast corner of California. 
Carter, who had admitted raping more than 100 women, was paroled March 17 after 
serving half of his 25-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the media spotlight turned south to Claremont, where Hubbart was 
supposed to go home to his 64-year-old mother and 75-year-old stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 In Claremont, a historic college town with no drive-ins or bars, where the 
annual Fourth of July Parade includes a thumb-twiddlers team and lawn mower 
brigade, a fierce protest materialized overnight. Demonstrators waved signs 
outside Hubbart's parents' house such as "Kill the Rapist" and "Lorena Bobbitt, 
Where Are You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several evaluations over the previous year that found little 
justification to hold Hubbart, it took one evaluation to keep Hubbart off the 
streets -- the one on his scheduled parole date. 
</P>
<P>
 Parolees who fail such an exam go back to prison for up to a year of 
psychiatric treatment -- even if the results contradict their previous prison 
evaluations. In Hubbart's case, two evaluators diagnosed a mental disorder, 
while three others said he had none. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal law professor Robert Pugsley of Southwestern University in Los 
Angeles said that because "psychiatry is an art, not a science," doctors 
"should not be brought in at the eleventh hour to provide a veil of 
justification to keep a person in prison because the community is in an 
uproar." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Occhiuzzo Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles Commission 
on Assaults Against Women, argues that a psychiatric exam should not even be 
necessary to keep Hubbart off the streets. "(Freeing) somebody who has 
committed over 30 rapes with no prospects for rehabilitation?" she asked. "This 
is not brain surgery. This is common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart's case was the first in recent memory to trigger a day of release 
psychiatric exam, corrections officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 a.m. on the day of his scheduled release, parole officers picked him up 
at the prison in Chino and drove to the Pomona parole office. A psychiatrist 
evaluated him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Lucero, a deputy regional parole administrator, said the public pressure 
had nothing to do with Hubbart's psychiatric exam. Lucero said the exam had 
been scheduled at least a week ahead of Hubbart's scheduled parole and before a 
local newspaper broke the story of his potential release. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the fact came up that this guy has a really bizarre background . . . (we 
asked): 'Are we sure this guy really does have it together?' This guy's 
extremely dangerous," Lucero said. "We hadn't done (last-minute exams) in the 
past probably . . . because we hadn't thought about it. . . . We're breaking 
new ground."  
</P>
<P>
 A month after Hubbart's near-release, Bartsma's scheduled parole provoked a 
community furor in Lancaster. Bartsma also took -- and failed -- a psychiatric 
exam on the day of his release. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to order Bartsma's psychiatric evaluation was inspired partly by 
the public outcry over Hubbart's near-release and the parole of serial rapist 
Carter, said Rosario Santillan, supervisor of the Antelope Valley state parole 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a high-profile case that went to (the Bay Area) that the public was 
unhappy about. We had the (Hubbart) case down south. We learned from those 
things. (The psychiatric examination) was a tool that we had in our hands, so 
(we thought) let's do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart's lawyer, Rowan K. Klein, has filed a writ with the California Supreme 
Court, challenging the constitutionality of his client's parole revocation and 
contending that the publicity prompted the Corrections Department to take 
extraordinary measures in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The public furor over felons on parole increased late last year with the 
arrest of parolee Richard Allen Davis in the kidnaping and murder of 
12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma. In September, Wilson signed the toughest 
rape law in the nation, the "one strike" bill, which requires up to life in 
prison for first-time violent sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, the state's prisons release 250 rapists, child molesters and other 
sex offenders, most of whom the public never hears about. But this year was 
different, Department of Corrections spokesman Bill Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, (a rapist) would have gone to (a city), moved into a house, his 
mother's house, or a relative or friend, or set up housekeeping himself, and we 
would have not heard of it. . . . I think there's a heightened awareness 
because of the media. This is an election year."

STEEL-FRAME CONSTRUCTION METHODS BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite widespread evidence that construction techniques for steel-frame 
buildings failed during the Northridge earthquake, building owners will be 
allowed to use the same methods to repair the damage, Los Angeles city 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concerns about the high cost to inspect and repair such buildings, a 
city panel recommended that building owners be allowed to devise their own 
inspection and repair plans using current repair methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials defended the decision, saying that current technology kept 
steel-frame buildings from collapsing. They added that government-funded 
studies of quake damage have yet to provide new repair methods. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, engineers were surprised to hear widespread 
reports of cracks in the joints of steel-frame buildings because such frames 
are designed to bend with the enormous force of an earthquake without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers emphasized that no steel-frame buildings came close to collapsing in 
the quake. However, an 11-story Westside structure was evacuated two weeks ago 
after engineers discovered the steel-framed building had been dangerously 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of about 300 steel-frame buildings in the high-damage areas of the 
San Fernando Valley and the Westside will be required to self-inspect steel 
joints within three months of notification by the city, under a recommendation 
approved by the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners will be allowed to use current repair methods, pending a 
case-by-case approval by city inspectors. It will be up to the building owner 
to use higher repair standards to increase the strength of steel joints so they 
can withstand subsequent quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs must be completed within two years of the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection charges alone can range from $10,000 to $60,000 per building. But 
the cost can be cut if building owners devise their own inspection and repair 
plans tailored to their particular facility and the amount of damage suffered, 
said Richard Holguin, assistant chief of the city's building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials had previously suggested a strict set of rules for 
inspecting steel joints and recommended a shorter, one-year time limit for 
owners to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin rejected suggestions that building owners and their engineers might 
take advantage of the liberal guidelines and make only minimal repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A structural engineer who does that would be putting his license on the 
line," he said. "I don't think from a practical standpoint that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Assn., 
representing 1,500 members throughout Los Angeles County, said the proposal 
"made a lot of sense" and echoed Holguin's sentiments that current repair 
methods are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "To repair the buildings to pre-Jan. 17 conditions certainly puts tenants in 
no greater danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who chairs the earthquake recovery committee and 
serves on the state Seismic Safety Commission, supported the building bureau's 
recommendation but said he may propose a uniform repair ordinance once 
engineers devise new techniques and propose new repair guidelines in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results, Holguin said the city may require inspections of the 
remaining 600 steel-frame buildings, including those in Hollywood, Century City 
and Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, state and federal officials have funded studies at USC and UC 
San Diego on the damage to steel-frame buildings in hopes of providing new 
repair guidelines to withstand larger quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawn Nelson, president of the Structural Engineers Assn. of California, said 
the studies should result in some interim repair guidelines to be published 
next month. But he said final recommendations will not be published until 
February, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is . . . trying to gather more test results from what happened 
in the Northridge quake so we can make recommendations based on fact, not 
theory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and other industry engineers said the city's decision to require 
inspections and repairs before final repair guidelines are proposed is 
reasonable, considering the alternative is to do nothing or impose guidelines 
that are not yet proven. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot of open issues, so people just have to use their best 
judgment and proceed," said Nestor Iwankiw, director of research for the 
American Institute of Steel Construction Inc.

JUANENO FEUD MAY HURT FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION; NATIVE AMERICANS: THE GROUP HAS 
SPLIT INTO FACTIONS UNDER TWO RIVAL LEADERS. MISSION INDIANS ARE ABOUT TO BE 
EVALUATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR TRIBAL STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing rift among the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians is threatening to 
split them into factions and imperil their long-sought goal of establishing 
their own sovereign government as a federally recognized tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Southland's oldest Native American groups, the Juanenos have fought 
for federal recognition for decades. Representatives of the U.S. Bureau of 
Indian Affairs are scheduled to visit early next year in what is believed to be 
one of the last steps in granting recognition to the tribe of 2,000 members 
scattered across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials may find a people in disarray, as evidenced by a recent lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute is David Belardes, who was elected to lead the 
tribe in the 1980s but was recently ousted in a vote of the general council. 
Head of the rival faction is Sonia Johnston, who says Belardes has consistently 
exceeded his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, 47, has refused to step down, and now he and Johnston are 
controlling separate factions. Belardes hired a security guard to ban members 
of the rival faction from a recent meeting at Mission San Juan Capistrano and 
is seeking an injunction in Superior Court to re-establish his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Fullerton is expected to rule on the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sonia Johnston wants my job," Belardes said last week. "She's been around 
before, and when she hasn't gotten her way, she's come and gone. I guess this 
is her last hurrah." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said Belardes was removed from his post as far back as March, 1993, 
but continues to represent the Juanenos -- before the bureau, the state of 
California, various city councils and the media -- "because he chooses to. And 
under the 1st Amendment, who can stop him?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a further attempt to lobby the government, Belardes met with President 
Clinton at a special White House reception Oct. 29. But his authority, Johnston 
said, extends only as far as that of any member of the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's entitled to his say, but you don't lock people out -- that's 
unconstitutional," she said, referring to the meeting at the mission. "A good 
leader just doesn't do that. Our wish is to keep our people together. But if 
bylaws aren't being protected, what choice do we have? We have to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he was appointed head of the three-member tribal council, the 
Juanenos' governing body, in April, 1993. But Johnston said it was "only a 
voice vote" and thus not binding under the terms of Indian law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was duly elected," Belardes said. "Voice vote or no." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said the general council later declared the tribal council 
nonexistent and at a meeting last month appointed her interim spokeswoman, 
pending new elections Dec. 17. It was earlier this month that Belardes barred 
her and others with the help of a security force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will hold the role of tribal spokeswoman until our elections are completed 
in December and new tribal officers put in place," Johnston said. "David has 
been nominated (to the soon-to-be-named tribal council) and could get elected 
-- if, that is, he accepts the appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Velasquez, tribal chieftain of the coastal Gabrielinos, who also are 
seeking federal recognition, said the vote against Belardes appears to be 
binding under the terms of Indian law. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they submitted their application to the federal government for federal 
recognition, they submitted their tribal constitution and bylaws," Velasquez 
said. "And if elections are not held according to that constitution, then 
that's an attempt to defraud the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, David should not be the tribal chairman because the general 
council voted him out. They're a valid council -- they're a quorum of 25 
people, with one-eighth or more Indian blood, and they lawfully defeated 
David." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition would grant the Juanenos their own sovereign government, giving 
them the right to establish their own schools and courts. It could greatly 
enhance their possibilities for expanded health care and job possibilities, 
while opening the door to owning Orange County's first Indian-run casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said ownership of a casino -- and the vast potential profits it 
promises -- are at the root of the Juanenos' dispute and the reason Native 
American groups in Los Angeles and Orange counties "appear to be in a race" for 
federal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes disagrees, saying "the cons outweigh the pros when it comes to 
casinos -- I don't know if it's worth compromising our peace of mind to get 
involved in something like that. If it's for the benefit of the tribe, well, 
certainly, we should consider it. We're looking at federal recognition, and 
beyond that, at nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Johnston said she believes the lack of unity constitutes "no 
splinter group -- no split" and will, in fact, have no bearing on recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You occasionally have problems in your family, but does that destroy your 
family?" she asked. "The U.S. government has internal problems and conflicts, 
but does that destroy its ability to self-govern, or mean it shouldn't be 
recognized? No way." 
</P>
<P>
 But other members of the Southland's Indian communities see the controversy in 
more damaging terms. Velasquez said that had the rift not developed the 
Juanenos were almost certain to be recognized, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they would risk federal recognition over such a silly 
dispute," he said. "They've fought for recognition for so long, and they really 
deserve it. Why ruin it now?" 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington declined comment 
on the dispute, noting, however, that the Juanenos are due to be placed on a 
list of candidates under "active consideration" for recognition sometime in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've completed all of their paperwork and are ready for the next step," 
said the bureau's Alicia Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-site visit to tribal headquarters takes place during "active 
consideration," and in the Juanenos' case, Sandoval said, the visit should be 
completed by summer.

LAWMAKER'S WIFE NAMED TO BOARD; POLITICS: SPEAKER BROWN APPOINTS SPOUSE OF 
LAME-DUCK ASSEMBLYMAN MIKE GOTCH TO WASTE MANAGEMENT PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown handed out one of his juiciest plums Tuesday, 
naming the wife of a lame-duck Democratic assemblyman from San Diego to a 
$95,403-per-year post on a little-known board responsible for handling garbage 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is a likely lame duck himself, given that Democrats apparently lost 
control of the lower house in the Nov. 8 election. With Republicans holding a 
41-39 majority in the Assembly, Brown stands to lose the speakership after 14 
years Dec. 5 when the new Legislature is seated. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two weeks before the Republicans take control of the lower 
house and a new Speaker is elected, Brown named Janet Lee Gotch, wife of 
outgoing Assemblyman Mike Gotch, to the state Integrated Waste Management 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued by Brown's office gave no indication that Janet Lee Gotch 
has any background in waste management. She is retail manager of Freemark Abbey 
Wines in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, and attended Monterey Peninsula 
College and Mesa College, both of which are junior colleges. She declined to 
discuss the appointment with The Times when she was reached at the winery. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Brown) feels she brings something to the table as it relates to the areas 
that the board deals with," said Darolyn Davis, Brown's press aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-member Integrated Waste Management Board is one of the few boards in 
state government that pays members more than $90,000 a year. Created while 
George Deukmejian was governor, it is responsible for substantially reducing 
the amount of garbage generated in California. The board also has control over 
the location of new garbage dumps. The governor and Senate Rules Committee make 
other appointments to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assemblyman Gotch was first elected to the Assembly from San Diego 
in 1990. A month after he was elected to his second term in 1992, Gotch rented 
out his house in San Diego and moved to the Napa Valley, where he bought a home 
and now resides. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Gotch was criticized for living 500 miles from the voters who 
elected him, and decided not to seek reelection for a third term this year. He 
did not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lee Gotch's appointment requires no confirmation and lasts until Jan. 1, 
1998. The appointment came as a surprise because Gotch, who had little impact 
in the Assembly, was not among Brown's close allies. Brown had been rumored to 
be considering the appointment of outgoing Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles) to the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been Speaker too long to give up the reins quickly," said Ruth Holton 
of Common Cause of California. "As long as he is in charge, he is going to 
continue to dispense such favors." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the governor, the Speaker makes relatively few appointments that pay 
salaries. But as Speaker, Brown has made a practice of giving his half a dozen 
paying jobs to his legislative allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown appointees have included former San Francisco Mayor and Assemblyman Art 
Agnos, former Assemblywoman Sally Tanner of El Monte, former Assemblyman Tom 
Bane of the San Fernando Valley, and former Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lee Gotch will replace Kathy Neal on the board. Neal is a businesswoman 
with a master's degree in public administration who also is wife of Oakland 
Mayor Elihu Harris, a former Democratic assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Harris and Neal were partners in the ownership of Oakland radio station 
KDIA. They recently sold the station to Bay Area entrepreneur James Gabbert for 
$3 million, almost double what they paid for it two years ago.

AIR BOARD CHIEF GETS NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, denied confirmation by 
Democrats in the Senate, stepped down Tuesday but was appointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson to a newly created post where she will retain considerable influence 
over state air pollution policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new role as "communications adviser" to the Air Resources Board, 
Jacqueline Schafer will serve as its main spokeswoman for the media and will 
help the board develop state air pollution regulations and programs by 
conferring with industry groups, the public and the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh said the position, which will pay $82,092 a year, 
was crafted specifically for Schafer because the governor wants her to remain 
in a key role to guide the state's air policies, which are increasingly 
contentious and far-reaching as California struggles to achieve federal clean 
air standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer, named by Wilson to chair the air board a year ago, was forced to 
resign because the state Senate Rules Committee, entrenched in election-year 
wrangling with Wilson, refused to confirm her post this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Schafer "an outstanding chair of the ARB," Wilson said in a statement 
that she will be "continuing to play a major role in the development of air 
quality policy in this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has not decided on a replacement to chair the influential board. 
Unlike the air resources board's former press secretary, who reported to the 
agency's executive officer, Schafer will report directly to the board's 
chairperson, which gives her more independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Wilson ousted longtime air board Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless, 
largely over a conflict with the trucking industry over state rules requiring 
cleaner-burning diesel fuel. Wilson then appointed Schafer, who had served in 
the George Bush Administration as an assistant secretary of the Navy and as a 
member of the Ronald Reagan Administration's White House Council on 
Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Schafer's appointment, California environmentalists and air quality 
officials have complained that the air board, known for two decades of 
independence and stringent standards for vehicles and fuels, has been bowing to 
influence from Wilson's office and granting concessions to the industries it 
regulates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jackee Shafer is an instrument of the governor's policy," said Cliff 
Gladstein, president of the Coalition for Clean Air. "She represents what 
(Wilson) asks her to represent and the responsibility for the bad (state clean 
air plan) must fall squarely on the shoulders of the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who played a pivotal role in blocking Senate 
approval of Schafer, said moving her from the top leadership position to a 
lesser post "means that the status quo will continue. This is not an argument 
over simply replacing one person with another, but a larger concern that the 
agency has become less independent and cozier with polluting industries." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave Titus of the California Trucking Assn., which represents 2,600 truck 
companies, said Schafer has "brought some common sense ideas to the 
environmental arena." 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept lines of communication open between all parties. Compared to the 
previous administration (under Sharpless), which was 110% adversarial, this was 
a big, big help to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said the governor was especially pleased with Schafer's oversight of the 
state's new smog plan, which the air board adopted last week after more than 20 
hours of public debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board succeeded in meeting a Nov. 15 deadline set by Congress, making 
California the only state in the nation that was able to complete its smog plan 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's most controversial aspect is a massive automobile and truck 
scrapping program suggested by the oil industry. Under the plan, 75,000 old 
cars in the four-county Los Angeles Basin would be bought each year for $1,000 
each and destroyed. Environmentalists and Southern California air quality 
officials say the air board set unreasonable expectations for how many old cars 
and trucks can be removed from the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, California's major environmental groups, except the Sierra Club, 
endorsed Schafer's appointment.

YOUTH DIES AS MEDICAL TREATMENT IS DELAYED; HEALTH CARE: PARENTS SAY THEY 
FEARED BEING REPORTED IF THEY WENT TO HOSPITAL. LATINO ACTIVISTS SAY THEY 
REGARD THE BOY AS A VICTIM OF PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino community leaders Tuesday cited the death of a 12-year-old Anaheim boy 
as the first casualty of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cano, a seventh-grader at Sycamore Junior High School in Anaheim, died 
after his illegal-immigrant parents delayed seeking medical treatment -- out of 
fear, the parents said, that a hospital would report them to immigration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for Proposition 187, the first day he felt sick we would have 
taken him to the hospital," his father, Constantino, who has a different last 
name than his son and asked that it not be used because of his immigration 
status, said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "This law, it won't give any medical attention, not even to kids, only if they 
are in a coma or something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 allows for emergency health care, but denies illegal 
immigrants other health services, along with public education and social 
services. It requires that health care workers report suspected illegal 
immigrants to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Coffey, head of a group that worked for passage of Proposition 187, said 
Tuesday that the Anaheim family's story is not believable. "I don't care what 
language they speak," she said. "Everybody knows this is not in effect yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Most provisions of the law have not been enforced, under court order, but many 
illegal immigrants are unaware of that, Latino activists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio fell ill early last week, complaining of a cough that sent pain shooting 
down his back. But his father said he and his wife were afraid to go to a 
hospital and postponed seeking help until they could raise the $60 to take 
Julio to a private doctor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday morning, Julio was dead of unknown causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy results are pending, and it was unknown Tuesday whether the boy's 
death could have been prevented if his family had sought free medical attention 
earlier at a government clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino activists say Julio's case highlights the extent of fear and 
misinformation swirling through the immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
 "For goodness sakes, this is a case that should never have happened," said 
Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, which focuses on Latino 
community issues. "The victims of Prop. 187 are preponderantly children, and 
here it is." 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, an official with the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund in Orange County, said that while his organization is still 
gathering information about the case, he believes that Proposition 187 is 
keeping people away from medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing is clear. . . . People are not sure whether or not to go to a 
hospital or community health clinic because of the passage of Proposition 187," 
Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the family's one-bedroom apartment Tuesday, Julio's mother, Rosa, sobbed as 
she cradled her 1-month-old baby and welcomed a stream of visitors, including 
the boy's art teacher and the principal at his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio was a shy, bright boy who wanted to be a lawyer, picked up English 
quickly and tutored other recent arrivals who spoke only Spanish, said Sycamore 
Principal Pat Savage. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff and students at the school collected $800 for the family Tuesday. 
Anaheim firefighters had raised $600 for the family, and several churches have 
begun fund-raising efforts. Constantino said the family does not have the money 
to claim Julio's body from the morgue, let alone pay the $2,800 costs of 
burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the students were devastated. He was good friends with so many of 
them," Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage said that Julio was out sick last week. On Wednesday, he came to school 
for about three hours and complained of feeling ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to a health clerk (at the school) twice, but he had no fever at all," 
Savage said. "He would not tell anybody what was wrong because he knew that his 
parents didn't have the money to take him to the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino and Rosa moved to Orange County from Acapulco four years ago. 
Julio and the couple's older children, ages 13 and 11, were born in Mexico and 
joined their parents here three years ago. They are all undocumented, 
Constantino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's younger children, ages 1 month and 1 year, were born in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the passage of Proposition 187, the couple was unsure where to 
seek medical care, they said. The older children carry Medi-Cal cards ensuring 
only emergency and pregnancy-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino and his wife said that a daughter had been denied care at a Garden 
Grove Hospital once because her condition was not deemed an emergency, and Rosa 
said she once went to the UC Irvine Medical Center seeking a free pregnancy 
test and was turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two babies here who were born here. If they deport us, what would the 
smaller children do without us?" Constantino said. "We were worried they would 
ask us for our documents." 
</P>
<P>
 The father said he waited until Friday to take his son to the doctor because 
that is payday at the factory where he works. They went to the Family Medical 
Clinic, a private facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said her son's condition worsened quickly after his visit to the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gutierrez, an Anaheim Fire Department captain and paramedic, said Julio 
was not breathing and his heart was not beating when his team arrived at the 
family's home Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 After paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive him, the youngster was 
transported to Anaheim Memorial Hospital where further attempts at 
resuscitation failed.

WOMAN, 100, SETTLES SUIT AGAINST INSURANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 100-year-old woman who said she was shortchanged by her insurance company 
after her home burned down has settled her lawsuit out of court, both sides 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the settlement between Anne Campbell Smith and Colonial Penn 
Insurance Co. were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Penn attorney Terry Rowland said the company agreed to the settlement 
rather than face the negative publicity of defending itself against the 
centenarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not settle for any weakness in the case," he said. "The case could not 
have been going any better for us. But the adverse consequences of having the 
media there made the trial, the reality of this case, almost irrelevant, almost 
secondary. The company didn't look forward to more publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had sued Colonial Penn in San Bernardino Superior Court for allegedly 
refusing to make fully good on her insurance policy when her 77-year-old Upland 
home burned to the ground in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and her 80-year-old son, Stuart Campbell, had sued Colonial Penn 
unsuccessfully in several other courts before they finally went to trial in 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith was scheduled to testify on her own behalf last week, a publicist 
for her attorney put the word out, and the media showed up. Smith gave charming 
courtroom interviews while Rowland could only stand by. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of her taking the witness stand, the case moved to the judge's 
chambers for settlement talks. On Tuesday, the court announced the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 So what plans are in store for Smith, who turned 100 on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 "She could build a new home now, but she'll more likely use the money to buy a 
home," Bill Shernoff said. "It's faster." 
</P>
<P>
 But the home won't be just for his client, Shernoff said. "She'd like to have 
some elderly people live with her, for her to take care of. She's been living 
in a retirement home, and worried about people who can't take care of 
themselves, who can't see or hear well and who get lost in the hallways. She 
wants to help them."

FALSELY IMPRISONED MAN CONVICTED IN NEW CASE; CRIME: FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, BENNY GENE POWELL FACES A SENTENCE OF UP TO 52 YEARS. HE WON $3.5 
MILLION AFTER WRONGLY SERVING 17 YEARS IN PRISON.

<P>
 Benny Gene Powell, whose 17 years of wrongful imprisonment won him $3.5 
million last year, was convicted this week of sexually assaulting a UCLA 
student and faces returning to prison for up to 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, 47, was convicted by a Riverside County Superior Court jury in 
connection with the May, 1993, assault of a 35-year-old German student in a 
motel room in Beaumont, near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault came 13 months after Powell and his close friend, Clarence Chance, 
were released from prison after each had served 17 years of a life prison term 
for the 1973 murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David Andrews. The 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office conceded in 1992 that the pair 
had been wrongfully convicted, based partly on false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, the city of Los Angeles awarded each man $3.5 million as 
compensation for their 17 years behind bars. Two months later, Powell 
contemplated the metamorphosis from ex-con to millionaire as he sipped a 
cocktail: "I feel like, how am I going to get adjusted to this?" 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, the UCLA student told authorities that she and Powell drove to 
Beaumont, where he raped and sodomized her. Powell was arrested two months 
later in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz., where he had purchased a two-story 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently drawing on his false-imprisonment award, Powell posted $1-million 
bail after his arrest and was released late last year. While out of jail, he 
allegedly raped and sexually assaulted a Vallejo, Calif., woman, Riverside 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Todd Rash said. Trial on those charges was scheduled 
to begin after the first trial ended, Rash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell faced 27 felony counts in the Beaumont assault. After a four-week 
trial, the jury convicted him Monday of four counts of oral copulation, one 
count of attempted sodomy and two counts of penetration with a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of convicting him on one rape count 
and six lesser counts and acquitted him on 13 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Powell's attorney portrayed the victim as a gold digger 
hoping to get some of Powell's riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Rash characterized Powell as "a very dangerous criminal who can . . . be 
charismatic and charming and can easily lure people into trusting him, then 
turn very violent, very vicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone in Scottsdale, Powell's mother, Elmira Keaton, said she 
was "as sick as I can be" about his conviction. "They're putting him back in 
prison like they said they were going to because they said he didn't deserve to 
be out. It's a conspiracy to get him back in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell will be sentenced Dec. 19 by Riverside County Superior Court Judge 
Edward Webster. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 52 years.

RUSSIAN GENERAL, IN CORRUPTION TRIAL, SAYS HE OBEYED ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In what the defendant complained was a show trial meant to squelch claims of 
unchecked corruption in the Russian military, a prominent air force general 
came before the Supreme Court on Tuesday facing charges of embezzlement and 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Nikolai Seliverstov, 49, was the highest-ranking officer yet brought 
to trial for alleged involvement in the shady dealings that were reportedly 
widespread among the Western Group of Forces that served in Germany. The 
Russian troops completed their withdrawal in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the investigation began in 1992, Seliverstov's trial came at a time 
when the Russian military particularly needed to demonstrate that it can police 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been picked as a scapegoat," Seliverstov declared to reporters during 
a break in the proceedings. "I categorically reject all the false charges and 
allegations against me." 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian reporter, Dmitry Kholodov, who specialized in digging up dirt on the 
troops in Germany, was killed last month by an exploding briefcase. Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin, saying he needed to preserve the honor of the army, 
later dumped the former commander of the Western Group of Forces from his new 
post as deputy defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Public attacks on the Russian military climaxed in Parliament on Friday, when 
beleaguered Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev was forced to answer lawmakers' 
pointed questions for hours. Fortunately for Grachev, Parliament does not have 
the constitutional power to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
 Seliverstov, speaking to reporters, worried that "the timing of this case is 
not beneficial to me," coming so soon after Kholodov's death. Prosecutors said 
Tuesday that they had arrested a suspect in the case, but it has yet to be 
declared solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Seliverstov's trial could, however, benefit the army. Beginning his defense on 
Tuesday, Seliverstov offered an unusually sympathetic glimpse of the 
under-the-table life among the cash-strapped Russian officers in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the court that, in 1991, the Defense Ministry issued a directive 
saying that "we had to earn money to support ourselves -- not defend the 
motherland as a priority. . . . If there had been no such order, there would 
have been no money made, and hence, there would be no court proceedings against 
me today." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and 1992, Seliverstov said, he helped pull in $1 million through air 
exhibitions, the sale of equipment and transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make ends meet, Seliverstov agreed to arrange several cargo flights of 
humanitarian aid to Kazakhstan for some German priests. The indictment said he 
allegedly took not only tens of thousands of dollars for the flights but 
$13,000 in bribes for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively measly sum fueled Seliverstov's complaints that he had been 
singled out for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't there any instances of corruption in places other than (the Western 
Group of Forces?)" he demanded. "And on a far greater scale, too! . . . To lay 
the emphasis on the fact that this is the biggest (case of corruption) is 
simply dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
 No one would dispute that Seliverstov's alleged take was small, especially 
considering that he now faces up to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that despite German descriptions of Russian under-the-table 
dealings and even an investigation by Russia's former top corruption fighter, 
little else has been pinned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Military prosecutors say that only nine Western Group soldiers have been 
convicted for theft and corruption since 1992, among them two colonels, a 
captain and a major. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian press, especially since Kholodov's death, has carried 
allegations of army supplies sold illegally to dealers, stolen weapons making 
their way to world markets and military money slipping into secret personal 
accounts abroad. 
</P>

AFTER RUMORS, BERLUSCONI LEARNS HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION; ITALY: THE 
BELEAGUERED PREMIER IS ACCUSED OF BRIBING TAX POLICE BEFORE ENTERING POLITICS. 
FOES CALL ON HIM TO RESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After months of rumors, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi learned from 
a newspaper Tuesday that he is under investigation for allegedly having bribed 
tax police before he entered politics. Formal word came as the beleaguered 
billionaire presided over an international conference here on ways to combat 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial notice does not imply guilt, but it does spell embarrassment. 
Whether the timing was contrived or simply ironic, it dealt a fresh blow to 
Berlusconi's sagging political fortunes -- and to public confidence in his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-wing opponents called for his resignation. Berlusconi said in a 
nationwide broadcast Tuesday night that he is innocent and will not quit. "I 
will not resign. This country needs stability . . . a government that governs 
seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the flux, the Italian stock market fell 2.8% Tuesday, while the lira eased 
against the dollar and slumped briefly to historic lows against the German 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 As 800 delegates from 136 nations at a seaside palace here debated how to 
clean up criminal money-laundering, Berlusconi, president of the U.N. crime 
conference, told reporters that he is untroubled by the corruption inquiry in 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never corrupted anyone. I have nothing to fear," he said in the taped 
broadcast. He called on magistrates to concern themselves "with justice, not 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi aides were outraged that news of the probe had been apparently 
leaked from the magistrates' office to the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera, 
whose exclusive Tuesday morning stole the thunder from conference 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extremely grave," said Antonio Tajani, spokesman for Forza Italia, the 
political movement Berlusconi heads. Tajani called it an attempt to influence 
voters before the Dec. 4 second round of municipal elections in more than 200 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forza Italia, which stormed to national power in the spring, fared poorly in 
first-round voting Sunday among Italians distressed by Berlusconi's austerity 
budget for 1995, which would trim pensions and health and social benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 What concerns the Milan magistrates are bribes paid to tax inspectors by two 
of the many companies within Berlusconi's vast Fininvest business empire, a 
network of publishing, advertising, real estate and insurance companies, 
supermarkets and three national television channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, who insists -- despite the cost to his popularity -- that 
government debt and deficit must be reduced, belittled the Milan probe as "a 
six-month-long affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Corriere said one payment of about $80,000 was made in 1991 to a general, a 
lieutenant colonel and a warrant officer in the Guardia di Finanza during 
inspection of company books at Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, the country's largest 
publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's brother Paolo and the head tax officer for Fininvest, Salvatore 
Sciascia, acknowledged making the payoff in testimony to the investigating 
magistrates in July. They claimed that the issue was not corruption but 
extortion; payment was demanded under threat of disruption and possible 
economic paralysis of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The second incident, in 1992, Corriere said, involved Paolo Berlusconi, 
Sciascia and two other Fininvest managers, who paid about $60,000 to two 
brigadiers, a lieutenant colonel and two warrant officers in return for their 
approval of accounts at the insurance company Mediolanum Vita. Once again the 
managers allege extortion by the tax police. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi echoes their accusation. He says the tax police took an 
extraordinary interest in Fininvest companies almost from the moment he 
declared himself a political candidate. One team of inspectors marched into the 
new Forza Italia headquarters in downtown Rome a few days before the election 
that brought Berlusconi to power. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly three years, judges in Milan and other major cities have been 
investigating endemic corruption in which Italian businesses large and small 
routinely paid off politicians and government officials in return for favors or 
government contracts. It was business and politics all'italiana; everybody 
knew, including voters whose exasperation finally overturned the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, a 58-year-old self-made man, owns Fininvest, which did $7 billion 
in business last year. As more than 3,000 prominent political and business 
figures have been implicated in the still-expanding judicial inquiries, there 
have been rumors that Berlusconi's name was bound to come up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he is a beneficiary of the political vacuum created by the 
corruption inquiry, which decimated Italy's Establishment political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 When it seemed that the political left led by former communists would win 
national elections in March, Berlusconi created his free-market Forza Italia 
movement to counter it, modeling the party organization after fan clubs for his 
A.C. Milan soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 He won resounding electoral victory and formed a government in May in 
right-wing alliance with northern federalists and neo-fascists. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been tough sledding ever since, amid internal squabbles and growing 
popular antagonism to his economic measures. The disputed budget, which drew 
more than 1 million protesters to Roman streets earlier this month, is now 
before the Senate. A national general strike is scheduled for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, who went to Rome on Tuesday night to greet visiting Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, returns here today for the final meeting of a 
conference he hopes will agree to establish an international anti-crime academy 
in Italy.

CLINTON LAUDS UKRAINE LEADER, VOWS TO BOOST AID; DIPLOMACY: $900-MILLION 
PACKAGE WOULD PUT KIEV IN 4TH PLACE ON U.S. ASSISTANCE LIST. MONEY EARMARKED 
FOR HELPING DISMANTLE NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 
</P>

 Praising President Leonid D. Kuchma as a post-Soviet Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
President Clinton on Tuesday promised to add $200 million to the U.S. aid 
program for Ukraine to help pay for the dismantling of the world's 
third-largest nuclear arsenal and to prop up the nation's sagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the incoming Republican-dominated Congress, the additional 
money will increase total U.S. aid to Ukraine to about $900 million over two 
years, placing the France-sized country fourth on the list of aid recipients, 
behind Israel, Egypt and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is so important to complete the work of denuclearization, (and) 
we think your long-term economic development, your commitment to democracy and 
to an open economy is so important that we want to be there over the long run," 
Clinton told Kuchma during a joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton and Kuchma were meeting in the White House, Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin won assurances on Capitol Hill that the new Congress 
will spare Israel's $3-billion annual aid allocation from its budget-cutting 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 The coincident appearances of Kuchma and Rabin seemed to suggest that it will 
be extremely difficult for congressional Republicans, no matter how determined 
to slash foreign aid in the abstract, to put the ax to particular recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no doubt that Ukraine needs the money. With a population of 52 
million, Ukraine is the second-most-populous nation carved out of the Soviet 
Union. It is also one of the most economically depressed. Recent efforts to 
introduce private enterprise into the economy so far have only added to the 
distress of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 About $350 million of the two-year aid package for Ukraine is intended to 
reimburse the Kiev government for the cost of dismantling the potent arsenal of 
nuclear weapons that it inherited from the defunct Soviet Union. Most of the 
rest is designed to keep the economic reforms from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 After hesitating for more than two years, the Ukrainian Parliament agreed last 
week to renounce its right to possess nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for Ukraine's ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, the United States, Britain and Russia assured Kiev of their assistance 
should the nation be threatened by a nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since his election just five months ago, President Kuchma has bravely and 
squarely confronted the two greatest challenges facing Ukraine -- economic 
reform and the nuclear question," Clinton said. "He has taken hard, practical 
steps required to secure a more peaceful and prosperous future for his people." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, during a welcoming ceremony, Clinton told Kuchma that he "reminds us 
of one of our greatest leaders, Franklin Roosevelt, who provided leadership in 
a time of great hardship in the United States. Like him, you inherited a nation 
in the throes of economic depression, and like him, you have lighted the 
darkness and created hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma said that, despite its current economic distress, Ukraine is not 
basically a poor country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a young country, and an inexperienced one," he said. "That is why we 
are ready to learn in the sphere of economics, politics, humanism on the best 
examples of other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Kuchma signed agreements calling for future cooperation between 
the two countries and authorizing joint peacetime space programs. Lower-ranking 
officials signed other agreements to encourage private investment in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who met Clinton on Monday, spent Tuesday on Capitol Hill meeting with 
key lawmakers from both parties. Summing up his meetings, he said he is 
"confident the United States will continue to assist Israel at the same level" 
as it has in the past. News Conference Text

Leonid D. Kuchma is available on the TimesLink on-line service.

POLITICS; GOP'S 10-POINT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Ross, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican agenda in the next Congress, laid out by more than 300 House 
candidates in their pre-election "Contract with America," promises sweeping tax 
and social reforms in the first 100 days of the new legislative session 
starting in January. But not all Republicans support all the provisions in the 
10-point contract, which Democrats have attacked as an "extremist" attempt to 
take this country back to the supply-side economics of the Reagan era. Here is 
a point-by-point look at the contract, along with some perspective on the 
legislative prospects: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Balanced budget: A constitutional amendment to require the federal budget 
to be balanced by 2002 or within seven years of enactment, whichever comes 
later. The amendment also would require a three-fifths vote in the House and 
Senate to approve any future tax increases and allow the balanced-budget 
requirement to be waived in times of war or by three-fifths vote by both houses 
of Congress. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the President would also 
receive the line-item veto -- the authority to veto individual items in a 
spending bill without rejecting the whole measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Likely to pass. Attempts to pass a balanced-budget amendment failed 
narrowly in the last Congress, and the large influx of new Republicans is 
likely to tip the balance in favor of passage by the required two-thirds 
majority. President Clinton has opposed it, but his veto authority does not 
extend to constitutional amendments. However, it would still have to be 
ratified by three-fourths of the states. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Crime control: Republicans opposed much of the social spending and gun 
control provisions in the Democratic crime bill that passed by narrow margins 
earlier this year. Starting in January, they plan to amend it with the 
so-called Taking Back Our Streets Act, an anti-crime package that would add new 
mandatory minimum sentences, toughen the death penalty provisions and put more 
money into prison construction by stripping funds for crime prevention 
programs, like midnight basketball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Democrats will oppose many of the provisions but may not have the 
votes to block them because of the public outcry over crime. Clinton could veto 
any extensive rewrite of his crime bill, but congressional sources say it is 
unclear if the White House will pick this issue on which to confront the new 
Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Welfare reform: The GOP's Personal Responsibility Act would ban welfare 
benefits to unwed mothers younger than 18 as a means of discouraging 
out-of-wedlock births and teen-age pregnancy. It would also cut off assistance 
after two years to families covered under the main federal-state welfare 
program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and require welfare 
recipients to report the identity of a child's father before receiving 
benefits. The growth of other programs would be capped. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Cloudy at best. While some type of welfare reform seems inevitable 
next year, Republican moderates in the House and Senate may join Democrats in 
opposing some of the GOP proposals as too Draconian. Several committees will 
weigh into the debate and, in the end, look for something between the GOP bill 
and Clinton's proposal to require young mothers to work after two years of 
receiving AFDC. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Education and children: A hodgepodge of "family values" provisions, the 
Family Reinforcement Act would establish school voucher programs, set up a 
nationwide tracking system to find parents who fail to make child support 
payments, strengthen child pornography laws and provide a tax credit for people 
who care for elderly relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Most of the provisions are likely to pass, but school vouchers to 
give parents the choice of sending their children to public or private schools 
may run into obstacles from some Republicans as well as Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Middle-class tax cut: The Republican version would establish a 
$500-per-child tax credit for families earning under $200,000 per year, create 
another tax credit to offset the so-called marriage penalty and allow 
individuals to open IRA accounts bearing tax-free interest upon withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Some form of middle-class tax cut is clearly in the offing, but 
specific contract proposals are expected to come under scrutiny by budget 
deficit hawks in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 6) National security: The proposal calls for increased defense spending and 
legislation to prohibit U.S. troops from serving under United Nations or other 
foreign command. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Rough sledding. The prohibition on the foreign command of U.S. troops 
enjoys widespread support, but Republicans on the Armed Services committees are 
expected to object, agreeing with the Administration that it infringes on the 
President's powers as commander in chief. Deficit hawks also note that the 
contract does not say how Republicans would pay for higher defense spending 
without ballooning the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Senior citizens: Several tax cuts are proposed for senior citizens, along 
with raising the Social Security earnings limit and helping the elderly pay for 
long-term care by allowing them to make tax-free withdrawals from IRAs or 
401(k) accounts to pay for long-term care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Some kind of tax relief for seniors appears likely but, again, the 
specific proposals are likely to run into opposition from Democrats and some 
Senate Republicans because of their weight on the budget burden. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Capital gains tax cut: The GOP proposes to halve the capital gains tax and 
adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, thus reducing the taxable 
capital gain at the time of sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Unclear. Republicans in both the House and Senate support a capital 
gains tax cut, but Democrats deride the proposal, which could raise the deficit 
by $56 billion over five years, as a break for the wealthy. The White House 
strongly opposes it, and small business groups are also skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Legal reform: Tort reform to set limits on punitive damages in product 
liability and medical malpractice lawsuits is proposed, as well as a "loser 
pays" provision to allow judges to order the losers in lawsuits to pay the 
other side's legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Dicey. Efforts to discourage runaway litigation and protect the 
health industry in particular from exorbitant costs are popular, but these 
specific provisions will have the nation's trial lawyers and consumer groups 
lined up against them. Democrats also argue that the "loser pays" proposal 
would discourage all but the very wealthy from going to court. If it passes, a 
Clinton veto is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 10) Congressional term limits: A constitutional amendment to limit federal 
lawmakers' terms of office to 12 years, or two terms, in the Senate and six to 
12 years in the House, depending on which version is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Don't hold your breath. Term limits are extremely popular with 
voters, making them difficult to vote against, even though most lawmakers 
loathe them. But passage is still considered uncertain in the House and 
doubtful in the Senate, especially in view of the two-thirds majority 
requirement for amendments. Michael Ross, Times Staff Writer

 A Bosnian who fled to Denmark as a refugee was found guilty Tuesday of 
torturing fellow Muslims to death in a POW camp in his homeland and given eight 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Copenhagen regional court's verdict was the first in a series of war 
crimes trials being held outside the former Yugoslav federation.

 The United States renewed consultations with key allies Tuesday over possible

 Clinton Administration officials said the United States is again pressing the 
United Nations to call in more warplanes from the 16-country North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization to prevent the fall of Bihac in the face of the intensified 
Serbian onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Washington was said to be renewing its push to get NATO to 
declare Bihac an "exclusion zone." The designation would prohibit the Serbs 
from using tanks and artillery in the area and would authorize air strikes 
against violators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian attacks on Bihac underscored the difficulty for the Administration 
and its major European partners in the face of a continuing split among the 
allies, and between the United Nations and NATO, over how to handle the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Monday's NATO air strike against a Serbian-held airfield in Croatia, 
Serbian forces continued to press in on Bihac, engaging in hand-to-hand combat 
with Bosnian government troops and setting villages on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, angrily denouncing NATO as "a criminal 
organization," threatened to retaliate against U.N. and NATO forces in a way 
that "will hurt every member" of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials described the situation in Bihac as "growing more desperate by 
the minute," with Serbian rebels mounting a three-pronged pincers movement that 
sent hundreds of refugees streaming out of the enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic called in U.S. Ambassador 
Victor Jackovic in Sarajevo late Tuesday to express "very deep concern" about 
the possibility that Bihac might fall, providing a major setback for Western 
peacemaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed Serbian attacks appeared intended to call the West's hand 
following Monday's NATO air strike on the Serbian-held airfield at Udbina. 
Damage from the raid was modest. The NATO armada of 30 warplanes blew five 
craters in the airstrip's main runways. But Western officials said the raid was 
designed to "send a signal" that the United Nations would not tolerate the 
Serbian offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all their obvious embarrassment in the face of the new Serbian 
attacks, it was not immediately clear what the allies would do to prevent the 
fall of Bihac or to ward off any further Serbian retaliation against U.N. 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Council, NATO's major decision-making arm, is scheduled to 
meet today to consider a U.S. proposal to create a new "exclusion zone" around 
Bihac, but officials said Britain and France still are reluctant to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Key European allies have been opposed to increased use of NATO military power 
because they fear that the Serbs would retaliate and endanger U.N. peacekeeping 
forces, which comprise mainly French, British and Dutch soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans regard Washington suspiciously, partly because the United States 
has no ground forces in Bosnia and also because they regard it as overly 
aggressive in its efforts to punish the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, top Administration officials renewed their push for the new plan. 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had "extensive" telephone 
conversations on the issue with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also pursued the issue in the United Nations, but 
apparently failed to win a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry warned that if the Serbian nationalists 
launch additional air strikes against Bihac from the Croatian airfield, NATO 
warplanes will return and destroy the 15 or 20 Serbian fighters that they 
intentionally did not attack Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet time appeared to be running out. Some U.S. officials believe that, unless 
some action is taken soon, the fall of Bihac could be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's intensified rhetoric was not the only sign of heightened defiance. 
Serbian forces near Banja Luka fired two SA-2 surface-to-air missiles at 
British Harrier aircraft patrolling the area for NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian forces in one area were supported by a rocket-firing helicopter. And 
the Serbs briefly captured two Czech soldiers attached to a local U.N. 
peacekeeping force but released them after appeals by the United Nations.

MILITARY CAN OUST GAYS, COURT RULES; PENTAGON: FEDERAL PANEL SAYS ADMISSION OF 
HOMOSEXUALITY IS GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL. CASE INVOLVED NAVY'S MOVE TO DISCHARGE 
A CADET. 
</P>

<P>
 In a setback for gay-rights activists, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday 
that the Constitution does not bar the military from discharging a serviceman 
simply because he admits that he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 In their legal challenges to the Pentagon's ban on gays in the ranks, 
gay-rights lawyers have contended that the government cannot punish persons 
solely because of their "status," or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a 7-3 vote, the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of 
Columbia rejected that argument, and ruled that a serviceman's admission that 
he is gay is, for all practical purposes, the same as admitting he has engaged 
and will continue to engage in homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military may reasonably assume that, when a (service) member states that 
he is a homosexual, that member means that he either engages or is likely to 
engage in homosexual conduct," wrote Judge Lawrence H. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision upholds the Navy's move to discharge Joseph C. Steffan, a 
midshipman at Annapolis who had a stellar record but admitted in 1987 that he 
is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, lawyers for gay-rights groups have fought his discharge as a test 
case challenging the Pentagon's discriminatory policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Dorhn, legal director for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund in New York, 
said that the new ruling in Steffan's case is "obviously disappointing" because 
it endorses a policy that "subjects gay and non-gay service members to 
completely different rules." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that her organization has not decided whether to appeal to the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Tuesday's ruling demonstrates again that gay-rights activists 
have an uphill fight in challenging as unconstitutional the military's ban on 
admitted gays. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the federal judges who have ruled on this issue has concluded that 
gays deserve special protection under the Constitution, similar to blacks, 
Latinos or women. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges have split, however, on whether it is "rational" to discharge gays 
based on the mere admission of their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The generally liberal U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has 
taken the view that it is unfair and irrational to punish gays or lesbians who 
do nothing more than acknowledge their orientation. In August, a three-judge 
panel of the 9th Circuit upheld an order requiring the Navy to reinstate Keith 
Meinhold, a sailor who admitted his homosexuality on a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the military does not make "the assumption" that heterosexual members of 
the military will engage in prohibited acts such as adultery or sodomy, it 
should not make the automatic assumption that gays will engage in prohibited 
homosexual acts, Judge Pamela Rymer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The more conservative appeals court in Washington dismissed that view. "The 
government's presumption is certainly rational given that the human sexual 
drive is enormously powerful and that an open declaration that one is a 
homosexual is a rather reliable indication as to the direction of one's drive," 
wrote Silberman, an outspoken conservative and an appointee of President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a panel of the same court ruled for Steffan in an opinion authored 
by then-Chief Judge Abner J. Mikva, now White House counsel to President 
Clinton. The dissenters Tuesday were Judges Patricia M. Wald and Harry Edwards, 
both of whom were appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge Judith Rogers, 
a Clinton appointee.

GOP GOVERNORS, CONGRESS VOW TEAMWORK; POLITICS: STATE EXECUTIVES ANTICIPATE 
PROGRAMS WILL SHIFT TO THEIR CONTROL. BUT ONE SENATOR CAUTIONS THAT SLASHES IN 
FEDERAL FUNDS MAY FOLLOW. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican congressional leaders pledged here Tuesday to work hand in glove 
with the new bumper crop of GOP governors to hammer out a framework for fiscal 
policy that ultimately could lead to a wholesale transfer of responsibility for 
running social programs to the states. 
</P>
<P>
 This pledge from House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich of Georgia and likely 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was what the Republican governors, 
assembled here for their biennial meeting, long have waited to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion could hardly have been more appropriate. Having scored a net gain 
of 11 governorships in this month's vote, the GOP can look forward next year to 
being in charge of 30 governors' offices, the first time since 1970 that they 
have been in the majority. Moreover, the Republican Governors Assn. made the 
theme of this gathering "Foundations of Federalism" to underline their 
determination to shake off the yoke of the Washington bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In casting their ballots, the voters were saying: "We have had it with 
Washington," said host Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia in welcoming his 
victorious colleagues to this historic locale, once frequented by the likes of 
Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson. "They want and are fighting to take back 
their government." 
</P>
<P>
 The governors found affirmation of this theme in Dole's disclosure that one of 
their oldest and fondest dreams -- a curb on costly federal requirements for 
managing programs ranging from the environment to voter registration -- would 
be the first piece of legislation to be introduced on the floor of the 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The state chief executives saw this as a portent that in the first fully 
Republican-controlled Congress in 40 years the trend would be toward allowing 
them more flexibility to run programs their own way. Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, 
the new chairman of the Republican Governors Assn., summed up the message that 
he and his colleagues want to send to Congress and the country at the 
conclave's opening news conference on Sunday: "Give us the ball and then get 
out of the way. We can solve these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from Dole and Gingrich, the governors pronounced themselves 
pleased with their guests' overall theme of teamwork. "We're going to be a 
team," Gingrich declared. Not only did he promise that he and Dole, who have 
not always marched to the same philosophical tune in the past, would strive for 
a harmonious collaboration, but Gingrich added that they would spend extra 
hours "reaching out to Republican elected officials" from city halls to 
statehouses all across the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that he is "very, very positive" about the Gingrich-Dole 
performance, Michigan Gov. John Engler, new vice chairman of the association, 
added: "What they are really saying is, 'Let's build it (the new Republican 
agenda) together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the governors, who breakfasted privately with the visiting 
legislators for more than an hour before their public discussion, had received 
assurances that they would have input into deliberations on Capitol Hill, 
California Gov. Pete Wilson said: "We got more than assurances. We got an 
invitation to work very, very closely with them on crafting legislation and 
making the kind of changes that are absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But along with glad tidings, the visitors from Congress brought some sobering 
reminders of the stark realities of the nation's fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough decisions will have to be made soon, warned Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), 
who is expected to be the next chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He 
predicted that a balanced-budget amendment would be enacted by Congress and 
ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the state legislatures by midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
 If political pressures keep Congress from cutting into the huge outlays for 
Social Security and other entitlements to meet the amendment's requirements, 
Packwood said, then the lawmakers might have to start slashing grants for 
federally mandated programs. These grants, most of which go to pay for 
Medicaid, also cover a range of other programs from highways and housing to 
welfare and education and will total an estimated $185 billion in the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The states would be free of federal mandates, "to handle your education 
problems, your health problems, your education problems, your highway 
problems," Packwood said. But, he added pointedly, the states would also be 
left "with no money from the federal government at all." 
</P>
<P>
 That thought was enough to make even an enthusiast for federalism like 
Michigan's Engler blanch. "It's not possible to go cold turkey on something 
like that," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 But Engler pointed out that Packwood was not yet making a specific proposal to 
cut deeply into the funds that states have come to rely on from Washington. 
Rather, he said, Packwood was "making an important point -- that this is a 
serious issue and that the numbers are big numbers and problems are big 
problems. And I think a lot of people haven't focused on that."

THUMB PRINT LEADS TO SUSPECTS IN '76 SLAYING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel Alvarez Solano's thumb has pointed police to suspects in his slaying, 
18 years after his body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's office Monday said two people have been arrested and a third is 
being sought in the shotgun slaying of the Cuban-born drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, police had been unable to identify the body and held onto the thumb 
in hopes it would eventually yield clues. A state crime lab injected some 
chemicals to raise the ridges on the thumb, and Solano's prints were found on 
file at the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in '76, they didn't have a lot of technology we have now," sheriff's 
Detective Jay Glover said.

<P>
 There were eight minor injuries on the TWA jet, an MD-80 carrying 132 
passengers to Denver, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Sandra 
Campbell said. The jet was evacuated after the 10:15 p.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said two people were killed. She said the twin-engine turboprop had

SEEKING SOLUTIONS; THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WORKING 
AGAINST HUNGER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HERE ARE THREE APPROACHES THAT STAND 
OUT.; VACANT LOTS BLOOM INTO URBAN GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On vacant plots of land that once were sites for illegal dumping and drug 
sales, urban gardens are blossoming, providing food for the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90 urban gardens now dot Los Angeles' landscape, providing more than 
sustenance: They create a sense of community, beautify neighborhoods and give 
parents in crowded homes a safe place to bring their children, said Brenda 
Funches, board president of the nonprofit L.A. Harvest. In Los Angeles' 
Mediterranean climate, a 64-square-foot plot can yield a family up to $600 
worth of food a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowning jewel of urban gardens has emerged from 7 1/2 rubble-strewn acres 
surrounded by warehouses in South-Central Los Angeles, land the city owns but 
has not developed. The garden was begun last year by the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps and the Common Ground Gardening Program with funds from the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. Water costs are paid by the Los Angeles 
Regional Foodbank and the city. The garden's 138 plots were claimed within 
days. Once blighted, the land is now a vibrant oasis. Walking amid its lush 
cornstalks, garden coordinator Norma Reyes says Latinos -- many of whom tilled 
the soil in Central America -- often plant corn and chilies. African Americans 
-- many of whom learned to farm in the South -- cultivate collard greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps feed my family," says Alfredo Ledezma, a 40-year-old concrete 
worker and bricklayer with three children, as he gently weeds his plot of 
chilies, squash and tomatoes. Ledezma says he can usually get bricklayer work 
only three days a week, earning $125. He swaps vegetables with his garden 
neighbors. "I know a lot of people who go hungry in this neighborhood," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several plots away, Marta Garcia, 33, who has four children, agrees. "I grow 
everything," she says, pointing to rows of cucumbers, tomatoes and radishes. 
Half her husband's $1,000 monthly pay goes for rent. "If it weren't for the 
garden, my children would do without," says the unemployed garment worker. "I 
couldn't buy these vegetables. They are too expensive," she says, adding that 
her children can consume eight cucumbers a day. "They love this food." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest barriers to urban gardens are liability concerns, lack of access 
to land, toxic soils and water costs. There are at least 2,600 vacant lots in 
Los Angeles south of the Santa Monica Freeway that could be used as gardens 
until they are developed, Funches says. Under AmeriCorps, President Clinton's 
national service program, some of the 40 recruits assigned to combat hunger in 
Los Angeles this year will work to plant the seeds of three more urban gardens.

SEEKING SOLUTIONS; THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WORKING 
AGAINST HUNGER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HERE ARE THREE APPROACHES THAT STAND 
OUT.; A SIMPLE IDEA BEARS FRUIT FOR THE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a simple idea, born of one man's disgust over wasted food: Take tons of 
still edible fruits and vegetables destined for choking landfills and give them 
to the poor instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired produce wholesaler Mickey Weiss got the idea after he passed by a 
homeless encampment on the way to the docks of his vegetable company at the Los 
Angeles Wholesale Produce Market in 1987. When he saw 200 pallets of still 
edible strawberries waiting for the dump truck, he exploded. "Why are we 
throwing away berries when eight blocks away people are frying stale bread over 
open fires for their first meal of the day?" Weiss asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who had been in retirement for six years, got managers of the produce 
market -- the nation's busiest -- to dedicate 2,000 square feet at the end of a 
dock for the project. He recruited high school students to call Los Angeles 
charities and ask, "Do you want produce for the poor?" The charity dock was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling operation handed out 60,000 pounds its first month; it now 
directs 26 million pounds a year -- about 44,000 meals a day -- to 400 
charities. Weiss kicked in $40,000 annually for the first two years of 
operation. Since 1989, World Opportunities International, a Hollywood-based 
charity, has operated the dock, which receives no government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first program of its kind nationwide, Weiss and two USC medical school 
professors, Susan Evans and Peter Clarke, have crisscrossed the country, using 
Los Angeles as a model to launch charity docks in 15 other cities. Their next 
targets: 30 more U.S. cities, as well as Australia, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn, nonprofit groups begin to arrive at the Los Angeles facility. A 
procession of rickety trucks and vans pulls up to the gray concrete dock, up to 
50 a day. Each one hauls away up to 2,000 pounds of produce and donated bread. 
"There is nothing wrong with this," Weiss says, waving a wilted bunch of 
cilantro. "But it is nutritious food many people have never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps," said Oscar Hernandez, backing a church van up to the dock. 
Hernandez, a volunteer with Sendero de la Cruz church, says that 500 people 
arrive at his charity for food each week, up from 100 five years ago. "Without 
this, people wouldn't eat," he says, heaving boxes of squash, bell peppers and 
cherry tomatoes into his truck. CHARITY DOCK 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW IT WORKS: Charities pick up food weekly, usually about 2,000 pounds 
each.  
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT COSTS: Unlike many food banks, which charge nominal fees for food, 
charity dock food is free. Recipients must be nonprofit organizations. The 
charity dock is open five days a week.  
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MANY BENEFIT: 400 charities receive food. Thirty more are on a waiting 
list.

SEEKING SOLUTIONS; THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WORKING 
AGAINST HUNGER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HERE ARE THREE APPROACHES THAT STAND 
OUT.; PRODUCTS OF SHARING: FOOD AND GOOD WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principle is simple: Get people to pool their resources and buy food in 
bulk, and you'll help those with limited resources purchase more food for their 
money. Require participants in the purchasing pool to do some volunteer work 
for the food, and you improve the community they live in too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Self-Help and Resource Exchange, or SHARE, which was launched in 1983 in 
San Diego and now has branches in the United States, Mexico and Guatemala, 
distributes close to a quarter of a million food packages each month to 30,000 
families. SHARE, which has expanded to 600 pickup sites in 40 California 
counties, is working to increase participation in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants pay $14 at the beginning of the month, put in two hours of 
volunteer work in their community, then pick up a bag filled with 30 pounds of 
nutritious foods, valued at $30 to $35, at the end of the month. Each bag 
includes six to 10 pounds of meat, four to seven kinds of fresh vegetables, two 
to four types of fresh fruits and staples such as rice or pasta and a few 
specialty items. 
</P>
<P>
 People do such work as cleaning up graffiti or helping out at the Red Cross, 
Little League or schools to meet the volunteer requirement. They can even do 
good deeds for neighbors -- baby-sitting, tutoring children, mowing lawns -- as 
long as they get a receipt. 
</P>
<P>
 SHARE participation, which is open to anyone, places no limit on the number of 
bags of food a person can buy, as long as they do two hours of community 
service for each one.

 "We buy in large quantities," said Patricia French, a SHARE regional manager 
in the group's Colton office in San Bernardino County, which opened two years 
ago. Southern California has 23,000 participants, 4,000 of whom are in Los 
Angeles County. Volunteers help distribute the food, picking up orders in 
Colton. In Los Angeles County , food is distributed at 25 sites, mostly 
churches and volunteer centers, such as the Calvary Community Church in Norwalk 
or the La Mirada Volunteer Center. The group, which will offer a vegetarian 
package next year, plans to open a warehouse in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Standish, co-director of the nonprofit group California Food Policy 
Advocates, believes that SHARE has been highly effective at helping the working 
poor, a growing number of whom have been seeking food assistance in recent 
years. The truly destitute, she says, find it harder to surrender part of their 
cash at the beginning of the month with the promise of food several weeks 
later. "You need to be able to gather up some money at the beginning of the 
month," she says. THE 'SHARE' PROGRAM

 * COST: $14 a month, plus two hours of volunteer community work, for a package 
of food valued at $30 to $35.

SPEAKERS DEMAND WEST COVINA SCHOOLS JOIN BREAKFAST PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deluged by phone calls and offers of help from people concerned that West 
Covina children may be going to school hungry, the city's school board Tuesday 
got an earful from parents at a public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering publicly for the first time since the problem of undernourishment at 
Edgewood Middle School was detailed in a Times story on hunger Sunday, the West 
Covina Unified School District heard from more than half a dozen parents and 
activists demanding that subsidized breakfasts be approved at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgewood was cited in the article as an example of the hundreds of schools 
statewide that have not taken advantage of a longstanding, federally funded 
breakfast program for low-income students. Although the article stressed that 
the school is one of many, the suburban community surrounding it has been 
rocked by the publicity and the assertions of faculty and administrators that 
trustees opposed the program simply on conservative philosophical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been proven over and over again that hungry kids don't do well at 
school," said Bill Felix, 71, a retired West Covina principal. Felix said he 
agrees with board members who contend that parents should take responsibility 
for making sure children are properly fed, but noted that often, even 
well-intentioned parents fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a job," he said. "They're too proud to ask for welfare. They 
mismanage their meager resources. There's no money left over for food." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix urged the board to soften its stance on the breakfast program. "We feel 
conservatives can do good things for kids, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks by Felix and others came despite an announcement this week that 
the board will discuss and possibly vote on the breakfast program at its next 
meeting, Dec. 13. School Supt. John Costello and some board members said the 
trustees have been exploring the breakfast issue for at least several weeks, 
and Costello predicted that the board will approve it next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The school officials contended that the board never explicitly opposed the 
program, which Costello said was considered three years ago but failed to get 
off the ground because of problems in assessing need. Since then, trustees 
said, no one has formally called for subsidized morning meals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, critics of the board contended that the trustees for years have made 
it clear that the program would be defeated if it were proposed. Similar 
programs, they said, have been voted down by board members who argued that 
certain responsibilities should be left to parents and not schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contended that the issue came up only because Edgewood was publicly named 
in the newspaper coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Costello said he expected that the district would approve the 
subsidized breakfasts, board President Mike Spence said this week he continues 
to oppose government-sponsored breakfast programs but is willing to consider 
private charitable efforts. Other board members indicated that they are more 
open to the government-funded program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Tuesday, a community group announced that it has launched its own 
breakfast program in the interim, and plans to begin serving morning meals 
today at Edgewood.

REICH CALLS ON GOP TO ADD 'CORPORATE WELFARE' TO CUTS; BUDGET: PROPOSAL TO TRIM 
BUSINESS 'INCENTIVES' MAY HAVE WON THE LABOR SECRETARY SOME REPUBLICAN ALLIES. 
WHITE HOUSE STEPS BACK FROM PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich challenged the new Republican Congress on 
Tuesday to scale back business tax breaks and other forms of "corporate 
welfare" at the same time that it tries to reduce assistance to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocative proposal caught the Clinton Administration off guard and 
potentially won Reich some unlikely allies among conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said that the federal government could increase its revenues 
significantly by doing away with various tax deductions, credits and other 
"incentives" that reduce the corporate income taxes paid by American 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we are committed to moving the disadvantaged from welfare to work, why 
not target corporate welfare as well?" Reich declared in a keynote economic 
speech to members of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech reflected a desire on the part of some top Administration officials 
to press GOP lawmakers to direct their budget-cutting at some beneficiaries of 
government largess that Republicans have traditionally protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything should be on the table," Reich said in an interview later. He 
refused to specify programs or tax loopholes that should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton took a step back from his labor secretary's challenge to 
Congress to cut corporate and agricultural subsidies, saying that he had made 
"absolutely no decision about any of the specifics in Secretary Reich's 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said, however, that a Democratic Leadership Council proposal with more 
specifics on cutting corporate subsidies and tax breaks that Reich cited in his 
speech is "conceptually . . . an attractive idea." He said that he would take 
the proposal into consideration as he prepares the fiscal 1996 budget for 
submission to Congress early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich may have unusual allies for the campaign to strike special tax benefits 
for particular industries. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) indicated his willingness 
Monday to go after what he called "corporate subsidies," including subsidized 
interest rates and direct loans from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Reich proposed using savings from such cuts to pay for education and 
job training to foster a more solid middle class and lessen the growing gap 
between the affluent and the rest of society, Gramm suggested using it to fund 
a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Neal, Gramm's press spokesman, said that there may be some room for 
cooperation with Reich, but that the senator is withholding judgment. "We're 
not sure what Secretary Reich is talking about," Neal said. "I suspect as usual 
the Administration does not mean what it says." 
</P>
<P>
 Business lobbyists cautioned that cutting benefits to industries so that 
Americans can get job training may be self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell you for a lot of industries, what he may consider a special 
break they consider essential for their survival," said John Satagaj, president 
of the Small Business Legislative Council, a coalition of 100 trade 
associations. "It's fine to talk about worker-training programs but if there 
are no jobs to place them in because you've destroyed the industries they would 
have worked in, what good have you done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-business analysts and Republicans suggested that Reich should first 
consolidate and improve the scores of training programs funded by the federal 
government and prove their efficacy before asking for more of the taxpayers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich cited a report by the Democratic Leadership Council's research arm, the 
Progressive Policy Institute, which pinpointed savings over five years of $225 
billion in government subsidies and tax breaks, which help the energy, 
agriculture, transportation and high-tech industries, companies doing business 
in Puerto Rico and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's proposed cuts range from canceling the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration space station program to eliminating subsidies for 
wealthy farmers and closing the tax loophole that allows businesses to 
depreciate rental housing at a different rate than other structures. 
</P>
<P>
 While proposing such cuts as a "powerful theme for the 104th Congress," Reich 
called on two conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and the Cato 
Institute, to come up with their own proposals on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative analysts and Republican staff members on Capitol Hill generally 
agreed with Reich that, if Congress decides to cut welfare for the poor, it 
should also cut the safety net for the corporate world, including agriculture 
subsidies, the Export-Import Bank, Commerce Department programs and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would only be fair and just if we're cutting welfare to cut those programs 
as well," said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage 
Foundation think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mitchell and other conservatives took issue with the way Reich 
equated tax breaks with government spending, saying that there is a fundamental 
difference between government spending and a government decision not to impose 
a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich countered that tax breaks are comparable to welfare spending because, 
when companies get tax breaks, other companies and individuals must pay more 
taxes to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans plan to introduce a bill that would end the entitlement 
status for food stamps, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and other 
programs that assist the poor. It would also permit states to cut cash benefits 
to all welfare recipients after two years without guaranteeing a job, and deny 
benefits permanently to children born out of wedlock to teen-age parents. 
Immigrants who are not yet citizens would become ineligible for about 60 
programs under their proposals.

RULING REQUIRES NEW SENTENCE FOR ASIAN-CANADIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court has ruled that an Asian-Canadian woman, convicted of 
conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute heroin, be resentenced 
because the judge remarked on her race and nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 "A defendant's race or nationality may play no adverse role in the 
administration of justice, including at sentencing," the three-member U.S. 2nd 
Circuit Court of Appeals panel said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said it will send the case back to another judge for resentencing. 
In 1993, while sentencing Lai-Moi Leung, 52, to 19 years in prison, U.S. 
District Judge John Keenan made reference to her ethnic origin and immigrant 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently when I sentence folks who are not American citizens . . . I make 
the observation . . . that we have enough home-grown criminals in the United 
States without importing them," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After imposing the sentence, the judge went on to say that "if people want to 
come to the United States, they had better abide by our laws."

GOP WELFARE CUTS WOULD SLICE SAFETY NET, REPORT SAYS; REFORM: MILLIONS WOULD BE 
LEFT POOR, HOMELESS AND HUNGRY UNDER PLAN, CENTER SAYS. REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE 
STUDY FOR EXAGGERATING IMPACT, DEFEND THEIR BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The welfare reform plan drafted by House Republicans would reduce assistance 
to the poor by $57 billion over four years and deny benefits to half the 
families and children that receive aid under current law, according to a 
detailed analysis by a Washington-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which opposes the 
proposed GOP benefit cuts, said that the welfare plan endorsed by Republican 
House members would represent an unprecedented reduction in the social safety 
net established by Congress over several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill would make deep cuts in vital programs without helping welfare 
recipients earn their way out of poverty," said Isaac Shapiro, a senior analyst 
at the center, a respected liberal Washington institution. "Increases in 
poverty, homelessness and hunger for millions of children most certainly would 
result and states would likely be saddled with significant added costs as they 
face the destitution created by these harsh policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The report represented the first major attack on the Republican plan to 
overhaul the welfare state, which is part of the House GOP's "contract with 
America." Its findings will be key ammunition for moderates and liberals as 
they fight to derail the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the huge chasm between the approaches to welfare reform favored by the 
President and the new Republican congressional leadership and the high priority 
both give it, the welfare debate is likely to be a defining issue for the 
upcoming congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans criticized the report for exaggerating the impact of the bill and 
defended their proposal as a necessary measure to combat out-of-wedlock births 
and force parents to take financial responsibility for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not any cold-hearted policy, this is the way you make a work program 
effective -- you raise the stakes," said a Republican congressional staff 
member familiar with the proposal. "Policy without consequences is the 
Democratic approach to welfare reform. Policy with consequences is the approach 
Republicans are going to take." 
</P>
<P>
 One example of how the center's report is misleading, the GOP aide said, is 
that the report accurately states that 5 million children would lose benefits. 
But it leaves out, the aide said, that it would take eight years for that many 
to be cut off and, by that time, their families would have been given $60,000 
in public assistance over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that jettisoning so many children is "a risky" approach, the 
staff member stressed that no reform effort without serious consequences would 
inspire the dramatic behavioral changes that Republicans hope to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft bill would permit states to cut cash benefits to all welfare 
recipients after two years without providing jobs, deny benefits to children 
whose paternity had not been established and permanently refuse benefits to 
teen-age mothers who had babies out of wedlock and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton proposal, in contrast, would limit welfare benefits to two years 
but would offer government-subsidized jobs to those who could not find work in 
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican bill also would end "entitlement" status for food stamps, Aid 
to Families With Dependent Children and other programs that assist the poor. 
This would alter a key feature of the safety net under which such programs 
expand during recessions when unemployment and poverty rise, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would remove the safety net for immigrants who are not yet 
citizens, making them ineligible for about 60 programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Republican plan would not offer government subsidized jobs for 
recipients who have exhausted their benefits, it would require some recipients 
to work 35 hours per week to be eligible for AFDC checks. Considering that the 
average AFDC payment for a family of three is $366 a month, the report states, 
the Republicans would be forcing the average recipient to work for $2.42 per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans countered that the compensation would exceed the minimum wage if 
the value of food stamps and Medicaid is added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro said that following such logic would mean that companies which 
supplement their employees' health insurance should be permitted to pay them 
less than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you added in food stamps, you would be earning under the minimum wage 
in most states," Shapiro said.

RULES TO OFFER VOTER REGISTRATION AT WELFARE OFFICES ARE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government proposed new rules Tuesday to help low-income Americans 
register to vote in welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department, moving to implement last year's 
Motor Voter Act, said its proposal reverses current regulations that bar the 
distribution of voter registration materials to welfare recipients and 
applicants at welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, known officially as the National Voter Registration Act of 
1993, public assistance offices must provide voter registration assistance 
beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 These welfare offices will be required to distribute voter registration forms, 
to assist applicants in filling out the papers and to forward the completed 
forms to election officials, HHS said. 
</P>
<P>
 The voter registration services are to be made available when someone applies 
for public benefits, is recertified or reports a change in address. 
</P>
<P>
 The local offices affected are those that provide Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children, Medicaid, food stamps and nutrition assistance under the 
Women, Infants and Children supplemental food program. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules take effect after 60 days for public comment.

HAITIAN CHILDREN AT GUANTANAMO MUST BE LET INTO U.S., JUDGE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 230 unaccompanied Haitian children being held in a U.S. detention camp 
in Cuba should be allowed to enter the country under the same humanitarian 
parole being granted Cuban refugees, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, said U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, legal counsel must be 
provided to all refugees who request it in writing, and the names of each of 
the 5,993 Haitians being held in the tent city at the U.S. naval base must be 
given to refugee advocates here. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins' order was in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys for the 
Haitians, who charged the Clinton Administration with "blatant discrimination" 
in allowing Cuban children at the Guantanamo Bay base into the United States 
while barring Haitian minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a flagrant double standard," said Cheryl Little, one of the attorneys 
for the Haitians. "We're delighted with the ruling. Innocent children should 
not become pawns in a political game." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit on behalf of the Haitians at Guantanamo was filed after attorneys 
for about 23,000 Cubans held there sued for their release. After Atkins blocked 
the repatriation of Cubans and ordered that they be given access to lawyers, 
the U.S. Justice Department appealed to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Oral arguments are scheduled for Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, Guantanamo Cubans are being released from the camps. Over 
the last few weeks, more than 200 refugees, mostly young children and their 
immediate families, and the elderly have been paroled into the United States, 
contradicting the Administration's Aug. 19 pledge that no refugees fleeing Cuba 
by raft would be permitted to enter the country without first returning to Cuba 
to apply for legal entry. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 23,000 Cubans at Guantanamo Bay, 9,000 rafters are held in 
camps in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending what appears to be unequal treatment of the refugees, U.S. 
Justice Department attorney David Kline argued in court Monday that the 
Haitians no longer face persecution at home since the return of elected 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the presence of U.S. troops in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Aristide's return Oct. 15, about 8,000 Haitians have volunteered for 
repatriation.

EXPANDED ESPY PROBE MAY TAKE A YEAR; INVESTIGATION: COUNSEL PLANS TO HIRE MORE

 Independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz said Tuesday that he has expanded the 
scope of his investigation of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy in light of new 
allegations since his appointment by the federal courts in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, a Los Angeles defense attorney and former prosecutor, said in an 
interview that he expects to hire as many as 35 staff members in an 
investigation that he estimated will now last a year. He said that he 
previously had anticipated that he would need only six months to determine 
whether Espy had violated any federal laws.

 "I'm going to be here a year to complete this investigation," Smaltz said in 
an interview in his temporary office near Union Station in Washington. "There's 
just too many allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with reports that he had accepted sports tickets, travel and hotel 
accommodations improperly from agricultural businesses and had abused 
government transportation perquisites, Espy abruptly announced Oct. 3 that he 
would resign, effective Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the resignation, Smaltz said: "I have a duty to look into all 
allegations of misconduct involving Secretary Espy, especially any sort of 
bribe or gratuity or any other offenses he may have committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said that he will consider information from news accounts that appeared 
shortly after his appointment -- including questions concerning Espy's use of 
taxpayer-funded vehicles -- as well as "other allegations that have never even 
reached the press." He declined to disclose the nature of that information. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the independent counsel expressed surprise that Espy has not 
offered to explain his version of the matters under review. While targets of 
federal inquiries traditionally are not compelled to testify before grand 
juries because of the constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination, 
they or their attorneys sometimes seek to meet with prosecutors to offer their 
view of events in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought that by now I would have heard from him," Smaltz said of 
Reid H. Weingarten, Espy's lawyer. "My thinking is that he would want to get 
his client's version of the facts before me at the earliest opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment on Smaltz's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ben-Veniste, a defense attorney and former Watergate prosecutor, said 
that the decision to come forward voluntarily depends on circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with a grand jury investigation, naturally you want to be 
very protective of your client's rights. And going in and talking to a 
prosecutor under these circumstances would definitely be an on-the-record 
conversation, with whatever implications there might be," Ben-Veniste said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Smaltz has broadened his investigation, Weingarten expressed 
confidence that his client will be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the allegations are insubstantial, are trivial," Weingarten said. "I 
think (Espy's) been severely punished by his resignation. I think there has to 
be a sense of proportionality here. I think it's extraordinary that he's under 
criminal investigation at this time. . . . At worst, these things were 
oversights caused by the crush of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy has been accused of accepting gifts from companies regulated by the 
Agriculture Department such as Tyson Foods Inc. of Arkansas and Quaker Oats. In 
addition, Smaltz has vowed to review allegations concerning other department 
employees. He also said that he intends to explore the legal issue of whether 
favors accepted by Patricia Dempsey, Espy's woman friend, from lobbyists for 
agricultural concerns could be construed as indirect gifts to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics laws prohibit senior federal officials from accepting all but small 
gifts from companies with interests before their agencies. In addition, a 
strict 1907 law bars agriculture officials with responsibility for regulating 
the meat and poultry industries from taking any gratuities from companies the 
department oversees. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, a Republican appointed by a three-judge panel in response to a request 
for an independent counsel by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, said that he has completed 
the preliminary phase of his investigation and now has "lots of documents we'll 
have to look at and a fair amount of testimony that I expect to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten said that Espy has not set up a defense fund to seek contributions 
to pay his legal fees and does not intend to do so "when he's a public 
official." Asked whether Espy would do so when he leaves office, the attorney 
replied: "We'll see."

EXPERTS CAN'T AGREE ON HUBBART; PSYCHOLOGY: ONE SAYS THE SERIAL RAPIST IS 
CONTRITE AND TRYING TO CONTROL HIS URGES. THE OTHER SAYS HE'S DANGEROUS AND 
WILL ATTACK AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Consider two takes on Christopher Hubbart, serial rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 State psychologist No. 1: He is a bright, shy 43-year-old man who is trying to 
control his sexual urges, and is truly sorry for his 34 victims. 
</P>
<P>
 State psychologist No. 2: He is dangerous, unable to control his sexual urges 
and can be counted on to rape again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they agreed on little else, both psychologists, along with a state 
psychiatrist, cleared Hubbart for parole to his parents' house in Claremont, 
according to confidential prison evaluations obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But on March 16, the morning of his scheduled parole, Hubbart failed a 
different mental health exam given by yet another evaluator -- and was returned 
to prison for a year of psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of a high-profile rapist and the psychologists and 
psychiatrists who could not agree on what made him tick. Five state evaluators 
looked at Hubbart; each came up with a different diagnosis. Ultimately, 
Hubbart's parole was revoked based on the decision of his last evaluator, state 
psychiatrist Barry Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary that just one person can make that decision," said Peggie Reyna, a 
program coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this one (evaluator) decides that this man goes free, and he moves to a 
neighborhood, and the next day, rapes a 16-year-old girl or an 85-year-old 
woman, is that psychiatrist held responsible? Of course, not. . . . I don't 
think one person should have all that power and all that responsibility on 
their shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute exam is one way to circumvent the state's 1977 determinate 
sentencing law. Under the law, rapists and most other felons are freed on a set 
date; they no longer have to go before a parole board. The only way corrections 
officials can keep dangerous felons off the street is to administer the exam -- 
and hope they fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart has been in and out of prison since 1973 for a series of rapes in 
California, including one on the first day of his release after six years in a 
state mental hospital. He has been linked to 24 rapes in Los Angeles, Orange 
and San Bernardino counties, 10 rapes in Northern California and several 
burglaries. In some of the attacks he bound and gagged his victims and forced 
them to endure enemas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart was released on parole in March after serving half of a five-year 
sentence for his most recent offense: grabbing the breasts of a female jogger. 
</P>
<P>
 His basic background is undisputed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart, a native of Pasadena, is smart and educated; his IQ of 122 puts him 
in the top 8% of the population. He has a bachelor's degree in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, thin man is close to his two sisters. His parents divorced when he 
was 5 years old. His mother is a Los Angeles County social worker, his father 
is a retired journalist and now a jazz musician. His stepfather does custom 
furniture work. 
</P>
<P>
 But his mental health evaluations have agreed on little else. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in Hubbart's last five evaluations, two evaluators diagnosed him 
with a mental disorder, and three others said he had none. One psychologist 
said Hubbart was a sexual sadist; others disagreed. One evaluator said Hubbart 
suffers from a personality disorder, while another said he did not. 
</P>
<P>
 In a January report, clinical psychologist Evelyn Sprick concluded that 
Hubbart "fits the profile of the classical 'gentleman' rapist," because he 
tried to "facilitate consensual sex as he understood it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, on the day of Hubbart's parole, state psychiatrist Bass 
reached a different conclusion -- the one that put Hubbart back in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subject's perception of reality is seriously impaired as demonstrated by 
his inability to recognize the severe terror, pain and trauma that his sexual 
assaults inflict upon his victims, and his belief that his assaults are 
willingly accepted by his victims," Bass' evaluation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprick and Bass also clashed on the subject of Hubbart's prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprick: "Based on present degree of self-understanding, increasing maturation 
and current motivation, one would expect that this individual would be able to 
control his behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass: "Fear of re-conviction has not deterred him. The prognosis for recovery 
within the next several years is virtually nil." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the psychologists or psychiatrists who evaluated Hubbart would comment 
on the case or the confidential evaluations. Corrections Department officials 
also said they could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Times' request, two independent psychologists and a psychiatrist read 
Hubbart's mental health evaluations. Each had a different opinion on the 
reports. One agreed with Bass' assessment that Hubbart suffers from a mental 
illness and should not be on the streets. Another said he was dismayed at the 
quality of all the evaluations but that he tended to agree with Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 A third, USC psychology professor Adrian Raine, disagreed with Bass' diagnosis 
that kept Hubbart in custody. Bass concluded that Hubbart suffers from a 
paraphilia, or sexual deviation. But rape is not considered a paraphilia, 
according to the manual used by mental health professionals to diagnose, Raine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this (man) was being released into my neighborhood, on my street, I'd be 
out there protesting, no question about it," said Raine, who has extensive 
experience evaluating prisoners. "But . . . given what the law of the land is, 
it doesn't seem appropriate that he's being held in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), a former Riverside homicide 
detective, said laws need to change. Psychologists and psychiatrists should 
have input on the fate of parolees, but courts should make the final decision, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important because if they make the wrong decision -- and from 
psychiatrist to psychiatrist, they can differ -- and a person is released, and 
rapes and kills again, there's no more serious consequence than that," Presley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Hubbart is scheduled to go back on parole, unless he again 
qualifies for the "psychiatric return." But in January, 1996, Hubbart's 
three-year parole is up, and he must be released without supervision, 
regardless of his mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one of Hubbart's rape victims, who lives in the Claremont area, 
struggles to understand the process. In fine detail, the 46-year-old remembers 
the morning that Hubbart raped her 22 years ago in her Pomona home, with her 
baby daughter sleeping in the next room and her husband away at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart used one of her husband's neckties to tie a pillowcase around her 
head, she said. When he left, he said he'd be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frightening that (Hubbart) can say something is consensual when 
(he) can break into your home when you're asleep . . . and tell you: 'Do you 
know what a man needs when he's been locked up for so long?' " she said. 
Conflicting Views 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from state mental health evaluations of serial rapist Christopher 
Hubbart show how opinions differed widely on some major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 ON HUBBART'S VIEW OF HIS VICTIMS: 
</P>
<P>
 "The subject's perception of reality is seriously impaired, as demonstrated by 
his inability to recognize the severe terror, pain and trauma that his sexual 
assaults inflict upon his victims, and his belief that his assaults are 
willingly accepted by his victims." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Psychiatrist Barry Bass, Region IV Parole and Community Services Division, 
March 16, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 "This individual has been able to develop empathy for his victims. When one 
speaks with him and addresses this subject of remorse and empathy, he will 
articulate that he feels sorry for the victims and that he has been able to 
imagine what they must have gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clinical psychologist Evelyn Sprick, California Medical Facility, 
Vacaville, Jan. 4, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 ON HUBBART'S PROGNOSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of re-conviction has not deterred him. The prognosis for recovery within 
the next several years is virtually nil." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bass 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time, Mr. Hubbard (sic) is aware of the fact that he developed 
an abnormal way of relating sexually to females. He has also developed a degree 
of insight into his sexual acting out which currently suggests that he is 
beginning to both understand and control his deviant sexual behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sprick 
</P>
<P>
 ON HOW HUBBART WOULD FARE IF FREED: 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly recommend that this individual be given a fair opportunity to 
prove himself, given his present level of motivation. I hope that his prior 
experience of having his parole revoked based only on the perception of danger 
does not repeat itself." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sprick 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a strong, well-functioning support system, he represents a danger to 
the community. This examiner feels that he does not have that at the present 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Staff psychologist Bruce J. Sutkus, California Institution for Men, Chino, 
April 2, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 ON HUBBART'S MOTIVES: 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hubbard (sic) refers to recurrent panic attacks as serving as the 
precursors or triggers for his sexual escapades." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sprick 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a needy, dependent individual who somehow has experienced these sexual 
assaults as gratifying these needs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sutkus 
</P>
<P>
 "He is predominantly a personality-disordered person with a compulsion to 
rape." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clinical psychologist Nancy Faulkender, California Medical Facility, 
Vacaville

EXCHANGE STUDENT, 12, HIT BY CAR, KILLED; ACCIDENT: CHINESE BOY WAS AMONG 75 
YOUTHS TAKING PART IN PROGRAM BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND THE L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 12-year-old Chinese student, one of 75 taking part in the first large-scale 
student exchange program between China and the Los Angeles school district, 
died after he was struck by a car, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bin-Feng Zheng apparently ran into the path of a car Monday evening as he 
crossed Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Burbank Boulevard in Woodland Hills, 
authorities said. The youth, who suffered massive head injuries, died at Kaiser 
Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills about 8:45 p.m. Monday, said hospital 
spokeswoman Linda Quon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bin-Feng, who had adopted the American name "Roy" and was known for his 
curiosity, was taking part in an exchange student program at Hale Middle School 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said that Bin-Feng apparently slipped out of the Woodland 
Hills apartment where he and the other students had been staying since they 
arrived in September from Guangzhou, a large city near Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might have been more kids about (at the accident scene), but it has not 
been confirmed," Hale Principal Jeanie Leighton said. "I think the only persons 
who know are our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Leighton said the exchange students usually are "watched very closely" by 
Chinese and Chinese American chaperons, each assigned to care for six students. 
The unidentified caretaker in charge of Bin-Feng apparently did not realize the 
boy was missing until after he had been killed, Leighton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy began to unfold sometime after 6:30 p.m. Monday when the boy 
apparently left the Warner Center Apartments, possibly during the students' 
recreation time, Leighton said. Where he was headed remains unclear, but about 
a half an hour later a car driven by Martin Rosenburg, 71, apparently struck 
the youth on Topanga Canyon Boulevard as he darted across the busy street, said 
Los Angeles Police Officer John Baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Bin-Feng was known as a student who "tried very hard and was very curious," 
Leighton said. The boy's parents were notified late last night of their son's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, school officials quickly assembled a Chinese-speaking crisis team, 
consisting of a psychologist and a minister and his wife, to counsel the other 
Chinese students and review safety procedures, including how to properly cross 
a busy American street. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a two-hour group counseling session, the exchange students 
received shorter counseling sessions later in the day, and more counseling will 
be offered as needed, Leighton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leighton said she hopes the tragedy will not affect the exchange program. 
"It's very sad," she said. "It seemed like everything had been very positive. 
Our kids had been very receptive and warm to these kids and anxious to learn 
about them and their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese youngsters, ages 11 to 14, are students of the Heroes School, the 
first private school in China. They came to Hale to attend a special program 
built around English as a Second Language courses taught by instructors who can 
speak both Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are expected to be replaced by a second group of youngsters from 
the Heroes School next September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district is scheduled to start sending American 
students to China in the 1995-96 school year, where the $30,000-a-year tuition 
at the Heroes School, a boarding institution, will be waived.

CONSERVANCY REJECTS ACCORD WITH SOKA; PARKS: AGENCY VOWS TO PRESS ON WITH ITS 
LAWSUIT TO SEIZE PART OF CAMPUS FOR PARKLAND. BATTLE NOW SHIFTS TO SUPERIOR 
COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Choosing combat over compromise, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy early 
Tuesday rejected a tentative settlement with Soka University, vowing to press 
ahead with its lawsuit to seize part of the school's campus for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed more than five hours of angry testimony from homeowners, 
environmentalists and elected officials who blasted the conservancy for even 
considering surrender in its fight to condemn Soka's scenic property to use as 
a park visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejection of the compromise means lawyers for both sides will face off this 
morning in Los Angeles Superior Court to argue over whether the conservancy has 
the right to seize 245 of the school's 662 acres at the corner of Las Virgenes 
Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said the decision marks the 
beginning of one of the toughest battles the 15-year-old agency has ever faced. 
It is the first time the conservancy has exercised its power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our supporters have to understand the consequences," Edmiston said. Edmiston 
warned conservancy supporters to expect drastic measures to raise money for the 
fight -- including allowing current land acquisitions such as the Canyon Oaks 
deal in Topanga Canyon to fall apart, or selling off parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said the school will continue to work with the 
community, but will aggressively defend itself against the condemnation 
lawsuit, which already has dragged on for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have suggested that the case may ultimately be decided by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late last week, it appeared that the board would approve the proposed 
settlement with Soka, and thus free the conservancy -- a state agency that 
acquires parkland -- from a high-stakes court case that will cost the public 
millions of dollars regardless of which side wins. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a barrage of criticism from the conservancy's traditional supporters 
-- including Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, (D-Woodland Hills), state Sen. Tom 
Hayden, (D-Santa Monica), and Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky -- 
the deal fell out of favor with board members, many of whom are political 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said a settlement would be a "betrayal of the conservancy's mission as 
defender of public park space and ecological restoration." Yaroslavsky labeled 
it "public policy at its worst." And Beilenson, who wrote the legislation that 
created the recreation area, said the deal "makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the settlement, which also included a broad coalition of 
environmentalists and homeowners, applauded and cheered when the conservancy 
board rejected the proposal about 1 a.m. Tuesday -- after 141 speakers for and 
against the proposal testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, the arm of 
the conservancy actually pursuing the condemnation, convened in executive 
session to consider the settlement. About 2 a.m., the authority's board emerged 
from closed session and announced that it, too, had rejected the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have long coveted Soka's campus for use as a visitors center 
for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Tokyo-based Soka, on 
the other hand, wants to expand its small language school there into a 
3,500-student liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the conservancy launched eminent domain proceedings in Los 
Angeles Superior Court to force the school to sell the part of its campus once 
owned by razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the conservancy would have dropped 
its condemnation lawsuit against the school. In turn, Soka would have sold 173 
acres -- including the historic King Gillette mansion and grounds -- to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The school would have applied to build a smaller, 2,500-student university on 
property it owns east of the present campus. The deal would have taken effect 
only if the expansion were approved by the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the deal said that tying sale of the land to development permits 
virtually guaranteed that Soka would be able to build its university because 
supervisors would be loathe to cross the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials had hoped to avoid the need for today's court hearing by 
settling the case. But now, lawyers for both sides will argue whether the 
conservancy has the right to seize Soka's land. If Judge Barnet Cooperman rules 
in favor of the conservancy, a jury will decide how much Soka should be 
compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury orders the conservancy to pay more than it can afford -- roughly 
$20 million -- then Soka would be able to sue for damages. Edmiston said the 
conservancy may be forced to sell other properties to raise enough money to 
finish a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conservancy can afford the jury's price, Soka lawyers have 
threatened to attempt to force the agency to buy all of their property at a 
price beyond the conservancy's reach. If such a tactic is unsuccessful, Soka 
would still be able to apply to Los Angeles County for a larger development on 
its other property. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the conservancy loses the case, Soka probably will sue for damages and 
proceed with plans for the larger university.

USE OF CRA FOR QUAKE REHAB OKD; REBUILDING: DESPITE ANGRY PROTESTS, COUNCIL 
APPROVES REDEVELOPMENT POWERS IN THE REPAIR OF HARD-HIT AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Redevelopment powers will be used for the first time to aid in the repair of 
earthquake-damaged neighborhoods under a plan approved Tuesday by the Los 
Angeles City Council over the objections of angry residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote, the council established an emergency redevelopment zone 
on about 700 acres of hard-hit commercial and residential neighborhoods along 
Ventura Boulevard and adjacent neighborhoods in Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first of six such zones being considered for quake-ravaged 
neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. The zones use property 
taxes to provide residential and commercial loans and money to repair public 
buildings and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to opposition from local residents, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents the area, dramatically modified the Sherman Oaks/Studio City plan to 
immediately initiate a repair program for condominiums but delay all other 
elements of the program for 11 months, giving the council an opportunity to 
abort the effort later. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, an appointed citizens committee can also vote to oppose 
elements of the plan. The committee's decisions can only be overturned by a 
two-thirds vote of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the modifications did not appease 25 residents who picketed in front of 
City Hall prior to the council meeting and threatened to sue the city to halt 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said they do not trust the city's Community Redevelopment Agency to 
spend their tax dollars and wield the power to condemn private property. They 
said the agency has a controversial history that makes them uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they get in, you can never get them out," said Lynn Solky, a Sherman 
Oaks resident who joined the group that picketed on the steps outside City 
Hall. One placard labeled the CRA the "Community Robbery Agency." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said they plan to sue, saying that the city has failed to prove that 
the redevelopment plan is needed and that no other funds or programs are 
available to repair the quake damage in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some complained that no one will watch over the CRA once Yaroslavsky leaves 
his post Dec. 5 to become the newest member of the county's Board of 
Supervisors. His council seat will be left vacant until a successor is elected 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "For seven months there will be no one to watch over this," said Roberta 
Weintraub, a former school board member and a candidate for Yaroslavsky's 
council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an emotional appeal during the meeting, Yaroslavsky blasted critics, 
saying the plan is a "last resort" source of aid for quake victims who fail to 
get funding from other disaster agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does the establishment of a redevelopment project help anyone? Yes," he said, 
nearly shouting. "Does the establishment of a redevelopment project hurt 
anyone? No!" 
</P>
<P>
 Within the proposed boundaries of the redevelopment area, about 200 businesses 
and approximately 500 residential buildings comprising 8,000 dwelling units 
suffered damage, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 717-acre project will generate just under $18 million to provide 
low-interest loans to home and business owners. Redevelopment guidelines 
require that 20% of the housing funds be set aside for tenants with low to 
moderate incomes, who may be housed within the project area or elsewhere in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA and the council would have limited powers to condemn abandoned and 
blighted property -- a provision that makes many property owners nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 A private consulting firm hired by the CRA estimated that the properties 
within the project area suffered between $50 million and $120 million in damage 
that will not be covered by insurance money or federal and state grants and 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a community panel has been working for three months to modify the 
redevelopment plan, strong opposition from residents has persisted, prompting 
Yaroslavsky to dramatically rewrite the plan himself last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become clear to me that for some people no amount of compromise will 
be sufficient," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan will provide immediate help for condominium owners because, 
Yaroslavsky said, many quake victims cannot make repairs to common facilities 
in a complex after other condo owners have abandoned their units. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the CRA can buy abandoned condos and make repairs so that the 
units can be sold. For condo owners who have not abandoned their units, the 
city's housing department already offers low interest loans of up to $35,000 
per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The other elements of the program -- including the sale of bonds to provide 
home and business loans -- will be delayed until at least Oct. 1, by which time 
a successor to Yaroslavsky will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to delaying most elements of the plan, Yaroslavsky also reduced 
the size of the proposed zone by 183 acres by cutting out dozens of Studio City 
neighborhoods.

CRYING FOUL; CRITICS SAY CITY SHIELDED PLANS TO EXPAND TILLMAN SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANBGO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics and defenders of the only sewage treatment plant in the San Fernando 
Valley agree on few things, but this much both factions concede: The demand for 
sewage processing, along with the population, will grow in time. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant should also grow -- 
and when -- is a continuing friction point between the two sides, and the 
recent discovery of two errors in planning documents for the facility have 
heightened the misgivings of plant critics who say the city is trying to shield 
its expansion plans from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a chapter of a long-term plan outlining the city's future sewage 
treatment needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The chapter predicts that Tillman will need to expand its capacity by 50% by 
2010. The section also appears to say that the facility can be expanded by as 
much as 250% during the next 100 years without a public environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those points are wrong, Public Works officials now say. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which treats sewage from most of the San Fernando Valley, should 
remain the same size between now and 2010, said deputy city engineer Brad 
Smith. This key point is contained in a short-range plan for the facility. 
Moreover, any major expansion at the plant will indeed require an environmental 
review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith discovered the errors after The Times asked the department to explain 
inconsistencies between the long-term and short-range plans for its sewage 
facilities. The expansion prediction has already been corrected, and the need 
for an environmental review will be clarified when the long-range plan is 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
 But any talk of adding facilities at Tillman without public notification is 
like taking a match to a powder keg. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's construction of a $2-million septic waste collection facility 
at Tillman in 1993 without an environmental study triggered massive protests in 
the community, which led the Board of Public Works to order a belated 
environmental study of that project. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the little-known long-term plan, its references to the 2010 
expansion, and the more than three months it took for the department to disavow 
those references, have worried community activists who fear the department will 
try to add facilities to Tillman again without properly notifying the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists oppose any enlargement of the plant, saying it will gobble up 
precious parkland, exacerbate already noxious odors, and promote unwanted 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions will not rule out future expansion of the sewage treatment 
plant. They merely mean that to the best of city planners' knowledge, Tillman 
will need to be expanded sometime after, not before, 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he considered the faulty prediction to be "inconsequential" because 
it deals with an anticipated plant capacity for a date 16 years in the future, 
and because it does not appear to affect other recommendations contained in the 
long-range report. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stenstrom, an environmental engineering professor at UCLA, said the 
mistake was not significant because it was caught well in advance of 2010. 
Furthermore, he believes the error would have been caught before the department 
did any design work because projections would have clearly pointed to one 
figure rather than another figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people familiar with planning issues surrounding sewage treatment 
facilities agree that the mistakes were neither unusual nor serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never read a perfect EIR (environmental impact report) and I don't plan 
to read one," said Mark Gold, executive director of Heal the Bay, an 
environmental group working to clean up Santa Monica Bay. "It's amazing the 
number of glaring inconsistencies that you will see. Does that make it right? 
Of course not. That's why we have the public review process." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Wagner, who directs New York City's long-range planning for sewage 
treatment, said: "The only difficulty with this situation is that an error was 
made, which was found by the community before it was found by the agency, and 
that created concern and distress in the community. That's always unfortunate, 
but it sounds like the agency has taken steps to rectify that error and that 
error had no significance and impact between the time it was made and the time 
it was caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists take a different view. They say the errors could have 
become the basis for faulty planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very serious violation of the public's confidence in the planning 
section of the Public Works Department," said Jill Swift, co-founder of the 
Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin. "I've lost some confidence in him (Smith) as 
an administrator if he didn't correct it when it was first brought up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope this kind of fiasco demonstrates the need for leadership and 
allows the leadership to come forward and take charge," said Peter Ireland, 
president of the coalition. "There's going to be continuing conflict, 
controversy and incompatible coexistence between the recreational resources and 
users in the basin and what is now going to become the city's second largest 
sewer plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman currently has the capacity to treat 80 million gallons of sewage per 
day. The incorrect sections of the long-term plan predicted that Tillman would 
have to expand to treat 120 million gallons per day by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range plan also calls for the plant to be expanded to 160 million 
gallons a day by 2050 and 200 million gallons a day by 2090. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range plan, called the Clean Water Program Advanced Planning Report, 
came to light when community activist Gerald A. Silver found a reference to it 
in a draft environmental study for a proposed sewer system repair project. At 
Silver's request, the city sent him the section of the plan dealing with 
Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asked Smith and half a dozen current and former public works 
officials about the discrepancies between the long- and short-term plans 
beginning in early July. Until mid-October, when the department admitted that 
mistakes had been made, officials did not provide a clear explanation of the 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 One common response was to downplay the long-term plan as merely a flexible 
outline of projects that they could choose, or not choose, to pursue. They said 
the long-term plan was not officially adopted by the City Council, as was the 
short-term plan, known as the Wastewater Facilities Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he believes the mistakes occurred because planners drafting the 
Tillman section worked in isolation from planners preparing other sections. 
Asked what projections the Tillman section planners had based their 2010 
expansion figure on, Smith said, "I honestly don't have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 But why did it take more than three months to recognize the inconsistencies 
between the long-term and short-term plans? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith offered a simple explanation: Public Works officials did not look into 
the matter until recently, and because of a "general reluctance on the part of 
government workers to explain that something is wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 As for Silver, the way in which the department has dealt with the issue -- and 
the repeated references in the long-term plan to expanding Tillman before 2010 
-- have raised suspicions in his mind that the prediction was not faulty at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his belief, he said, that the department thinks that 2010 sewage levels 
will require an expansion, but is loathe to admit that because it doesn't want 
to face the predictable public furor. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, pointed out that Tillman was built 
in 1984 to accommodate 40 million gallons of sewage a day, and just seven years 
later, it was expanded to 80 million gallons a day. Common sense dictates that 
Tillman would need to be expanded again 19 years later, in 2010, not stay the 
same, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith counters that predicting sewage capacity is not as obvious as it 
seems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Tillman was quickly expanded to 80 million gallons a day to catch 
up to the demand. Now that that demand has been met, future expansions will 
happen more slowly. In fact, he said, the amount of sewage generated per day in 
the Tillman service area, which includes most of the San Fernando Valley, has 
decreased from 78 million gallons a day in 1985 to 71 million or 72 million 
gallons a day today, mainly due to water conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that amount, Tillman treats 67 million gallons a day, Smith said, with the 
rest sent to other plants for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said he believes sewage levels are artificially depressed now by 
about 10% and will rebound as people become less careful about using water, and 
that they will rise -- driven mainly by population growth -- at a rate of 1% to 
1.5% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such growth would bring the sewage levels in the service area to between 90 
million and 100 million gallons a day by 2010, although the level could be 
affected by economic and development fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers would appear to buttress Silver's claim that projected sewage 
flows require the department to increase Tillman's capacity or build another 
treatment plant to serve the Tillman service area by 2010. But Smith, once 
more, said that simple math doesn't provide the whole picture. 
</P>
<P>
 If sewage levels do indeed go beyond Tillman's 80-million-gallon daily 
capacity, the excess sewage could be sent to other treatment plants. In 
deciding not to expand Tillman by 2010, the department took into consideration 
not only the anticipated sewage levels in the Tillman service area, but also 
cost and environmental factors, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman is part of an interconnected system of sewage treatment plants, Smith 
said, and there is no rule that says Tillman must process all of the sewage 
generated in the Tillman service area. However, he conceded that it is more 
expensive to send Valley sewage elsewhere to be processed. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes, as it has for years. Silver and other critics question other 
aspects of the long-range plan, and the Public Works officials answer them away 
as well. But there are two things that cannot be reconciled for Silver: He did 
indeed spot errors in the document, and Public Works officials failed to 
address them for months. 
</P>
<P>
 His trust in the officials running Tillman, never high from the start, he 
says, has only deteriorated further.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; OLD PIPELINE NOT DUE TO BE REOPENED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operator of a 70-year-old crude oil pipeline that ruptured in nine places 
after the Northridge earthquake has announced that it has no plans to reopen 
the 10-inch-diameter pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement at a San Fernando City Council meeting temporarily 
mollified citizens who have demanded that the 130-mile line -- sections of 
which run through the heart of densely populated areas and cut across the 
property of an elementary school in San Fernando -- never be operated again.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those at the meeting Monday who asked that the line remain closed 
permanently was Lucky Hemphill, principal at O'Melveny Elementary School. The 
pipeline, owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., runs roughly parallel to O'Melveny 
Avenue and bisects the school three feet beneath the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day when my kids walk into the school yard they're stepping across the 
pipeline," Hemphill reminded officials. "Because of this danger, we've had to 
split the school in half during evacuation drills. Parents and teachers want to 
be sure that line is flushed out and that it remains closed."  
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Arco line cracked and caught fire at a 
welded joint near the school, spewing oil and flames that injured one 
motorcyclist and burned three homes and 17 vehicles. At another point in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, the line split, dumping oil into the Santa Clara River, 
killing hundreds of fish and birds. Since the earthquake, the line has remained 
closed, and the California State Fire Marshal, which regulates pipeline safety, 
has established criteria Arco must meet before restarting the line.  
</P>
<P>
 Requirements include replacing sections of pipe where 1920s-era acetylene 
welds exist. The welds were pinpointed as the weakest spots along the line, 
which carries oil from Kern County to the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tested and repaired the line after the quake," said Matt Rezvani, 
government relations representative for Four Corners Pipelines, which operates 
the line for Arco. "We have plans to flush it to remove residual oil, and that 
line will not be operated until the state fire marshal and Arco both are 
satisfied it's safe."  
</P>
<P>
 But while the Four Corners pipeline will remain closed for the time being, a 
new line is in the works.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Pipeline System Inc. is developing plans to lay a 20-inch crude oil 
conduit beneath the Metrolink railway in San Fernando. The tracks -- and the 
proposed line -- run roughly parallel to and just north of San Fernando Road.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Pacific Pipeline met with San Fernando city officials 
recently about the proposed line, which would incorporate new technology and 
safety features including automatic shut-off valves at both ends of the section 
that cuts across city boundaries.  
</P>
<P>
 The line would be constructed with thicker piping in areas near schools and 
where sections of the pipe cross fault lines, company engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The line would connect Emidio, about 60 miles north of Santa Clarita, to 
Wilmington and El Segundo, providing a key link between offshore Santa Barbara 
oil fields and South Bay refineries.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific is proposing the line to eliminate the need for marine tanker 
transportation of crude oil from fields at Point Arguello to Los Angeles 
refineries. Pipeline proposal 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co., owners of a crude oil pipeline that ruptured in 
January after the Northridge quake, recently announced it will keep the 10 
3/4-inch line shut down indefinitely. Meanwhile, Pacific Pipeline System Inc., 
have announced plans to lay a 20-inch crude oil conduit beneath the Metrolink 
train tracks.TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; COUNCIL PANEL OKS MALL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed expansion of the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall entered the final 
stretch of the approval process Tuesday, when it received the blessing of a Los 
Angeles City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Laura Chick and Hal Bernson, of the Planning and Land Use 
Management Committee, both voted in favor of a proposed zone change that would 
allow the expansion, according to Ginny Kruger, planning deputy for Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky. The other committee member, Councilman Richard Alatorre, was 
absent, Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last hurdle for the project will be the City Council's consideration of 
the project, set for next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City Freeholds USA, the mall owner, wants a $20-million expansion project that 
would increase the size of the mall by nearly 20%. The expansion is opposed by 
nearby residents, who say the project will worsen traffic, pollution and noise. 
 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kruger, the council committee approved the zone change with the 
proviso that the budget for a developer-funded Neighborhood Protection Plan -- 
which will pay for raised medians and signs that will discourage shoppers from 
cutting through neighborhoods -- be increased by $75,000 to $175,000. In 
addition, the developer must post a $50,000 bond to make additional 
transportation improvements if they are deemed necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists have complained that they were not given adequate time to 
study a city Planning Commission report approving the zone change before the 
committee meeting. The report came out about noon on Monday, and the committee 
meeting began at about 2 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are questioning why the city Planning Department decided against 
launching a full-scale environmental study of the project when the department's 
Environmental Staff Advisory Committee recommended that one be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planning management is overriding its own staff members' report in order to 
get this thing ramrodded through," charged Jim Young, chairman of the Fashion 
Square Committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger said the commission report basically reflected what the commission 
decided to do Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything here that would be a surprise -- it's exactly what the 
Planning Commission did," Kruger said. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST VALLEY; COUNCIL OKS STUDY OF LAPD COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a wide and coveted strip of the information superhighway runs through Los 
Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department is chugging down that road in a 
technological Edsel, some police and city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 So the City Council passed a plan Tuesday with the hope of studying and 
eventually supercharging the department's archaic (and in some cases 
nonexistent) computer and communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we need more officers on the street," said City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, who introduced the plan. "But we also need to give them the tools to 
fight crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the city to retain a consultant and develop a detailed 
schedule for implementing such modern communications services as an on-line 
information link and a departmentwide computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Just having a personal computer "helps put the bad guys away, so can you 
imagine what a whole computer system could do?" said Chick, the West Valley 
representative on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is getting high-level support, according to Bill Russell, 
commander of the LAPD Support Services Bureau. In a recent planning meeting, 
improving technology ranked third as a department priority, after eliminating 
bias within the department and increasing staff and patrol personnel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of time doing paperwork, and to the extent we can reduce that 
time, it's like hiring extra officers," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the LAPD is one of the largest and most advanced police departments 
in the world, many small-town forces employ more advanced technology, with 
officers writing reports on portable computers, communicating with other 
stations via electronic mail, and doing in-depth research from their desks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devonshire and West Valley divisions are considered among the most 
technologically complex of the department's 18 divisions because they have 
personal computers. Many of those machines are years out of date, however, and 
virtually all were donated.  
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they are not linked through a common system, Chick said, and so 
act as little more than word processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials say the study -- which is due to be completed by spring 
-- should complement the efforts of the Mayor's Alliance for Public Safety, a 
group of business executives already working to raise funds for updating 
crime-fighting technology in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like the Mayor's Alliance is building a highway, and this study 
will help create the vehicles to travel on that highway," Russell said. ERIC

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY FEUD STALLS HOME UPGRADE OF 
ELECTRICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 He's not poor. He's not hungry. In fact, Logan Hubbard of Glendale recently 
added two new bedrooms and a modern kitchen to his stately Mountain Street 
home, and the turkey he and his family will eat this Thanksgiving will be 
catered. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only because the Hubbards' new oven doesn't work. Neither do the 
central air-conditioning and heating and other appliances, due to an ongoing 
dispute with the city and the next-door neighbor that has blocked Hubbard from 
upgrading the home's electrical system to 220 volts. Now, the family says, its 
holidays will be colder, and a bit less merry than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to wear parkas at the dining table. It's embarrassing, because 
we're having our relatives over for Thanksgiving," said Hubbard, who is 
self-employed in telecommunications.  
</P>
<P>
 While Hubbard admits that may be an exaggeration, he said that he, his wife 
and the family's three children have actually been wearing ski clothes to bed 
during the recent spate of chilly nights. What's more, they are actually 
breaking the law by sleeping in their own new bedrooms because the city won't 
grant them a permit to occupy the new sections of the house until the 
electrical system is upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the 900-square-foot addition passed muster with the 
city's building department, inspectors discovered only after the construction 
was finished earlier this year that the city does not have a written easement 
allowing it to dig up the home's existing power line.  
</P>
<P>
 That line runs underneath the back yard of a home owned by Gar Wilson, 
Hubbard's friend and next-door neighbor. To increase the home's voltage supply, 
a higher-capacity cable must be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem that creeps up from time to time," said Bill Hall, the city's 
electrical services administrator. "There's several older developments in town 
where the lot lines and easements weren't well-defined when they were 
originally built, and where we don't have an easement we either have to get one 
or work around it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said he previously was taken advantage of when he granted an 
easement over a property he owned in another city, and he is adamant about not 
allowing his property rights to be infringed upon again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view simply is this is an inappropriate, undesirable, invasive way for the 
city to provide a service to somebody," Wilson said. "They should not do it by 
carving up other people's yards. This is planning of the lowest order." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard has hired an attorney to aid him in his dealings with the city, and 
says he has spent about $5,000 in legal fees, with still no result.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he has two options: to construct an underground connection between his 
home and a power station across the street, which he estimates would cost more 
than $10,000 and require the tearing-up of his sloping front yard, or to sue 
his neighbor. Each of those options he finds unpalatable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On top of all this, my property taxes have gone up because of the addition. 
We're losing every way possible," Hubbard said. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; HOME FOR AGING'S EXPANSION PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jewish Home for the Aging, seeking to expand its residential campus, has 
encountered vigorous opposition to the new construction from its Reseda 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Letter-writing campaigns and petition drives have swept through neighborhoods 
surrounding the elder-care facility. More than 20 residents attended a mid-day 
zoning hearing Monday to testify against a city permit and zone variance needed 
to allow construction to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Green, an associate zoning administrator for the city of Los Angeles, 
will take additional testimony until Dec. 5 before deciding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the single-family, mostly single-story neighborhood resent a 
proposed addition to the home's main building that would raise it from one 
story to five stories. Two three-story buildings would be constructed in 
addition to the two constructed earlier this year. Altogether, the home seeks 
more than 212,000 square feet in new construction on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Home officials also want permission to use five single-family homes in the 
neighborhood to house 40 of the facility's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, officials of the home repeatedly identified it as a 
not-for-profit facility relying on fund-raising and generosity to meet $9 
million of a nearly $22-million budget. One neighbor, however, lambasted the 
home, calling it a big business "operating under the guise of care for the 
elderly . . . (and) encroaching on the rights of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors foresee traffic problems on their quiet, child-laden streets, as 
well as noise pollution from a public address system used during outdoor 
parties, which required calls to the police before they were quieted. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Charlotte Baker testified that "(the proposed construction) would 
constitute an unlawful taking of our property by substantially diminishing its 
value." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Musolff, a resident of the neighborhood since 1956, said he has watched 
the home expand over the years and, until now, never complained. "But this will 
block my view of the mountains," he said, emotion obvious in his voice. "I am 
entitled to that damn view."  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hirsch, a board member of the home, said: "If we have let the neighborhood 
down in any way, we deeply regret it and are willing to do what it takes to 
reach a compromise with them. We have always only wanted to be good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side brought in attorneys to represent them in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents and proponents of the proposal are encouraged to register their 
testimony with Green by mail at the Office of Zoning Administration, Room 600, 
Los Angeles City Hall, 200 N. Spring St., Los Angeles 90012. L.D. STRAUB

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FIRM HIRED TO PLAN AREA'S REVITALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A New York planning firm that devised a much-touted "strategic plan" for 
reinventing downtown Glendale will be called upon again to chart the course for 
the city's fledgling San Fernando Road redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday awarded Cooper, Robertson & 
Partners a $246,000 contract to help create a plan to revitalize the area 
stretching along the city's southern border between Burbank and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 City staffers and a committee overseeing the redevelopment project recommended 
that the agency hire Cooper over two competing firms -- including one whose bid 
for the job was $113,000 -- because it has promised to develop "a long-range 
and illustrative plan of what the project area may become," and because of its 
"vital experience" on the recently completed downtown study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a little bit more visionary. They bring a lot of experience to the 
project and they've worked in Glendale before, so they were the top candidate," 
said Angela Moreno, the Glendale Redevelopment Agency's project manager for the 
San Fernando Road corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope the master plan may be an economic catalyst for the San 
Fernando Road area, which has shown virtually no signs of redevelopment 
activity since the project area was adopted in December, 1992. The area is a 
hodgepodge of industrial companies, auto repair shops, ethnic markets, salvage 
yards and various other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the downtown strategic plan -- which identified areas best suited for 
certain types of business, residential and public development but left much 
leeway for the city and property owners to improvise -- the San Fernando road 
document will set down specific areas where industrial facilities, medical 
buildings, transportation-related projects and other developments can be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The master plan, which is expected to be finished within about nine months, 
will also include information on the present and future costs of land in the 
area and propose ideas for infusing public money to help start up redevelopment 
projects in certain areas. There will also be design guidelines to give 
rebuilding areas a new identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, Robertson & Partners was recruited in 1992 by the Glendale Partners, a 
group of prominent local business people, to create the downtown strategic 
plan, which was jointly financed by the business group and the city for 
$350,000. Much as it did with the previous project, the firm has offered to 
hold meetings with affected property owners, businesses and other groups. STEVE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 1-DAY COLLECTION OF TOXIC WASTES SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners who have been searching for an environmentally safe way to dispose 
of household hazardous wastes now have a solution: Los Angeles County has set 
up a collection center in Malibu that will be open for one day only. 
</P>
<P>
 The free collection will be held Dec. 3 at the Malibu Civic Center at 23519 W. 
Civic Center Way, said Susan Zulusky, recycling coordinator for the city of 
Calabasas. The center will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. that day and will not 
be restricted to Malibu residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have a lot of old containers of insecticides and paints 
hanging around their garages and they don't know what to do with it," said 
Zulusky. "This is a good way to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The center will accept up to a five-gallon container, or 50 pounds of 
hazardous waste, she said. Those limits are based on a state law that prohibits 
motorists from transporting more than that in their vehicles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will accept such wastes as used motor oil, cleaners containing 
acids or lye, paint, car batteries, pesticides and garden herbicides and 
chemicals from hobby and art projects, she said. About 90% of the waste brought 
to the center will be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day collection drive is part of a countywide collection program held 
in various cities throughout the year, said Kathi Delegal, a spokeswoman for 
the Waste Management Division of the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works. Anyone who wants information about collection schedules can call (800) 
552-5218. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county program began in 1988, more than 116,000 people have legally 
disposed of more than 1 million gallons of household hazardous waste, said 
Delegal. More than half of that was paint, she said. More than 230,000 gallons 
of motor oil was collected during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 The collections are designed to prevent people from dumping the wastes down 
sewers or into the ground, Delegal said. Wastes poured down sewer drains often 
end up in the ocean, while wastes poured into the ground can pollute ground 
water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Delegal also suggested giving some of the wastes to someone who needs them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around, there might be church groups or other organizations that need 
this stuff," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She also urged homeowners to check labels to see if wastes can be used for 
other purposes around the home. FRANK MANNING

VALLEY BRIEFING: IN HOT WATER; CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS RECYCLING PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since it was built in 1984, the waste water treatment plant serving most 
of the San Fernando Valley has been a source of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from nearby neighborhoods complain that the Donald C. Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant, located in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, has spoiled 
valuable parkland and emitted noxious odors. About 75 residents attended a 
public hearing to complain about the odors just last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest flap involves a portion of a long-term growth plan that says 
Tillman should expand by 50% by 2010. The Department of Public Works now says 
that projection is in error and that no expansion is anticipated over the next 
16 years. But the department's assurances have not calmed residents, who have 
long viewed the facility with suspicion. Department officials, meanwhile, say 
they are just trying to serve a growing community. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is one of four waste water treatment plants operated by the Los 
Angeles Bureau of Sanitation. Together they treat waste water produced by 4 
million people in a 600-square-mile area. Tillman operates around the clock and 
employs more than 100 people. It processes about 67 million gallons of waste 
water a day. 
</P>
<P>

 A family of four produces an average of 281 gallons of waste water daily.

into Tillman.

<P>
 Solid waste piped to Hyperion Treatment Plant in El Segundo; after more 
processing it is used as fertilizer in Arizona and the Antelope Valley or 
burned as fuel to run the treatment plant. Reclamation Process

 Typically, 0.05 to 0.1% of waste water is organic and inorganic materials. The 
Tillman plant removes more than 65 tons of such debris daily.

CHILD-SLAYING SUSPECT PLEADS NOT GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Woodland Hills man accused of kidnaping, raping and murdering an 8-year-old 
girl pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Tuesday as lawyers began to pick 
a jury to hear his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooman Ashkan Panah, 23, earlier had denied charges he killed Nicole Parker, 
whose body was found a year ago stuffed in a suitcase in Panah's closet a day 
after she disappeared. He was indicted by a grand jury in February,  
</P>
<P>
 The insanity plea sets the stage for as many as three mini-trials in the case. 
The first would determine whether Panah killed Nicole, the second whether he 
was legally sane at the time, and a possible third to decide whether he should 
receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Sandy Kriegler appointed two psychiatrists Tuesday to 
examine Panah, one on behalf of the prosecution and the other for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case proceeds to a sanity phase, the jury will be asked to determine 
whether Panah knew the difference between right and wrong and understood what 
he was doing when he killed Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is scheduled to begin Dec. 5, and attorneys expect the trial to last 
about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, who lived across a courtyard from Nicole's father in a sprawling 
apartment complex on Ventura Boulevard, was charged with the child's murder 
after her body was found. Prosecutors said she also had been raped and 
sodomized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grisly finding followed a frantic weekend search for the child, who had 
been playing in the courtyard near Panah's apartment before she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah came to the attention of police after a suicide attempt when he slashed 
his wrists and swallowed over-the-counter sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
 He later gave detectives a statement, which Kriegler recently ruled could be 
used by prosecutor Peter Berman at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key piece of prosecution evidence is a blood-spattered notebook found 
in Panah's BMW. It contained an apology to the child's family, but blamed the 
killing on "evil, psychotic" people.

BEATING SUSPECT SEIZED NEAR COLLEGE AFTER STREET CHASE; VAN NUYS: SOUTH-CENTRAL 
L.A. MAN FACES CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THEFT OF AN ENCINO WOMAN'S VAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who police say beat an Encino woman, then pushed her out of her van and 
ran over her, was arrested Tuesday morning near Valley College after a nearly 
hourlong chase through Valley streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hag Mahmoud Tahir, 34, of South-Central Los Angeles, will face charges ranging 
from robbery to assault for his actions Tuesday morning, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began at around 8 a.m. when Tahir allegedly drove his car in 
front of a van driven by an Encino woman, cutting her off, said LAPD Detective 
Mel Arnold. Tahir then ran screaming to the van and started pounding on the 
windows, asking to be let in. The 44-year-old woman opened the door, Tahir 
climbed in, and ordered her to drive, Arnold said. Tahir also struck the woman, 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 After driving a few blocks, the woman was pushed out of the van onto Sepulveda 
Boulevard, according to two eyewitnesses, John Hanna and Rick Rahimzadeh of 
Express Plumbing in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 They were driving south on Sepulveda Boulevard when they saw the van weaving 
toward them, a man and woman fighting at the wheel.  
</P>
<P>
 Then "the (driver's) door popped open," said Rahimzadeh, 32. "Her feet were 
hanging out first. She was screaming and kicking and the horn was beeping." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna jumped out to help the woman while Rahimzadeh followed the van and 
called 911 on his cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was run over by the van, and taken to the hospital. She was found 
to have suffered "minor injuries," according to Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted by the call, police converged on the van as it crossed Sepulveda and 
Burbank boulevards. A chase at moderate speeds followed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's standard procedure, said Sgt. Joseph Brazas. "It worked just like it 
was supposed to. He stopped at intersections," said Brazas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 a.m. Tahir surrendered, getting out of the van at Burbank Boulevard 
and Fulton Avenue.

TOKYO CUSTOMS OFFICIALS CONFISCATE GIFT TURKEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanksgiving is not celebrated in Japan, but Tokyo customs officials may be 
enjoying a turkey dinner anyway, thanks to a well-intentioned local 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Watanabe thought he would surprise a colleague stuck in Japan for 
Thanksgiving by sending him a frozen, precooked turkey.But because the 12-pound 
Butterball turkey was sent without the proper documents from the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, Japanese officials will not allow the bird to clear 
customs at Narita International Airport, outside Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Any meat sent to Japan must have a special label on the package in addition to 
the USDA stamp of approval found on all meat sold in grocery stores, said 
Amelia Sebastian of the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebastian said the consulate does not get many inquires about sending meat to 
Japan. But of the few who do call, "most usually forget it after we tell them 
how hard it is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Goodman of Box Brothers in Glendale, who Watanabe hired to ship the bird, 
said he tried several overseas shipping companies before finding one that would 
make the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 The frozen turkey -- which was packed in dry ice and shipped Friday -- arrived 
in Japan on Saturday, where it has been sitting ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "That bird is slowly becoming sushi," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight shipping company admitted its error and has apologized, said 
Watanabe, who works for Dassault Systems of America, a software firm in

FATHER, 23, KILLED BY ROBBER WHILE WIFE FLEES WITH BABY

 The robber grabbed Jose Torres Jr. by the neck and began dragging him away 
from his car while he held his 4-month-old son, police said. Torres' wife 
leaped from the passenger side of the car and grabbed the baby, as Torres told 
her to run into their apartment building and call the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of gunshots that police said killed her 23-year-old husband echoed 
through the apartment unit from where she was calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives said Torres died Tuesday after spending the 
night in Northridge Hospital Medical Center's intensive care unit. Police were 
searching for the man who shot him in the head and shoulder Monday night after 
Torres refused to give up his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres had driven his family into the parking lot of their Panorama City 
apartment building about 8:30 p.m. As he left the car, he was grabbed by the 
robber, LAPD Sgt. Joseph Brazas said. Torres told the robber he was carrying a 
baby, and managed to hand the child to his wife, who fled inside the 
three-story building, Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber took Torres' wallet, which contained no money, Brazas said. They 
then began to struggle, and the robber shot Torres twice, in the head and 
shoulder, with a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' wife, meanwhile, ran into the building and pounded on the doors of 
several units. Two boys, Steve Bustillos, 15, and Ricky Hardiman, 12, answered 
her pleas. As she used their phone, the youths said, they heard the gunshots 
and ran out with another friend. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived at the parking lot they saw the robber flee. Bustillos said 
the robber ducked through a tear in the chain fence by the gated lot and ran to 
the street. The boys then ran to Torres.  
</P>
<P>
 Bustillos said that while cars in the lot are occasionally broken into or 
vandalized, this is the first violence at the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in this building tries to keep things up," chasing off taggers and 
vandals, Bustillos said.

YESTERDAYLAND; NOSTALGIA: EVERY CHANGE AT DISNEYLAND BRINGS A REACTION FROM 
VISITORS. OFTEN THEY ARE UPSET BY REPLACEMENT OF SOMETHING THEY REMEMBER FONDLY 
FROM PAST VISITS -- EVEN IF IT WASN'T VERY POPULAR. WHAT DOOMS AN ATTRACTION? 
IF IT ISN'T MOVING, IT MIGHT BE MOVED OUT. 
</P>

<P>
 Peggy Winder, visiting Disneyland from Racine, Wis., for perhaps the 20th time 
in her 48 years, said something seemed different. But she couldn't put her 
finger on it. 
</P>
<P>
 She searched Tomorrowland's panorama for a clue. Finally she glanced up and 
saw it. The Skyway, whose four-passenger gondolas rode an aerial cable between 
Tomorrowland and Fantasyland since 1956, were gone. She was standing on a new 
patch of asphalt where a support tower had been uprooted only four days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Winder was angry -- no, hurt. "How would they do that?" she said. But what she 
meant was, how could they do that to me?  
</P>
<P>
 "The baby boomers miss these old rides the most," said David Koenig, a baby 
boomer who grew up going to Disneyland and recently published an unofficial 
history of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a Disneyana convention over the summer. The Disney people announced 
a minor change in Storybook Land -- a scene from 'Aladdin' was going to replace 
a scene from 'Mr. Toad' -- and these people started booing. These people just 
don't want Disneyland to change." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has, does and will, say Disneyland planners. Of the 38 attractions 
operating during 1955, the park's first year, only 17 remain, some in altered 
form. In all, about two dozen Disneyland attractions have been closed or 
replaced, but only one has ever been saved by public outcry. Two attempts to 
replace "Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln," in which a realistic Lincoln robot 
delivers a speech, were thwarted by what a Disney executive called a "deluge" 
of letters and telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony, says Disney management, is that "Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln" 
was one of the park's lowest-volume attractions and remains so today. People 
love it, but they don't go to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like music," said Craig Smith, Disneyland's director of 
attractions. "It's associated with certain things in your life and reminds you 
of them. I remember when they tore down the Sunshine Broiler on Harbor 
Boulevard. I met my first girlfriend there. How can they pull out the Sunshine 
Broiler?!" Smith can answer the question when it comes to Disneyland. What 
dooms an attraction there is one or a combination of three factors: "being too 
passive, low attendance or we could put something better there." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not even that simple, he conceded. "America Sings" was closed because 
it was too passive and therefore poorly attended; visitors merely sat and 
watched robot animals perform. But still open is "Country Bear Jamboree," in 
which visitors merely sit to watch robot animals perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, according to Smith, is that the bear show is "a critical 
element of that particular area, Critter Country. We put 'America Sings' in 
Tomorrowland, and it was a borderline fit." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the reason that while Disneyland disposed of all its pony and mule rides 
because the creatures were troublesome to control, it maintained the 
horse-drawn streetcars on Main Street. They were just too important to the 
image, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to have things moving. It gives a kinetic focal point. It gives 
movement to the area. The streetcars were such a key element, they were 
probably the featured thing on Main Street." Some departed attractions are 
still mourned. "People always ask about the House of the Future, and they 
remember Skull Rock and Pirate's Cove and the Mickey Mouse Club Theatre and the 
Flying Saucers," said publicist John McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some fall into the good-riddance category as far as 
Disneyland management is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Flying Saucers, opened in 1961. Great fun. Huge fans blew air through 
holes in the floor, lifting the one-person saucers like Hovercraft. Riders 
could steer by leaning, making the saucers act like bumper cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my favorite ride," said visitor Elden Buckler, 50, of Wichita, Kan., 
"but it took forever to get on because it was always breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
 The official history of Disneyland declared the saucers a "maintenance 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have attractions with good reliability," said Smith. "We have to 
have operating reliability in the high, high 90 percents. If an attraction goes 
down, we upset guests. With the Flying Saucers, it was just awful." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Koenig, the ride also frightened safety managers. A boom that 
would sweep the saucers to one side at ride's end was powerful enough to maim 
anyone who fell onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Phantom Boats, 1955. You have to be a real old-timer to remember these. 
They were ugly little motorboats with grotesque tail fins that were even more 
unreliable than the Flying Saucers. Randy Bright, author of the park's official 
history, wrote that "each boat that left the dock seemed to have only a 50-50 
chance of making it back without having to be towed." 
</P>
<P>
 The boats were redesigned after two years, then removed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mule Pack, 1956. Most horse- and pony-drawn rides like stagecoaches, fire 
wagons and surreys were gone by 1960 after accidents like a stagecoach 
capsizing and another being carried away without a driver. The mules persisted, 
however, until even Walt Disney admitted they, too, were a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers complained that the mules often refused to budge, sometimes just 
sitting down mid-ride. Worse, they enjoyed nibbling on the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember as a little girl, one of them ate the hat on the girl in front of 
me," said visitor Linda Westmoreland of San Diego. "I laughed until my mule 
reached around and started eating my skirt. Then I screamed." 
</P>
<P>
 * The House of the Future, 1957. "I thought it was boring, but people always 
ask about it," said McClintock. An X-shaped house on a low pedestal, it was 
intended by its sponsor, Monsanto, to show how chemistry would provide us with 
virtually our entire domestic environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was plastic," recalled visitor William Arnett of San Francisco. 
"Even the house and furniture were plastic. I remember it was the first time I 
ever saw a microwave oven, although I forget what they called it then. It was 
really pretty nifty." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the future came nearer, the house became less of a wow, and Monsanto 
wanted something different. The house was demolished, and Monsanto instead 
sponsored . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Adventure Thru Inner Space, 1967. Riders entered two-person cars that seemed 
to envelop you like a cocoon, carrying you into a giant microscope and through 
a particularly dark ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to explain the structure of molecules and atoms, but the ride 
was popular among dating couples for a different reason. Some found the seeming 
isolation in the dark an invitation to fool around. 
</P>
<P>
 The isolation was an illusion, however; ride operators were stationed 
throughout to keep an eye on things, and according to Koenig, they quickly 
dubbed the ride "Adventure Thru Inner Course." Koenig said a common prank was 
to tell inquiring couples that the ride took much longer than it actually did, 
then gather at the exit to see the couple emerge suddenly into the light. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride maintained its popularity but was removed to make way for "Star 
Tours," a high-tech ride based on the "Star Wars" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rocket to the Moon, 1955. Visitors sat in a room where projected images and 
vibrating seats gave the illusion of space flight. But it suffered from 
Tomorrowland disease; that is, it couldn't remain futuristic for very long. 
Redesigned twice to stay ahead of reality, its reincarnation as Mission to Mars 
was doomed after spacecraft really did reach Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to keep Tomorrowland fresh "is like chasing your tail," said Smith. 
Most closed or replaced attractions have been associated with Tomorrowland, and 
another overhaul of that area is planned by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 But no attractions are yet marked for extinction, Smith said. When the new 
Indiana Jones attraction opens in Adventureland in February, "We think we'll be 
pretty much where we want to be. Nothing's about to be put out to pasture. But 
we're thinking about it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrowland planners have only a goal, to make the new Tomorrowland somehow 
more durable by making it agelessly futuristic. "Maybe it could be a retro look 
at the future," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which would bring Tomorrowland nearly full circle. It's "20,000 Leagues Under 
the Sea" exhibit -- sets and props from the Disney movie of Jules Verne's 1870 
science fiction novel -- was closed 28 years ago. It may be forgotten, but it's 
not gone. Today pieces of the exhibit are incorporated into other attractions. 
For example, Capt. Nemo's pipe organ is part of the Haunted Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "What strikes me as kind of interesting is how some of these extinct 
attractions can still be seen around the park," said Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mine train that was replaced by Big Thunder Mountain -- you can still see 
pieces of track and the cars here and there. You can still see the graveyard 
from the Indian village. The rigging from the pirate ship in Fantasyland was 
incorporated into the Peter Pan ride when they rebuilt Fantasyland." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you yearn for the nostalgia of date night in the old Inner Space ride, 
look closely on the right when your Star Tours spacecraft goes "out of control" 
in its hangar. You'll see a huge microscope lying there, its only purpose to 
remind you of days gone by. Major Attractions That Have Come and Gone at

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; ANY WAY IS A GOOD WAY TO GIVE THANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank God we don't feel the way we used to about the late fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, we expressed our gratitude to the higher power by sacrificing 
a goat or a passing stranger as soon as the last ear of corn was picked. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of the first Thanksgiving, all that had changed and most of us 
were making short prayers of blessing and thanks over roast turkey and a 
steamed vegetable platter. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's how it is in the movie "Squanto," where the Native Americans 
offer humble and respectful words to the creator as Colonists pass around 
squash bowls filled with mixed vegetables that look as if they came straight 
from Rosie's kitchen. But nowadays, many people say grace only when relatives 
come over, or not at all. Atheists, naturally, don't believe in Anyone to 
thank. Dieters, of course, probably feel more resentment than gratitude toward 
a plate loaded with fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with established religious or cultural traditions have no problem 
knowing what to say. Rabbi David Eliezrie of the North Orange County Chabad 
Center said observant Jews have offered the same simple blessing over every 
meal for thousands of years: 
</P>
<P>
 "Blessed are you Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings forth bread 
from the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The British have always taken a sensible approach, as in this prayer found at 
Chester Cathedral: "Give me a good digestion, Lord/And also something to 
digest." 
</P>
<P>
 A blessing from Africa evokes natural traditions: "We swim in your grace like 
a whale in the ocean. The saying goes, 'An ocean never dries up,' but we know 
your grace also never fails. This food you have given us is one more proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Young children have always had their own silent favorites, a perennial being: 
"Past the teeth and through the gums, look out stomach, here it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 But modern adults can find some updated ideas in such books as "Table Graces" 
(Peter Pauper Press, 1986). There are graces for: 
</P>
<P>
 * rationalizers ("If we deny ourselves adequate food or a balanced diet, we 
violate God's plan. Help us, Lord, to eat wisely."); 
</P>
<P>
 * environmentalists ("Help us to ensure that our food shall be free from 
radioactive contamination."); 
</P>
<P>
 * socially conscious but guilty philosophers ("The bellies of Third World 
children swell through malnutrition, but the only way our bellies swell is 
through overeating. We wonder what God's plan on this Earth must be."). 
</P>
<P>
 Some sentiments appear frighteningly similar to the old days.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1977 book "Table Prayers," author Mildred Tengbom reprints a dire song 
by someone named "Mother Mary Owen": 
</P>
<P>
 "God loves me and he gives me food and very good food he gives. It makes me 
big and it makes me strong and my body grows and lives. If he didn't give me 
food, I would die, die, die. I would simply fade away. So I'll tell him now 
that I'm very glad that he loves me so today." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, some people think it's best to leave well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Levy of Eagle Rock said his Thanksgiving gatherings are very modern and 
civilized, including as they have his wife's ex-husband (and his father) and 
their daughter, his mother-in-law and her two ex-husbands and current 
companion. Because Levy and his wife consider themselves secular humanists, 
they don't usually say anything anyway over the turkey and trimmings before 
they dig in.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just call the people in," he said. "We might say something like, 'Hey, 
people, the food's ready!' " Then, he said, "We just eat." 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, he said, they run the leftovers over to Hennacy House in Boyle 
Heights, a commune of Catholic Workers who annually invite 50 Skid Row regulars 
to join them for Thanksgiving.  
</P>
<P>
 There the hosts are believers and the guests are presumably grateful for food. 
The words are informal and spontaneous. Said community member Kieran Prather: 
"We all gather in a side yard and hold hands and invite one of the guests to 
make up a grace or say something they know." 
</P>
<P>
 The point is to offer a family environment as well as free food, he said. If 
they're grateful, fine; if not, that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully," he said, "everyone is." Treat Yourself Like Company 
</P>
<P>
 If you'll be spending part or all of the holiday season alone, psychologist 
Amy Stark offers the following tips:  
</P>
<P>
 * Examine your motivations for wanting to spend the holidays alone. Make sure 
that it is really a choice and not that you're playing the martyr.  
</P>
<P>
 * If you choose to spend the holidays alone, don't feel guilty. "It's your 
choice," Stark says. "If you feel good about the decision and are happy, then 
what does it matter what other people think?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at the time to yourself as a welcome thing. Realize you don't have the 
pressure of pleasing anyone else and take advantage by doing something you 
enjoy.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't deny yourself a celebration just because you're alone. "Put up a tree 
or decorate," Stark says. "Do whatever you want to make the holiday festive." 
</P>
<P>
 * Treat yourself like company. "Don't say, 'It's just me, so why bother,' " 
Stark says. "You're the most important person, so treat yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 When she's spending Christmas alone, Stark makes herself Danish fruit soup 
from an old family recipe. "I love that soup," she says. "I sit down on 
Christmas Eve and enjoy every spoonful."

DANA PARSONS: AN UNFORTUNATE RESPONSE TO THE HOMELESS IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's never been fun to be poor, and it's getting less fun all the time. The 
enemies used to be starvation and joblessness. Now, they're your fellow 
citizens, wanting like the devil to legislate you away. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing was no doubt accidental, but it says something, doesn't it, that 
Thanksgiving 1994 provides the backdrop for citizen complaints about the 
homeless and foodless? 
</P>
<P>
 In this California year of peace and goodwill toward some, there are certain 
sentiments that just can't wait for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlines this week were that some Costa Mesa residents want the city to 
cut back its permits to private agencies serving the homeless. No permit, no 
ability to house and feed the homeless. The logic appears seamless. One citizen 
argued that the agencies are "the magnets, short and simple. And as long as 
they're here, the homeless are going to keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Note that the argument isn't that the homeless will suddenly and miraculously 
have shelter and food; no, it's just that they won't be hanging around Costa 
Mesa anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time (and it does seem like a couple fairylands ago), we prided 
ourselves on taking care of the more unfortunate among us. Now, not even the 
spirit of Thanksgiving keeps us from blasting the presence of so many lost 
souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment behind the Costa Mesa citizenry is nothing more than that of 
Proposition 187 in search of its next group of have-nots. If we can ward off 
"undesirables" by denying education and medicine, why not food too? 
</P>
<P>
 Who's next? Indeed, one more down-and-out group, and maybe we can get the wave 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Costa Mesa scenario, its citizens are playing the role that 
Californians played en masse during the Proposition 187 debate. Why, they ask, 
should they pay a disproportionate share of the cost for a social problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget for a moment that Costa Mesans aren't paying for the homeless. It's 
more a matter of having to see them more than the rest of us do, and their 
visibility is unsettling. Residents claim the homeless are committing crimes, 
and police confirmed that, saying they're largely of the misdemeanor variety, 
such as trespassing, public drunkenness and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the spirit of 187, Costa Mesans seek a solution that doesn't 
address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Costa Mesa residents have to put up with trespassing, drunkenness and 
public urination? Absolutely not, and people committing those crimes should be 
accountable. But shutting down soup kitchens doesn't attack crime; it attacks 
eating. And just for the sake of argument, if you didn't have a home, where 
would you go to the bathroom? 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Cusmano, a spokeswoman for the Mental Health Assn. of Orange County, 
says about 35% to 40% of the homeless have mental problems. After the severe 
cutback in recent years of mental health facilities, how surprising that we now 
find them on the streets. If those mentally disturbed people could piece it all 
together, they might wonder how a society could first kick them out of 
hospitals and then kick them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in their diminished capacity, they must ask: Is there somewhere else to 
go? 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa residents understandably feel put upon. Other than the fact that 
three shelters happen to be in their city, there's no particular reason why 
that city should do any more for the homeless than any other town. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor Sandra L. Genis sounded exactly the right note by saying the 
homeless in the area have responsibilities too. 
</P>
<P>
 Cusmano said the public doesn't realize that agencies are trying hard to 
rehabilitate some homeless people, and that many are directed to independent 
living. As a group they are not violent, she said, because if they were, 
"they'd have plenty of money to live." 
</P>
<P>
 This issue isn't about Costa Mesa citizens. It's about all of us, and how we 
plan to deal with society's most unfortunate or deprived citizens. Homelessness 
isn't solely Costa Mesa's problem, any more than illegal immigration is solely 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
 All Costa Mesa is doing is holding up a mirror for the rest of us to look 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Cusmano whether people are getting colder and harder toward their 
fellow man. I asked her to take a guess as to what people are thinking these 
days, as they contemplate closing down soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people don't know what to feel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I think she's right, but for a county whose residents tell pollsters that they 
want Judeo-Christian values stressed, I dug up one. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it could form the basis of a prayer in school some day: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three 
days, and have nothing to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The quote was in the Book of Mark and was attributed to a man named Jesus.

THANKSGIVING HAS VOLUNTEERS APLENTY; CHRISTMAS AID SOUGHT 
</P>

 Cyndi Brown wanted to help. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old accountant, who recently moved to Costa Mesa from Walnut, 
contacted the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County, which refers hundreds 
of volunteers to more than 1,200 agencies. But like scores of others this week, 
Brown was told need for Thanksgiving Day volunteers already had been met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disappointed," Brown said. "My intent was to get out and do 
something, but I don't know where to go now." 
</P>
<P>
 While officials of nonprofit agencies are grateful for a bounty of 
Thanksgiving Day volunteers this year, they say the situation is unique to this 
holiday. On any other day, officials say, agencies still have a pressing need 
for help, particularly with Christmas on the way. Agencies across the county 
already are calling on the community to volunteer time and to donate food, toys 
and especially new items of clothing for the upcoming holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually do hit capacity on Thanksgiving," said Jeff Urbaniec, a spokesman 
for United Way in Irvine. "A lot of people want to participate on that day for 
the moment. But there's still a need with Christmas coming up."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials attribute the large volunteer turnout for Thanksgiving Day to a 
raised social awareness fueled by a lingering recession and a traditional 
spirit of giving that surfaces around the holidays.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been swamped with calls," said Lovette Tucker, coordinator for the 
volunteer center. "I think people are more aware of what's going on during 
Thanksgiving, so people are putting volunteering on their schedules much 
earlier and doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Walters, another volunteer center spokeswoman, said it seems to her that 
"people get a little more sentimental at Thanksgiving. They get more heartfelt. 
It's like their New Year's resolution kicks in early." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana agency has matched hundreds of volunteers with agencies in need 
this holiday. But some charities, not able to get the word out through the 
volunteer network, still need Thanksgiving Day help. For example, the Southwest 
Community Center in Santa Ana, which will feed an estimated 500 people a 
holiday meal, are seeking 30 more volunteers to shore up their crew Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason this year, it's been a little tougher getting volunteers," 
said Connie J. Jones, executive director of the 24-year-old agency. "We need 
help serving, cleaning up and helping to distribute donated clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say it's too early to tell whether Christmas contributions will be 
up or down compared to last year. United Way in Orange County has received $9.8 
million so far, roughly the same amount it collected last year during the same 
10-month period. But as large corporations begin to make their sizable seasonal 
contributions, officials are optimistic they will reach their goal of $20.2 
million by the end of this January, Urbaniec said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army officials just launched their traditional "Red Kettle" 
fund-raising drive. But they anticipate the number of families requesting 
Christmas assistance will rise sharply, said Capt. Lee Lescano. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Salvation Army provided Christmas food and toys to about 6,800 
families locally. This year, the number could go as high as 10,000, Lescano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way officials add the recent cold spell has highlighted the crucial 
need for clothes for the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the things people take for granted," Urbaniec said. "It's been 
record-breaking cold and these people are having trouble surviving because they 
can't get warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing Inc., one of the hundreds of county agencies which 
aids the needy during the holidays, is feeling the crunch and is asking for 
donations of items, especially toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't had stuff start to come in yet," said executive director 
Margie Wakeham, whose organization hands out Christmas gifts to the needy. "The 
kids would like to have something to play with." Giving on Thanksgiving 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's food pantries and community centers will provide free 
Thanksgiving meals Thursday. Some organizations also will have live 
entertainment and raffles. For example, at Bluebird Park in Laguna Beach, local 
amateur singers will perform at the Friendship Shelter for Thanksgiving Day 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Casa Garcia of Anaheim, a mariachi group and other bands will entertain 
for the thousands expected for its annual feast. Last year, 10,000 people were 
served.

THIEF OF WOMEN'S HEARTS, MONEY CONVICTED; BACKGROUND: WIFE RECALLS HER FIRST 
HUSBAND, WHO SHE THOUGHT WAS DEAD, AS A SMOOTH-TALKING MANIPULATOR OF WOMEN WHO 
WANTED THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. 
</P>

<P>
 For 14 years, Barbara Brunette thought her first husband was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she spotted his picture in a newspaper and found out that James 
Borzynski, the 45-year-old accused con man who had fathered her son, was not 
only alive but on trial here for swindling other women. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Brunette, 49, said she wasn't surprised at the 
allegations against Borzynski because he had a history of deceiving women. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette said she is glad he was convicted Tuesday of three counts of grand 
theft for swindling three women out of $87,000 and now faces more than five 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dear, little hubby got convicted," Brunette said from her home in 
Glendale, Ariz., where she works as a mobile-home saleswoman. "He was pulling 
this crap when we were married, and it was time to put a stop to it."  
</P>
<P>
 Brunette said she married Borzynski in 1970 in Waukegan, Ill. They eventually 
moved to Milwaukee, where Borzynski got a job as a used-car salesman for 
Chevrolet. But in 1974, after discovering his affairs with two other women, she 
said, including an 18-year-old who had believed he was single, Brunette said 
she told him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did to that girl was enough for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's investigators said Borzynski married the young woman. 
Brunette said that if he did, he did it without first obtaining a divorce from 
her. The young woman eventually committed suicide, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette said she tried to contact Borzynski in 1980, because she wanted to 
marry another man and needed a divorce. But several of his family members told 
her he had died in a car accident, she said. Brunette said she believes she was 
told he was dead to keep her from trying to seek child support. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette remarried and moved to Arizona where she raised her son, who is now 
24. In 1991, her second husband, Henry Brunette, died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, five months ago, a friend in Los Angeles spotted a Times article and 
photo of Borzynski and sent it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock here a couple of days," Brunette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette, however, said she was not surprised by the charges of theft because 
Borzynski was always a smooth talker who wanted the best of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always show and tell with him," she said. "He had to have the best 
clothes, the nicest car, the best home. He'd only go to clubs and lounges. 
There was no going to a corner bar and shooting pool with this guy. You had to 
go someplace where high society went. He was always trying to impress someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette said she felt so strongly about what she knew of his past that she 
volunteered to testify against him, despite a call from Borzynski who begged 
her not to. Orange County Sheriff's Investigator Cliff Deller said prosecutors 
considered calling Brunette as a rebuttal witness in the event Borzynski 
testified. But Borzynski declined to take the stand last week and so Brunette 
was not needed, Deller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunette said she would have been able to give jurors facts about Borzynski's 
background, but she would never be able to explain his behavior completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was a woman-hater," Brunette said. "He seemed to love women, but 
just to benefit himself. But I could never figure it out -- what made him tick 
or why he hated women. He's just been that way."  
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski's defense attorney, Dennis P. O'Connell, said he was aware of the 
two wives in Borzynski's past. He said he believes Borzynski's second wife 
committed suicide because she was upset that her mother was dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as allegations that Borzynski hates women, O'Connell said that only an 
expert could make that judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get high emotions in a case like this and it's hard to tell who's telling 
the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D'Agostino said he is now investigating evidence 
that Borzynski may have yet two more wives to whom he is currently married.

NATIVE DISHES; PROFESSOR NOTES THAT THANKSGIVING FEASTS PRECEDED THE PILGRIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As families prepare for their Thanksgiving feasts, a Chapman University 
sociology professor reminds celebrants that one of today's most popular 
American holidays was founded on the blood, land and history of Native American 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanksgiving is a happy time for sharing. But we need to remember there is a 
dual reality . . . when reflecting upon the origins of this holiday," said 
Professor Paul Apodaca, himself of Navajo, Mexican and Spanish descent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earliest colonial encounters, Apodaca said, there was both a 
willingness to give and the determination to conquer. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Thanksgiving dinner traces its origins to the Iroquois' annual Green 
Corn Dance, which the pilgrims joined in celebration of the harvest. It was a 
tradition established long before the settlers began to observe a Thanksgiving 
ritual in 1621, and is still practiced in some Native American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was also the often ignored Pequote War at Block Island, R.I., where 
600 to 700 Pequote Indians were massacred in 1637 by colonists, who marked the 
conquest with a victory feast that colonial leader John Endicott decreed the 
official Thanksgiving Day in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 As traditions evolve through generations, Apodaca said, the bad is frequently 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Native Americans are usually the only ones who remember the tragedies," 
Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Sarracino, a member of the Creek Seminole tribe, spent the lunch hour 
Tuesday teaching Newport Beach elementary school pupils about what types of 
food that actually graced the tables at the first Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to 35 Mariners Elementary third-graders dressed in beaded T-shirts 
and feathered headdresses, Sarracino explained that food was the crucial link 
between the newly arrived settlers and agriculturally rich indigenous peoples 
during the colonial period. 
</P>
<P>
 While children tasted dishes cooked with venison, duck and leeks, ingredients 
used in the original Thanksgiving meal, Sarracino debunked the widely held idea 
that roasted turkey and mashed potatoes were served at the 1621 dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The culinary experience was quite a surprise for some youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know they didn't have glasses and Sprite back then," said 8-year-old 
Jennifer Grummerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing traditional Indian garb, Sarracino told the children her family 
sometimes cooks turkey for Thanksgiving, but stews and breads commonly used by 
all 500 Indian nations usually adorn the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Green Corn Dance, which takes its name from the light green 
husks of the newly harvested corn, Sarracino said corn was a native American 
foodstuff that was a very important staple in the diet of Native Americans, and 
remains an important element of the world's food consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Apodaca said that because many European foods were based on cereals such as 
wheat and barley, plants vulnerable to wind and hail, the European continent 
was frequently stricken by famine. But foods native to the Americas, such as 
potatoes, chilies and beans, are heartier and have higher nutritional value, 
Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Native American foods created the Europe that we think of," said Apodaca, 
attributing Europe's population growth during the 17th to the 20th centuries to 
foods imported from the New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing European and African population growth during that 300-year span, 
Apodaca said the better nourished Europeans increased sixfold in number, while 
population growth in Africa only doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 With the largest Native American population in the country (more than 242,000 
according to the 1990 U.S. Census), California has a special reason to cherish 
Native American history, Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Native Americans are true patriots, carrying alone both negative and positive 
memories in American history," he said.

THIEF OF WOMEN'S HEARTS, MONEY CONVICTED; COURTS: JAMES BORZYNSKI IS FOUND 
GUILTY OF SWINDLING 3 LOCAL WOMEN OUT OF $87,000. PROMISES OF LOVE BECAME HIS 
ACCESS TO CASH FROM AS MANY AS 10 VICTIMS. 
</P>

<P>
 The case was spicier than "Peyton Place," more provocative than "Oprah," said 
jurors who deliberated just two hours Tuesday before convicting a Laguna Niguel 
used-car dealer of romancing three women and then swindling them out of 
$87,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting for the TV movie," said juror Cindy Kindinger of Foothill Ranch. 
"I want to see how he could be so intense that he could get money from these 
women in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 James Borzynski, 45, was convicted of three counts of grand theft and a felony 
enhancement charge of "excessive taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of an Orange County Superior Court jury said they had little 
difficulty finding Borzynski guilty because they believed the five women who 
testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The women described how Borzynski posed as a Newport Beach attorney in trouble 
with the IRS and promised them love and marriage to wheedle them out of their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the women, all from Orange County, pressed charges. The other 
women, however, came from Northern California to testify as witnesses during 
the weeklong trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The behavior was continuing to the very end, to the very day he was 
arrested," said jury foreman Roger Camp, referring to a dinner date Borzynski 
missed the night of Nov. 4, 1993, because police took him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed that he just wasn't going to stop," said Camp, of Huntington Beach. 
"Not unless we stopped him." 
</P>
<P>
 Their one regret, jurors said, was not being able to see Borzynski in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was so hypnotic about his behavior?" Camp asked. "That was something we 
would have liked to have seen, but never will. That remains the one mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski bowed his head slightly as the verdict was read. A bailiff then led 
him out of the courtroom to jail, where he will be held without bail until 
sentencing on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a maximum of five years and four months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Borzynski's defense attorney said his client was 
"extremely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 "His concerns were that the victims were being held in a sympathetic light and 
that would make it difficult for him to prevail," said attorney Dennis P. 
O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell contended that Borzynski did nothing wrong because he was always 
honest about being in financial difficulties.  
</P>
<P>
 "Have they been defrauded, have they been misled when they know he has 
nothing?" O'Connell asked. "They haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he will appeal the verdict and will ask that Borzynski be 
placed on probation so that he can have an opportunity to pay the women back. 
It's a chance, O'Connell said, that Borzynski has always wanted. Since being 
released on bail several months ago, Borzynski has been working as a used-car 
salesman in Fremont, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D'Agostino said Borzynski deserves prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on his prior record, the amount of loss here and the viciousness of his 
behavior, we're going to ask for a lengthy prison sentence," D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski was arrested in Tiburon, Calif., after 10 California women alleged 
he swindled them out of as much as $150,000. Many of the women were too 
embarrassed about being duped to press charges, said Orange County Sheriff 
Investigator Cliff Deller. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Borzynski answered personal ads from women seeking 
companionship and then posed as a widowed Newport Beach attorney who needed 
money to pay back taxes for his deceased wife's estate. Witnesses said he 
promised to pay all of them back as soon as the estate was settled, but instead 
disappeared with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, he promised women with children that they could be a family, 
the women testified. Borzynski used at least 12 aliases in his dealings with 
the women, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 One widowed woman, 47-year-old Joan Norton, gave him $51,000 from her 
husband's insurance money. Another woman, who asked to be identified only as 
"Valerie," borrowed $13,000 from an ex-boyfriend and gave him another $18,000 
from the sale of her Laguna Niguel condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie testified that she was so in love with Borzynski that she once cried 
and begged on her knees for his forgiveness in a restaurant when he became 
angry after learning she was suspicious of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Borzynski's victims said Tuesday that she will be glad to see him 
go to prison.

 "I'm very happy he'll be off the streets and won't be able to continue his 
profession of con artist for quite a while," said Carol Gamper of Marin County. 
"I consider it his profession because he was pretty good at it, though not good 
enough because he got caught -- didn't he?"

DEAD BABY'S DAD ACCUSED OF MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A jailed print shop worker who tearfully denied any culpability in the death 
of his 8-month-old daughter last weekend was charged Tuesday with molesting 
her.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office charged Jorge Perez, 34, of Santa Ana with 
child molestation following a coroner's examination of the body, Lt. Bob Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed in jail on Sunday, Perez heatedly denied harming his daughter, 
whom he said he found plunged head-first into a hamper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to lie about . . . " Perez said. "Who feels more pain about my 
dear baby's death -- me or the police? I'm already suffering because she died, 
and now they accuse me of killing her." 
</P>
<P>
 Police went to a house in the 600 block of Borchard Avenue on Friday afternoon 
in response to a 911 call that a baby there had stopped breathing. The child, 
Kenya Perez, was dead on arrival at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Police called in child abuse investigators after the baby died, and Jorge 
Perez was arrested. A second, 8-year-old daughter who lived in the rented room 
was taken to Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said Sunday that he had taken a nap with Kenya next to him about 2:15 
p.m. Friday, but when he awoke an hour later she was gone. When he got up he 
said he discovered the baby upside down in an empty clothes hamper near the 
bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Perez speculated that Kenya woke up while he slept, fell into the hamper and 
suffocated, despite his efforts to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Perez gave inconsistent counts of what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not been charged with the death pending toxicological tests, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to determine the exact cause of death," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the four molestation charges, Perez faces a maximum of 14 
years in jail.  
</P>
<P>
 In another case involving an infant last weekend, the 6-week-old son of Juan 
Carlos Rivera of Buena Park remains in critical condition. Rivera, 20, remains 
in jail, booked on suspicion child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said doctors at Children's Hospital of Orange County determined that 
the infant had been violently shaken and had suffered brain damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Sgt. Bob Cheney said Tuesday that new information had surfaced in 
the case, but he declined to provide details. Cheney said additional interviews 
were needed with witnesses and others familiar with the family before police 
take the case to the district attorney.

<P>
 Contribution: Bank employees washed cars, sold baked goods and hosted a garage 
sale to raise $1,000 for the Garden Grove Police Department's Canine Fund. The 
money will be used to train police dogs in narcotics detection, according to 
Police Chief Stanley L. Knee. "This caught us completely by surprise," he said. 
"But this kind of support from members of our business community is truly 
appreciated." The bank employees decided to raise the money after a 
presentation on bank safety and crime prevention by Officers Todd Langus and 
Mike Scalise, and their canine partners, Thunder and Nero. Donations may be 
sent to the Police Canine Fund, City of Garden Grove, P.O. Box 3070, Garden

Center of Orange County, established in 1983 as a private, nonprofit food bank. 
The Orange County office of the law firm O'Melveny & Myers led the drive, 
collecting 2,659 pounds. NEWPORT BEACH / $9,000 Raised for Needy Children

Wambaugh. Newport Beach resident Bill Lanjhar, in his boat, "Ohm Work," was the 
rally's overall winner. The best costume award went to the Wayt family for 
"Aladdin," while Lester Hale's "M.A.S.H." entry took the best-decorated prize.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; SANTA ANA; CITY TO PAY FAMILIES IN 2 POLICE 
SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city has agreed to pay $240,000 to the families of two teen-agers who were 
shot and killed by police in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlements were announced by City Atty. Edward J. Cooper after a closed 
session Monday during the regular City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to pay $190,000 to the family of Jose Javier Muniz, an 
18-year-old who was fatally shot by an officer as the two struggled in a Santa 
Ana back yard on May 17, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cooper, Muniz grabbed the officer's flashlight and threatened him 
with it before the officer shot him. The officer has since retired from the 
police force with a stress disability, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the officer has a stress disability made it very hard for us to 
proceed with the case," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, witnesses at the house where the shooting occurred said they 
could not tell who started the altercation, but that the officer fired too many 
times, too quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 In the other case, the city agreed to pay $50,000 to the family of a 
15-year-old who was fatally wounded by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose DeJesus Jimenez was shot twice in the back by Officer Steven Serrano 
after the teen-ager fled a gang fight near 1st and Flower streets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the September, 1992, shooting, police said Jimenez was 
affiliated with a gang that had signed a peace pact, but rival gang members he 
encountered were not part of the pact. Jimenez fled from rival gang members, 
ending up crouched behind a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police alleged that Jimenez spun around and pointed a gun at police before 
Serrano shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family's attorney, Rudolfo Ginez, said there was no forensic evidence 
to connect the teen-ager with the gun found near Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said the city opted to settle the lawsuit in part because some 
witnesses had refused to testify, in fear of gang retaliation. LEE ROMNEY and

 A police officer was nearly struck Tuesday morning as he approached the driver 
of a stolen vehicle registered to City Councilman Earle Robitaille, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was not injured and the vehicle was later found abandoned on the 
shoulder of the San Diego Freeway between Beach Boulevard and Magnolia Street, 
said Police Lt. Chuck Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was one of two Hondas spotted by the officer at 4:55 a.m. at Beach 
Boulevard and Edinger Avenue. A license plate check revealed that one of the 
cars was registered to Robitaille, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicious, the officer followed the cars to a nearby gas station, where he 
approached the driver of Robitaille's car for questioning. The driver "put the 
car in gear and tried to run him over," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer fired two shots at the passenger side of the vehicle, then pursued 
the driver, who was heading east on the San Diego Freeway. A search was 
conducted after the officer found the car abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger, Rene Briddle, 19, of Norwalk, was located in the vicinity of the 
abandoned car and arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto. She remains in the 
Huntington Beach City Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. The drivers of the two 
cars, described by police as males in their late teens or early 20s, remained 
at large Tuesday. The second vehicle was not recovered, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille said his son, Eric, 29, had stayed overnight at a friend's house. 
At 5 a.m., as Eric Robitaille was leaving for work, he discovered the car had 
been stolen.THAO HUA

 A parolee accused of burglarizing a department store, then striking a Santa 
Ana police officer on the head with the bag of stolen items was in jail 
Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Mackey Jr., 42, of Fullerton was arrested Monday afternoon, hours after 
scuffling with Santa Ana Officer Steve Chavez at MainPlace/Santa Ana, where the 
suspect tried to steal $469 worth of leather purses, wallets and eyeglass 
cases, said Santa Ana Officer Jack Wipple. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer tried to stop him," Wipple said, "but (Mackey) broke free and ran 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police spotted Mackey more than four hours later in front of a motel 
in the 2600 block of West Orangethorpe Avenue, where he was arrested on 
suspicion of burglary, criminal conspiracy, possession of narcotics and assault 
on a police officer. All of the stolen items were retrieved. He is being held 
without bail at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey has been on parole since Jan. 21, after serving more than three years 
at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, authorities said. Police and 
parole officers would not release information on his convictions, saying it is 
against department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men seen leaving the scene of the assault after the scuffle also were 
arrested on suspicion of criminal conspiracy, Wipple said. Ruben Vidaurreta, 
34, of Santa Ana and David Wilson Wheeler, 39, of Fullerton remain in jail in 
lieu of $10,000 bail. Vidaurreta was taken to the Santa Ana Detention Center 
and Wheeler to Orange County Jail. THAO HUA

 The City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday night to a local ordinance 
that would raise city fines up to $5,000 against Cablevision of Orange for 
airing unscrambled adult movies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 residents who stumbled across the movies, which one said was 
"pornography beyond belief," said the proposed increase was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the future of our country, the future of the city of Orange. We just 
have to make a stand now," said Elaine Jumpe. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has been going on for about two months, since resident Kathy 
Davis brought the matter to the council's attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Kristy Casasanti, general manager of Cablevision, said the problem occurred 
because the Playboy Channel had shared a channel with regular programming and 
was not scrambled properly. She said the problem was resolved when they gave 
Playboy its own channel. Also, they now have set traps on the televisions of 
everyone who has complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to look for an alternative solution, although we feel that 
trapping is the solution at this time," Casasanti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents say the audio portion of the adult programming is still coming 
through, and that many sets are still receiving unscrambled movies. LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT / COSTA MESA / IRVINE; COSTA MESA; SEMINAR WILL 
OFFER TIPS ON AVOIDING HOLIDAY BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who frequently get the blues around the Thanksgiving and Christmas 
holidays can seek help at a seminar next week at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Klein, a marriage and family therapist in Cypress, will give tips on 
how to cope with sadness brought on by the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is attitude adjustment," she said. "If you're thinking 
'humbug' and that everything is costing a lot of money, then decide what your 
priorities are going to be. Create your holiday around what you value." 
</P>
<P>
 If you value family, then that's what you need to focus on, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money and the gifts aren't important," she added. "It's just enjoying 
each other's company, whether its decorating the tree or drinking hot cocoa." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who conducts this seminar annually, said many people tend to get 
depressed around a holiday because it brings back memories of things that 
cannot be re-created. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time when people go back to their childhoods and remember being 
together as a family," she said. "And what they want to do is recapture the 
cooking, the certain smells and flavors, but sometimes it's just not there. The 
kids have grown up and moved away and you find yourself all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 If you fall into this category, Klein suggests breaking the mold and doing 
something different. Invite friends over who are also alone -- or have an open 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is to change the routine that has made you sad every 
year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The class will be held Dec. 1 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. on campus. Information: 
Nicolette Jackson, director of the college Re-entry Center, at (714) 432-5162.

 Chapman University might not be Orange County's largest or most famous 
institution of higher learning. But it is one of the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, five buildings on the campus are listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The neoclassical buildings, constructed between 1904 and 1928, are considered 
to be one of the largest concentrations of historic buildings in the county, 
according to college officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The exteriors of all five buildings -- Wilkinson Hall, Memorial Hall, Smith 
Hall, Reeves Hall and Founders Hall -- are mostly unchanged from their original 
appearance. Today

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTH; LA HABRA; BAR'S PERMIT TO ENTERTAIN IS REVOKED 
</P>

 Playing pool and listening to jukebox music is no longer allowed at the Leaky 
Tiki Tavern, the bar where police have arrested patrons on suspicion of dealing 
drugs and fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted last week to revoke the bar's entertainment permit, 
citing criminal activity, disorderly conduct, poor management and numerous 
police calls. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing on the matter, Leaky Tiki owner, Janet Escobosa, and her 
attorney, Ted Cromwell, pleaded with the council to reconsider their action. 
They challenged police reports of several calls made to the bar, saying the 
people arrested for such offenses as fighting were not patrons of the Leaky 
Tiki. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clearly the perception of the Police Department of the city of La Habra 
that this particular establishment has become an undue burden," City Atty. 
Richard Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobosa said she believes the bar has been treated unfairly. She said she 
does not allow her employees to serve drinks to people who appear to be already 
drunk, and that what they do when they leave or are denied service is beyond 
her control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have a duty to take them home and tuck them in bed," 
Cromwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. John Rees said: "The management and ownership of the bar is not . 
. . running the bar in a responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The city had revoked Leaky Tiki's entertainment permit last year, but a 
Municipal Court ruled the bar could keep its entertainment permit if it beefed 
up security. The council found last week that the security was insufficient to 
maintain order and again revoked the entertainment permit, which had allowed a 
jukebox and pool tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people of this city are getting a little tired of this," 
Councilman James Flora said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees said he is holding meetings with Escobosa to work out a plan on how to 
better manage the bar's activities. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MEAL PROVIDES FOOD FOR THOUGHT ON HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To remind themselves and others that many Orange County residents often go 
hungry, community leaders and business officials went on a diet of bread and 
water Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 leaders, including Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Board 
Supervisors, and county Republican Party Chairman Tom Fuentes, joined the "No 
Lunch Luncheon" sponsored by a local food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon was organized by the private and nonprofit Food Distribution 
Center and held at Antonello Ristorante in Santa Ana. It was designed to call 
attention to hunger and to encourage people to donate food and other goods for 
the poor, not only during the holidays, but year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunger exists 365 days of the year and people are surprised by the level of 
the problem in Orange County," said Margaret O'Malley, spokeswoman for the Food 
Distribution Center. She said that about 16% of the county's population, about 
400,000 people, do not get enough to eat each day. 
</P>
<P>
 While the main purpose of the event was to increase awareness of hunger, 
participants also donated about $15,000 to the center. During the 90-minute 
luncheon, they ate bread and soup and sipped water and wine, O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center does not feed anyone directly, but supplies food to 277 charities 
countywide. Indirectly, the center provides food to about 180,000 people each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said that while people "always assume it's the homeless or the street 
person" who goes hungry, many without enough food are senior citizens and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, those two groups receive about 58% of the center's food, she said, 
adding that "they are the innocent victims." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on donating money or food, or to volunteer, call (714) 
771-1343. Checks made payable to the Food Distribution Center may be sent to: 
426 A, W. Almond Ave., Orange, 92666. JON NALICK

EDUCATORS, STUDENTS HAMMER PROP. 187 AT 'TEACH-IN'; ACTIVISM: SPEAKERS CONDEMN 
THE MEASURE DURING IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE GATHERING. THOSE ATTENDING ARE ASKED 
TO SIGN 'UNITY PLEDGE' NOT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A noon-hour Proposition 187 "teach-in" Tuesday attracted educators, activists 
and some 300 students to Irvine Valley College, where the law was condemned for 
dividing students along racial lines and credited with bringing them together 
in a renewal of campus activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Jess Craig, acting student services director at Irvine Valley College, opened 
the nearly two-hour-long string of speeches with a caveat: "This is an 
educational event -- not a political event." But the energies of the speakers, 
who included a nun and a former vice president of the United Farm Workers, were 
directed against the ballot measure. And those who attended the teach-in were 
asked to sign a "unity pledge" to refuse to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Cervantes, 22, said the law cynically exploits people's fears about 
immigration. "We want to change the way people look at immigration," said 
Cervantes, a leader of the newly formed Four Winds Student Movement and a 
history major at Claremont Graduate School. "This is more of a human rights 
issue than a legal issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Advance notice of the teach-in generated some criticism of the administration 
at the 10,287-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get some phone calls from supporters of the proposition who were kind 
of questioning why we were sponsoring this," said Irvine Valley College 
spokesman George McCrory. "This was something the students organized. It's not 
like the college is protesting Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 The 107-campus California Community Colleges system will remain officially 
neutral on Proposition 187 until the issue is revolved by the courts, according 
to McCrory. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley College history professor Richard Prystowski told students that 
Proposition 187 is an effort to find a scapegoat for a sense of "malaise" in 
the community. He encouraged the audience to have tolerance for supporters of 
the initiative, which was approved by 67.4% of Orange County voters and 59% 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be careful not to victimize or callously judge the characters of 
those who voted for this proposition," said Prystowski, the organizer of a 
Holocaust studies group on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders from UC Irvine, Chapman University, Irvine Valley and 
Saddleback colleges spoke against the proposition, saying the law has 
heightened racial tensions on and off their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the terms of Proposition 187, I am now a suspect in the state of 
California," said Alicia Basurto, a spokeswoman for the UC Irvine chapter of 
MEChA, a Latino student organization. She said Latino students like herself who 
are legal residents feel intimidated by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the change in ethnic relations caused by the passage of 
Proposition 187, Irvine Valley College history professor Francisco Marmolejo 
said a white student asked him if he now felt under suspicion of being an 
illegal immigrant because he is Latino. Marmolejo replied by asking the student 
if he felt under suspicion of having voted for the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the law was fueled by "a residual and somewhat subtle form of 
racism in the electorate," he said 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Prince, a Tustin accountant who is co-author of Proposition 187, said 
in a telephone interview that opponents are falsely finding racist motives 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing more than political exploitation by grasping demagogues," 
Prince said. "The purpose of Proposition 187 is to ensure that all 
public-funded benefits go to those people who are legally entitled to those 
benefits."

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT EMPLOYEES PREPARE FOR HOLIDAY HORDES; TRAVEL: DAY BEFORE 
THANKSGIVING IS TRADITIONALLY THE YEAR'S BUSIEST. OUTGOING FLIGHTS ARE NEARLY 
ALL BOOKED, AND RENTAL CARS HAVE ALL BEEN SPOKEN FOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Welcome to Black Wednesday, as this, unfailingly the busiest day of the year, 
is known to those in air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a challenge," said Walter Bialorke, 48, a customer service agent for 
USAir at John Wayne Airport. "Like an athlete, you prepare all year for it. If 
you aren't prepared, you will be left behind in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Skycap Dennis German agreed, "It is going to be like a zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 As the pace began to quicken Tuesday, ticket salespeople, baggage handlers, 
taxicab drivers, skycaps and other workers were bracing for the onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday Tuesday, all the long-term parking next to the terminal was full. 
William A. Pemberton, chief of landside operations at the airport, said signs 
had been posted in the community directing people to additional long-term 
parking on Main Street in Irvine, more than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 People who park there will be served by airport shuttle buses running every 15 
minutes, he said. If that lot fills, he said, another 700 cars can fit at an 
annex lot nearby on Skypark Circle.  
</P>
<P>
 Pemberton said he expected 10% to 15% more airport traffic than last year, in 
part because of the addition of Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pemberton said he believes Thanksgiving is more popular than Christmas for 
cross-country family reunions, because the weather is more favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters, in fact, said the holiday will be mostly sunny in Orange 
County, and travelers leaving John Wayne will encounter clear skies almost 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good travel day from coast to coast," said Dean Jones, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a private forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport chaos of Thanksgiving eve, seasoned airport workers say, is caused 
more by the kind of travelers who take to the skies than their sheer numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 Bialorke said John Wayne Airport usually serves business travelers who know 
their way to gates and are knowledgeable about departure and arrival schedules. 
But today, he said, airport staff will work harder to steer infrequent fliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be an overabundance of people who need to stop and ask questions," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Air travelers also would have been wise to make preparations by buying tickets 
and reserving rental cars in advance, airport workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southwest Airlines, "almost every flight is booked up" through Thanksgiving 
morning, said Cheryl Hoban, the airline's area marketing manager.  
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of extraordinarily long lines at check-in counters, Hoban 
said, the airline recommends that its customers arrive today 95 minutes before 
their scheduled departure, rather than the customary hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers arriving in Orange County will be flocking to car rental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no cars available without reservations," said Phil Forbes, a 
reservation agent for Hertz. Minivans, which are especially popular for 
families, have been completely booked at all the agencies, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Still, a 46-year-old taxicab driver from Tustin, said he normally makes 
eight to 12 trips each day to the airport. But today he expects to make at 
least 30 runs, and to face fearsome traffic snarls both at the loading curbs 
and on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be a battle all day long," Still predicted. The hard work, he 
said, will probably be offset by the tips, which usually are generous during 
the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go home with a lot of money, that's for sure. But I'll need Thanksgiving 
to recuperate," he said.

COUPLE HELD IN DEATH OF 4-MONTH-OLD SON; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY THE INFANT DIED 
AFTER BEING 'SQUEEZED AND SHAKEN.' ARREST OF PARENTS FOLLOWED A LENGTHY 
INVESTIGATION OF INCIDENT IN SAN CLEMENTE. 
</P>

<P>
 A Big Bear couple have been arrested in connection with the death last January 
of their 4-month-old baby, whom authorities said died after being "squeezed and 
shaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Grear Miller and Tina McCleeary, both 31 and formerly of San 
Clemente, were arrested at home last week by Orange County sheriff's detectives 
after an investigation linked them to the death of their son, Alexander Miller. 
Both parents face charges of child abuse and child endangerment, Sheriff's Lt. 
Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence leading to the arrests was not disclosed, pending completion of the 
investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the child was abused," Martini said. "We would like to prove the 
injuries were caused by the suspects and were the cause of death." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests mark the second time in a week in which a parent has been arrested 
in connection with shaken baby syndrome, where shaking of an infant damages 
developing tissues. On Saturday, a 6-week-old baby was diagnosed with bleeding 
in the brain and eyes after his parents brought him to Children's Hospital of 
Orange County. The baby, Christian Valdez, remains in critical condition, while 
his father, Juan Carlos Valdez Rivera, 20, of Buena Park is in jail on 
suspicion of felony child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the San Clemente incident on Jan. 6, 1994, authorities 
attributed the cause of Alexander's death to sudden infant death syndrome. 
However, autopsy reports and an "extensive review" of the case led to the 
conclusion that the parents might be responsible, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found several rib fractures to the lower back, as well as an old contusion 
on top of the brain," he said. "We also didn't find any external injuries or 
any other visible signs of trauma to the child, leading us to believe that the 
injuries probably were caused by someone shaking the child." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was brought to the attention of San Clemente police after 
Alexander's 13-year-old half-sister discovered that Alexander had stopped 
breathing 15 minutes after their parents left the house to run errands, Martini 
said. A neighbor called paramedics, who tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the 
infant. Alexander was pronounced dead at the scene.

PLANNING PANEL BACKS STUDY FAVORABLE TO CARGO FLIGHTS; AVIATION: THE 
ENVIRONMENT WOULDN'T BE HURT BY DEPARTURES FROM JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, REPORT 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Planning Commission gave unanimous approval Tuesday to a 
controversial study saying that cargo flights from John Wayne Airport would 
have no significant impact on the area's environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, approved after an anticlimactic public hearing, does not mean that 
air cargo companies may soon begin doing business at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the environmental study and the favorable finding by the Planning 
Commission will be sent to the Airport Commission, which will hold a hearing 
next week on whether to allow Federal Express and United Parcel Service to each 
have a daily departure from the airport. The hearing is set for 7 p.m. Nov. 30 
in the terminal conference room at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Airport Commission recommends the cargo flights, the Board of 
Supervisors will consider the issue at its Dec. 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study approved by the Planning Commission, the county's Environmental 
Management Agency analyzed the environmental effects if two, four or six of the 
flights now carrying passengers were shifted to carry freight. 
</P>
<P>
 Planner Kari Rigoni told the commission any potential negative effects from 
the change would be limited to ground operations at the airport and could not 
be easily analyzed until the freight carriers have worked out leases with the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's hearing was tame, with just four speakers -- two for the freight 
companies -- addressing the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent were representatives from Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Costa 
Mesa, all of which sent letters to the county objecting to potential noise 
problems. Irvine officials largely were concerned with peak-hour traffic on 
streets serving the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Of local cities, only Tustin sent a representative to speak at the hearing. 
Associate Planner Ann Bonner asked that if cargo flights are allowed, they be 
limited to middle- and low-range noise level craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Wallace, a spokeswoman for the South Orange County Chambers of 
Commerce, voiced the business organization's support for cargo flights. Local 
businesses must have "packages ready two or three hours earlier than" they 
would if there were cargo flights available within the county either from John 
Wayne or another airport within the county, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach did not send a spokesman, although city officials fear that 
allowing cargo flights would threaten a 10-year-old settlement of a lawsuit 
with the county over noise. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement and a 1990 county Access Plan limit departing flights by 
noise-regulated aircraft to 73 per day. Passenger planes fill all those slots 
because passenger aircraft with at least 75 seats get preference. If cargo 
flights are approved to take any of the 73 slots, Newport Beach officials fear 
airlines will sue to get the flights back. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities oppose and the staff also recommended against simply adding two 
departures for a total of 75. Any change to the number of noise-controlled 
departures would make all the flights subject to Federal Aeronautics 
Administration scrutiny under a much more liberal 1990 federal noise/capacity 
law than the one in effect when the settlement was reached in 1985, Newport 
Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Airport Commission met in closed session Monday to discuss the 
potential threat to the settlement the city won in the federal court battle 
with the county, but details of that meeting, posted as a discussion of pending 
litigation, are protected by law.

WOMAN, DOG DIE IN LAGUNA HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified woman and a dog were killed Tuesday in a fire that engulfed a 
house in the 400 block of Blumont Street, according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 to 25 firefighters from Laguna Beach and the Orange County Fire 
Department responded about 7 p.m. after a neighbor alerted them, according to 
Battalion Chief Joe McClure. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time firefighters arrived, the house, built in the 1930s, was engulfed 
in flames. It took just over an hour to control the fire, McClure said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's body was found in the kitchen-living room area. Neighbors said the 
victim was retired and lived alone with her dog. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no winds at the time of the fire, McClure said, and nearby 
structures that were threatened were protected from the fire.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IT'S A WHOLE NEWT WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back before the People Spoke, I thought that no Newt was good news. 
</P>
<P>
 But ever since the second Tuesday in November, I've seen the light. And boy, 
it's great to be a Republican! 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know a single Democrat anymore. (Talk about your Jurassic Party.) 
Everything's coming up Newts. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, look over there! There's Gloria Steinewt, the former feminist, who now 
says her stint as a Playboy bunny was the most fulfilling experience of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't realize it till now," says Ms. Steinewt, founder of a new 
magazine called the Newt Republic. "Our first issue features a story on how the 
upper middle class is victimized by usurious tax rates on capital gains. Like 
I've always said, a Republican without a national health plan is like a fish 
without a bicycle. Or something." 
</P>
<P>
 And there goes the noted poet, Maya Angenewt, hard at work on a poem to be 
delivered to the American people in January, when Congress officially swerves 
to the right. It's a revised version of the poem she recited at the 
inauguration of That Democrat waaaaay back in 1992. The new title: "This Newt 
Morning Dawning." 
</P>
<P>
 The first line -- which might have become a classic if only English classes 
were not going to be replaced by Creationism Studies -- is "A Rush, a Contract, 
a Newt." 
</P>
<P>
 For inspiration, Ms. Angenewt has been eating pork rinds and jelly beans. She 
wears a pained expression as she writes. Indigestion, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Say, here comes former Democratic spinmeister George Stephanoponewt! 
</P>
<P>
 George? Hello?  
</P>
<P>
 That's odd. George has duct tape over his mouth. Oh, well. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like Anewta Hill has a minute to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Anewta, who was recently spotted underlining passages in the Newt Testament, 
experienced a dramatic conversion on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've seen the light," she says. "Those secular humanist liberals used 
me back in '91 to further their godless agenda. I just hope Clarence Thomas can 
forgive me, because I'd really like to use him as a job reference. Say, do you 
have a number for the Supreme Court?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The great thing about Newt Gingrich is that it's not just Washington he's 
taking by storm. He's out to finish the job Dan Quayle started -- the rescue of 
American culture from the forces of evil, such as unwed mothers on TV and 
anyone who graduated from Yale Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Newt's influence is being felt on Broadway, where composer Andrew 
Newt Webber is creating a new musical, "Pennsylvania Boulevard" in which a 
sincere but misguided President invites a cooperative but uncompromising 
Congressman into the Oval Office for a chat that changes their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm looking forward to the President's big musical number, "School Prayer 
Shuffle (I Just Want to Be Loved.)" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just Newt's agenda that is so darn appealing. Sure, he's the best 
thing that's happened to American politics since Sonny Bono took Palm Springs 
by storm. But it's more than that. It's the man himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Newt is cute. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got twinkly little eyes -- yes, I suppose some would call them beady -- 
and a jolly round face -- some might say puffy -- and when he laughs, his belly 
. . . well, I don't know what his belly looks like when he laughs. But I am 
guessing it bears a relationship to a bowlful of jelly since the man does not 
appear to have been in spitting distance of an abdomicizer in a long, long time 
-- probably not since George McGovern was spewing his brand of inchoate 
Clintonism around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not really sure what Newt has against McGovern. All McGovern ever did was 
lose in a landslide to Richard Nixon more than two decades ago. Newt ought to 
be grateful.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he implied before the election that McGovern was somehow responsible 
for the actions of that woman in South Carolina who confessed to drowning her 
kids. According to Newt, it is our wanton society -- as exemplified by the 
"McGovernick counterculture" -- that leads to parents murdering their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't know about that. But Newt does, and that's the important thing.  
</P>
<P>
 See, he only wants what's best for America: mandatory school prayer and 
orphanages for children whose parents receive public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could be against orphanages, except for the children who live in them? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, welfare orphans can't vote. They'll just have to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether their prayers will be answered, well, strictly speaking, that's not 
Newt's department. Yet.

SEASON OF SEPARATION; 'I HAD TO GET MY CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY' 
</P>

 They long to kiss their children. To hug their parents. To belong to the 
families they have left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty and joblessness have brought them here to earn the necessities for 
their loved ones back home: food, shelter, clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Separated by borders and countries, the immigrants visit through letters and 
phone calls, catching up on the everyday life they dearly miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly chats are usually enough to boost their spirits until the next time. 
And the photos they receive -- especially those of the children they haven't 
held in years -- fuel their dreams of being reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 As families gather this week, thousands of immigrants in Los Angeles endure 
the sorrow of separation. Here are three of their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once more, before she mails the foil-wrapped box 2,000 miles, Evangelina Reyes 
admires the surprise gift for her daughter. She envisions the gold ring on 
Kira's slender finger, the matching necklace around her child's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will look so elegant on her," says Reyes, a nanny and baby-sitter to many 
Los Angeles children who has been separated for six years from her 13-year-old 
daughter in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, her eyes filled with tears, her lips trembling with emotion, gently 
holds the jewelry in her palms. She reaches for Kira's photo on top of a small 
stereo in the small one-bedroom house in South Central that she shares with 
five other immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kira Mariella Reyes, a beautiful girl with long, wavy brown hair; sparkling, 
deep brown eyes, and a knockout smile, is wearing a frilly white dress tiered 
with lace -- a present Reyes sent last year. The gifts, she says, make Kira 
happy. But it's Kira's kisses Reyes aches for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents don't know how lucky they are to kiss and hug their children every 
day. If I were with Kira, I'd kiss her every hour. I would hug her every time 
she walked near me," says Reyes, 39. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Reyes -- the sole support for her daughter, then 7, and son, Boris, 
then 11 -- left her small Guatemalan village of San Jose La Arada, a dusty, 
impoverished place where jobs are scarce and life is painfully difficult. She 
headed for Los Angeles, where, a friend here told her, good-paying jobs were 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing only the clothes she was wearing and "the hope that things would work 
out," she bid her children a tearful farewell, hugging them so tight that "I 
thought I would squeeze the life out of them," she says. Boris, now 17, joined 
his mother six months ago and works at a Downtown seafood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Boris with her is a blessing. "But without Kira, our family is 
incomplete," she says while sitting on a bed by her home's front door. On the 
walls is a mix of colorful Guatemalan handwoven art and scribbled watercolor 
drawings from children Reyes has cared for -- and grown to love as her own -- 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, who recently lost a nanny job after one of the parents was laid off, is 
looking for similar work. She has worked at day-care centers and for two 
families: a Pasadena couple with two children whom she looked after for more 
than two years, and a Los Angeles couple with two young girls, one Kira's age 
when Reyes departed Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would look at that little girl and think, 'There's my Kira,' " she says, 
pausing, fighting tears. Finally, she asks out loud: "How could I have left 
her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her answer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Economics. I had to get my children out of poverty. No one person will ever 
know how difficult it was for me to leave them." It was a decision, she says 
the entire family agreed upon. Arrangements were made for Kira and Boris to 
live with their mother's best friend, a woman who loves Kira like her own 
daughter, which worries Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Kira's mother," she says, "but I am not there like a mother helping her 
with the problems of growing up, of becoming a young lady. I've missed so much 
-- her first years of school, watching her play with friends, her birthdays." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to return to Guatemala, but first she would like to earn more money 
to send to her 56-year-old mother, who is raising eight kids of her own and 
managing a household of 15. She wants to save money for a house whenever she 
does return. And, at the moment, Kira needs clothes and shoes and Reyes wants 
to shower her daughter with extravagant things like the gold jewelry set she 
could never afford on a $15 monthly income cleaning houses in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, a legal immigrant who gets housekeeping and child-care jobs through a 
West Los Angeles immigrant rights center, earns $50 a day taking care of 
children, $36 cleaning a house and $4.50 an hour baby-sitting. When work is 
plentiful, she is able to send $100 a month to her daughter and the woman who 
cares for her. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't know when she'll return home. She doesn't know when she'll have 
the money to send for Kira, who desperately wants to move to L.A. to be with 
her mother. It took Reyes two years to save up for Boris' plane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from Guatemala, Kira says she carries her mother's 
photo with her everywhere. "I cherish her," she says. Sometimes, when she's 
alone, she talks to her mother as if Reyes were in her bedroom. She wants to 
become a nurse when she graduates from high school. But, mostly, Kira prays for 
the day she can be reunited with her mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel alone here," she says. "I want to feel like I belong to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, on the phone, reassures her daughter that with God's help maybe she 
will be able to send for her early next year, especially now that Boris is 
working. Maybe, she tells Kira, her voice upbeat and cheery, "with two incomes 
we can get a plane ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 "But for now, mija ," Reyes tells her daughter, bravely fighting her own 
sorrow, "keep studying and keep being a good girl. I want so much to hug you 
and hold you, too, mija . I'm always thinking about you. Remember, have faith 
in God." 
</P>
<P>
 The two hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes reaches for the foil-wrapped box. She clutches it to her chest. "Every 
time, my heart breaks when we are on the phone," she says. "I dream about her. 
I can't sleep at night because she is in my mind. I worry if she is OK. The 
other night I dreamed that she was in a car accident. It was horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes says she won't be able to send for Kira, not right away. She knows the 
separation will last a few more years, maybe longer. And she knows that she can 
express her love for Kira only with words and gifts, even though she longs for 
the day to embrace her child as tightly as the day she left her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we are reunited, whether it's here or there," Reyes says, "it will 
be forever." More on Immigration

<P>
 As families gather this week, thousands of immigrants in Los Angeles endure 
the sorrow of separation. Here are three of their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Marroquin is thinking about the holidays in her homeland: cooking 
tamales with her older sister, baking cheese and rice cakes with her mom, and 
caring for her two kids, Ruby, 11 and Marvin, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year -- like the last five years -- the holidays will come and go in 
Guatemala City without Marroquin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old cosmetologist came to Los Angeles in 1989 in pursuit of the 
universal immigrant dream: a better life for her children. Separated from her 
husband, Marroquin had been her family's only wage earner in a city where the 
only job she could get paid no more than $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby was 6 then. Marvin was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 And Marroquin will never forget the day she parted with her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the children I was going to visit some family and would be gone a few 
hours. I kissed them and then left," she recalls, tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers their young faces -- soft, smooth, sweet-smelling. "Cherubic," 
she says, "like little angels. I call them my angels on the phone," she says 
before speaking to her family via long distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Marroquin, 33, entered the United States to land a better paying job and has 
maintained her legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently earned a cosmetologist's license while holding down a full-time 
job at a Melrose Avenue salon. 
</P>
<P>
 She is driven to succeed because "I don't want people to think of me as an 
immigrant without ambition." And everything she does is for her kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every month, Marroquin sends her family -- which includes her 72-year-old 
mother, Juana, and 38-year-old sister, Alicia, who is raising her children -- 
money, clothes and shoes. When there's extra cash, she phones home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always so much I want to know. How is school? Are you studying hard? 
Are you being a good boy and girl? Are you minding your aunt?" 
</P>
<P>
 And, Marroquin says, every time she calls, the children always ask: " 'Mommy, 
when are you coming back?' " She pauses long enough to wipe away her tears. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she hasn't gone back because "I need to send money to fix the house, 
money for my mother's medicines and for so many things that the children need. 
I know it's difficult for them to understand, but I don't have the extra money 
to fly home." 
</P>
<P>
 She has kept up with her children's growth, noticing the subtle changes in 
their voices during phone conversations, hearing tales about teeth falling out, 
new ones coming in and other physical changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to send them a video camera so they can make movies for me," she 
says. A few years ago, the children received a camera so they could send 
photographs. Recently, Marroquin sent her kids an electric typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could go back tomorrow I would, but my plan has always been to save 
enough money to open my own beauty shop in Guatemala for my children's future," 
she says, adding that she hopes to return in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she knows in her heart that her children are in good hands with 
her sister, she says: "I am so scared that one day they will forget me. My 
sister has been a second mother to them for so long now. Maybe one day my 
children won't love me as a mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a phone conversation with her children from her rented room in North 
Hollywood, Marroquin puts her fears to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 After chitchat about friends and family, Marroquin engages the children in 
talk of schoolwork and offers some motherly advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, school gets harder, my angel," Marroquin tells Ruby. "You get 
older and you move up a grade -- that's why the classes are harder. But 
watching TV all afternoon -- that's not good. Don't forget you are the example 
for your brother. Now put your brother on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 To Marvin: "You have to do what your Aunt Alicia says or else no playing 
basketball on the weekend. OK? I love you, my angel." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview with the children's aunt, Alicia Marroquin says the 
children are saddened over their mother's absence, "but they understand." 
Still, she says, they constantly ask about Marroquin's return. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Not yet,' I tell them. 'She is working hard so you can study and eat. She 
is fighting for you because here the life is hard.' I know my sister is 
struggling and sacrificing for her children. But I always tell her when she 
comes back to Guatemala, she will rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Marroquin's mother: "She is our conquering hero, our hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the brave one," Marroquin says. "My children are." More on

BEWARE OF THE TOYS THAT GIVE LITTLE JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Launching the holiday season with a note of caution, a consumer group Tuesday 
warned parents to look for hazards when shopping for toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing to check for are toys with small parts -- they can be choking 
dangers," said Jon Golinger, consumer advocate for CALPIRG (California Public 
Interest Research Group). He spoke at a news conference at Kaiser Permanente in 
West Los Angeles, announcing results of the group's ninth annual toy-safety 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, "Trouble in Toyland," lists 24 dangerous toys found in the group's 
random survey this fall of toy and other retail stores. At least 11 of the toys 
violate the Consumer Product Safety Commission's small-parts standard, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is the new Child Safety Protection Act laws will tighten the 
restrictions after Jan. 1, 1995," Golinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is there are still toys out that will give children pain instead 
of pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 From a table full of samples, he demonstrated toys that violate the choke-test 
standard, including small toy cars, trucks and trains, wooden blocks and a 
plane with detachable signs -- many from China with no indication of the 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases the toys from other countries cannot be traced, he said. Many of 
the dangerous items are the small, inexpensive "stocking stuffers" found on 
supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 As a test standard for a toy, toy part or ball size, parents should use the 
size of a child's fist, Golinger said. "Anything smaller is unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 Balloons, when deflated or broken, are also choking hazards, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dangers were found in toys with sharp pieces, including a putty-type 
Glat Splat, and toys with excessive noise, including a set of Blaster Balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these toys either failed to meet the standards or meet them but are still 
dangerous," Golinger said. At least 26 children died in 1993 playing with toys, 
and an estimated 165,000 were treated in emergency rooms for toy-related 
injuries, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Phil Seifer emphasized that parents should read labels carefully and make 
sure the toy matches the skills of the child. "We have lots of regulations and 
consumer organizations, but the bottom line is that parents have to be 
responsible for their children," the pediatrician said. "The best defense for 
children is a careful parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the toys that violate the CPSC's small-parts standard: Large Beads and 
Laces (manufactured by Media Materials), Easy Grip Pegs and Tactilmat Pegboard 
(Ideal School Supply), BRIO Farm (BRIO), Jumbo Value Pack Wood Shapes 
(distributed by Holiday Industries), London Double Decker Bus (distributed by 
ILC), Jumping Frog (made in Taiwan, manufacturer unknown), and Press & Go Cho 
Cho Train and Press 'N Go Plane With Signs (both made in China, manufacturer 
unknown). 
</P>
<P>
 Three toys with small partsthat will be banned as of Jan. 1 are Pound a Ball 
(manufactured by Adica Pongo Inc.), T.C. Timber Jumbo Beads (Habermaass Corp.) 
and Stack of Nine (Plan Toys). 
</P>
<P>
 Toys that do not violate the small-parts standard but are considered to pose 
choking hazards are older versions of Fisher-Price's Little People, the Super 
Whistler train set (My Kids Toy Mfg. Co.), Wood Building Blocks Classic Wood 
Line (Battat Inc.), Baby's 1st Birthday Balloon Pack (Trisar Inc.) and Magic 
Water Snake, a balloon toy (manufacturer unknown, made in Taiwan). 
</P>
<P>
 Toys listed that pose other hazards are Nikelodeon Gak Splat (Mattel, Inc.), 
Blaster Balls (the Nature Company), older models of Playskool Preschool Radio 
Control Fire Chief remote-control car (Playskool Inc.) and nail polish -- 
"Shell Gold" and other colors distributed by Sanrio Inc. that contain toluene. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of this year's list of dangerous toys are available by calling CALPIRG 
at (310) 397-3404.

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; ANY WAY IS A GOOD WAY TO GIVE THANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank God we don't feel the way we used to about the late fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, we expressed our gratitude to the higher power by sacrificing 
a goat or a passing stranger as soon as the last ear of corn was picked. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of the first Thanksgiving, all that had changed and most of us 
were making short prayers of blessing and thanks over roast turkey and a 
steamed vegetable platter. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's how it is in the movie "Squanto," where the Native Americans 
offer humble and respectful words to the creator as Colonists pass around 
squash bowls filled with mixed vegetables that look as if they came straight 
from Rosie's kitchen. But nowadays, many people say grace only when relatives 
come over, or not at all. Atheists, naturally, don't believe in Anyone to 
thank. Dieters, of course, probably feel more resentment than gratitude toward 
a plate loaded with fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with established religious or cultural traditions have no problem 
knowing what to say. Rabbi David Eliezrie of the North Orange County Chabad 
Center said observant Jews have offered the same simple blessing over every 
meal for thousands of years: 
</P>
<P>
 "Blessed are you Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings forth bread 
from the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The British have always taken a sensible approach, as in this prayer found at 
Chester Cathedral: "Give me a good digestion, Lord/And also something to 
digest." 
</P>
<P>
 A blessing from Africa evokes natural traditions: "We swim in your grace like 
a whale in the ocean. The saying goes, 'An ocean never dries up,' but we know 
your grace also never fails. This food you have given us is one more proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Young children have always had their own silent favorites, a perennial being: 
"Past the teeth and through the gums, look out stomach, here it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 But modern adults can find some updated ideas in such books as "Table Graces" 
(Peter Pauper Press, 1986). There are graces for: 
</P>
<P>
 * rationalizers ("If we deny ourselves adequate food or a balanced diet, we 
violate God's plan. Help us, Lord, to eat wisely."); 
</P>
<P>
 * environmentalists ("Help us to ensure that our food shall be free from 
radioactive contamination."); 
</P>
<P>
 * socially conscious but guilty philosophers ("The bellies of Third World 
children swell through malnutrition, but the only way our bellies swell is 
through overeating. We wonder what God's plan on this Earth must be."). 
</P>
<P>
 Some sentiments appear frighteningly similar to the old days.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1977 book "Table Prayers," author Mildred Tengbom reprints a dire song 
by someone named "Mother Mary Owen": 
</P>
<P>
 "God loves me and he gives me food and very good food he gives. It makes me 
big and it makes me strong and my body grows and lives. If he didn't give me 
food, I would die, die, die. I would simply fade away. So I'll tell him now 
that I'm very glad that he loves me so today." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, some people think it's best to leave well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Levy of Eagle Rock said his Thanksgiving gatherings are very modern and 
civilized, including as they have his wife's ex-husband (and his father) and 
their daughter, his mother-in-law and her two ex-husbands and current 
companion. Because Levy and his wife consider themselves secular humanists, 
they don't usually say anything anyway over the turkey and trimmings before 
they dig in.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just call the people in," he said. "We might say something like, 'Hey, 
people, the food's ready!' " Then, he said, "We just eat." 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, he said, they run the leftovers over to Hennacy House in Boyle 
Heights, a commune of Catholic Workers who annually invite 50 Skid Row regulars 
to join them for Thanksgiving.  
</P>
<P>
 There the hosts are believers and the guests are presumably grateful for food. 
The words are informal and spontaneous. Said community member Kieran Prather: 
"We all gather in a side yard and hold hands and invite one of the guests to 
make up a grace or say something they know." 
</P>
<P>
 The point is to offer a family environment as well as free food, he said. If 
they're grateful, fine; if not, that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully," he said, "everyone is."

'90S FAMILY; BOY TROUBLE; LOW SELF-ESTEEM. BIAS. EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. SOUNDS 
LIKE THE OBSTACLES GIRLS FACE IN THE CLASSROOM, RIGHT? WELL, SOME EXPERTS SAY 
IT'S THE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE LOSING OUT.

 Ken, 17, believed he had no choice but to belch loudly during a "mushy" 
classroom discussion on betrayed love, as depicted in Nathaniel Hawthorne's 
"The Scarlet Letter." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do something 'cause I was starting to freak," said Ken, remembering 
the "dumb day" last year in an English class at a Westside high school. "All 
that talk about love and feelings and commitment makes me feel weird, like I'm 
talking about something private. . . . That's why I feel like I had to 
interrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the teacher's public reprimand, detention and ultimately a bad grade, 
Ken said the burp was worth it. "School don't do me much good anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken's attitude worries some educators, counselors and academics, who believe 
it illustrates the sorry state of boys in the classroom. Neglect and unfair 
treatment, they say, damage the education of boys in elementary and secondary 
schools in California and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Two reports, released by the American Assn. of University Women in 1991 and 
1992, have produced countless discussions and media stories about classroom 
bias against female students and the plummeting of teen-age girls' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 And while few will completely dismiss girls' struggles, a handful of experts 
and forthcoming books argue that in recent years, girls have received too much 
attention and boys not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys are believed to have the educational opportunities" at the expense of 
girls, said Diane Ravitch, former assistant secretary of education and a senior 
research scholar at New York University. "But many boys -- boys of all (ethnic 
and economic) backgrounds -- are angry and in trouble. Not many have connected 
this to the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Facts, according to Ravitch and the U.S. Department of Education, such as: 
more adult men than women lack a high school diploma; young men have lower 
educational aspirations; boys consistently earn lower report card grades; they 
get in more trouble at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men also bring into the classroom emotional problems from outside the 
school fences, stemming from being what some have called "an endangered 
species." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent U.S. Department of Justice figures, for example, reveal that high 
school boys are four times more likely than girls to be murdered; they are more 
prone to abuse alcohol or drugs; boys 12 to 15 run double the risk faced by 
girls of becoming victims of a violent crime, and 82% of the nation's 
incarcerated youths 18 and under are male -- a percentage that increases to an 
estimated 95% for adult men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this hurts boys' academic performance and chance for success in 
life," said Thomas Glennon, a psychologist in Studio City and a consultant for 
a North Hollywood center for troubled youths. "I see many boys who have such a 
low self-esteem and tremendous amounts of anger. A lot can't handle life." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 
that male California youths, ages 15 to 24, are four times more likely to 
commit suicide than girls in the same age group. But teen-age girls 
unsuccessfully attempt suicide about as often as teen-age boys, CDC 
epidemiologist Robin Ikeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys have everything stacked against them," said Lawrence Beymer, a 
counseling professor at Indiana State University and author of "Meeting the 
Guidance and Counseling Needs of Boys," published by the American Counseling 
Assn. in September. "The schools don't seem to notice. Everyone always seems to 
talk about the poor little girls with low self-esteem. Well that's screwy." 
</P>
<P>
 What's even more discouraging, said Larry Schryver, is that most people 
acknowledge boys' problems only when they are tied to their ethnicity, such as 
the high homicide rate among young African American men. Schryver is director 
of Camp Afflerbaugh, a Los Angeles County probation facility in La Verne, which 
houses about 115 male juvenile offenders between the ages of 16 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to view boys' problems as something that can be solved only with 
punishment. With girls, there's a feeling that they can be rehabilitated," said 
Schryver, pointing out that boys occupy 17 of the county's 18 probation 
centers. "This gives boys the idea that they don't matter, that they don't 
exist." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ian McCann, 15, said he feels confident about his personality and academic 
abilities. But the Fullerton High School student added: "Many of the guys I see 
(in classes) seem unmotivated, especially in English. They're usually timid and 
unsure of themselves. But the girls I see are very confident and very much able 
to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodbridge, Va., a scheduling quirk placed only boys in Jean Ellerbe's 
ninth-grade English class last year. "At first, it was a mess," she said. "They 
were at-risk students who had reading difficulties and they looked like the 
type of boys who got in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Ellerbe tailored the curriculum to pique the boys' interest in the 
Vietnam and Gulf wars. Reading tests given to her 20 students at the beginning 
and end of the year showed the boys collectively boosting their scores 2.7 
grade levels. "I don't think they would have been nearly as successful if there 
were girls" in the class, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Gary White, 16, one of Ellerbe's students. "I like girls, but I 
don't like being in classes with girls," he said. "Teachers seem to like girls 
better. Girls are too confident. They're always talking in classes. It can get 
intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 The observations of McCann, Ellerbe and White mirror the findings of a report 
published in the fall, 1993, issue of Research in Middle Level Education. A 
study of 400 sixth- through eighth-graders in North Carolina found that girls 
have a higher opinion of themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "Boys tend to puff themselves up more," said William Purkey, co-author of the 
study and a counseling professor at the University of North Carolina at 
Greensboro. "Boys brag when they're insecure, so it looks like they're more 
confident than they really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report focuses on a small sample of students from one state, it 
contradicts the AAUW's nationwide poll of 2,400 girls and 600 boys in 1991. 
That study found that 29% of the high school girls compared to 46% of their 
male peers agreed they are "happy the way I am." A year later, the AAUW 
reported textbooks and teachers favor boys, damaging girls' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 AAUW Executive Director Anne L. Bryant echoed many experts when she said the 
research "shows that schools seriously shortchange girls. Girls need to have 
better opportunities and more encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
 Others criticize the AAUW reports as self-serving and scientifically flawed. 
For instance, self-described feminist Christina Hoff Sommers disputed AAUW's 
"deceptive" methodology and "misleading" conclusions in "Who Stole Feminism? 
How Women Have Betrayed Women" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "(AAUW reports) do not reflect reality," said Clifford Adelman, senior 
research analyst for the U.S. Department of Education. "Females are the 
greatest success story in American education." 
</P>
<P>
 He rattled off the numbers: Women earn more than half of all associate, 
bachelors and masters degrees; they receive almost half of the doctorates, law 
and medical degrees; they are increasingly enrolling at top colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Board recently reported that female high school students have 
increased scores and narrowed the gender gap for the third straight year in the 
verbal and math sections of the Scholastic Assessment Test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of gender inequity is not in the schools but in the labor market," 
said Adelman, who is studying the successes and failures of high school 
students who graduated in 1982 and 1972 and is chronicling the latter in 
"Lessons of a Generation" (Jossey-Bass/Macmillan), published this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Before writing "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" 
(Charles Scribner's Sons, 1994), authors Myra and David Sadker spent years 
observing classroom interaction at 80 public schools in four states and the 
District of Columbia. The American University professors concluded that girls 
fall behind boys in math and science, and teachers -- the majority of whom are 
women -- pay more attention to and expect more from boys than girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in their chapter called "The Miseducation of Boys," the Sadkers 
acknowledge problems facing boys. "Much of the attention boys receive is 
negative attention," David Sadker said. "Gender bias is a two-edge sword. Boys' 
problems don't just affect boys. It threatens (equality) for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Slezak, a 42-year-old father of two teen-age boys in Rowland Heights, 
said he frets about teachers unfairly punishing boys' "natural aggressiveness." 
While in grade school, one of his sons had attention deficit disorder. 
"Teachers treated my son, who is outspoken and extremely smart, like he was 
misbehaving. His mind was just racing," he recalled. "That can really break a 
kid's spirit. Luckily, my son grew out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators and psychologists worry that rowdy behavior exhibited by more boys 
than girls propels school officials to wrongly place boys in special education 
classes. The National Longitudinal Study of Special Education, conducted by the 
U.S. Department of Education in 1993, found that boys make up about two-thirds 
of the classes for students with learning, behavioral and developmental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, boys have filled about 90% of Alice Robinson's special 
education classes. "A lot of the boys suffer because many students in 
non-special education classes call them stupid," said Robinson, a former 
elementary-school teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School District who now 
teaches in the Bay Area. "It can have a negative long-term effect on the boys. 
I worry about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Shickler, co-principal of Jordan High School in Long Beach, said he also 
worries about boys. Often, "There's a hopelessness and disappointment that is 
weighing down heavily on boys, causing them to join gangs or drop out," he 
said, citing the 3,000-student school's 11% dropout rate of mostly boys. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Mel Collins, co-principal, are hoping to combat the problem with a new 
self-esteem program. One hundred juniors and seniors will undergo a four-day 
training program designed to teach them coping, confidence-building and 
peace-making skills, Shickler said. Students will then help their peers. 
"Something needs to be done," he said, "especially for the boys."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: TALKING TO THE DEAD, PART TWO: THE SKEPTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talking to the Dead II. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The response was heavy concerning my recent face-to-face chat with James Van 
Praagh, the mesmerizing spiritualist medium who claimed to communicate with my 
dead stepfather, just as he regularly had made contact on television with 
others who have "passed over." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Van Praagh a TV story is his increasing visibility on NBC as a 
quasi-regular on the new daytime talk series "The Other Side" and as the 
scheduled subject of a yet-to-be-taped segment of "Unsolved Mysteries," in 
which he will be asked to contact the dead on behalf of 10 people whose 
identities, the show says, will not be revealed to him beforehand. Some will be 
believers in the spiritual world with which Van Praagh claims a schmoozing 
relationship, others will be skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Praagh knew I was dropping by his West Hollywood residence, but not that 
it was my stepfather I wanted him to contact. During our session, he got some 
things wrong about my family and some things right (most of which could have 
been logical deductions), but a couple of times he was so inexplicably on 
target that even I, the great skeptic about such things, was jolted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dottie Buck of Los Angeles read the column and empathized: "I, too, have sat 
with James Van Praagh. I agree (that) talking with the dead can be a real pain. 
We contacted my dead grandmother. I had to hear from the other side -- from 
across the dimensions -- to clean my room?" 
</P>
<P>
 But David J. Simmons of Ridgecrest knew a sucker -- me -- when he read one, 
citing my "naivete about how to go about interviewing someone who 'communicates 
with the dead.' " After detailing my ineptitude, Simmons hoped that I would be 
better prepared for my next "interview with the supernatural." Other calls and 
letters tended to agree with Simmons' criticism of me. 
</P>
<P>
 What! Me . . . naive? A courageous, muckraking, investigative reporter -- who 
once wrote a column about his costly calls to the TV-advertised Psychic Hotline 
-- a patsy? Stung by the accusations, I sought the real scoop about Van Praagh 
from Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic Magazine and assistant professor of 
science history at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Shermer was, well, skeptical. "Gosh, there's just almost no chance. I mean, 
think about the claim that's being made, that people actually did live beyond 
this life. It's outrageous. The only evidence we have is this fuzzy 
hit-and-miss thing that he (Van Praagh) does." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy hit and miss? Hadn't Van Praagh relayed things to me from my stepfather 
that accurately reflected my life? "I talked to a couple of my mentalist 
buddies about him," Shermer said. "A mentalist is a magician who does mental 
magic. They study demographics. They get to know people's characteristics just 
like a marketing executive would. If you get someone who is white and 45, you 
know that he has 3.5 kids and such and such." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of Van Praagh's stuff seemed pretty specific. "Most likely he got 
something on you through the computer system," Shermer said. "He might have 
been able to track down pathways even you don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but well into our session, Van Praagh mentioned Oregon in connection with 
me. Oregon, the state where my daughter's fiance had been spending a lot of 
time working on a ballot initiative. There had been a slew of phone calls 
between my house and Oregon in recent weeks. How would Van Praagh know about 
Oregon?

 "Sometimes you get lucky," Shermer said. "We had an event at Caltech last year 
where we brought Houdini back from the dead. Mark Edward was the mentalist. We 
had 13 people at a table holding hands, and Mark was divining these amazing 
facts about people. He got this woman's birthday. It so happens it was also my 
wife's birthday. My wife said, 'That's my birthday!' He said, 'I know. Both of 
you have the same birthday.' I asked him afterward how he knew. He said it was 
pure luck, that you always take credit for lucky guesses." 
</P>
<P>
 I called Edward, who quoted a line that he said mentalists have used for 
years: "If I could really do that, I'd go to the race track." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as a "psychic entertainer," Edward said: "I'm not as 
skeptical as Michael is. I believe that there are people who are sensitive, and 
there are people who are clever manipulators of information. In my experience, 
the people who really have this clairvoyant ability don't advertise it. The 
last thing they want to do is go on television. They're low-key and they don't 
want to be bothered. So, I'm not saying such things can't happen. But it's not 
like you turn on a tap and suddenly you know about someone's great-grandfather. 
I don't even have to see this guy (Van Praagh) to know that he's using 
techniques that, if I was sitting in on it, I could nail him." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the seemingly specific information Van Praagh conveyed to me? 
"There is so much information available to computer programs, that you have no 
privacy at all," Edward said. "If I have your Social Security number, I can 
tell you the first car you bought and what color." 
</P>
<P>
 I told Edward the Oregon story. "And you say they (my daughter and her fiance) 
made phone calls?" he asked. Was he implying that phone records. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," Edward said. "All I'm saying is that the information highway 
has a lot of lanes on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next I told my tale to the great debunker himself, relentlessly skeptical 
James (The Amazing) Randi, a professional magician especially renowned for his 
work with the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the 
Paranormal, which he founded with Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov and Martin Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi was aware of "The Other Side," the series making Van Praagh famous. "It 
angers me so much that this kind of crap is presented to the American public," 
he said. "The host throws in an occasional monkey wrench (devil's advocate 
question), but a monkey wrench made of chop suey." 
</P>
<P>
 People usually hear from so-called spiritualists what they want to hear and 
"ignore things that don't work," Randi said. He agrees with Shermer that those 
claiming to communicate with the dead often exploit the emotions of vulnerable 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Van never seems to encounter a dead person unhappy about being dead, which 
makes the surviving loved ones happy. In a sense, he's a Doctor Feelgood who 
sells hope. So what's the harm? "Heroin makes people feel better, too," Randi 
replied, "but you can't function in the real world with heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing as he is, how can Randi be certain that Van Praagh and others cannot 
communicate with the dead? "I can't," he said. "But the onus is not on me, it's 
on them." 
</P>
<P>
 What Van Praagh can't do, apparently, is communicate with West Hollywood cops. 
Because he lives on a side street with limited parking, he suggested that I 
park my car in the driveway behind his. Although my car extended across the 
sidewalk, he assured me that it would be all right. It wasn't. Returning to my 
car, I found a parking ticket on the windshield, a stain on Van Praagh's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we'll always have Oregon.

PARISIAN WINS THE TOP MONK JAZZ PRIZE; COMPETITION: SARA LAZARUS GETS $10,000 
FOR FINISHING FIRST. AGE RESTRICTIONS MADE THIS YEAR'S CONTEST THE MOST 
DAUNTING IN THE EVENT'S HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's easy to know when a jazz vocalist connects with the audience. It's a lot 
harder to know why. A singer can get all the notes right, apply perfect pitch 
to each phrase -- even stay on the beat with impeccable precision -- and still 
leave the audience as cold as a midwinter morning in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, among others, this year's vocal edition of the two-day 
Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz's competition, which concluded Monday night 
with a sold-out concert at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, may have 
been the most daunting challenge in the competition's eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Monk Institute officials acknowledged that the 33-and-under age 
restriction used in previous Monk competitions for pianists, saxophonists, 
trumpeters and drummers proved dicey for singers. Whatever the respective 
merits of the contestants, it's hard to imagine an artist in his or her 20s or 
30s singing the rueful, sophisticated lyrics of classic American pop with 
adequate knowledge and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 All one had to do was look at the contest's judges -- Dianne Reeves, Abbey 
Lincoln, Jimmy Scott, Shirley Horn, Jon Hendricks and Cleo Laine -- to know how 
much artistry in jazz singing comes from simply committing the act of living. 
</P>
<P>
 Age and experience may have been critical factors in helping Sara Lazarus, a 
32-year-old from Paris, win the $10,000 first prize. Monday night at the 
Kennedy Center, she navigated "Sophisticated Lady" and "My Shining Hour" with a 
confident and unaccented balance of warmth, imagination and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a trio of pianist Norman Simmons, bassist Scott Colley and drummer 
Grady Tate, Lazarus did nothing gratuitous or showoffy, even when scat-singing 
several bars of "My Shining Hour." She didn't do anything risky or especially 
galvanizing, either. Still, she easily won over the crowd and the judges -- a 
convergence of opinion rare in previous Monk finals. 
</P>
<P>
 If stage presence were the only consideration, Lisa Henry would have had a 
clear shot at the top prize. As it was, the 26-year-old social worker from 
Kansas City, Mo., received the $5,000 second prize. She also won a six-week 
concert tour of African countries sponsored by the United States Information 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lazarus, Henry performed "Sophisticated Lady"; while her version may have 
had a few rough patches, it dared more in narrative design. Her delivery of the 
words, "Smoking, drinking . . ." bit a little deeper than Lazarus'. But where 
the Parisian's interpretation gained strength in its second performance, 
Henry's lost just a little of its edge from the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3,000 third prize went to Carolyn Leonhart, 23, who had the best-known 
name among the semifinalists. (She's the daughter of veteran bassist Jay 
Leonhart.) "Nobody Else but Me" and "Daydream" were more daring song choices 
than those of Lazarus and Henry, and she had a steely presence to back up such 
bravado. But, like a promising young pitcher with an arm that's both live and 
wild, Leonhart needs to learn greater control and more focused delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazarus, Henry and Leonhart were the survivors of a grueling process that 
began with about 200 entrants sending tapes to the Monk Institute. Eleven of 
those singers got the chance to show what they could do at Sunday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 From this group, it was possible to draw on the strengths of each singer to 
form various composites of the Compleat Jazz Vocalist. If, for instance, one 
merged Leonhart's breezy inventiveness with the finely honed austerity of 
semifinalist Autumn White or the engaging vitality of Maria de Angelis, one 
would have a star of no little magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 One also imagined the glories that could come if the white-light tenor of Pete 
McGuinness were somehow fused with the rugged, ballistic riffing of Neville 
Peter. Similar intriguing mixes could also be imagined with Yuko Hata and 
Caterina Zapponi. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous Monk competitions, which sent winners like Joshua Redman, Ryan 
Kisor, Marcus Roberts and Jacky Terrasson on to immediate glory, lightning 
success was difficult to imagine for any of these singers. Thinking about their 
prospects made one wonder, once again, what exactly defines a great jazz 
vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really sure what's going to happen now," Lazarus said after the 
concert. "There's still a lot I have to learn, but one of the great things 
about jazz is that you have time to learn. The more you live, the better you 
give." 
</P>
<P>
 The very nature of jazz singing is already in a state of transition. Recent 
albums by Reeves, Cassandra Wilson and other 35-and-older vocalists prove that 
singers don't have to lean on the classic pop repertoire to earn respect and 
popularity in jazz.

TV RATINGS; 'SEINFELD' USES COMBINATION TO BEAT CBS' 'SCARLETT' 
</P>

 Scarlett? Rhett? No, it was Jerry that viewers were clamoring for last 
week--Jerry Seinfeld. Two episodes of his NBC comedy series scored a decisive 
one-two punch in the national A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings released Tuesday, while 
the concluding three installments of CBS' miniseries "Scarlett," which started 
out at No. 1 the week before, finished at Nos. 7, 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Scarlett" didn't deliver blockbuster numbers, it did well enough to 
boost CBS to a first-place finish among the networks for the week. CBS, which 
got off to a slow start this fall in its effort to win a fourth consecutive 
prime-time crown, has now narrowed the gap with front-running ABC to one-tenth 
of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, meanwhile, has been losing ground in the last few weeks--"Seinfeld" 
notwithstanding. Its new science-fiction series "Earth 2," which lost 33% of 
its audience after the first week, dropped another 16% in its third outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's strongest series continues to be "Beverly Hills, 90210," which finished 
43rd among last week's 84 prime-time network programs. Southland Ratings

SIGN OF AN OLD CONTROVERSY IS REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 44-foot-long sign emblazoned with a skull and crossbones was removed from a 
house in an Oxnard subdivision Tuesday, relieving area residents who said the 
structure was an eyesore and hurt property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Dunes residents and property owners said the infamous "Toxic" sign was 
such a spectacle that they used it as a landmark to direct visitors to the 
neighborhood, the site of a former oil-waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 From his balcony next door, Don Viers watched as three workers hired by the 
Oxnard Shores Community Assn. and a couple of volunteers knocked down the 
plywood sign using chain saws, ropes and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's gone," Viers said afterward. "But nobody will be able to find 
my house anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Blanchard, who erected the large plywood sign more than three years 
ago, saw it as a form of political expression and waged numerous legal battles 
to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 But property owners such as Linda Wolf, who owns the duplex across the street 
from the house where Blanchard put up the sign, said it "held the whole 
neighborhood hostage," involving residents in a political controversy whether 
they wanted to be or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf and a handful of association officials, attorneys, property owners and 
real estate people clapped and cheered as the sign fell from the parapet of 
1010 Canal St. to a patio below. The whole process took about 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners of the property allowed the association to remove the sign, 
said Robert Bartosh, an attorney representing the community group. Bartosh said 
an Oklahoma real estate firm acquired the property last month in a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 But news of the sign's destruction stunned Blanchard and his attorney, Kate 
Neiswender. Blanchard said as far as he knows, he still owns the Canal Street 
property and he intends to consult with Neiswender on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard said he hasn't lived at the house or made a payment for six years, 
but that he was never notified about a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the realtors and developers in the area are anxious to get that 
sign down," he said. "I know they're anxious to sell properties on dumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Krakover, vice president of the association and owner of Pacific Shores 
Realty, said state toxics experts found no significant risks in the area. He 
also said the sign is hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
 He said property owners have been unable to sell their houses -- Krakover said 
he knows of only two condominium sales there in the past year -- while prices 
have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others who watched the sign fall Tuesday said it might have also hurt housing 
sales in other beach community neighborhoods, and had hampered efforts to get 
appraisals and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who comes from Wooley Road can't help but see the sign," Krakover 
said. "Even though testing by the state has given the site a clean bill of 
health, the suggestion that there might be toxics scares the hell out of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The sign had been a visible reminder to renters, homeowners and property 
owners of the cloud of controversy hovering over this beach community 
neighborhood since the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy included a series of lawsuits as well as an arson involving 
the home of former resident Lynda Paxton, who had painted a sign on her duplex 
on Dunes Street that read "Oxnard's Own Love Canal." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire remains an unsolved case. In March, plaintiffs agreed to a settlement 
of lawsuits involving multiple defendants connected with the development at 
Oxnard Dunes and companies that dumped wastes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard was awarded a $84,000 judgment in the settlement but never collected 
it because of a legal snarl involving the statute of limitations, Neiswender 
said. Neiswender said she's trying to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Blanchard continues to pursue his lawsuit against the Oxnard Shores 
Community Assn. over the association's removal of a smaller "Toxic" sign in 
October, 1990. That case is scheduled to go to trial Jan. 9 in Ventura County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard contends the association trespassed in removing that sign. Bartosh 
contends the sign violated the real estate codes, covenants and restrictions 
governing the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard alleges that when he and a friend tried to stop workers from 
removing the sign in 1990 they hit him with their vehicle, injuring Blanchard's 
legs. Blanchard also is pressing a libel suit against an association official, 
whom Blanchard alleges defamed him in flyers distributed in the neighborhood.

FIELD HONORS LEGACY OF SLAIN OFFICER; OXNARD: NEWLY RENOVATED SITE IS RENAMED 
FOR DETECTIVE JAMES O'BRIEN, WHO WAS KILLED LAST YEAR BY A GUNMAN. HE 
OFFICIATED GAMES THERE. 
</P>

<P>
 Wearing white gloves and crisp black uniforms, the Oxnard Police Department 
honor guard stood silently at arms while tears welled in the eyes of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many a cold night I've been at this field," said Pat O'Brien, mother of slain 
Oxnard Police Detective James O'Brien. "But it's a warm feeling now." 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional ceremony Tuesday, colleagues of O'Brien mingled with Oxnard 
city officials and unemployment office workers who had watched in terror a year 
ago as a suicidal gunman methodically shot their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the formal dedication of a sports field long associated with 
O'Brien, who for years officiated youth football games on the very field now 
named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to keep someone alive is to make sure you never forget," said 
Tom O'Brien, whose brother was killed last December by unemployed computer 
programmer Alan Winterbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I drive by, it'll jar my memory and I'll think of Jim," he said. 
"Remembering means he's alive and very much well with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly renovated athletic field in Beck Park at Laurel and C streets in 
south Oxnard will from now on be named O.B. Field, Mayor Manuel Lopez told 
dozens of officers, friends and mourners at the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 The softball and football field was named O.B. Field rather than O'Brien Field 
on the recommendation of the dead officer's co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Jim," Pat O'Brien said, pointing to the gold-plated plaque that will 
commemorate the field. "It would have been too starchy to spell out James 
O'Brien. He was always 'O.B.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was killed Dec. 2, 1993, when he chased Winterbourne from an Oxnard 
unemployment office, where the chronically unemployed computer analyst shot 
three people dead and wounded four others. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne shot and killed O'Brien near the intersection of Victoria Avenue 
and Olivas Park Drive when they stopped in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said O'Brien's confrontation with Winterbourne slowed the 
gunman enough so that other officers could catch him before he killed anyone 
else. Police fatally wounded Winterbourne in the parking lot of a jobs office 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in my mind that Jim and the other officers saved the lives 
of some of the workers at the Ventura (Employment Development Department) 
office," Tom O'Brien said. "That's where he was headed." 
</P>
<P>
 City and police officials said naming the sports park for O'Brien was a 
fitting tribute to an officer who dedicated a large portion of his leisure time 
to youth athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all feel a sense of loss because Jim was more than a member of the Oxnard 
Police Department," Chief Harold Hurtt said. "He was a member of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed in hard work," the chief said. "He also loved children, and this 
field is a place for children to come out and play sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie O'Brien, the detective's wife, and the couple's two children were not 
on hand Tuesday because they were not yet prepared to handle the emotion 
publicly, Hurtt said. The wife and children were expected to visit the field 
privately Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien's brother, sisters and mother all took solace in knowing that the 
detective died doing what he loved best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked being a cop and chasing down bad guys," said Tom O'Brien, who 
teaches math and science at Santa Clara High School, across the street from 
O.B. Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors of the shooting took a moment Tuesday to honor those who came to 
their rescue that Thursday morning last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who work at EDD never really had the opportunity to thank all of 
you officers -- especially James O'Brien," said Irma Lopez, the mayor's wife, 
who narrowly escaped death during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what you're going through because we lost our co-workers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trish O'Brien said this Thursday will be especially trying for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanksgiving is going to be hard, but we'll be together as a family and Jim 
will be with us in spirit," said the slain officer's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll light a blue candle for him."

PLAN WOULD CUT SCHOOLS' DEFICIT BY $5.4 MILLION; SIMI VALLEY: REDUCED PAYMENTS 
TO THE EMPLOYEES' HEALTH PROGRAMS AND THE SALE OF EXCESS REAL ESTATE ARE 
SUGGESTED TO THE BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Responding to demands to curb spending or lose control of their finances, Simi 
Valley school officials presented a plan Tuesday to cut $5.4 million from the 
district's $5.9-million projected deficit during the next two school years. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of possible reductions -- such as reduced payments to employees' health 
plans and the sale of excess real estate -- was presented to the school board 
Tuesday evening during a two-hour budget study session. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are ways I think we can effectively reduce this budget," said Wayne 
Templeton, the district's chief financial analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The board took no action Tuesday evening. A final vote on the reductions is 
expected Dec. 13, and the district's plan must be submitted to county school 
officials by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not balancing the budget yet," Assistant Supt. E. Leon Mattingley 
explained. "The county just wants to be sure we have a plan in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Tuesday evening meeting, Templeton said he thought the proposed 
cuts would reassure the county. "I think I can convince the county 
superintendent of schools that we are OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, schools Supt. Charles Weis notified six Ventura County districts, 
including Simi Valley and Moorpark districts and the Oxnard elementary school 
district, that they had to cut projected spending for the 1995-96 school year 
or face sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we are saying is they have to get control," Weis said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If school districts do not take swift steps to reduce spending, Weis said, the 
county will act on behalf of the state and take over the districts' finances. 
But that has never happened in Ventura County and is not likely to occur, he 
added. California school districts are required by law to balance their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor fiscal decisions and bad financial planning" have led to district 
takeovers in other counties, Weis said. "That's not the case in Simi Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District is the largest district in the county 
with more than 18,000 students, and trustees have struggled in recent years to 
balance its $75.5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut costs, the board made up a $2.5-million shortfall this school year in 
part by eliminating about 24 teaching positions and imposing a $200 student 
busing fee. The school board will begin its official budget planning in January 
in hopes of adopting a 1995-96 spending plan July at the beginning of the 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, school officials will prepare a letter to Weis and approve a 
cost-cutting plan for board approval in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, where the district is facing a projected $450,000 deficit in its 
$24-million budget next year, officials outlined cost-saving measures last 
summer, Assistant Supt. Carmela Vignocchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials agree that without additional funds from Sacramento, 
balancing budgets next year is going to be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school district, like all other school districts in the state, has not 
received a cost-of-living increase in four years," Vignocchi said. "I don't 
know any district that isn't struggling."

ARREST PLAN REJECTED FOR RIVERBED DWELLERS; VENTURA: OFFICIALS OPT FOR EFFORTS 
TO DISCOURAGE PANHANDLING IN DOWNTOWN WHILE SEEKING ALTERNATIVE HOUSING FOR 
ROUGHLY 200 HOMELESS. 
</P>

<P>
 A proposal to arrest squatters living in the Ventura River bottom has 
sputtered before the Ventura City Council, with council members opting instead 
for a plan to discourage transients from loitering downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly all support helping the homeless and helping the merchants," 
Councilman Gary Tuttle said during the council debate Monday night. "Where we 
begin to start having (disagreement) is with the idea of arresting homeless 
violators and breaking up encampments. I think that could get ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council voted unanimously for a plan that calls for tougher 
panhandling ordinances, increased police foot patrols downtown through 
Christmas and a continuing search for alternative housing for the approximately 
200 river-bottom dwellers.  
</P>
<P>
 The action was a step to assuage downtown business owners, who complain that 
transients litter and disturb their customers. The merchants say they think 
many of the problem panhandlers walk up from their encampments on the river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our staff is beginning to face questions from tour operators," said Bill 
Clawson, director of Ventura's visitors bureau. "Some of our hotels are 
beginning to lose business because the atmosphere outside the hotel is not as 
friendly as the atmosphere inside the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Brennan, general manager of the Chart House restaurant, said that while 
he did not want the council to kick the homeless out of the river bottom if 
they had nowhere to go, he thought the city needed to take some action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around my restaurant, I have three homeless encampments," he said, adding 
that the transients there have begun to pester restaurant-goers, as well as set 
off his security alarm late at night by rattling doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "My employees and my customers are starting to get gravely concerned," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also heard from social service providers and river-bottom 
dwellers, all of whom urged the council to postpone clearing the area until 
suitable housing could be found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems strange to me that a report from the housing committee only reduces 
housing for some people in Ventura," said Clyde Reynolds, director of the 
Turning Point Foundation, which provides services to mentally ill homeless. "I 
don't accept the idea that there are not resources to viably address this 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Thompson, who also lives at the river bottom, implored council members 
to reject the police plan before them. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of the people of the river bottom, I ask that you do not remove us 
from our homes," she said. "Our homes are to us as your homes are to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's housing committee -- composed of council members Rosa Lee 
Measures, Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan -- presented the original enforcement 
proposal after months of study sessions and community meetings on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's final draft, as prepared by Ventura Police Capt. Randy Adams, 
had three phases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase, the police and social service providers would have warned 
the river-bottom squatters that they must move, while providing them with a 
list of shelters that might have room for them.  
</P>
<P>
 During the second phase, the police would have photographed, fingerprinted and 
written citations on those homeless people who refused to leave the river 
bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 In the third phase, police officers would have arrested any homeless person 
who still lived on the river banks and destroyed the encampments there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, at a total price tag of up to $200,000 for the first year, also 
included finding money for a downtown police storefront and for increased 
police foot patrols downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the housing committee worked with homeless advocates and the police 
on a plan for a homeless campground away from the river bottom, which would 
have given the transients a roof over their heads and access to crucial social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fall, committee members decided that Ventura could not afford to pay 
for a campground. Tingstrom proposed drawing up a list of the county's 
available shelters in the hopes that together they would provide enough space 
to house all the river squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Pete Bulens had warned committee members that the city could be 
setting itself up for a lawsuit if it did not provide adequate housing for the 
squatters once it kicked them out of the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 River-bottom dwellers who attended Monday night's council meeting said they 
were appalled that the city would consider forcing them from their homes while 
leaving them few housing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sanders, who has lived on the river banks for the past 10 months, told 
the council that he once had a job and a family but lost them to alcoholism. He 
said he is trying to turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same wants and needs as everyone else," he said.

THOUSAND OAKS INCREASES PAY FOR 2 OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite complaints that the timing is inappropriate, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council agreed Tuesday night to a pay raise of $7,312 for City Manager Grant 
Brimhall and $2,937 for City Atty. Mark Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 3 to 1 with Councilwoman Jamie Zukowski dissenting. Elois Zeanah 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises are retroactive to October, 1993, giving the top officials an 
unexpected windfall just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a better city manager in the state," said Mayor Alex 
Fiore, who proposed the pay increases at his last regular council meeting 
before retirement. "And it is tough to go three or four years without any 
improvement in salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for departing 
county chief administrator Richard Wittenberg, has not received a raise on his 
base salary of $121,860 in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he declined a 5% merit raise offered to him, citing the poor 
economic conditions facing the city. On Tuesday, he said he would accept this 
6% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they feel is fine," Brimhall said. "Most of it would go to charity 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jamie Zukowski said the pay raise should not have been introduced 
at a time when the council is in such flux. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that it is good policy to have this question before a council 
that is about to seat two new members," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore is retiring at the end of the month, and Councilman Frank Schillo is 
leaving office to join the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the pay raise a "final Fiore moment" in public comments, resident 
Ekbal Quidwai asked that the measure be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a council that has two people departing to vote on this, I don't consider 
proper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiore bristled at the suggestion of waiting until a new council is seated 
to vote on the raise, saying that the increases are based on past work by the 
two officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a brand new person coming in could judge their work for the 
last two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said the council needed to bring Brimhall's salary in line with other 
cities of similar size. Brimhall makes less than city managers in Burbank, 
Sunnyvale, Santa Monica, Irvine and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Camarillo, I understand the city manager started at $99,000 a year," he 
said. "Our city is over twice as large. We are talking about a budget of $70 
(million) to $80 million a year, and Grant is in charge of an excess of 400 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 With benefits and perks, Brimhall's total compensation will be about $163,000, 
making him the second highest paid city manager in the county behind Simi 
Valley City Manager Lin Koester, who makes $185,160, including benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' $97,920 salary will be boosted to $100,857. He had last received a 
merit raise of 5% in December, 1992. He also receives a benefits package worth 
more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar praised both officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been three years since they got raises," she said. "I think if we had 
dealt with our city employees in the same fashion, we would have had some very 
unhappy employees. I think the city manager has done an outstanding job and the 
city attorney has been very effective."

FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF 85 GOLF CLUB FOUNDRY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park foundry that makes golf clubs burst into flames Tuesday, 
forcing the evacuation of 85 workers and slightly injuring three firefighters, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which spread from a boiling vat of paraffin, blew out 10 
second-story windows at the Wilson Sporting Goods plant at 810 Lawrence Drive, 
allowing the cold wind to fan the flames throughout the east end of the second 
floor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural damage was estimated at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if I could be happy with anything, it's the way the employees handled 
the evacuation," said plant manager Greg Hill, standing with several workers in 
front of the bone-white, 44,000-square-foot structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-alarm blaze, which started about 6:40 a.m., was contained in an hour 
but continued to flare up four hours later because of winds that gusted up to 
30 m.p.h., said spokeswoman Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten fire companies, in addition to two ladder-truck companies and two 
hazardous materials teams, responded to the fire in the light industrial 
district off Rancho Conejo Boulevard, north of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter O.J. Hunt, whose crew gingerly cut holes in the "tar and mop" roof 
to release 25-foot plumes of fire and heat, collapsed on the grass across the 
street from the blaze. Hunt was treated for heat exhaustion and released from 
St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had several wind changes, and he had some smoke exposure from that," said 
Capt. Ron Topolinski, whose crew navigated the lattice-work of beams that form 
the ribs of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other firefighters were treated at the scene, one for a twisted ankle and 
another for minor facial abrasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Wells said of the evacuation. "The whole company should be 
complimented for their practicing fire (drills). . . . Sometimes we have whole 
families of just a few people and they aren't sure everybody is out, and here 
we have a company that got all their people out, all 85 of them, all accounted 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 This cut the risks to firefighters, she added, because they did not have to 
plunge into the building in search of missing people. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the chemicals used in the foundry, two hazardous materials teams 
spent three hours combing the warehouse-like structure for toxic fumes. About 
65 firefighters later used three wood-and-plastic troughs to decontaminate 
their boots and pants, dousing them with water. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, whose plant casts up to 60,000 irons and metal woods weekly, said the 
fire began in a 5,000-square-foot area where wax is removed from the molds for 
the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about a quarter of the building's interior -- about 10,000 square feet -- 
was burned, Wells said. She did not expect a damage estimate for the contents 
of the plant until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to an employee's report of smoke, mechanic Frank Torres rushed to 
the six-worker "finishing cell," grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to douse 
the flames. Fellow mechanic Barry Schlosberg joined him. When their efforts 
failed, one of them hit the fire alarm and the employees filed out within 
minutes, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Langmack, vice president of Wilson's golf club group in Chicago, said 
work could resume at the plant as early as late next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf club foundry, the only one owned and operated by the giant sporting 
goods manufacturer, ships its unfinished steel clubs to Tullahoma, Tenn., where 
they are polished, painted, shafted and gripped, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The production stoppage should not adversely affect the firm's business, he 
added, because the fire did not damage the area where the bulk of the work is 
done and because cold weather typically slows demands for golf clubs this time 
of year.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: POWERFUL WINDS EXPECTED TO EASE

<P>
 The gusty northeast winds that swept across Ventura County on Tuesday, fanning 
two small grass fires and downing several trees, were expected to die down 
considerably today. 
</P>
<P>
 The two brush fires both occurred in School Canyon off Ventura Avenue in 
Ventura.The first, a small half-acre blaze, was reported about 1 p.m. and 
quickly extinguished. Firefighters responded to the second fire about 3:15 
p.m., which grew to three acres before being contained about 45 minutes later, 
said Mary Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were expected to remain in the canyon until sundown. Investigators had 
not yet determined causes for the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's winds blew from 20 to 30 m.p.h. below mountain passes, gusting to 40 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gomberg, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, said the winds 
were caused by a large high-pressure system over Nevada and Idaho funneling 
cool air toward Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomberg said the gusts differed from the classic Santa Ana winds because they 
did not bring a sharp upswing in temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers with the California Highway Patrol said the weather caused no 
serious problems in Ventura County, although several trees were reported down 
in the western half of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures today are expected to be in the mid-60s, dropping to the 
upper-30s and mid-40s at night with clear skies and light winds. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS-ELECT TO ATTEND CEO TALKS

<P>
 Ventura County's two newly elected supervisors will be included in board 
discussions on replacing outgoing chief administrator Richard Wittenberg, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting in closed session, the Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to 
invite Judy Mikels and Frank Schillo, who will be sworn in Jan. 3, to future 
meetings regarding the selection of a new county manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said it is important that the two incoming supervisors participate in 
the search for Wittenberg's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he had talked earlier to Supervisors Vicky Howard and John Flynn 
about being included in the board's discussions, but that it had not been made 
clear until Tuesday whether that was legally possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said the board plans to meet in closed session next 
Tuesday to discuss naming an interim manager as well as finding a permanent 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg, the county's top executive for 16 years, surprised officials last 
week by announcing that he will step down Jan. 23 to take a job in Santa Clara 
County. He said he accepted the new job because he wanted the challenge of 
working in a more urban county. CARLOS LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD RETAINS FEE CAP FOR APPEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to complaints from residents, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
agreed Tuesday to maintain a $1,200 cap on fees charged for appealing decisions 
by either the Ventura County Planning Commission or its director. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to retain the fee cap after hearing testimony from 
half a dozen county residents who complained that removing the ceiling would 
preclude people of limited financial means from participating in the appeals 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members agreed that lifting the cap on appeal fees would discourage 
public participation on future planning issues. The county requires an $800 
deposit to file an appeal, with a maximum $1,200 billing limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's staff had recommended that the billing limit be eliminated to 
recoup some out-of-pocket county expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Collart of the county's Resource Management Agency said that costs for 
writing staff reports and analysis associated with appeals occasionally exceed 
the $1,200 limit and that the county must pick up the remaining costs. On 
average, he said, those additional costs amount to about $6,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said they did not think the county's cost was significant 
enough to warrant lifting the fee cap. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; YOUNGSTERS GOBBLE UP FEAST, HISTORY

 Michael Caine was one hungry little Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 Munching on a plate piled high with turkey, mashed potatoes, corn, sliced 
apples and Jell-O, the 6-year-old University School student Tuesday enjoyed the 
first of two Thanksgiving feasts he will devour this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks elementary's pre-holiday meal was served to about 200 
kindergarten, first- and second-grade students, many of whom donned Native 
American and Pilgrim costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The noon event, which included a musical performance, was organized to teach 
children the meaning of Thanksgiving and bring three grade levels together for 
a common activity, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to promote camaraderie in the primary grades," said kindergarten 
teacher Margaret Kemp. "I thought this would be a nice way." 
</P>
<P>
 The feast also provided children with a taste of history, since many classes 
discussed the history of Thanksgiving before Tuesday's events. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a Native American vest tailored out of a paper grocery bag, Michael 
defined the holiday as "a day when people give thanks and go to someone's house 
to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Bryce Henderson said Thanksgiving "is a celebration of when the 
Pilgrims discovered America." But the second-grader was not sure who those 
Pilgrims were who founded the Plymouth Colony in 1620. "I think they came from 
Spain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers also stressed the unhistoric aspects of Thanksgiving in their 
classes by asking children to bring canned foods for hungry Ventura County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kind of makes them aware that there are other people who don't have 
food," said teacher Mave Colunga. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 parents prepared hot food dishes for the feast, which included two 
large turkeys donated by a local grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," parent Anna Halle said. "It's a custom that we follow 
year after year, and how many kids really understand it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said most teachers incorporated the holiday into their class discussions, 
both its history and its traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every class has talked about what the original Thanksgiving was like and how 
it has changed," she said. "Your father doesn't shoot a turkey anymore, your 
mom goes to Vons and buys it." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DAY-CARE PROVIDER SERVICE TO END

<P>
 County budget cuts have eliminated a local program providing information on 
day-care providers, shifting callers to a state office in Santa Barbara 
beginning Dec. 1, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County previously hired contractors locally to provide family day-care 
licensing information to those who called a county phone number, said Dennis 
Trenten, spokesman in the county's Public Social Services Agency.After Nov. 30, 
all inquiries will be referred to the state's Community Care Licensing Division 
office in Santa Barbara, Trenten said. That number is 682-7647. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County officials say they will eliminate the licensing information to 
save on the $30,000-a-year contract, Trenten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers will be able to get the same information from the Santa Barbara 
office. "The only difference will be that a call to Santa Barbara might be a 
little more expensive," he said. 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LIGHT AT INTERSECTION OKD AFTER 2 
MISHAPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to concerns over accidents at a Simi Valley crosswalk, the City 
Council has agreed to install a flashing light at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked for a study on accidents at the intersection of Royal Avenue 
and El Monte Drive after two accidents occurred on successive days in late 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-shaped intersection has a painted yellow crosswalk, and traffic coming 
from El Monte Drive is controlled by a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, a motorist hit a student in the crosswalk, and on Sept. 27 a 
teen-ager on in-line skates careened into a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 A report compiled by Bill Golubics, assistant public works director, showed 
that despite the accidents, the intersection is as safe as others in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the council agreed to install a temporary flashing yellow light 
at the corner to warn motorists of crossing students. 
</P>
<P>
 The council disregarded suggestions that a crossing guard be stationed at the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about junior high school students," Mayor Greg Stratton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to cross with a crossing guard. They're a real pain." SARA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNTY BACKS SUIT AGAINST RADAR TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County will express support in federal court for a lawsuit aimed at 
shutting down a radiation-emitting weather tower in Ojai, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors authorized attorneys to file an amicus curiae brief 
with the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after discussing the issue in 
closed session Tuesday, said County Counsel James L. McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will argue in the brief that the federal government should have 
followed regular planning procedures and conducted public hearings before 
installing the 98-foot-tall radar tower atop Sulphur Mountain, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the government gone through the regular process of acquiring a 
conditional use permit, there would have been an opportunity for the public to 
have some input," McBride said. "But that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, U. S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. threw out a lawsuit filed 
by Ojai residents seeking to shut down the National Weather Service tower until 
more health studies are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter said there was no evidence to support residents' claims that the 
government intentionally misled local officials about the weather-tracking 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Environmental Coalition of Ojai contend in their lawsuit 
against the government that the tower poses a health risk because it emits 
harmful levels of radiation. Federal officials say this is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Hatter's decision, the coalition decided to take its case to the U. 
S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY CANCELS MEETING ON HOUSING PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard officials on Tuesday canceled a special City Council meeting at which 
real estate speculator Donald T. Kojima was to submit a proposal to build 115 
low-cost houses on city-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which was not announced until noon Monday, was postponed until 
December because most council members could not attend the entire presentation, 
said city Atty.Gary Gillig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit, there was some confusion over whether a meeting was scheduled, so we 
decided to cancel," Gillig said. "It's too important not to have everyone 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the meeting Monday came as a surprise to farm worker 
advocates, who were turned down earlier this month when they asked the council 
to let them submit alternative proposals at the same time as Kojima.  
</P>
<P>
 Kojima said he was just as surprised about the special meeting, which he did 
not learn about until he received a call from a city official Monday. He was 
originally scheduled to present his proposal Nov. 15, but that presentation was 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said Monday that the council, which is not meeting again 
until Dec. 6, wanted to see what Kojima put together before outgoing Councilman 
Michael A. Plisky has to step down from office that day. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a $5.32-million land deal between Kojima and Oxnard, the city 
agreed to give Kojima the first crack at submitting a proposal to build 115 
low-cost houses on the property he had just sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was conceived as a way to relocate the residents of the Oxnard 
Mobilehome Lodge, one of the county's worst slums, by building them a new place 
to live. But the houses Kojima originally proposed were criticized by farm 
worker advocates as too expensive, and the council vowed to provide more 
affordable houses. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MOTHER OF SUSPECT CHARGED AS ACCESSORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother of a Port Hueneme murder suspect has been charged with being an 
accessory after the crime because prosecutors believe she hid the weapon used 
in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Terry appeared Tuesday in Superior Court in response to an indictment 
handed down last week by the Ventura County grand jury.Her arraignment on the 
felony charge was postponed until Dec. 7, Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicted with Terry was her son, Zolly, 21, on charges of murder, attempted 
premeditated murder, use of a firearm and infliction of great bodily injury. 
The indictment of Zolly Terry supersedes the filing of identical charges 
against him in Ventura County Municipal Court last month and will allow his 
case to proceed to trial faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolly Terry is charged with the Oct. 24 slaying of Jerome Hurst, 25, and the 
attempted murder of Vernon Hunter, 27, both of Oxnard. Police said Hunter was 
romantically linked to Terry's sister, who was pregnant, but Hunter was living 
with another woman when he was shot inside his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst was killed in the same attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said police have been unable to find the .380 semiautomatic pistol 
used by the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that Dolores Terry disposed of the murder weapon," the prosecutor 
said. "We have witnesses that indicate that she went to the location where the 
defendant had hidden the gun and she re-obtained the gun, and it's not been 
seen . . . since." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Terry is free on her own recognizance. Zolly Terry is in the Ventura 
County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 His Superior Court arraignment also has been postponed until Dec. 7. BARBARA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CHARGE UPHELD IN SPOUSAL BATTERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor who barged into a defense attorney's office to subpoena a witness 
did not behave so badly that criminal charges should be dismissed against the 
defendant, a Municipal Court judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he found that the actions of Deputy Dist. Atty.Paul Junge were 
"highly inappropriate," Judge Edward F. Brodie ruled that the defense was not 
harmed by the prosecutor's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot conclude that this is outrageous conduct," Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling means that Mitchell Blair, 38, of Oxnard, must stand trial 
on a misdemeanor spousal battery charge. The case is scheduled to return to 
court today for assignment to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's case was in trial last month when Junge saw Blair's wife, the alleged 
victim in the case, enter a conference room in the public defender's office, 
according to court records. Moments later, he and a district attorney's 
investigator entered the room without knocking and gave the woman a subpoena, 
Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge declared a mistrial when he learned what happened, and Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee apologized to the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the public defender's office argued in court that Junge's behavior 
was so inappropriate, it justified dismissal of the case. Deputy Public 
Defender Randolph Tucker said the incident interrupted Blair's wife as she was 
about to recant her earlier statements to police about being beaten by the 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. De Noce, who said Junge has been removed from the 
case, argued against dismissal of the charge. He said Junge's actions were 
improper, but dismissal was too severe a sanction. BARBARA MURPHY

O.C. MUSIC; FOUR SEASONS STARTING OVER WITH LISZT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By all rights, the Orange County Four Seasons Orchestra should play Mahler's 
"Resurrection" Symphony at its concert Sunday. It has come, gone, come, gone 
and now, come again. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Irvine-based group will begin its third life with a Mostly Liszt 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 To list the organization's intricate bloodlines, you'd wind up with something 
looking like one of those genealogical charts that help you get through a 
Shakespeare history play. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra was founded in 1990 by local free-lance violist Carolyn Broe to 
play baroque and early classical music. Unlike most other orchestra founders, 
Broe had no interest in conducting. She planned to keep her violist's position 
and invite a series of guest conductors to lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But her Four Seasons only appeared once, with Donald Ambroson conducting in 
October, 1990, at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband changed jobs, Broe moved a few months later to Scottsdale, 
Ariz., where she started another Four Seasons Chamber Orchestra. In an effort 
to keep the Orange County wing going, the group merged with John Elg's newly 
formed Irvine Chamber Orchestra, which had never played a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 This Four Seasons Orchestra gave its first concert under Elg's direction in 
April, 1991, at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The first concert focused as Broe had envisioned it, on music of the baroque: 
Bach, Handel and Vivaldi. The second included premieres of pieces by Orange 
County composers John Gerhold and Kenneth Friedenreich in emphasizing 
20th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why we never heard of it again. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incarnation of the orchestra numbers 70 members who will play 
Sunday under Roger Hickman's direction at the Irvine theater. Pianist Leonid 
Kuzmin will be the soloist in two works on the Liszt program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, music director of the Los Angeles Classical Ballet, professor of 
music at Cal State Long Beach and one of the two conductors of the defunct 
Irvine Symphony, took over in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the Irvine Symphony had stopped functioning, we were left without a 
nonprofit status," Hickman, 45, said in a recent phone interview. "I still had 
the Irvine Youth Symphony and we were looking for umbrella to work with. We 
also wanted to build a professional orchestra. This was a perfect opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Symphony was started by then-UCI professor Peter Odegard in 1978, 
one year before the Pacific Symphony was born. By the late '80s, financial 
troubles had set in. It scheduled and later canceled concerts, ran up a $25,000 
debt for its 1987-88 season at the Orange County Performing Arts Center and in 
1988 also lost the office space that the Irvine Co. had donated since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra survived the financial crisis through corporate and private 
donations, however, and by the summer of 1989, retired more than 80% of the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at the end of the 1990-91 season, the management decided to call it 
quits. 
</P>
<P>
 The new umbrella organization is called the Four Seasons Music Foundation and 
it sponsors four organizations -- La Primavera, a college-high school 
orchestra; the Irvine Youth Symphony, an ensemble for younger players; the 
Irvine Chamber Youth Orchestra, for even younger musicians, and the Four 
Seasons Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's concert is the first under the sponsorship of the new organization. 
Two more are planned: a Tchaikovsky program at the Irvine Barclay on March 19, 
and a May 12 concert at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for all the groups, Hickman said, is about $55,000, most of which 
is targeted to come from ticket sales, with the rest from individuals and 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're stretching," Hickman said. "We've got enough funds to hire a fully 
professional orchestra. We're building bit by bit. But we're not where we want 
to go yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major obstacle is that you want to establish right away the quality of 
being a group. That takes money," he said. "But which comes first -- quality or 
a money base to create that quality? It's not something that happens 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman was raised in Orange County. He went to Troy High School in Fullerton, 
UC Irvine and then UC Berkeley to receive a doctorate in musicology in 1972. He 
taught for six years in Hawaii, where he also played viola in the Honolulu 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 After that he returned to Orange County to teach and study at UCI. There, he 
worked with Odegard, who hired him for the Irvine Symphony. He now teaches 
music history at Cal State Long Beach, where he also led the orchestra for 
about six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The load got pretty heavy," he said. "So I took over the principal recruiting 
duties and got some other people to conduct. My primary duties now are in 
string recruiting and teaching music history classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do try to keep up my playing," he added.  
</P>
<P>
 His plans for the Four Seasons are to balance familiar and unfamiliar 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who have never heard Beethoven's Fifth before, although 
for others that's a tired warhorse," he said. "We will balance that with new 
works, like the (Marcel) Dupre G-minor Organ Concerto at the Crystal Cathedral 
in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
 * Roger Hickman will conduct the Four Seasons Orchestra in music by Liszt and 
Beethoven on Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, 
Irvine. Pianist Leonid Kuzmin will be the soloist in Liszt's "Totentanz" and 
"Hungarian Fantasia." Hickman will also conduct Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 
2" and Beethoven's "Leonore" Overture No. 3. $15 to $25. (714) 854-4646.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'SHOT IN THE DARK' HITS MARK ON COMIC TIMING; AT LONG BEACH 
PLAYHOUSE, THE CAST'S RAT-A-TAT-TAT DELIVERY MAKES THE VERBAL FARCE WORK, BUT 
THE UNDERLYING SENSE OF CLASS WARFARE MISFIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Be warned: The Long Beach Playhouse's current production of "A Shot in the 
Dark" is not to be confused with the identically titled movie with Peter 
Sellers, the second in the Pink Panther series. 
</P>
<P>
 While both lampoon the French law-and-order establishment, the similarity 
stops there. The Sellers "Shot" is a small wonder of physical comedy; the play, 
adapted by Harry Kurnitz from Marcel Achard's "L'Idiote," is a verbal farce 
with a maximum of flapping tongues and a minimum of swinging doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors that do open in this case of the murdered chauffeur are nicely 
exploited, though, by director J.D. Reichelderfer and actor Jerome Loeb, who 
milks every second as an old, bent-backed guard slooooowly bringing witnesses 
in and out of Paul Sevigne's (Tom Wagner) chamber. After 10, 15, 20 minutes of 
well-timed gabbing, Loeb's ridiculous gentleman is just the right rhythmic 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Things here are set at a less-than-frantic pitch, and Beth Kellerman's wily 
maid Josefa is careful not to disturb the tone -- even though Josefa is accused 
of killing the chauffeur. (Who else? She was found naked, next to the corpse, 
with seemingly incriminating evidence.) Kellerman is unashamedly cute as 
Josefa, but she's also smarter than the whole bunch of magistrates and 
upper-class twits who employ her. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the twits -- particularly, Monsieur Beaurevers (Ivan Allen) -- may 
have done it. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems open-and-shut becomes class warfare; maybe not another "Dreyfus 
Affair," as it is described by Sevigne's uptight boss, LaBlanche (Mitchell 
Nunn), but upsetting of the social order. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this most French of reasons for comedy, an American cast is not 
necessarily attuned to the class strata under the nonsense. Not that it 
couldn't be: There is, after all, first-rate American Moliere on view from time 
to time. But Reichelderfer's cast generally has little more than mastery of 
verbal timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellerman, Nunn and Allen have their accents -- and attitudes -- down pat, but 
no one is in the comic class of Carl DaSilva as Morestan, Sevigne's delirious 
assistant. Like an Art Carney to Wagner's Jackie Gleason, DaSilva pops in and 
out of the action, dropping comic firecrackers along the way. He makes this 
very long play just a tad shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the light of DaSilva's turns, Wagner sometimes seems dazzled and not quite 
sure what to do next. Wagner captures some of his bureaucrat's befuddlement and 
sense of justice, but given that he's almost always onstage, his muddled accent 
truly impedes the comedy's verbal music. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Shot in the Dark" is in the classic vein of what Parisians call "boulevard 
theater," which always ends happily. The playhouse's Studio Theatre is the size 
of some of the boulevard houses, and Steve Shapiro's set is a nice fit, though 
it could be much dingier. Donna Fritscheavoids overdoing it with the costumes 
-- not easy to do in a show with so many broad stereotypes. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; TWO GOOD TO BE THREE ONE-ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Revolving Door's "Three Original One-Acts," at the Tribune Theatre, runs three 
hours. It's obvious the evening is one play too long. 
</P>
<P>
 That play is the opener, William Alewyn's "El Dorado." Followed by Steve 
Spehar's intriguing "Delilah's Garden" and Lydia Dunn's delightful faux 
feminist "Dancing Through the Arms of Desire," it pales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorado" is little more than an event that takes place in a coal mine that has 
just collapsed. The protagonists (Bradley A. Whitfield, Steven Lamprinos, David 
Paris) alternate between bonding and coming unglued, all to the tune of their 
mutual relationships with a prostitute named Bianca (Su Madrinan). 
</P>
<P>
 Under Whitfield's even-headed direction, the performances, like the writing, 
are standard. It looks for all the world like a scene extracted from a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Spehar's "Garden," directed by the playwright, is a tone poem about a girl's 
attempt to rationalize her father's death. It is poetic and well-constructed, 
but Spehar's extended blackouts for changes tend to break the rhythms of his 
writing. A bare stage with a couple of chairs and a table would allow him to 
gather the seams of his lyrical tapestry together.  
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Bishton as the girl, Martina Paris as her mother and Terry McNichol 
as the memory of her father are a great help in creating the misty mood of loss 
and the dawning light of healing. 
</P>
<P>
 The gem of the evening is Dunn's "Desire." It begins on a 19th-Century 
battlefield, where Christian (Mike Murphy) is dying in the arms of his friend 
Barnes (Chris Egger). His love, Cora (Erica Dewey), arrives to make him promise 
that he will wait for her, as she will for him, until they meet in a future 
life. The acute satiric tone is established by Christian's stated desire to die 
and leave good-looking hair. 
</P>
<P>
 In her next incarnation, Cora discovers that her female roommate Chris (Kara 
Knappe) is really Christian, this time the satire aimed at early 20th-Century 
attitudes about lesbian love. Finally, in the present day, Cora finds Christian 
once again a male, but this time he's philandering and emotionally dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desire," tautly directed by Nicholas Boicourt II deserves to be a longer 
play. Dunn's humor, aimed at the male and society's rules of conduct between 
the sexes, is sharp, fresh and revealing. The performances are totally matched 
to character and period.  
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; A 'WEDDING' FULL OF PASSION; FIERY MOMENTS IN THE RANCHO 
SANTIAGO COLLEGE PRODUCTION -- NOTABLY THE MALE CHARACTERS' BURNING MACHISMO 
AND SINCERITY -- BRING FEDERICO GARCIA LORCA'S PLAY TO LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The plays of Federico Garcia Lorca are not easy to stage. His lyrical -- if 
often violent and angry -- dramas are clear-cut, bare-boned and explicit. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not a Lorca play that does not require extensive production values to 
bring the heart and meat out of the writing. Those values are the high point of 
this production of "Blood Wedding" at Rancho Santiago College's Little Theatre 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Barbara Covington has surrounded the core of the action with a 
panoply of Spanish dancing in its rigidly structured grandeur (choreography by 
Juan Talavera), heart-wrenching vocals. She has also, finding emotionally weak 
moments in the English translation, allowed her actors to speak in Spanish 
during some of the more passionate scenes. It's a good choice. The actors are 
at home then, and you can almost feel the beat of their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a very large cast, many of the actors are not adept enough to plumb the 
depths of Lorca's writing, but several find moments of fire that bring the 
words to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Guerrero, as the Bride, has a burning-ember quality beneath her angry and 
willful exterior. As the wife of the Bride's earlier lover, Cynthia Vargas 
restrains the volatility inherent in this difficult role. Sandra Borner as the 
Bridegroom's Mother has a stoic power reminiscent of Greek tragedy, and Arme Z. 
Caballero as the Bride's buoyant Friend brings a delicate sense of frivolity to 
her role. 
</P>
<P>
 The males are stronger in the long run, particularly Adrian G.D. Lopez as the 
naive Bridegroom, and Alberto Correa as the Bride's former lover, the randy 
Leonardo. They both burn with machismo flames and sincerity, and their vocal 
duet, an emotional duel of great import, is very impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Arleen Hurtado and Richard Chavez are excellent as the dancing images of the 
Bride and Leonardo, twirling and arching in their dance of doom, in a 
production that looks very good on tilted platforms in the small theater space. 
The scenic and lighting design by D. Silvio Volonte allows the action to be 
fluid and very darkly pictorial, as does the costume design by Wilma 
Mickler-Sears. 
</P>
<P>

1530 W. 17th St., Santa Ana. Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2:30 p.m.

THE CUTTING EDGE; HIP ON-LINE MAGAZINE GENERATES HEAT ON NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first month on the Internet's virtual newsstand, HotWired -- the 
ambitious electronic offspring of the ink-and-paper magazine, Wired -- is 
taking something of a beating in the on-line reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as "the Net's first cyberstation," "way new journalism," or, as Wired 
publisher Louis Rossetto described it in a press release, "live, twitching, the 
real-time nervous system of the planet," HotWired, the consensus seems to be, 
is a little too hip for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 With the parent magazine's reputation as the most-flaunted mascot of the 
digitally aware, many publishers and other businesses are looking to HotWired 
as an example of how to migrate to a new medium. But Internet watchers say the 
young magazine's experience thus far should also serve as a lesson in what to 
watch out for. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, there is the delicate matter of advertising, a controversial 
practice on the Internet that the analog magazine (Wired) has sometimes 
attacked and the digital version (HotWired) engages in with abandon. Despite a 
carefully reasoned e-mail memo sent to every subscriber, the apparent 
contradiction has inspired postings to Internet news groups with titles such as 
"WIRED SELLS OUT." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the sometimes-cumbersome process of user identification. While 
HotWired is free, subscribers must register and enter a password each time they 
want to read it -- thus providing the magazine and its advertisers with some 
minimal demographic information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe Wired has sunk so low as to REGISTER all HotWired users. Come 
on! That's soooo 'tired,' " writes one Internet user, mimicking one of the 
parent magazine's popular features. "Wired: free flowing public information 
with no strings attached. Tired: HotWired/Wired mag hipocrisy (sic)!" 
</P>
<P>
 But overriding such philosophical questions seems to be one of image. The 
design technique that helped San Francisco-based Wired achieve remarkable 
commercial success in just two years of publication -- without stinting on neon 
colors, digitized distortions and unconventional layouts -- is winning far 
fewer fans among the Internet crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Pages are filled with elaborate graphics that take several minutes to 
materialize on the screens of those not privileged to have a super-high-speed 
connection to the Internet. Things are hard to find. The back issues are hidden 
behind an obscure "coin" icon that no one quite gets, and there's no plain old 
table of contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're cool. They know they're cool, and they tell you they're cool, and the 
Internet doesn't really get off on being told that," says Adam Engst, a 
longtime Net surfer and author of Internet Explorer Kit. "It goes against the 
tradition of the Internet, which is good information hype-free." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, most of the criticism of HotWired focuses on packaging. The 
editorial content -- generated independently from that of Wired -- includes 
pictures, video and audio clips, articles on technology and interactive chat 
areas, and has garnered quite a few on-line followers. Nearly 30,000 Internet 
users have registered with the service since the beginning of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite complaints from hard-core users about ads, many agree HotWired has 
broken ground by lining up such names as Volvo, AT&T and Club Med to experiment 
with advertising-based on-line publishing.  
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's editorial policy, different from that of many other 
publications experimenting with electronic editions, has also won friends among 
on-line veterans. "More is not better," HotWired president Andrew Anker told a 
packed seminar on magazines and new media in Beverly Hills last week. "Our 
asset is not our content. Our asset is our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, critics say HotWired suffers from trying to do too much too fast in a 
technological world that is still too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made the most common mistake in businesses entering into the 
Internet, and that is doing their design for the high end of the Net," says 
Aneurin Bosley, editor of the Internet Business Journal. "They get lost in the 
technology, and they lose touch with the consumer base that's out there. The 
result is it's not very hot and not terribly well-wired." 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively new ability to display images easily on the Internet -- and the 
promise of a secure means to transact commerce -- has spurred a rush of 
businesses onto the network, which allows them more aesthetic freedom and 
control over content than commercial on-line services such as America Online 
and Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their sometimes-desperate attempts to appear techno-savvy, Internet 
consultants say, commercial enterprises scouting out the overwrought electronic 
frontier risk turning off those they are trying to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should not try to go for the highly stylized, 3-D graphic, really 
futuristic-looking stuff, because that is not what people really want," says 
Paul Grand of Los Angeles-based Digital Planet. Grand has designed Internet 
sites for MCA/Universal and MGM. "It has to be as comfortable as going to your 
TV set or picking up your phone," he said. "Otherwise it's going to turn people 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 To launch the Universal site, for example, Grand created an on-line version of 
the premiere of "Junior," the studio's recently released film starring Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. But while the company would have liked demographic information 
on who "attended," Grand advised against a registration form based on the 
response he had seen to the HotWired system: "If you make people work too hard, 
they may not come." 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine is taking a more straightforward approach with its Internet 
experiment called Pathfinder, limiting the nouveau icon designs and 
capitalizing as much as possible on what the Time name has traditionally meant 
to subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have a Time Inc. corporate mentality about this, but I have to believe 
that the real job here is to make this more of a mass medium, and I'm not sure 
the best way to do that is to make it seem as gee whiz and arcane as some of us 
are doing," said Robert Pondiscio, public affairs director for Time. HotWired 
is trying to respond to some of the criticism. "Clearly there are some things 
we can do better," says Anker. "One of the complaints is there's so much there, 
it's hard to get a sense of what it is. We'll definitely be adding improved 
user interfaces." In any case, Anker says, HotWired never aimed to appeal to 
all of the Internet's users.  
</P>
<P>
 "The intent behind HotWired was not to do the lowest common denominator, 
please-everybody kind of service. We think content and media drive technology, 
and if we tried to do a system where we support black-and-white monitors, fast 
speeds and slow speeds, we would not have something that would drive this 
medium forward. We don't want to be for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 HotWired says its target audience is the "digital community, the people 
driving the Digital Revolution through their creation and deployment of digital 
technologies." But ironically, the power-user base that HotWired is aimed at 
may be the least receptive to its current format.  
</P>
<P>
 While Wired based its remarkable commercial success on a subscriber base of 
high-income techie and techie wanna-bes, the Internet demographics may be 
considerably different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they are trying to appeal to the supposedly 'young, hip' cats that are 
on-line and 'like disorder,' " says Peter Bray, who runs his own site and a 
consulting business called Internet Marketing in Portland, Ore. "Well, the 
people that I know who use the Net are pretty much all male math students. And 
they prefer order."

MICROSOFT DEAL FACING INTENSE NEW SCRUTINY; MERGER: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEKS 
MORE DETAILS ABOUT GIANT'S PROPOSED PURCHASE OF INTUIT. ANTITRUST QUESTIONS 
LOOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department has asked Microsoft Corp. and Intuit Inc. for more 
information about their proposed $1.5-billion merger, indicating that the deal 
is facing intense scrutiny for possible antitrust problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The request, issued Friday, is the second from the Justice Department, which 
is trying to weigh the merger's implications for something that hasn't yet 
taken full flight but is expected to soar: the market for on-line electronic 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among information being considered at Justice is a "white paper" from a 
Silicon Valley law firm, submitted last week at the agency's request. The 
paper, prepared by an antitrust specialist at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & 
Rosati in Palo Alto, uses an economic theory known as "increasing returns" to 
argue that Microsoft's vast clout in the software world, combined with a 
strategic purchase of Intuit, would enable the company to seize an unhealthy 
amount of control of the networks that Americans will eventually be using to 
make purchases and do their banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intuit controls most of this market," said Gary Reback, the antitrust 
attorney. "Microsoft is the only potential competitor. . . . (This deal) lets 
Microsoft seize another gateway that would otherwise take them five or six 
years to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Reback and his firm have represented most of Microsoft's competitors, 
including Novell, Borland International, Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems. 
He said the cost of preparing the white paper -- more than $150,000 -- was 
billed to clients that had informally voiced fears about the Microsoft-Intuit 
combination and that wanted the Justice Department to understand the issues. 
Some executives of rival firms, he added, were wary of fully laying out their 
problems with the deal because of worries over possible retaliation by 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 Intuit, based in Menlo Park, makes the hugely popular Quicken program and 
controls an estimated 70% of the market for personal finance software. 
Microsoft, with headquarters in Redmond, Wash., is the dominant player in 
computer operating system software and is rapidly gaining market share in many 
other pieces of the software industry. It agreed in October to buy Intuit for 
what was considered an extraordinarily high price. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hope of preempting any antitrust concerns, Microsoft agreed to sell its 
own personal finance product, Microsoft Money, to Novell. But competitors say 
the real antitrust issue relates not to personal finance software itself, but 
to how Microsoft might use such products to gain advantage in emerging areas 
such as electronic commerce and on-line services. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the company announced Microsoft Network, an on-line service that 
will be available to users of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 95 operating system, 
due next year. By being part of Windows, the Microsoft Network could gain a 
major -- and perhaps unfair -- advantage over rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration has been perceived as being far tougher on 
mergers than the administrations of George Bush and Ronald Reagan, the Justice 
Department took heat earlier this year for its settlement of a long-running 
investigation into Microsoft's marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry observers said Justice might be focusing more closely on the 
Intuit deal to assuage concerns that it was being soft on Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that Justice is starting to figure out that Microsoft, not 
necessarily by crook but certainly by hook, is gaining a lot of clout," said 
Mark Macgillivray, a Silicon Valley consultant. It is unusual for the Justice 
Department to issue a second request for information in a review of a merger 
case. Last year, it did so in only about 5% of the 2,300 proposed mergers that 
were large enough to warrant being reported to government authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Microsoft played down the importance of the request. "We remain 
confident that the merger will be approved after careful review," spokesman 
Greg Shaw said.

EQUITIES DESERTED FOR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, BONDS; MARKETS: CHEMICAL, DRUG 
AND COMPUTER ISSUES TAKE THE BIGGEST HITS. DOW DROPS SHARPLY IN LAST HOUR OF 
TRADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer, chemical and drug issues -- among those most sensitive to a slowing 
economy -- took the greatest hits on Tuesday as investors deserted equities in 
favor of bonds and other fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market had its biggest one-day rally in more than three months as 
investors pushed the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond to 8.01% 
from 8.12% on Monday. Its price, which rises when yields fall, soared 1 7/32 
points, or $12.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average skidded 36 points on sell programs at the 
open, then trimmed its losses to less that 20 points for most of the day. A 
powerful surge of sell programs sent the Dow sharply lower in the last hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close, the blue-chip indicator had plunged 91.52 points to 3,677.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically sensitive stocks, those of large manufacturing and retail 
companies, took the brunt of the selling. "There's a sense that earnings of 
these companies have reached a peak, and people are selling the stocks as a 
result," analyst Hildegard Zagorski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers cut a wide swath through the market, with declining issues swamping 
advancers by nearly 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also fell sharply. The NYSE's composite index fell 4.26 
points to 246.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 8.21 points to 
450.08. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller issues dropped 16.53 points to 741.21 
and the American Stock Exchange's market value index dropped 5.14 points to 
436.14. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was a heavy 383.26 million shares, up from 250.58 million on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 30 Dow components, 17 stocks lost a point or more. The biggest 
losers were Caterpillar, dipping 3 1/4 to 51 5/8; IBM, falling 3 1/8 to 69 3/4; 
International Paper, off 2 7/8 at 68 1/8; Alcoa, slipping 2 5/8 to 80 5/8, and 
Sears, declining 2 1/4 to 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, which had been good performers and market leaders in 
recent sessions, fell sharply after Motorola sold new stock at a discount to 
prevailing market rates. Motorola was the most actively traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange and fell 2 to 57. The company sold 8 million shares at $58.50 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq fell 2 to 38 and Micron Technology was off 1 3/4 at 38 7/8. Intel 
retreated 1 3/8 to 64 3/4 and Cisco Systems declined 2 5/16 to 30 5/8. Novell 
fell 1 3/8 to 18 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney Co. gained 5/8 to 43 after reporting strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaylord Entertainment rose 1 to 23 1/4. The country-entertainment company 
denied a USA Today report that it is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brinker International sank 3 3/4 to 17 7/8 after saying its earnings for its 
second quarter would fall below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restaurant chains were also off, including Outback Steakhouse Inc., which 
was downgraded by Morgan Stanley and tumbled 3 1/4 to 24 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * H&R Block sank 6 7/8 to 33 1/2. Block said its financial unit will report 
lower earnings or a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tektronix dropped 1 1/2 to 35 1/2. It said late Monday that Delbert Yocam 
resigned as the company's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar finished lower against most leading 
currencies Tuesday, hurt by comments from Germany's top central banker and a 
late plunge in Wall Street stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to journalists in Europe, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said he 
favored a strong German mark. In addition, he said there was no pressure on the 
central bank to alter its monetary policy.

JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: MORE THAN AN IMAGE THING; JAPANESE 
INVESTMENT IS BROAD -- AND MOSTLY HERE TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The question at a business breakfast in Los Angeles was plaintive and 
influenced by Sony's massive write-down of movie investments. "With no more 
Japanese investment in our area, how seriously will the local economy be hurt?" 
asked an investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that the question is mistaken; it misses a forest of investment 
for a few high-profile trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investment in Southern California is vast and permanent, with 615 
companies employing 78,000 people. Total dollar figures for Southern California 
are hard to come by, oddly enough, although the value of Japanese industrial 
investment statewide is estimated at more than $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And new U.S. investment on the part of Japanese companies, including real 
estate transactions, rose to $14.7 billion last year from $13.8 billion the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the variety of Japanese companies ranges 
from Mitsubishi making big screen televisions in Santa Ana to Nippondenso 
making auto parts in Long Beach to Union Bank making loans throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sony is not going away either, despite its initial debacle in the film 
business. As part of its $100-million investment in movie lots in Culver City, 
the company has built laboratories for digital sound, high-definition video and 
motion-picture special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if we looked at how and why companies from Japan do business here, 
rather than worrying that their investments will dry up and blow away, we would 
get a better idea of Southern California's real strengths and economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The region welcomes people from many lands and has a great port. Takashi 
Kiuchi, chairman of Mitsubishi Electric America, which is headquartered in 
Cypress, commands U.S. manufacturing activities stretching from nearby Santa 
Ana to Sunnyvale, in Northern California, to Atlanta. Mitsubishi Electric set 
up U.S. operations here in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pick a site first because of proximity to the home office in Japan and 
because of the Port (of Los Angeles-Long Beach)," says Kiuchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's major automobile makers have their U.S. headquarters here -- Toyota, 
Nissan and Honda in Torrance, Mazda in Irvine and Suzuki in Brea -- even though 
their U.S. factories are east of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the region had a large Japanese American population made it 
easier 25 years ago, when many companies opened U.S. operations, to bring 
employees and their families from Japan. That factor is less important now that 
much of the United States has become cosmopolitan, but other forces -- 
including politics and regulation -- are pushing business this way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government policies that say auto parts must be made in the United States, 
plus the high yen, weak dollar -- which stem also from political decisions -- 
mean we will be increasing production here," says Kazunori Amano, president of 
Nippondenso of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nippondenso, the world's largest auto parts maker, came to Long Beach in 1971. 
Amano, an engineer by training, came earlier to New Jersey to study catalytic 
converters because Congress had passed the first law mandating reduced auto 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company has major operations in Tennessee and Michigan, while Long 
Beach does $470 million in annual sales supplying parts dealers nationwide with 
spark plugs, auto air conditioners and alternators and fuel pumps for trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The many ways in which California encourages innovation attract investment. 
"To keep up with technology in the audiovisual fields, you have to be here," 
says Jack Osborn, who heads Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics, the division of 
Kiuchi's company that produces big-screen televisions, among other products. 
"This is where new developments in multimedia will be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi, like all other Japanese companies, gets overtures to move from 
other states and regions. But it is keeping the big-screen plant in Santa Ana, 
even though Southern California at the moment is a less affluent market than it 
used to be. The work force of about 450 is good and productive, Osborn 
explains, and though Mexican wages are far lower than the $15 an hour with 
benefits paid in Santa Ana, productivity is far less also. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies complain of the same disadvantages as other Southern 
California firms: crime, taxes, regulations and high costs. And in recent 
years, they have faced an additional difficulty with the collapse of Japan's 
bubble economy. Head offices in Japan pulled in purse strings, instructed U.S. 
divisions that profit was the No. 1 priority. And some of them closed up shop. 
Membership in the Japan Business Assn. has dropped to 615 from 700, but Amano 
feels the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, these companies are part of the landscape, involved in local causes 
and charities, and most of them successful -- unlike Sony in the movies. The 
consensus among Japanese executives is that Sony was taken advantage of by 
"unprincipled people" -- a reference to its free-spending U.S. managers whom 
Tokyo headquarters couldn't or didn't have the wit to manage properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sony's troubles won't affect a trend among Japanese companies of trying to 
give U.S. managers real authority now. It's no secret that American managers 
have been largely figureheads at Japanese companies, Japanese executives admit. 
"But now it's time to change. We have to give U.S. managers more authority if 
we're to make good profits in this demanding market," says Kiuchi of 
Mitsubishi, who came here as a student in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, Japanese companies in Southern California -- like U.S. 
companies in Europe decades ago -- are becoming less travelers in a strange 
land than local businesses in a global economy. And, importantly for us, 
they're choosing this region as home. The Job Count For all the noise about 
investment in movie studios and fancy hotels, the big Japanese employers in 
Souther California are in everyday banking and industry. Japanese firms with

 Medical Inflation Slows: Medical inflation last year was the lowest in seven 
years and among the lowest in more than three decades. Federal health officials 
reported Tuesday that Americans spent an average of $3,299 apiece on health 
care in 1993, or $205 more than for the previous year.The total bill came to 
$884 billion, or 7.8% more than in 1992. That was the slowest rate of increase 
since 1986 and the third lowest since 1960, according to the Health Care 
Financing Administration. Health care's share of the gross domestic product 
rose to 13.9% from 13.6% in 1992. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. 
Shalala noted that health expenditures still rose 2.4 percentage points faster 
than the overall economy in 1993 as measured by the GDP.

 Gaylord Entertainment Says It's Not for Sale: USA Today reported that the 
entertainment company -- which owns the Nashville Network, Country Music 
Television, the "Grand Ole Opry" and other properties -- is on the block and 
could fetch as much as $3 billion. But Gaylord Entertainment Co. said that it 
is not for sale, despite reports that Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting, 
Tele-Communications Inc. and Tribune Co. had expressed interest in buying it. 
"The company has from time to time in the past engaged in preliminary 
discussions about potential transactions involving the company as a whole, but 
the company is not for sale and is not engaged in any discussions with any 
party regarding its sale," Gaylord said in a statement.

 Patent Challenge Rebuffed by Appellate Court: Without comment, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a San Francisco federal judge's 
ruling that NTN Communications of Carlsbad cannot challenge Interactive Network 
Inc.'s patent on an interactive TV game system. Backed by Tele-Communications 
Inc., NBC and other major media firms, Interactive Network markets a system 
that lets viewers play along at home with sports events and game shows.NTN 
alleged that the San Jose firm stole the idea from it, but the decision upheld 
last week ruled that a previous out-of-court settlement barred NTN from raising 
the claim in court. Interactive Network's stock closed at $3 on the Nasdaq 
market, down 18.75 cents; it traded at $12.25 a year ago.

 Complaint Against U-Haul Ads Referred to FTC: In an unusual move, the National 
Advertising Review Board, the advertising industry's self-regulatory agency, 
referred to the Federal Trade Commission a complaint against the company's 
advertised "guaranteed reservations" claims. The board said it made the 
referral after U-Haul International Inc. failed to indicate that it would 
comply with the board's recommendation to quit using the potentially misleading 
claim in its Yellow Pages ads. Phoenix-based U-Haul, the nation's biggest 
consumer truck-rental firm, denied that the ads are misleading.

 Group Urges FTC Crackdown on 'Misleading' Food Ads: A day after the government 
barred Haagen-Dazs from making low-fat claims about its rich frozen yogurt, a 
consumer organization urged a similar crackdown on other foods.Washington, 
D.C.-based Center for Science in the Public Interest said advertisers routinely 
make misleading claims that foods are more healthful than the data on their 
labels say. Label information is closely regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The Federal Trade Commission has said advertising must adhere 
to many of the same standards as food labels. But CSPI, in a report to be 
delivered to the FTC today, said the agency is not enforcing that policy.

 PUC Fines Railroad for Dunsmuir, Seacliff Spills: Southern Pacific must pay 
$492,000 for violations of the state's hazardous material reporting rules.The 
California Public Utilities Commission also set new train make-up and safety 
regulations for Cantara Curve near Dunsmuir, where the 1991 derailment 
occurred. In that accident, 14,000 gallons of herbicide went into the 
Sacramento River, killing all plant and animal life for 45 miles downstream. 
Also in 1991, the railroad spilled toxic aqueous hydrazine underneath a U.S. 
101 overpass at Seacliff, closing the highway for five days, in part because 
the train crew had no records as to how much hazardous material was in the car.

 Shell Chemical Agrees to Pay Penalties Related to Explosion: The division of 
Shell Oil Co., the U.S. arm of Royal/Dutch Shell Group, agreed to pay $3.02 
million in penalties to settle charges related to a fatal explosion at an Ohio 
plant, the Labor Department said. Shell Chemical Co. also agreed to make 
significant improvements at its Belpre, Ohio, facility, where an explosion 
killed three workers on May 27, said the department's Occupational Safety & 
Health Administration unit.OSHA said it would issue citations against Shell and 
that the company has agreed not to contest them. "We are very pleased that 
Shell has agreed to resolve this matter as quickly as possible in order to 
ensure maximum protection for its employees," Labor Secretary Robert Reich 
said. Shell said it disputed many of the allegations but that it decided to 
settle the charges to avoid a costly and prolonged legal battle.

 Japanese Car Makers Report Mixed Results for October: Toyota Motor Corp. said 
its domestic vehicle production rose from a year earlier to 311,141 in October, 
marking the third monthly year-on-year gain. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. said 
domestic production fell from a year earlier to 131,737 vehicles, marking the 
28th straight year-on-year decline.Overall domestic vehicle sales in the first 
18 days of November rose 16% from a year earlier, with Toyota up 12.4%, Nissan 
up 14.3%, Honda up 1.6% and Fuji Heavy up 32.2%, industry sources said. 
Toyota's vehicle exports in October rose 23% year-on-year to 132,425, the fifth 
successive annual increase. The rise was attributed to poor exports to Europe 
last year, after the ceiling on Japan's 1993 exports to the European Community 
was lowered to 980,000. Nissan's October exports fell 6.1% year-on-year to 
50,518 vehicles, the third straight year-on-year decline, caused by a poor 
demand in Europe.

 Worldwide Recall of Drug Begins: Baxter International Inc., the hospital 
supply company, began the recall after an autopsy showed a blood donor had a 
rare fatal disease. Only the lots of the blood product albumin that might have 
involved that donor have been withdrawn, Baxter spokeswoman Jill Carter 
said.The drug, sold under the name Buminate 25% Albumen, is used after surgery 
or for patients who have lost a substantial amount of blood and are suffering 
from shock, Carter said. The autopsy of a male donor who died recently showed 
he had Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, caused by a virus that attacks the central 
nervous system and leads to dementia, wasting of muscles and eventual death. 
"There is no blood test for this disease, and we couldn't have known about it 
beforehand," Carter said.

SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY TO LEAVE NASDAQ FOR NYSE; STOCKS: COMPANY SAYS ITS DEPARTURE 
IS 'TOTALLY COINCIDENTAL' WITH RECENT TRADING CONTROVERSIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seagate Technology Inc., a leading maker of computer disk drives, said Tuesday 
it intends to leave the Nasdaq stock market and have its shares listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagate's departure from Nasdaq comes as the nation's second-largest stock 
market is facing intense scrutiny by the government over dealer trading 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Shugart, Seagate's chairman and chief executive, said the company's move 
to the NYSE was "totally coincidental" with the recent Nasdaq trading 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image the New York Stock Exchange presents, we thought, was important for 
us," Shugart said. The international visibility of the world's largest stock 
market figured prominently in the decision, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagate, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., reported record results for fiscal 
year 1994, with revenue of $3.5 billion and net income of $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Seagate has applied to list its common stock and its 6.75% 
convertible bonds on the NYSE, but there's little doubt the New York Stock 
Exchange will approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagate was Nasdaq's 17th-largest company in terms of trading volume last 
year, and the largest company to jump to the NYSE, said NYSE spokesman Ray 
Pellecchia. Seagate is scheduled to begin trading on the NYSE on Dec. 12 under 
the ticket symbol SEG, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE, Nasdaq and the No. 3 exchange, the American Stock Exchange, vie for 
the rights to list shares of major companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amex took out a full page advertisement in The New York Times on Tuesday 
touting the 301 companies that switched from Nasdaq to the AMEX since January, 
1987. The ad touted "narrower spreads" or a smaller gap between the best asking 
and best bidding sales prices for stock. Critics contend spreads on Nasdaq 
stocks are excessively wide, a charge the market disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 companies have jumped from Nasdaq to the NYSE this year, in line with 
last year's trend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq, by contrast, has picked up 10 companies from the AMEX this year and 13 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There's very little traffic from the NYSE to Nasdaq. That's partly due to NYSE 
Rule 500, which requires that 66.6% of a company's voting shares approve and no 
more than 10% of its shareholders object to moving off the Big Board. 
</P>

 Such a stringent delisting requirement led market analyst Junius W. Peake of 
the University of Northern Colorado to describe Rule 500 as the "roach motel" 
rule, after the popular insect trap. Companies can check in, but they don't 
check out, Peake said.

PAINEWEBBER IS TARGET OF SEC INQUIRY; INVESTIGATION: REGULATORS ARE LOOKING AT 
THE SALES OF CERTAIN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE FIRM SAYS THE 'VAST MAJORITY' 
WERE 'SOLD APPROPRIATELY.'

<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating PaineWebber Group Inc. 
as part of a broad review of Wall Street's limited partnerships sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is trying to determine whether PaineWebber misrepresented risks and 
rewards when it sold about $2 billion of partnerships that invested in assets 
such as real estate and energy projects, people familiar with the review said. 
Individuals lost money in such investments as property and energy prices 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber, the nation's fourth-largest securities firm, said Tuesday that it 
is "cooperating with an SEC inquiry into the sale of certain limited 
partnership investments." The firm said the "vast majority" of the partnerships 
were "sold appropriately and professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber also said it has "promptly and fairly resolved clients' claims and 
will continue to do so" when it finds sales that used inappropriate marketing 
materials or offerings to investors for whom the securities were unsuitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is reviewing the sales practices of a number of securities firms, 
including Merrill Lynch & Co., that were active in selling limited 
partnerships, according to people familiar with the review. The investigation 
of PaineWebber is more specific, according to people close to the situation, 
who refused to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC declined to comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber, the nation's fourth-largest securities firm, was among the 
biggest marketers of partnerships. It sold $2 billion of real estate, energy 
and airplane-leasing limited partnerships between 1980 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, investors bought units in Pegasus Aircraft Partners 1 in late 
1988 and early 1989 for $1,000 each. The minimum purchase, in most cases, was 
five units. They could sell their units for about 5 cents on the dollar today, 
according Robert A. Stanger & Co., a consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber stock fell $1.25 Tuesday, or almost 9%, to $13. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation comes after Prudential Securities Inc. reached an agreement 
last month with the Justice Department in which the firm admitted to criminal 
wrongdoing in its sales of $8 billion in limited partnership interests. The 
Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit is on three years probation and had to 
double the size of a fund to repay investors as much as $660 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prudential case led the SEC to look at partnership sales by other firms, 
the people familiar with the review said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales practices across Wall Street are "remarkably similar," said Thomas 
Grady, a Naples, Fla., attorney who represents investors.

AVERAGE NEW CAR COST RISES TO NEARLY $23,600; AUTOMOBILES: HIGHER INTEREST 
RATES, FEWER REBATES AND INCREASED SAFETY FEATURES ARE CITED. 
</P>

<P>
 New car buyers beware. It's harder to buy a new car than at any time in 15 
years, based on a study released this week that considers factors like family 
income and interest rates along with retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
 And costs are expected to go even higher in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by higher interest rates, increased cost for safety features and fewer 
rebate deals, the average new car costs nearly $23,600 to buy and finance in 
the third quarter. That's up almost $1,650 from a year ago, according to a 
study released Monday by Comerica Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, low-cost financing and rising incomes have helped consumers 
afford those shiny new vehicles stuffed with air bags and cleaner exhausts. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Federal Reserve Board boosting interest rates, analysts expect 
car purchasing costs to rise further as car companies boost finance rates to 
reflect the higher cost of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the Fed doesn't do anything more with interest rates, auto loans 
might go up another half a point or so, maybe even a full point," said Michael 
Luckey, with the Luckey Consulting Group in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "The auto companies have been intentionally holding them down, particularly 
GMAC (a GM auto financing subsidiary) and Ford Motor Credit, in an effort to 
keep business going. But at some point, the rates will continue to go higher." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, every one percentage point rise in the typical auto loan 
translates into an additional $7 increase in the monthly car payment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Comerica's auto affordability study, the average car loan rate 
rose to 9.35% in the third quarter of 1994, up from 8.85% in the second 
quarter, and 8.78% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Comerica's Chief Economist David Littmann said the rise in interest rates, 
coupled with increased costs for new safety features, has pushed the average 
number of weeks a family must work to buy a new car to 37.1 weeks of take-home 
pay from 35.4 weeks a year ago and just under 30 weeks in the third quarter of 
1986.

YOUR MONEY ; THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ON THE FLY: AIRLINES VYING FOR 11 MILLION 
FARES; TRAVEL: CARRIERS OFFER CHEAP TRIPS AND CHARITY TIE-INS. PLANES ARE 
EXPECTED TO RUN 80% FULL SUNDAY.

 Airlines are offering specials and donations to the homeless in competing for 
the 11 million passengers expected to fly during this year's Thanksgiving 
travel crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 30.4 million Americans will go more than 100 miles from home by plane, 
train or other transport, the American Automobile Assn. estimated. That would 
be 3% more than took trips during last year's Thanksgiving holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong economy and generally lower air fares are enticing more Americans 
to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent with what we've seen all year long," said James Cammisa, 
editor of Travel Industry Indicators. "Consumer fundamentals are very positive, 
prices are attractive, air fares are actually below a year ago and hotel 
increases are behind the inflation rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines have limited fleet expansion in recent years to reduce the number of 
empty seats on planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Transport Assn. says about 80% of the available seats will be filled 
on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, when traffic will peak at 1.65 million 
passengers. So far this year, flights have been 67% full on average. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract passengers to off-peak times or routes, airlines are using gimmicks 
and promotions. They need to fill seats on routes favored by business travelers 
and on Thursday and Friday flights. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines is selling some Los Angeles-to-San Francisco tickets at $9.97 
one way, and donating the proceeds to charities for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 On flights between Washington, New York and Boston, Delta Air Lines is 
offering $50 discounts to passengers who bring non-perishable food items for 
donation to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines is offering $25 one-way fares on trips taken between 4 p.m. 
Thanksgiving Day and midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines hopes to boost travel on Friday, traditionally the first 
day of Christmas shopping. The airline is offering fares of $59 to $159 for 
daytime round trips between 50 cities and the Mall of America, a major shopping 
center near Northwest's main airport in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based industry group Air Transport Assn. estimates that 
airlines will carry 11.13 million people between Nov. 20 and the Monday after 
Thanksgiving, or 2.9% more than in the comparable period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore-Washington International Airport has added 1,400 parking spaces 
since Southwest and other airlines started offering cheap flights from there. 
Traffic has increased 40% and the 14,000-space parking area has been 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak is adding 60 trains on the Northeast Corridor to accommodate 250,000 
passengers during Thanksgiving weekend. The railroad plans to use all its 
equipment and borrow cars from commuter lines to meet the demand.

A MATTER OF DEGREE: WENDY'S TRIES TO COOL ITS HOT CHOCOLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just in time for winter: Wendy's says it will spend the next month looking for 
a way to cool its hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Lynch, a spokesman for the fast-food chain, said Tuesday that the 
company hopes to resume sales in a month or so, after it finds a way to brew 
and serve the drink at a lower temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy's International, which says it sells only about two cups per day per 
store, serves hot chocolate at 180 degrees, the same temperature it serves 
coffee and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know that it's too hot," Lynch said, "but at 180 degrees brewing 
temperature, it would be too hot if it was spilled." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company became concerned about the hot chocolate because children 
are more likely to drink it than other hot beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes after a ruling in a lawsuit that accused a McDonald's 
restaurant of serving its coffee too hot. A woman who was scalded by the coffee 
was awarded $480,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said Wendy's has been sued over coffee in the past but that no similar 
lawsuits are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in suburban Columbus, has started to notify its 4,000 U.S. 
restaurants to temporarily stop hot chocolate sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy's has about 4,300 restaurants worldwide.

YOUR MONEY ; PROP. 103 ROLLBACK ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi Tuesday ordered 28 insurance companies 
to pay rebates and interest totaling $1.25 billion to policyholders under 
Proposition 103. It was the second such order Garamendi has issued under the 
1988 insurance rate rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, in October, 1991, involved 14 companies and totaled $1.57 billion. 
Four of those 14, including market leader State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance Co. and earthquake-battered 20th Century Insurance Co., have yet to 
pay rebates. The other 10 settled with Garamendi and  
</P>
<P>
 paid rebates ranging from 23% to 89% of the amounts originally ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is doubtful whether many of the companies involved in Tuesday's order will 
settle their cases before Garamendi is replaced on Jan. 2 by his successor, 
Charles W. Quackenbush. A Garamendi spokeswoman said Tuesday that several 
companies, including Farmers Insurance Group and United Services Auto Assn., 
are currently in settlement talks.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; LUCASARTS CHIEF POINTS 
TO FLAWS IN HOLLYWOOD-SILICON LOVE AFFAIR; Q&A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINA SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a lot of talk these days about the so-called convergence of Silicon 
Valley and Hollywood, but the topic is old hat for San Rafael-based LucasArts 
Entertainment Co., one of three George Lucas-owned and operated entertainment 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other two -- Lucasfilm Ltd. and Lucas Digital Ltd., which is the 
parent of Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound -- LucasArts is 
dedicated solely to creating digital interactive entertainment. Its Rebel 
Assault, which capitalizes on Lucas' Star Wars property, has been widely hailed 
as the best-selling CD-ROM game ever. Other hits have included X-Wing, a Star 
Wars Space Simulator that was the top-selling PC game of 1993, TIE Fighter, its 
sequel and a graphical adventure called Day of the Tentacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that every major film studio and software maker is eyeing the market, 
LucasArts has finally hired its first chief executive officer, Randy Komisar. A 
Harvard Law-trained attorney, his experience includes stints as senior legal 
counsel at Apple Computer Inc., founder and vice president of Apple software 
spinoff Claris Corp., and chief financial officer of Silicon Valley's Go Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In his role as president and CEO at LucasArts, Komisar's charge is to continue 
the firm's rapid growth into the next century. We asked him his views on 
collaborations between Hollywood and Silicon Valley and the state of the game 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q As one of the first, if not the first, companies to combine Hollywood and 
Silicon Valley people and products, what do you think is going wrong with this 
whole convergence phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Well, Silicon Valley's culture and perspective is distinctly different than 
that of Hollywood. Hollywood has taken a perspective of new media as a 
derivative or ancillary set of products for their movie properties, much like 
T-shirts or theme parks. On the other hand, Silicon Valley has focused more on 
the gee-whiz aspects of the technology, and it doesn't have a firm grasp of the 
content the broad audience wants. So there's a mismatch of perspectives and a 
mismatch of vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest mistake Hollywood is making is not treating this new medium as a 
distinct and different medium. To treat it as a derivative product shows a lack 
of understanding of the power of interactivity as a new tool. * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Everyone talks about how the Hollywood filmmaking business compares to the 
multimedia business. Does it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Not really. Interactive entertainment is always compared to Hollywood, 
because of all the audio and video. But if you take a look at the real, core 
businesses, Hollywood makes its money from two very special circumstances of 
the movie business: one is the very, very high production costs, in excess of 
$30 million per film on average, and the other is the constrained distribution 
of movie theaters, a very limited channel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hollywood makes money on high interest from the capital and high 
distribution fees. That's why six out of 10 movies allegedly lose money. But 
take a look at industries like the music business, where production cost is 
more like games, something like a half a million or a million and a half. And 
if you take a look at the channels of distribution, which allow several 
thousand products a year to reach the shelves, you see that business is much 
more similar to the game business.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q OK, but certainly Hollywood could have a place in it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Certainly. Hollywood really understands how to tell a story, how to engage 
an audience, how to goose the production values that games are now becoming 
capable of doing. They have a lot to offer in terms of that experience and that 
knowledge. But they need to adapt it to the interactive medium that is 
available to them. I think there will be quite a lot of money lost. There are a 
lot of companies flailing around in this industry. Q Do game players really 
want actors and movie production values anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A If you take a look at the best-selling 50 products of 1993, you'll see that 
only four of those products were based on movie properties. They were all Star 
Wars products, and they were all from us. Take a look at the first half of 
1994, of the top 20 products only two were based on movie products. And they 
were both from us. We basically, in Rebel Assault, used actors to set the tone 
and provide the payoff. We didn't bore them with linear video, which is the 
temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, many game designers are just frustrated film buffs. And I think the 
Hollywood people have yet to understand what makes a great game. So you end up 
with an overemphasis in linear video. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What's the biggest problem facing the multimedia entertainment industry 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A One of the biggest issues is bringing in great talent, and making sure we 
have a steady supply of people who understand the medium and have a vision for 
how it can be used for entertaining and informing people. That's going to take 
some time, to really get to a point when we've got people of that inherent 
understanding and vision.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SCREEN SAVERS: STILL 
FUN, BUT NO LONGER ESSENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing fuzzy about today's high-resolution computer monitors is the 
thinking of the people who sit in front of them. For instance, many users still 
believe those clever screen savers, with their free-floating images of flying 
toasters or humpback whales, are somehow saving endangered screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Error message: Most likely, they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that screen savers, one of the hottest software niches of the last year or 
two, don't deliver on their promise. They do exactly what they claim to do, 
most of them in a delightful way. It's just that, as with practically 
everything in personal computing nowadays, the screen saver's raison d'etre is 
being overtaken by technological advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest benefit that screen savers provide is that they are fun to look 
at," said Jim Schwabe, vice president of the graphics business unit at NEC 
Technologies Inc., a major player in computer hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Screen savers were designed to prevent permanent phosphor damage that could 
occur when an unchanging image accumulated too many on-screen hours. They did 
so by replacing stagnant images with dynamic intermissions. So when people left 
their computers on around the clock (said to be better for delicate circuits 
than turning them off and on often), the screen saver would kick in -- with 
stars, toasters or tropical fish -- to protect the screen from an electronic 
tattooing. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem could leave a ghostlike image, such as is standard on automated 
teller machines at banks. But, according to many computer experts, the risk of 
phosphor burn in home PCs and most office computers is now small -- especially 
with newer monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, when DOS ruled the PC world, its monochrome text displayed on a 
black background boosted the risk of screen burn. The emergence of color 
monitors as the industry standard made burn-in less likely to occur, since the 
color images disperse light over a larger phosphor area. Now, dynamic Windows 
and Apple Desktop interfaces use black text on white background, so most of the 
screen is lit and a single image is rarely displayed for long.

INNOVATION; GIFTS TO GIVE THE CYBER-BOUND ON YOUR LIST

 I've figured out the ideal present to give Santa this year: a database 
management program for "making a list and checking it twice." But Santa is 
unique. Everyone else on my Christmas and Hanukkah lists is getting products 
that are fun and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of choice. The elves of the computer industry have been 
exceptionally busy over the past year, equipping lots of new machines with 
CD-ROM drives and modems and developing thousands of new home entertainment and 
"edu-tainment" programs for adults and kids. There are two new home computing 
magazines and more new computer books than Santa can fit on his sleigh. The PC 
has finally arrived as a mass-market consumer product, and that generally makes 
computer gift buying a whole lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you still have to be careful. Most importantly, be sure that your gift 
is compatible with the recipient's computer. Most people will have IBM 
compatible or Macintosh systems, but if you're buying software, make sure they 
have enough memory and disk storage to handle the program. Compact discs 
(CD-ROMs) are extremely popular this year, but not everyone has a CD-ROM drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying someone a new computer is, of course, very generous, but be sure you 
know what the person really wants. Giving an IBM compatible PC to a Mac lover, 
or vice versa, could be like coal in their stocking. If it's someone's first 
computer, consider an all-in-one system like the Compaq Presario CDS520, or the 
Apple Macintosh Performa 570. These systems have built-in CD-ROM drives and 
speakers as well a modem and starter software. For those who like to mix soap 
operas with their spreadsheets, both companies also make models with TV tuners. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're buying hardware or software, try to find a store that takes 
returns. Many software dealers refuse to give back your money for software 
programs that have been opened -- an unfortunate policy considering the number 
of programs that fail to deliver what they promise or just don't work at all. 
If you buy from a company that won't accept returns, caution the recipient to 
check for compatibility before opening the package. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for low-cost stocking stuffers, both computer and office 
supply stores carry diskette holders, mouse pads, wrist rests, copy stands, or 
colored diskettes. You might also consider the current copy and a subscription 
to one of the ever-more-numerous computer magazines. I like both of the new 
family-oriented PC magazines, Home PC and Family PC, while NetGuide is good for 
on-line enthusiasts. For the propeller heads on your list, consider Windows, PC 
Computing or MacUser; those interested in the culture of computerdom might 
enjoy Wired or Computer Life. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs little or nothing to get someone a trial subscription to an on-line 
service, but after a month the person will either have to start paying about 
$10 a month or call to cancel. All of the services can be used to check news, 
weather, sports, stock quotes, movie reviews, encyclopedias, airline schedules 
and just about anything else. For free or low-cost starter kits, call Prodigy 
((800) Prodigy), CompuServe ((800) 621-1258), America Online ((800) 227-6364), 
EWorld (Macintosh only (800) 775-4556) or GEnie ((800) 638-9636). Make sure the 
person has a modem. If not, consider an external 14,400 bps modem such as the 
Practical Peripherals 14400FXTM or the U.S. Robotics Sportser. 
</P>

 Many of today's best family and child-oriented programs are coming on CD-ROM. 
If you're shopping for a CD-ROM drive, make sure it's at least double-speed. 
All Macs have built-in sound, but PC users should look for a bundle like 
Creative Lab's ((800) 998-5227) Discovery 16 CD (about $300) that includes a CD 
drive, a sound card, speakers and several programs -- including the Grolier 
Multimedia Encyclopedia. Creative's Digital School House has the same hardware, 
but the programs are hand-picked for families with elementary school-aged 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want your kids to have fun sending and receiving electronic mail, 
consider KidMail from ConnectSoft. This Windows software package lets users of 
Prodigy, CompuServe or MCI Mail send electronic mail and greeting cards. Each 
family member gets to choose a personal "environment" such as "Outer Space," 
"Secret Agent" or "Dino Communication Center." Before giving this gift, make 
sure the recipient has a modem and one of the on-line services, and between 
eight and 16 megabytes of free disk space. Parents can control kids' usage by 
issuing "stamps" required to send mail. It's available on CD-ROM ($29.95) and 
floppy disk ($34.95). 
</P>
<P>
 My kids and I love Aviation Adventure ($40 to $50), a new Windows CD from 
Knowledge Adventure ((800) 542-4240). It has an aviation reference library, an 
aviation lab that lets kids examine the internal structure of planes, and a 
resource center that includes information about museums. There are flight 
movies, a paper airplane factory, a "crash and burn theater" and a great 
aviation trivia game. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of airplanes, Real World Math: Adventures in Flight ($39.95 CD-ROM 
Mac and Windows) from Sanctuary Woods ((415) 286-6110) teaches children about 
aviation while enhancing their math skills. You earn the ability to print out 
paper airplanes by solving real world math problems related to aviation. My 
kids learned a great deal about interpreting graphs while having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have any news nuts in your life, consider "CNN Time Capsule: 100 
Defining Moments of 1994" ($29.95) available from Broderbund ((800) 521-6263). 
This CD, which runs on Windows and Macintosh, chronicles the six months of 
1994. A final 1994 edition will be available in late January for an additional 
$4.95 shipping and handling. In addition to the footage from CNN, the disc 
includes written news reports from USA Today and U.S. News and World Report and 
also selected editorial cartoons from newspapers.

SANTA FE SHAREHOLDERS URGED TO REJECT UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Fe Pacific Corp. advised shareholders Tuesday not to tender their stock 
to unwanted suitor Union Pacific Corp., saying its $3.3-billion bid was too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe, which also is being wooed by Burlington Northern Inc., cited a Union 
Pacific statement that it might boost its bid to $20 a share from $17.50 if it 
is allowed to examine Santa Fe's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific spokesman Gary Schuster said his company is willing to discuss a 
higher bid but has not been invited to meet with Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Inc.'s competing bid for Santa Fe is currently worth $3 
billion, or about $16.07 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail industry analyst Scott Flower of Kidder Peabody Inc. said Santa Fe was 
trying to block a hostile takeover by Union Pacific. But he said Union Pacific 
probably will prevail unless Burlington Northern Inc. sweetens its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're hoping shareholders will say no," Flower said. "But in the absence of 
a better offer, it looks like shareholders will tender to Union Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe and Burlington Northern shareholders are scheduled to vote Dec. 2 on 
their companies' merger proposal, which would be accomplished by exchanging 
0.34 of a Burlington share for each share of Santa Fe stock. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 11, Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad, proposed to buy 57% 
of Santa Fe's stock from shareholders at $17.50 a share, then negotiate an 
agreement to acquire the rest of the shares for a combination of cash and 
stock, also worth $17.50. The tender offer expires Dec. 8, but can be extended, 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is control of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, the nation's 
seventh-largest railroad in terms of revenue, with routes from Chicago to 
Southern California. The Santa Fe route is more direct than Union Pacific's. 
Burlington, based in Fort Worth, Tex., has no such route. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe's stock fell 25 cents Tuesday to $16 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe is based in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg. Union Pacific is based 
in Bethlehem, Pa.

3RD-LARGEST CABLE OPERATOR BUYS NO. 15; TELEVISION: CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION 
WILL ACQUIRE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL SYSTEM IN A $1.4-BILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continental Cablevision Systems, the country's third-largest cable operator, 
has agreed to acquire Providence Journal Co.'s cable systems, the 15th-largest, 
in a transaction worth $1.4 billion, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental is paying for the systems with its Class A common stock and is 
assuming $755 million of debt for a total cost of $1.4 billion. Now privately 
held, Continental expects to go public as the result of the Providence 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of Continental and Providence Journal's cable systems will create a 
combined system of 4 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price they are paying is in line with current valuation of cable assets, 
which seems to be near $2,000 a subscriber," said Jackie Popp, high yield 
analyst with Duff & Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 Trygve Myhren, Providence Journal president, told Bloomberg three weeks ago he 
was negotiating a merger with Continental Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence Journal's cable operations, which serve more than 750,000 homes, 
include Colony Communications Inc., Colony Cablevision, Copley/Colony and King 
Videocable Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Cable serves 3.1 million subscribers in 650 communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Providence's properties are in pretty close proximity to existing Continental 
systems," Popp noted. "It continues their strategy of clustering." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the merger is completed, tentatively in mid-1995, Providence Journal 
will buy out Kelso & Co., its partner in the King joint venture. The cable 
assets from this joint venture will go to Continental, and Providence Journal 
will acquire Kelso's 50% stake in the venture's five broadcast television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Providence Journal Company's cable systems are a very good fit with 
Continental's operations," said Amos B. Hostetter Jr., Continental's chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the operations in the cable industry, their operations are closest to 
Continental's in geography, management philosophy, technology and commitment to 
customer service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence Journal Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Hamblett said the sale 
will help restructure Providence Journal's operations to focus on newspapers, 
broadcast television and video programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Sirlin, an analyst with Wertheim Schroeder, said the merger fits in with 
a broader plan involving the merger of cable and telephone businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner Entertainment, which investment bankers said is negotiating to 
acquire Cablevision Industries, is partly owned by U S West. 
</P>
<P>
 U S West also is negotiating to acquire Continental Cable, according to 
investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of Providence Journal, Continental Cable, and Cablevision 
Industries would give U S West enough subscriber base in the Northeast to 
provide telephone service in competition with Nynex, Sirlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Continental piece is growing, which will in turn become part of a larger 
U S West puzzle," Sirlin said.

TRIAL ORDERED FOR MARROW TRANSPLANT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego Superior Court judge has ordered a jury trial in a case in which a 
woman sued health insurer Health Net for twice refusing to pay for a bone 
marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills-based health maintenance organization eventually agreed to 
pay for a transplant for Viviana Vander Stoep of San Diego after it lost a jury 
trial involving another patient who was also denied a transplant to treat 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the company contended that the procedure was investigational 
and therefore not eligible for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the agreement to reimburse Vander Stoep after she had two transplant 
operations, her suit contends that Health Net's prior refusals constituted a 
breach of contract and that Vander Stoep suffered emotional distress from those 
actions, said her attorney, Mark Hiepler of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler represented the family of Nelene Fox (his sister), which won a 
Riverside County jury verdict ordering Health Net to pay a record $89-million 
fine for denying a bone marrow transplant to Fox, who later died from breast 
cancer. That verdict was the largest U.S. plaintiff's verdict ever involving 
the denial of medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net reached an out-of-court settlement with the Fox family in April for 
a lesser, undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net officials said the decision to reimburse Vander Stoep did not alter 
the company's policy of rejecting bone marrow transplant treatment for patients 
with late-stage breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMO plans to appeal the San Diego judge's ruling, said Don Prial, a 
company spokesman. The HMO contends that Vander Stoep's membership contract 
stipulates that the dispute should be resolved through third-party arbitration, 
not in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler said Vander Stoep, a former teacher, has recovered from her November 
transplant and is in good health.

U.S. HEALTH CARE SPENDING ROSE 7.8% IN '93; ECONOMY: SHALALA CALLS THE INCREASE 
THE SMALLEST SINCE 1986 BUT SAYS IT STILL EXCEEDS THE INFLATION RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER RICH, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health spending by Americans increased 7.8% last year, the smallest rise since 
1986, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spent $884.2 billion on health services, or about $3,299 per person, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago, the annual increases in health spending nationwide were 
in the double digits. Whether last year's slowdown means that the nation has 
gotten control of what a previous Secretary called "the health care inflation 
monster" is still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows whether the slowdown in cost growth can be sustained," said John 
Holahan, a health care policy analyst at the Urban Institute. "There is 
certainly evidence of near-term success, but whether it's permanent is a big 
unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said that although the growth in health spending went from 8.6% in 
1992 to 7.8% last year, the 1993 rise is still much higher than the national 
inflation rate of 2.7% and greater than the growth of the gross domestic 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mike Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American 
Health Systems, which helped defeat the Clinton Administration's cost-control 
proposals for health spending, took a more optimistic view. The low growth 
figure, he said, demonstrates that "the market is working better and can work. 
And if we remove some barriers, the market can work even better." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem of rising health costs is not over," he said, "but the latest 
figures are clearly a reflection of managed care trends," in which insurers and 
providers of medical care carefully monitor care and payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Private expenditures are slowing for two reasons, Holahan said. First, each 
year sees fewer people with health insurance coverage, so they and the insurers 
are spending less. Second, the private sector has been "successful in 
controlling costs," he said, through managed-care methods such as "negotiating 
contracts with doctors and hospitals" to provide services at specified 
discounts according to fee schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala, however, said: "Slow growth in health spending appears to result more 
from very low inflation in the rest of the economy than from any permanent 
changes in the health sector." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the growth rate of health outlays slowed to 7.2%, only to rise to 
near double that a few years later. The United States now spends 13.9% of its 
GDP on health, by far the highest for any developed nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report Shalala released Tuesday shows that the federal government, which 
paid 31.7% of the nation's health care bill, "was the fastest-growing payer of 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare-Medicaid administrator Bruce C. Vladeck said, "Medicare outlays per 
enrollee grew more rapidly than private insurance in 1992 and 1993," reversing 
the pattern of a decade.

ENTREPRENEUR'S RUSSIA VENTURE JUST DOESN'T FLY; INVESTING: STEVE MYERS OF 
NEWPORT BEACH CUTS HIS LOSSES IN AIRCRAFT REFUELING OPERATION AT AIR BASE. 
RISING DEMAND CAN'T SAVE CALIFORNIA KAMCHATKA CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Suffering losses and unable to raise capital for needed equipment at an 
airport on Russia's Pacific Coast, a Newport Beach entrepreneur said Tuesday 
that he is withdrawing from a joint venture there to service freight planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Myers said that he is folding the organization he founded, California 
Kamchatka Co., which had joined with a Russian company in 1992 to operate an 
aircraft refueling station at a military base just outside Kamchatka's capital, 
PetropavlovskKamchatskiy. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation had handled 160 planes since it began in December, 1993, Myers 
said, but wasn't profitable. He declined to specify the company's losses or its 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite increasing demand from airfreight companies that use the airport as a 
stopover on flights between North America and the Far East, Myers said he 
couldn't find investors willing to back the operation or to buy it for an 
asking price of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter on the experience, I don't regret that I did it," he said. "In 
the end, it's all about making money. I just couldn't see any way to make the 
thing run in the black." 
</P>
<P>
 With Myers' withdrawal from Kamchatka, Larry Lane, president of Evergreen 
International Airlines Inc. in McMinnville, Ore., said his company has begun 
diverting its four weekly Boeing 747 flights to and from China to airports in 
Japan and in the Russian city of Khabarovsk. A larger American company, 
Dyncorp, based in Reston, Va., also runs a refueling joint venture at the 
Russian city. 
</P>
<P>
 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was a good location for California Kamchatka's 
venture, Lane said, but harsh winter conditions made it crucial for Myers to 
obtain de-icing machines, devices to restart jet engines and other equipment to 
service planes there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to put these things together," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're used to dealing with the U.S. type of air operations and you 
start dealing with the Russians, it's imperative you have people in place, but 
even that doesn't mean it will succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers criticized the slow pace at which U.S. government agencies have reviewed 
proposals for investment assistance, and the demands of U.S. banks for what he 
called excessive collateral guarantees, both of which he said made it difficult 
to improve California Kamchatka's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven E. Halliwell, chief financial officer of the Russian-American 
Enterprise Fund in New York City, a quasi-governmental agency that was 
considering an investment application from California Kamchatka, said it was 
"unfortunate" that its Moscow-based research teams were not able to complete a 
review of the company's proposal sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, to which Congress has allocated nearly $340 million to distribute 
over three years, has received more than 2,000 proposals and doesn't have the 
staff to review them faster, Halliwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 While smaller proposals like California Kamchatka's are promising, many of 
Russia's aviation-related investments will require much more support than the 
$10-million ceiling that the fund tries to put on its investments, Halliwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said dealings with his Russian partners were at times difficult, but 
such concerns were less of a factor in persuading him to leave than were his 
capital-formation problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States we have a concept here that everything that's not 
expressly prohibited is OK. Over there, it's everything that's not expressly 
permitted is prohibited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're fighting with is an utter and complete lack of economic 
principles, combined with a fear on their part that they'll get taken advantage 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he will now concentrate on his Newport Beach-based aerospace and 
environmental management consulting company, which he expects will grow from 
about $15 million in revenues in 1994 to $18 million next year. He said the 
consulting company had $9 million in revenue in 1992, and grew despite his 
involvement in the airfreight operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture's seven American employees will be transferred to the 
consulting group or given severance packages, Myers said, adding that the fate 
of the 17 Russian employees based at the airport will be up to their employer, 
known by its acronym AKCORD.

 The certification allows both companies to provide workers' compensation 
insurance in a managed care structure, which is aimed at controlling the high 
cost of such insurance.

HELIONETICS BLAMES LOSS ON TRI-LITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helionetics Inc. on Tuesday reported a $3.9-million third-quarter loss, or 14 
cents a share, on revenue of $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company blamed the poor performance on losses incurred by its 
Tri-Lite Inc. unit, of which it owns 56%, and said that it is now searching for 
a buyer for its $7-million stake in Tri-Lite. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Lite's losses for the quarter ending Sept. 30, were $1.9 million, or 37 
cents a share, on revenue of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss was essentially a Tri-Lite loss," said Helionetics Chairman Bernard 
B. Katz. "Helionetics is in excellent financial health with a strong balance 
sheet and realistic prospects of strengthening it in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Lite President Alvin Katz, Bernard Katz's brother, insisted that the 
losses were the result of a one-time $1.2-million marketing charge, but that 
the Irvine-based lighting equipment manufacturer's expected fourth-quarter 
billings would put the company back in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 Helionetics also said that it is moving forward with plans to take another 
division public by the end of the year. Aim Technology Inc., in which 
Helionetics has an approximate 60% ownership stake, manufactures equipment to 
make buildings more energy efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Helionetics stock has not traded on the American Stock Exchange since Monday 
when it closed at a 52-week low of $1.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in company shares was halted Monday after both companies filed 
quarterly reports. According to Katz, American Stock Exchange officials 
questioned company officers about the terms of a sale that was transacted 
during the quarter. Trading is expected to resume today.

SURGICAL LASER SUES BARD OVER BROKEN PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surgical Laser Technologies Inc. said it is suing C.R. Bard Inc., claiming 
Bard reneged on plans to jointly market a urologic laser delivery system in the 
United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgical Laser, based in Oaks, Pa., is seeking up to $62 million in 
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages.Surgical Laser said Bard 
backed out, citing a June, 1991, agreement with Trimedyne Inc. in Irvine, to 
market Trimedyne's Urolase laser delivery system. Surgical Laser also said Bard 
claimed that Trimedyne had threatened to sue it. 
</P>
<P>
 A C.R. Bard spokesman said that while the company had not yet seen a copy of 
the lawsuit, Surgical Laser's press release contained "a number of 
unsubstantiated allegations and opinions." He said the company has already 
rejected Surgical Laser's initial attempt to settle.  
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement signed in July, Bard was to buy up to $36.5 million of 
Surgical Laser's systems over five years and promote the product as Bard's 
preferred laser system, according to Surgical Laser. Bard also was to make a 
$3.8-million payment to Surgical Laser in equity and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it had shared its most confidential information with Bard and 
changed its development plans to meet Bard's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Bard, based in Murray Hills, N.J., is a health-care products company. Surgical 
Laser makes and sells surgical lasers and laser delivery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgical Laser shares fell 12.5 cents Tuesday to close at $3 while Bard shares 
fell 37.5 cents to $25.875

PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC EXPECTS BIG FIRMS TO BUY ITS BULBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific Co. expects initial sales of its energy-efficient Solium 
fluorescent light bulbs to be made to big industrial and commercial companies 
looking to save money, according to Chairman Edward S. Brower. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bulbs can be dimmed by hand, distinguishing them from other 
fluorescent lighting. What's more, Pacific Scientific says Solium bulbs can 
last up to five years and use only 15% of the electricity used by most 
incandescent bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that money-saving angle that is likely to generate the most excitement 
from large industrial and commercial companies, Brower told the Bloomberg 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industrials and commercials may be some of the earlier customers because 
they will make more of an effort to evaluate the economic benefits from using 
our bulb," Brower said. "However, once consumers see this, we think they will 
come around too." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific's stock has soared 44% since the company said in early 
October that Solium could add as much as $100 million to the company's total 
revenue in the next two years. On Sept. 30, the last trading day before the 
introduction of Solium, shares closed at 27 5/8. At midafternoon today, they 
were going for 40 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year ended Nov. 1, shares of Pacific Scientific were up 77%, placing 
the company's stock 36th on the Bloomberg 100 list of top performing U.S. 
stocks in that time. The ranking is based on the total return, including 
dividends, of stocks with a market capitalization of at least $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Pacific Scientific derives the majority of its annual revenue, 
which reached $195 million in 1993, from sales of outdoor lighting controls, 
safety equipment and products for electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 These core businesses are expected to grow at about 12% to 15% a year, Brower 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the future of Pacific Scientific lies with Solium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Solium is everything we expect it to be, it will define the company and 
become our major thrust," Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific is gearing up to manufacture Solium bulbs on a large scale. 
Brower said the company plans to spend about $10 million in the next year on 
equipment and facilities to manufacture Solium. Limited production is expected 
to begin in mid-1995.

 New Investor in Area: Realty Investment Co., a large East Coast real estate 
investment firm, has opened an Irvine office with plans to buy up to $100 
million worth of property in 1995. John Bernard, manager of the firm's 
California office, said he thinks Southern California is "at or near the bottom 
of the trough.The area has been on its knees for some time now, but I think its 
ready to shake itself off." Formed in 1951, the Silver Spring, Md.-based firm 
develops and purchases all types of real estate, including apartments, office 
buildings, shopping centers, nursing homes and hotels. Bernard said the company 
hopes to buy apartments as well as office, retail and industrial centers 
throughout Southern California.

SETTING THE THANKSGIVING TABLE ACROSS THE LAND; CONSUMERS: HOW MUCH YOU PAY 
DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE AND SHOP. ON AVERAGE, A HOLIDAY MEAL FOR 10 WILL COST 
$28.39. 
</P>

 Let's talk turkey for a moment, shall we? 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks are doing a little belt-tightening when it comes to shopping for 
this year's Thanksgiving dinner. Others have plenty of room to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 With the inflation rate holding steady nationwide, the cost of this year's 
holiday feast depends simply on where you live and where you shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a regional business; so a lot of the time what's happening in New 
York has nothing to do with what's happening in California," said Edward 
Comeau, a senior vice president who follows the supermarket industry for Lehman 
Brothers in New York. "Turkey prices are different in every market." 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual Thanksgiving survey of retail prices, the American Farm Bureau 
Federation said Tuesday that the nationwide average for a turkey was 79 cents a 
pound this year, but it noted some shoppers in Florida paid $1.39 a pound while 
others in Arizona were charged only 29 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices as low as 19 cents per pound have been seen in some parts of the 
country," according to the survey, which was recently conducted by 73 volunteer 
shoppers in 27 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation said the average cost of this year's traditional Thanksgiving 
dinner for 10 will be $28.39, or around $2.84 a person, up $1.34 from last year 
but 44 cents below four years ago. A 16-pound turkey cost on average $12.01, 95 
cents more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other menu ingredients that had higher prices, according to the federation, 
included: a 14-ounce package of cubed stuffing, $2.26, up 2 cents; three pounds 
of sweet potatoes, $1.62, up 11 cents; a 12-ounce package of rolls, $1.09, up 
16 cents; 12-ounce package of frozen peas, $1.01, up 5 cents; and a 12-ounce 
package of fresh cranberries, $1.82, up 4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday menu also included a relish dish, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, 
and milk and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 While prices may vary, almost all supermarkets strategically sell their 
turkeys below cost -- on average 30 cents per pound, according to Comeau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supermarket chains have freezers full of turkeys that they have to get rid 
of," he said, describing retail sales as healthy so far. "They have to make 
sure they have a competitive price on turkeys to get people in their stores. 
This is the biggest week of the year for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make it up on everything else they sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Cans of vegetables, for instance, may have a 10% to 12% markup while some 
perishable items may be priced as much as 40% to 50% above the wholesale cost, 
Comeau said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping season for supermarket chains, the 
holiday isn't quite as important for farmers, largely because agriculture has 
become such a diversified business, said Rick Bush, a spokesman for the farm 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a critical holiday for cranberry growers, for example. Back in 
the '50s it made all the difference for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cranberry's spread into mainstream drinks has made Thanksgiving a much 
less significant sales event. Likewise with turkey growers, whose 
diversification into foods ranging from deli sandwich fare to turkey burgers 
and hot dogs has eased the pressure for high sales of the birds at 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "For farmers, Thanksgiving is profitable in general because the demand helps 
get the prices up," Bush said. "But it's also the best value around. Feeding 10 
people for $28 is a pretty good deal." Now We're Talking Turkey 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey trivia, as compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation and the 
National Turkey Federation, trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Turkey Federation has sent one live and two stuffed turkeys to 
the White House each year since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benjamin Franklin lobbied for the turkey to be named the national bird. When 
the bald eagle was chosen instead, Franklin complained "the turkey is a much 
more respectable bird and a true native of America." 
</P>
<P>
 * Neil Armstrong's first meal on the moon was turkey in foil. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only tom turkeys gobble. Hens make a clicking noise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the estimated 300 million U.S. turkeys raised this year, 45 million will 
be eaten at Thanksgiving, 22 million at Christmas and 19 million at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turkey sandwiches account for 44% of all turkey consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mature turkeys have approximately 3,500 feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can freeze a turkey for a year and it won't lose flavor.

FIRINGS MAY SPUR WEARY EXECUTIVES; SURVEY: SOLUTION TO BURNOUT MAY BE THE VERY 
THING MANAGERS FEAR -- SEEKING A NEW JOB. ONE STUDY SUGGESTS SUCH A CHANGE 
EVERY 4 TO 5 YEARS.

<P>
 Overworked executives fear they are burning out faster than ever in the era of 
corporate downsizing, but those who actually get fired may be getting the 
better deal, according to two new surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three of four executives believe the threat of burnout is greater now 
than it was 20 years ago, said a survey released Monday by Challenger Gray & 
Christmas Inc., an international outplacement firm based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of those polled said managers are working too many hours (65%), are 
physically exhausted by the end of the day (64%) and bring too much work home 
(60%). 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a 1982 survey showed only 39% believed managers were working 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the solution to burnout may be the very thing executives fear -- looking 
for another job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, the pressure of proving yourself in a new environment with new 
people and new challenges makes you better," says James Challenger, the company 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested executives age 45 should change jobs every four to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for those executives whose decision to seek a new job has been made 
for them, parting has not been such sweet sorrow -- at least for their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, two-thirds of 575 terminated executives said they believed their 
severance packages were fair, said a survey by Lee Hecht Harrison, a New 
York-based outplacement consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given most people's mixed emotions after losing a job, we did not expect that 
so many would be satisfied with the severance their former employers provided," 
said Steve Harrison, president of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He said fired executives received an average of 28 weeks of severance pay, 
consistent with four years ago. Severance benefits seem to have become 
institutionalized, even as many organizations are cutting costs and trimming 
staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those executives who believed their severance was unfair, many complained 
they were not given enough credit for their length of service and their level 
of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 10% said no amount of severance could compensate for the pain of their 
dismissal.

 William French Smith -- An Oct. 7 article in Life & Style misstated the 
circumstances surrounding the resignation of William French Smith as attorney 
general in the Reagan White House. While he had received criticism in 1982 over 
a personal tax matter, that criticism had ceased by January, 1984 -- when Smith 
announced his intention to step down -- and was not cited as a reason for his 
resignation.
