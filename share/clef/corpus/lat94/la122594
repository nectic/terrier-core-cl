ESSAY; WHAT CAN'T BE WRITTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's my imagination, but I've always thought that out of all people who 
have no faith in words, writers have the least. I'm not sure who has the most, 
maybe preachers and politicians and salesmen, but as far as I can tell, there 
isn't another group more disheartened by what can't be said than those whose 
business it is to say it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course this makes perfect sense. Just as any good auto mechanic can tell 
you that your water pump isn't going to make it another thousand miles, and an 
animal trainer knows just how far to push that lion, so every writer I know 
begins the task of writing absolutely convinced of the utter impossibility of 
saying anything even close to what they'd like to. Or as Beckett put it, "I 
can't go on, I'll go on." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though poets, with their habit of letting half the page be taken up 
by white space -- with what isn't said -- are probably the kings and queens of 
the unsayable, certainly it trickles down to every writer, including, I'm 
pretty sure, those creators of action-adventure romances. Their dashing 
characters, if they had to sit quietly for a moment, emulating us, their 
readers, completely overwhelmed by the confusion of everything going on in our 
lives all at once, would probably keel over in a second, deader than any bullet 
or broken heart could ever make them. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe that's the point. Every work of fiction exists just to remind us of 
what isn't there -- as when we prospect for gold (or buy a lottery ticket) 
every small success only serves to remind us of everything that still eludes 
our grasp. Thus those writers, even great ones (Kafka comes to mind, Hemingway, 
too) who retell nearly the same story over and over aren't really repeating 
themselves, but are only trying to narrow down, eliminate everything that isn't 
the elusive tremor they know they've never captured. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this writing business cuts both ways: On one hand for all of us, 
there's the sense we have that no language in the world is complex enough to 
convey the wavering, contradictory, profound stream that is our impression of 
ourselves and the world. But on the other, for me at least, there's also a 
sneaking, smirking, sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that anything I 
think, no matter how personal, private or prodigious, once I tell, will be 
recognized as the pathetically banal, ordinary, and yes, even boring, un-bon 
mot it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 So these, then, are the two sides of the unutterable. One: my hopelessly 
romantic wish to say something so true and original, that for the first time, 
like some prince or princess abducted by Gypsies at birth, my true station will 
be revealed at last. Two: the fear in equal parts that once I say it I'll be 
exposed as not only not a prince, but not even a Gypsy. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, I'm told by those smarter than me, is a language problem: the 
signifier is never the thing signified. The word is never the object, they say, 
and I believe it. I remember once, years ago, I was visited in the office where 
I teach by an earnest and distressed middle-aged man who told me he was sorry, 
but he'd had to drop out of my class because, as he said, he was "involved in a 
triple death situation." The phrase puzzled me; it turned out what he meant was 
that his wife and two daughters had been killed by a drunk driver who swerved 
into their lane on the freeway. "That's OK" I told him, "you take care of 
yourself." And what could I have meant? 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the impossibility of language from the other direction, a while 
ago I heard a mother who had survived the loss of her child describe the 
feeling as "a hole in my heart." I was moved by its aptness, and then, 
strangely, a couple days later, I heard a father use the same phrase to 
describe the same loss, and then a week or so after that, still another 
grieving father used it, and this time, or maybe I only imagined it, he spoke 
it with a slight smirk of satisfaction for having found the proper phrase: "A 
hole-in-the-heart situation." 
</P>
<P>
 We speak a single word, and no sooner is it spoken than it disperses to join 
all such identical words, and each time one of those is used, each time we say 
love, or good, for example, its power is diminished by some tiny increment, 
becoming, although never reaching, some theoretical level of pure meaningless 
that must be, after all, the same as the unutterable. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it's all impossible -- this entire life, every minute of it, when it 
comes to reporting what actually is going on. Yet of course, we do nothing but 
blab about it, every blasted minute, creating a fabric which, though may not be 
our lives, must, like Old Man River, mean something -- be a stand-in, a double, 
a surrogate self, behind which the real self must lurk. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when I first began to try to write, an older and wiser friend kept 
telling me, correctly, that I had to drop the false mask of competence. I had 
to put into my poems the real messiness of my life, which, because I was young, 
I didn't want to admit. My friend, on the other hand, had chosen to construct 
his own mask almost entirely out of his own pain and groping need and blind 
apprehension. What his mask hid from the world was his formidable intelligence, 
ambition, critical judgment and naturally, his competence. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not so long ago when I would walk down to the edge of the 
ocean every day. Once there, on the Styrofoam-flecked, wrapper strewn sand, I 
would climb a ladder to a lifeguard station and sit, my back pressed against 
the light-blue, weathered enclosure where the guards hung out in season, and 
stare at the water. This was not in order to think -- in fact I thought nothing 
-- but there was something soothing in the parallel emptiness that I was 
staring at and the one I carried in my life those days. Of course, the sea was 
not really empty, nor was my life, but it pleased me to think of both of them 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that I was sitting there, on that lifeguard tower, one winter 
morning about 11 a.m.; I tried to levitate, and may even have succeeded, 
because certainly I felt nothing beneath me but space and air. The self who was 
sitting there, whoever I was then, seemed as transparent as the spray of waves 
blowing in from the west toward the land. A little later, I climbed down and 
headed back home, no different than before I had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Theory of Gases, if I remember correctly, we are all a single 
gas -- the glass of water we hold, the air we breath, our cat, our begonia, our 
VCR -- us and our world together -- with some lumps simply more dense than 
others. The gas of Anna Karenina suddenly becomes dispersed by contact with a 
rapidly moving, denser gas we call a train. The gas of little Marcel Proust 
drifts, mixes with other gases like it, forms a small refined cloud, and then 
goes on its way. 
</P>
<P>
 What stays whole then, for those of us who write and those who don't, is the 
medium of silence, that unchanging broth in which all words float. What finally 
can be said -- what can't be said -- perhaps they are the same in the end. And 
for the person foolish enough to write about such a subject, Ortega y Gasset 
reminds us that one day in the 1st Century BC there was a sculptor named 
Pasiteles who was busy sculpting a panther for the decoration of some temple or 
another. Of the kind of day it was, or how the man felt we have no record, but 
the important thing is, as he chipped and chipped away at his stone, in one way 
or another, the panther ate him.

BAD BOY BUILDER; THE ARCHITECT OF 'GLASS HOUSE' AND THE BEST VISUAL JOKE IN THE 
MANHATTAN SKYLINE HASN'T CONFINED HIS HUBRIS TO HIS WORK.; PHILIP JOHNSON: LIFE 
AND WORK, BY FRANZ SCHULZE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $30; 420 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Temko, Allan Temko, a longtime columnist for the San Francisco 
Chronicle, won a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for his architectural criticism. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Johnson is the wicked old man of American architecture. At the age of 
88, he has not lost the capacity to shock. Although he will never again do 
anything so outrageous as crowning the AT&T Building in Manhattan with a huge 
broken pediment resembling a Chippendale highboy, it will not be for want of 
trying. Assisted as always by younger architects, he is still at the drawing 
board a few days of the week, fragile but elegant, candid but perverse, rich, 
amazingly cultivated, gay of course, even slightly vicieux, disarming his 
critics with the cool smiling malice that put him on the cover of Time and made 
him a top talk-show draw on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Schulze, the rather sober-sided author of this long-awaited study of 
Johnson's life and work, is not a critic who is easily charmed or disarmed by 
an architect whose sins, aesthetic and otherwise, may outnumber his virtues. 
Despite recent competition on the tube from I. M. Pei, Johnson is probably the 
best-known living architect. That, as Schulze makes clear, is not the same as 
being the best architect. Johnson has done some very good buildings, most 
notably his own famous Glass House in Connecticut and the spectacular Crystal 
Cathedral at Garden Grove, in nethermost Orange County. But he has perpetrated 
many more bad buildings, enumerated by Schulze in one of the worst drubbings 
ever administered to a supposedly serious architect by a writer to whom he 
opened his heart and from whom he may have expected more kindly treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Johnson asked for it. He has not been serious in the way that masters such 
as Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe (Johnson's foremost influence) were 
wholly serious about their art. This went largely unnoticed so long as Johnson 
adhered to the strict structural discipline of Miesian "skin-and-bones" 
architecture, an allegiance so close, Schulze and others have remarked, that it 
sometimes bordered on "plagiarism." As soon as Johnson broke with Mies around 
1960, however, after they worked together on the Seagram Building in New York, 
he struck out wildly on his own (although he occasionally returned to his 
Miesian manner in his best later buildings such as the Crystal Cathedral). 
</P>
<P>
 Then Johnson's frivolity and essential weakness were exposed in a series of 
flippant, careless, trivial but unfortunately often very big buildings, 
especially in parvenu places like Texas. There were campy buildings in 
pseudo-historical drag, like the ersatz Gothic of Pittsburgh Plate Glass or the 
stepped-up Dutch gables of the Republic Bank Building in Houston; one-liner 
joke buildings like the gift-wrapped Neiman Marcus store in San Francisco; 
decadent "ballet school" buildings, sporting crass facades at Lincoln Center in 
New York or in Lincoln, Neb.; and finally, after an array of Post-Modern 
pastiches, such as the bogus mansard roofs of the Crescent in Dallas, an 
autumnal infatuation with throw-out-the-rules Deconstructivism in which -- 
striving as ever to keep ahead of the game with younger architects -- he 
feverishly embraces the bombastic masculine nihilism of Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, Johnson is our finest Fake Architect, a bantamweight Nietzsche 
with a will to power, who is truly best only at creating and recreating his 
inimitable self. For this Johnson has had abundant financial means all of his 
life. Had he chosen another career -- and for a time in the 1930s, like an 
American Oswald Mosley, he embarked on a loathsome pro-Nazi excursion in 
politics -- he still would have been a phenomenal multifaceted personality, 
afflicted when young with manic-depression, who might be hated or execrated but 
not ignored. Besides, after the fascist interlude, his grace, generosity and 
genuine talent earned him forgiveness -- nay, admiration and affection -- from 
Jewish friends, colleagues and clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating all this was his unashamed homosexuality. Well, almost unashamed. 
Over the years his inamoratos have included no less than four pretty "Mrs. 
Johnsons," long-term catamites, as well as innumerable one-night stands, 
sometimes picked up on "chicken-hawk" forays for boys and risky hunts for 
"rough trade" (Schulze reports that Johnson has always been pleasurably excited 
by risks and physical danger). Then there were flings with Merce Cunningham and 
other stars. Yet Johnson was middle-aged, long after Cunningham left him over a 
presumed slight, before he took gay lovers to "uptown" dinner parties where he 
cajoled social equals as important as Blanchette (Mrs. John D., 3rd) 
Rockefeller, for whom -- to her conventional husband's annoyance -- he did the 
exquisite Rockefeller Guest House just north of the Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
 To decipher the codes of Johnson's arcane personal life, and to relate them to 
his architecture, has been Schulze's most daunting task. On the whole he has 
done a fair and conscientious job. Almost all the relevant facts seem to be 
here, even if their nuances -- worthy of a Proust -- have sometimes escaped the 
dogged research of an able architectural historian, not a psychologist, who in 
1985 brought out an excellent biography of Mies. 
</P>
<P>
 The present book is not quite in that class, just as Johnson is not in the 
class of Mies either as an architect or an individual. Nonetheless the Johnson 
book cuts deeply enough. It is not an "authorized" biography. Certainly the 
text was not submitted to Johnson for his imprimatur, much less the glossings 
and emendations at which this most literate of architects is adept. Yet Schulze 
could not have written as he has with confessions by Johnson that make Oscar 
Wilde's seem reticent. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness to Johnson, he never expected to see his avowals in print. By 
mutual consent, publication was to have been withheld until after Johnson's 
death; but as several years passed, and the octogenarian gave no sign of 
shuffling off this mortal coil, gleefully anticipating his 90th birthday, the 
dismayed author requested -- and was graciously granted -- permission to 
publish now. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently we have a unique chronicle of Johnson's pivotal role in high 
architectural culture of the 20th Century. He himself is only six years younger 
than the century; and he has been not only a designer of buildings, but almost 
equally significant as a critic, historian, theorist, instructor at Yale and 
Cornell, patron of all the fine arts, and even a propagandist, for he has been 
a formidable polemicist in the major architectural controversies of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not least, he was founding director (and ever since, the presiding genius 
behind the scenes) of the department of architecture and design at the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York, where he teamed with the equally snooty homosexual 
aesthete Henry-Russell Hitchcock to change the history of architecture with the 
epochal "International Style" exhibition of 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 How he reached this precocious apogee at the age of 26, when he had visited 
many of the advanced Modern buildings in Europe, but as yet had received no 
formal architectural training, would have been an altogether different story if 
Philip as a girlish boy, a stammerer, had not realized his gender preference 
early. After painful confusion and a nervous breakdown, he came to terms 
passionately with his sexual identity, after boarding school at Harvard, where 
he studied philosophy with Alfred North Whitehead (who took a shine to him), 
and later in Weimar, Germany where, like so many other gay artists and 
intellectuals, he found more fun and freedom than anywhere else in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 This deeply American struggle, so Jamesian, took place in an archetypal 
Protestant family in Sherwood Anderson's Ohio, where Philip Cortelyou Johnson 
was born into the Cleveland patriciate in 1906. The protagonists are familiar: 
the dull, slightly ridiculous lawyer father who did not understand his son at 
all, but gave him a block of IBM stock on his 21st birthday that soon made him 
a millionaire; and the aesthetically ambitious, strangely thwarted mother who 
perhaps understood the son too well. There were also the lost older brother, 
who died in childhood; the slightly distant older sister; and the adoring 
younger sister Theodate, a fascinating libidinous creature, gifted musically, 
who deserves a biography of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulze has the background pretty much correct. Although Philip was often 
considered "aristocratic" by plebeian New Yorkers, the Johnsons were a cut 
below the real ruling class of Mark Hanna's Cleveland. Their status was summed 
up for me by an heiress to the White truck company fortune: "his father worked 
for my father." That may be, but lawyer Johnson gave Philip the wherewithal to 
cut a dashing figure among the cultural elite of Europe and America. He was a 
quick study, who usually appeared in the right place at the right time, a bit 
before everyone else, for instance at Mies' magnificent Tugendhat House in 
Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1930, accompanied by the architect who had not had the 
money to see the building earlier. Often Johnson would arrive in glorious 
motor-cars, among them a Cord and an Auburn, right out of F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Slender, intense, drop-dead handsome, with a cleft chin to set off his 
chiseled features, he was a model of young WASP privilege. Then, inexplicably, 
he threw it all over -- except his private fortune -- and became a camp 
follower of Huey Long, Gerald L.K. Smith, Father Coughlin and other home-grown 
Populist demagogues, returning to Germany before the outbreak of World War II 
as a correspondent for Coughlin's Social Justice. On the eve of the blitzkrieg 
William L. Shirer spotted him as "an American fascist" and suspected him of 
"spying" on the other foreign journalists "for the Nazis." Philip has never 
refuted the charge, and only late in life did he make a tepid apology for his 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he a Nazi agent, or simply a sympathizer like Charles Lindbergh? By his 
own admission, he was bowled over by the uniforms, the leather belts, the storm 
troopers, above all the gigantic Hitlerian rallies staged by Albert Speer. 
Schulze, in a major discovery, has found that Johnson felt something like "a 
sexual thrill" when he watched the Nazis burn and destroy a Polish village. 
</P>
<P>
 Such things were not forgiven when he returned home. The FBI had a file on 
him, from which Schulze has culled chilling extracts. After a mysterious call 
to the German Embassy in Washington, before Pearl Harbor, he decided to study 
architecture at Harvard. The design school was now headed by Walter Gropius, 
the anti-fascist former head of the Bauhaus, whom Johnson never liked. The most 
brilliant professor was the ex-Bauhaus master Marcel Breuer, whom he did like. 
His thesis was a full-scale Miesian courtyard house -- the first of its kind in 
the country -- that Johnson built for himself in Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, in which he was somehow permitted to serve as an Army private, 
he became the most fashionable architect in New York. It was an event to lunch 
at his table in the Four Seasons, probably his finest interior. Once I was 
late, and he drummed on the table and said: "You vile boy, I should order you a 
steak tartare." I was then in my 40s, and one of the first critics to attack 
his Post-Modern facades. Years later I could tell him how much I admired the 
Crystal Cathedral, where I heard the Rev. Robert Schuller deliver a televised 
sermon. "But does he know of your sinfulness?" I asked Philip. "Oh," said 
Philip, waving his wrist, "he says we're all sinners."

THE MAN AT THE DINNER TABLE; FATHERALONG: A MEDITATION ON FATHERS AND SONS, 
RACE AND SOCIETY, BY JOHN EDGAR WIDEMAN (PANTHEON: $21; 197 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mitchell Duneier, Mitchell Duneier teaches sociology at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of Slim's Table: Race, 
Respectability, and Masculinity (University of Chicago Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mind of today's American child, the father is a mysterious figure. One 
of two children will grow up in a home where the father is absent for six 
years. Of those fathers who remain living in the same home with their children, 
many are working two jobs. Employed or unemployed, they are gone. Anonymous. 
Lost. Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking one's father has become one of the tragic personal dramas of the age 
in which we live. Among African Americans, the situation is even more dire: 85% 
will grow up in a home headed by a single mother. Add to that all of the intact 
black homes in which fathers labor at two jobs, and it is not hard to 
understand why presences and absences are fundamental themes in African 
American family life. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, for all the sociological studies of black kinship, the absence of 
personal exchanges between fathers and sons has never been so insightfully 
described as in "Fatherlong," John Edgar Wideman's book of personal stories 
about his own distant relationship and "long delayed conversations" with his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Wideman is one of America's greatest novelists, well known for his portraits 
of black urban life. In the book's title story, he meditates on his Pittsburgh 
youth, when his father worked daily in the restaurant of Kaufman's department 
store ("in a short white jacket and black pants"), and nightly at a second job. 
"I did not expect him to do much more than come and go like a ghost, at odd 
hours, to sleep, to eat," he writes. "He was my father and worked long and hard 
for us. We slept in the same house, but at different hours." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wideman's father was not working or living at home, he was likely in 
another part of town -- beyond Hamilton Avenue, a mysterious and disreputable 
district of bars and poolrooms. His account of crossing these streets and 
searching for his father raises the painful dilemma faced by multitudes of 
young black men who seek their mysterious fathers today: The women in one's 
house have organized their lives to raise a boy alone and protect him from the 
dangers that ruin black men. So is the father search then an act of deserting 
or shaming the women? Whatever it is, Wideman writes, the search "is finally 
only a trope, a ropa-dope trope containing enough rope to hang you up 
terminally, you black bastard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatherlong" is a masterpiece of sociological speculation, constructed with 
such an abundance of wisdom as to compensate for its lack of evidence regarding 
questions on which there are no easy answers. Viewing the search for fathers as 
a crucial experience of black manhood in America, he sees the absence of the 
black father as the key to comprehending the high levels of violence that stand 
behind the collapsing moral order of America's inner cities. "People are easier 
to kill if they come from nowhere. If they have no names, no fathers or 
mothers," he writes. "The dead . . . are nobodies who began nowhere, go nowhere 
except back where they belong." Coming from nowhere, going nowhere is the 
defining characteristic of black manhood in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Wideman looks closely at the garments that appeal to young men today. 
"Oversize and drooping . . . off the behind styles . . . styles antithetical to 
the city; Timberland boots, Pendleton wool shirts. Isn't one message of these 
costumes loud and clear: 'We're still kids . . . . Help us pull ourselves 
together. Hike up these baggy drawers. Turn my cap around.' But if abandonment, 
a plea for help are projected in styles of dress, there are also the cold 
distant eyes, daring you to touch." Has American society created an unbridgable 
distance between black fathers and sons? 
</P>
<P>
 Though he begins his book by asking if we can stop seeing the world through 
the prism of race, by the end of "Fatherlong" Wideman suggests that we are 
unable to do so. The distance between black sons and their fathers is rooted in 
their own racial exclusion from the larger society. Marginalized in a labor 
market that demands increasing skills for mediocre opportunities, black fathers 
are unable to attain the minimum self respect necessary to establish their own 
manhood. Fathers who secretly question their own masculinity stay away from 
their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the worst aspects of this distance," argues Wideman, "is the unwitting 
complicity of the victims perpetuating it. Because we don't talk or can't talk 
father to son, son to father, each generation approaches the task of becoming 
men as if no work has been accomplished before."

LOVE YOU FOREVER; A LOOK AT THE HARD TRUTHS OF MOTHERHOOD; AMERICAN MOM: 
MOTHERHOOD, POLITICS AND HUMBLE PIE, BY MARY KAY BLAKELY (ALGONQUIN: $19.95; 
291 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Francesca Lyman, Francesca Lyman, a free-lance writer, has a 6-year old boy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good advice on mothering is hard to come by in books, writes author Mary Kay 
Blakely, who supplies a good reason why: "This great body of knowledge is 
essentially an oral history, because anyone engaged in motherhood on a daily 
basis has no time to write an advice book about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder, then, that Blakely's own memoir and meditation on motherhood 
comes as her two sons are leaving the nest. Offering no advice at all, 
"American Mom: Motherhood, Politics and Humble Pie," simply serves up one good 
tale after another of the frazzling, frustrating but ultimately fulfilling life 
and times of a divorced, working mother. After nearly 20 years of what -- for 
any mother-hyphen-writer -- would have to be a struggle and a juggle raising 
sons very close in age on her own for the most part, she finds herself 
adjusting to a suddenly changed reality: "Now I didn't want my grown sons, my 
daily buddies, to leave home; I also couldn't wait for their ravenous appetites 
and deafening music to go." 
</P>
<P>
 If such a clear expression of the "empty nest" syndrome might sound like 
something equally at home in the pages of Erma Bombeck, the author's more 
complicated view is informed by the wrenching social transformations of the 
last few decades. Blakely's objection to "deafening music" sounds oddly 
old-fashioned for someone of her generation, but these memoirs portray her as 
caught between a fairly conventional Catholic upbringing and unconventional 
idealism. Like many mothers today, Blakely spent little time as a full-time 
mother in the traditional sense, in her case owing to family financial 
difficulties and a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Her non-traditional family's life is unique -- including stages she describes 
as "the charmingly chaotic, physically affectionate years of our young nuclear 
family; the emotionally explosive and slightly radioactive period of our 
post-nuclear family; the surprisingly fluid and eventually peaceful transition 
into two long-distance single parent families" -- each capped by periods of 
poverty and stress that finally lead her to the ultimate edge -- a harrowing 
nine-day coma. But Blakely's struggles and stresses -- with spouse, children 
and other loves (such as a post-separation relationship that doesn't last 
either) -- relate to challenges universally faced by mothers. Her wry and witty 
handling of them make satisfying medicine for maternal distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakely, the author of another memoir, "Wake Me When It's Over," is a feminist 
writer whose work has appeared in many magazines, particularly women's 
magazines, such as Ms. and Working Woman, where earlier versions of essays 
appeared that provided some of the base for this book. She does inject 
political commentary, relating her stories to feminist theory. But she leavens 
it with wit, as when she writes about celebrity moms who have the luxury of 
having it all without having to really put out extra: "Most of the rest of us 
were still laboring under the cliche: 'A woman has to work twice as hard as any 
man to be considered half as good.' That equation kept us so frazzled that 
hundreds of women from coast to coast thought my coma sounded like something 
they might want to try." (She notes that a woman from Portland called in to ask 
what nine days of sleep was like.) 
</P>
<P>
 Blakely's odyssey begins in her first chapter, "Maternal Bondage," with her 
first hint that motherhood was going to be far more complicated than expected, 
the night she goes into labor while being coached in the deep-breathing 
techniques of natural childbirth. Expecting to be "self-anesthetized" as 
promised, she reports, "if my self-anesthesia took at all, it packed the power 
of two baby aspirin." Next, trying to conquer the business of maternal bonding 
(after her husband, "having concluded his duties as a natural father -- goes 
home to catch up on a night of lost sleep"), she waits for the magic moment 
when her maternal instincts are supposed to "kick in" -- to no avail. It would 
be years, she writes, before she would comprehend that "the effortless 
knowledge women allegedly acquired at birth" was a "cultural invention that 
kept the hard work of motherhood invisible to anyone outside the field." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, myths about motherhood, she reflects, often contain a grain 
of truth. "Although 'maternal instinct' did not exactly describe it, I did 
sense a subtle but significant shift in my thinking after my sons were born. . 
. . I began to see the world through this triple vision of my past and our 
present and my sons' future. Ever since, it has been my hunch that when a woman 
startles a man with her uncanny 'female intuition,' she is merely tapping into 
this uncredentialed knowledge of what the human organism will do/has done under 
certain circumstances. Within nanoseconds, for example, she might see beyond 
the angry lawyer fuming at the dinner table, making a connection with the 
wounded boy who lost his truck in a sandbox wager that afternoon and then 
popped his teammate on the head with his plastic shovel." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her many stories, Blakely lovingly chronicles the transformations of her 
sons from boys to men -- well, their efforts anyway -- like the older son who 
turned up the collars of his jackets and practiced facial expressions. "In his 
school pictures that year, his lips are curled in a lopsided grimace and his 
eyes narrowed in an apparent effort to look like Clint Eastwood. But among the 
frankly cheerful smiles in the freshman year book, he looked more like a stroke 
patient suffering temporary paralysis. Masculinity comes hard to the 
baby-faced." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakely's comments are less original when dealing with the new challenges 
afflicting parents, such as the social problems named by USA Today as the top 
five: drug addiction, teen-age pregnancy, suicide and homicide, gang violence, 
anorexia and bulimia. "Ryan and Darren . . . had friends who had to be 
hospitalized, who disappeared into recovery programs, who had brothers in jail, 
who had pregnant sisters. We'd traveled a long way from their early charming 
inquiries (Mom, how many chews are there in a stick of gum?) to their 
frightening questions now: 'Mom can you really get addicted to crack after only 
one try?' " Such glimpses don't offer much. 
</P>
<P>
 A more compelling real-life tale from the front comes when her son returns 
home from college the week the story of the Glen-Ridge, N.J. gang rape hits ( 
which gang-rape? the one of the mentally-retarded young woman, with baseball 
bats and broom handles). The author fearfully nudges him for a reaction. " 
'Mom!' he fairly shouted. 'Are you really asking if I know whether it's wrong 
to rape a retarded girl with a baseball bat?' She was; she could hardly believe 
it herself. . . . Because she knew, as most mothers who take the news 
personally do, that the integrity of every young man is under constant 
assault." She writes elsewhere: "Until mothers become the sayers and makers of 
the culture, until we can actually live in a society where mothers and children 
genuinely matter, ours is an essentially powerless responsibility. Mothers 
carry out most of the work orders, but most of the rules governing our lives 
are shaped by outside influences." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the scope and scape of Blakely's emotional terrain in "American 
Mom" is as wide-ranging and laced with irony as her book's title would suggest. 
These quirky and very personal anecdotes are what is best about this diary of a 
struggling mother, which should have plenty of resonance among mothers today. 
It should also be required reading for that new demographic category Blakely 
invents: "working fathers," the ones learning to make brownies.

RICHARD EDER: IN THE LAND OF THE DEFEATED AND OPPRESSED, TO BE IS TO BE SOMEONE 
ELSE; THE BLACK BOOK, BY ORHAN PAMUK TRANSLATED FROM TURKISH BY GUNELI GUN 
(FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $25; 400 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orhan Pamuk's braided mysteries coil around the story of a plodding husband 
who searches for his restless wife through Istanbul's serpentine streets and 
historical memory. Once it was the Ottoman Empire's Constantinople and before 
that, the Byzantine Empire's, and long before that, the ancient Greek 
Byzantium. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pamuk, author of the warmly praised "The White Castle," the city is a 
suffocating midden of 2,000 years of temporary victories and permanent defeat. 
Pamuk writes of the defeat. His philosophical detective story is, in fact, an 
evocation of the crippled consciousness and destructive reflexes of his fellow 
Turks: heirs of a traditional Eastern society, and engaged for three quarters 
of a century in a Westernizing project that still has not taken root. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the land of the defeated and oppressed, to be is to be someone else," 
asserts one of the many figures -- at once enigmatic and hysterically 
overwrought -- whom the husband, Galip, encounters on his week-long quest. It 
is the underlying theme of a book of disguises and transformations. Personal 
identity is unattainable when a nation's identity has been lost, and in neither 
case -- so goes Pamuk's menacing comedy -- can it be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborated with a dizzying wealth of discursiveness, distraction and literary 
baiting and switching, it often bogs down under its own abundance. It will 
dazzle and then, with an effect akin to snow-blindness, it goes indistinct. It 
disappears into its own virtuosity and reappears. It remains distant from the 
reader like someone who talks fast and well and doesn't look you in the eye, 
and suddenly, with disconcerting effect, looks you in the eye. It is a trying 
book and worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Galip's quest is partly human and mostly allegorical. He is an undistinguished 
lawyer desperately in love with Ruya, his long-haired, long-legged cousin and 
wife, who spends the day reading detective novels. We never see her and yet -- 
an example of Pamuk's gifted elusiveness -- she is vivid and oddly lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 She vanishes suddenly, leaving a 19-word note in green ink. We are only told 
nine of the words -- an example of Pamuk's exasperating elusiveness -- but we 
are made to understand that she has gone off with her half-brother Jelal, to 
whom she has always been attracted. Galip comically hides the disappearance 
from his family. When his aunt phones he makes footstep noises to signal that 
he has gone to fetch her and found her asleep; then he sets off to try to track 
the pair down. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the humanity, though it will return, movingly, at the end. In the 
quest, Ruya is all but lost sight of; the real quarry is Jelal. He is as 
brilliant as Galip is obscure: Istanbul's most celebrated and controversial 
newspaper columnist. Galip has always worshiped and envied him and lived in his 
shadow. Even as children, when Galip and Ruya played hide-and-seek Ruya would 
never try to find him, but go off instead to meet Jelal. 
</P>
<P>
 The book proceeds by alternate chapters. One set tells of Galip's search; the 
other contains Jelal's writings. Gradually the two converge; finally Galip and 
Jelal will also converge. Eventually Galip will be living in Jelal's apartment, 
wearing his pajamas, writing his columns and taking over his lovers' calls and 
his death threats. By this time the actual fate of Jelal and Ruya has dwindled. 
Eventually we will learn it and be touched when Galip momentarily comes down to 
earth, as it were, and lets himself grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galip-Jelal quest is a wild, varied and sometimes stupefyingly arcane trip 
through Turkish history and culture, political battles, themes of individual 
and national alienation, portraits of extravagant and emblematic characters and 
beliefs, and Galip's own obsessions. He tramps the streets and neighborhoods of 
Istanbul as thoroughly as Leopold Bloom tramped Dublin; stopping frequently to 
eat. Eating -- he buys from street stands and cafes and sticks to the cheap 
traditional dishes -- is a way to assure himself that there is, in fact, a 
Turkish identity. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a bravura chapter in which Jelal writes of the Bosphorous drained, 
and sedimentary layers of history turning up in the pestilential muck. There 
are the skeletons of galley-slaves chained to their boats, the skeletons of 
crusaders atop their skeleton horses, sackfuls of the Sultan's courtiers fallen 
out of favor, strangled and ditched, an entire German battleship and a white 
Cadillac belonging to a rich gangster. The gangster's skull and his 
girlfriend's are glued together in a kiss. Galip thinks for a moment of Ruya 
before returning to his intoxicating existential quest. 
</P>
<P>
 Wandering through the city he visits two of Jelal's colleagues, each with his 
own mania. They question him fiercely, intrusively and outlandishly; Galip is 
like Lewis Carroll's Alice undergoing impertinent questions from the likes of 
the Caterpillar and the Red Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 He visits Ruya's first husband, an intellectual who has set himself against 
all foreign cultural influences and makes a point of living like a provincial 
middle-class Turk, with a doily over the TV and a dusty tray of cordials 
brought out for visitors. He visits the premises of a failed mannequin artist 
who had insisted on portraying authentically Turkish figures -- bow-legged, 
short, mustached -- instead of the blond anonymous elegance required by 
Westernized commerce. He is shown wax models of those the artist despised -- 
writers and translators who import alien culture -- and those he admired -- 
police torturers whose careers suffered because they insisted on using 
traditional Turkish methods instead of newfangled methods brought in from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 To be oneself, to reject outside influences: a national obsession that, for 
Pamuk, leads nowhere. He writes an allegory of a prince who sets his people an 
example by excluding anything that might dilute his own authenticity. He gets 
rid of his books (though then, finding his mind empty, he brings a few back). 
He gets rid of paintings, furniture, his wife. Not wishing to be influenced by 
memories, he banishes smells and music. Finally he dies in a room painted 
white; its only furniture a white piano. His last words are: "Nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Galip, however, illustrates an opposite national obsession. He wants only to 
be someone else; he wants only to be the powerful and glamorous Jelal, free of 
narrow Turkish prejudices and sought out by foreign journalists and television 
teams as their sophisticated interlocutor. He wants above all to have the power 
that Jelal wields: to control the universe by writing about it. By the end, he 
has to all intents and purposes become Jelal. As for the real Jelal: before a 
mysterious ambush that claims his and Ruya's lives, he has shown signs of 
abdicating his power and seeking something more authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 What that will be, this intriguing, overnourished and maddeningly private 
attempt at a public novel, doesn't say. It is neither retreat into national 
solipsism nor dilution in a homogeneous world culture. All we have to hold on 
to, at the end, is Galip remembering Ruya and the game they once played. They 
would try to describe what a day would be like when they reached the age of 73. 
Now, alone, Galip lives out that day in his imagination.

COVER STORY: SANTA'S MIXED BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merry Christmas to: 
</P>
<P>
 JAY LENO: For losing with graciousness and respectable ratings against the 
David Letterman steamroller. 
</P>
<P>
 "TWIN PEAKS": Better than ever in its recent reruns on Bravo. It'll be back 
again next year, the cable network says. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHNNY CARSON: Boy, do I miss those monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 EMMY VOTERS: Yeah, sure, "Picket Fences" is better than "NYPD Blue." Get real. 
</P>
<P>
 "THE FIVE MRS. BUCHANANS": Is it hallucination, or did this show really make 
the CBS lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES KURALT: You got out just in time, pal. Just take a look around. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC REPORTER PATRICK HEALY: Sure miss your late dad, Jim, who made 
sportscasting an uproarious art. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICAN MOVIE CLASSICS: My favorite cable channel. But get rid of some of 
those cute, crummy little features that clutter up far too much time between 
the films. 
</P>
<P>
 CONAN O'BRIEN: Nice try, but time to pack it in. 
</P>
<P>
 GREG KINNEAR: Give him O'Brien's spot following Leno. Out of the blue, 
Kinnear's "Later" show is proving him a TV natural with big-time potential, 
even though he sometimes seems and sounds like a Letterman clone. 
</P>
<P>
 NANCY KERRIGAN: TV's quote of the year, made during a Disney World function: 
"This is so corny. This is so dumb. This is the most corny thing I've ever 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID CARUSO: A graceful exit is just as important as a grand entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 FORD MOTOR CO.: All right -- O.J.'s Bronco cruise on the freeway was great 
exposure, but Lindsay Wagner's commercials are still the best thing that's 
happened to Ford on TV in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "FRASIER": For showing that a really classy and urbane comedy can go up 
against the super-hot Tim Allen and his series, "Home Improvement," and not 
only survive but thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELA LANSBURY: Those Emmy airheads still don't think she's worth an award. 
All she's done is hold CBS Entertainment together for a decade with "Murder, 
She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 BRIAN LAMB: C-SPAN's incomparable, implacable interviewer and host -- and, by 
the way, the founder of the invaluable news-of-record channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "CAGNEY & LACEY": What made the two-hour comeback movie so good was the 
stylish filmmaking that subtly reflected the difference between the '80s -- 
when the series thrived -- and the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL GATES AND BARRY DILLER: Get together, guys, buy a network and take us 
into the 21st Century tomorrow. You know -- a network that wouldn't even dream 
of doing shows like "Blue Skies" and "Wild Oats." 
</P>
<P>
 VANCE MUSE: For his delightful new book, "We Bombed in Burbank," about Jay 
Tarses' ill-fated series "Smoldering Lust," which the geniuses at NBC retitled 
"A Black Tie Affair," which had nothing to do with the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "THE NANNY": Monday used to be CBS' Tiffany night. Now it features this 
sitcom, which has all the appeal of fingernails screeching across a blackboard 
-- for a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 JERRY SPRINGER: For proving that there is a tackier talk show on TV than 
"Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
 "SOUTH CENTRAL": Gone, but not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 BRETT BUTLER: Not the baseball player -- the star of "Grace Under Fire," who's 
as comfortable as strong coffee and a stack of good reading on a Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL TV: The only reason it rates as high as a D-minus for the year -- with 
its insane focus on crime and scaring people to death -- is its mesmerizing 
power on an occasional big story like the Northridge quake, which it covered 
admirably. As for the frenzied O.J. coverage, let's not even talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "COACH" AND "WINGS": TV's most underrated sitcoms -- valuable utility players 
on the prime-time chessboard. 
</P>
<P>
 NETWORK PROGRAMMERS: Wake me up when you can match such past specials as 
"Friendly Fire," "The Execution of Private Slovik," "Gideon's Trumpet," 
"Something About Amelia," "Love Among the Ruins" and "The Miracle Worker." 
</P>
<P>
 THE NFL: Sure, I've tuned in the Sunday games, but I feel like I'm playing 
hookey when I watch them on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CENTER FOR MEDIA AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS: For its devastating report on the 
lack of Latinos on prime-time TV -- and their negative image. "Sadly," the 
Center noted of the last TV season, "the highest-profile Latino characters 
(were) Erik and Lyle Menendez." 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. LAW." Thanks for the memories. 
</P>
<P>
 DIANE SAWYER: Lucky for her she got that $7-million ABC deal before "ER" 
creamed her "PrimeTime Live" series and chased it to another night, starting in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 CONNIE CHUNG: Yet another high-priced anchor whose series was clobbered by 
"ER," as newsmagazines finally seem to have peaked and appear headed for 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 STATION EXECUTIVES: KABC-TV Channel 7 has lost million-dollar news readers 
Jerry Dunphy, Ann Martin and Paul Moyer and is still managing to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 KEN BURNS: His 18-hour PBS documentary series "Baseball," for all its 
portentous overkill in seeking out national social meaning, was still more 
interesting than the strike-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
 TV NEWS REPORTERS: Shame on those who, during the Haitian crisis, casually 
parroted the military-speak term "collateral damage." Translation: Civilians 
could be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 HELEN HUNT: If you have to ask why, you're a wimp. A real heir to the Carole 
Lombard style, Hunt is much better than her series, "Mad About You." 
</P>
<P>
 DAN RATHER: Sometimes corny and erratic, he's still the top and most dramatic 
network anchor to watch in many big stories. His side-by-side interview with 
Haitian military despot Raoul Cedras right after President Clinton's speech, as 
an invasion seemed imminent, was one of the year's most vivid TV moments. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK PAAR: Simply a television legend, as great as anybody in the medium. 
Check out his work when the New York-based Museum of Television & Radio opens 
its West Coast branch in Beverly Hills in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSEANNE: If there was ever a dumber idea than making a television movie about 
her life, I can't think of it -- so naturally the networks produced two such 
films. And viewers fled. Surprise, surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAIRE DANES: The teen-age star of ABC's "My So-Called Life" is a real find, 
with an ethereal mystique that is reminiscent of the young Mia Farrow. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT STACK: Somewhere, he discovered the fountain of youth. It's an unsolved 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID LETTERMAN: The trick now is to somehow set all that high energy at a 
comfortable level so that it wears well with audiences for years to come -- or 
else, watch out for Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 BRUCE MORTON: The former CBS reporter's Election Night analysis for CNN 
illustrated exactly what his old network has given up for glitz in its once 
matchless news department. 
</P>
<P>
 LEONARD GOLDENSON: The master builder of ABC had the last laugh over rivals 
William Paley of CBS and David Sarnoff of NBC. When Goldenson was struggling 
with his young network, Sarnoff had the arrogance to suggest to Goldenson "that 
you take the best programs off CBS and NBC, after we play them, and show them 
on ABC." Now ABC is the premier network in comedy, news and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 KIRK GIBSON: We'll never forget that homer, no matter how many years pass. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE ALLEN: A life well spent.

COURTING SUCCESS; ONLY A NARROW ROAD LEADS FROM HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TO THE

MIFFLIN: $19.95; 231 PP.) ; FALL RIVER DREAMS: A TEAM'S SEARCH FOR A TOWN'S

<P>
 America is raining jump shots again. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school basketball season officially tipped off this month, and few 
towns anywhere, it seems, fail to embrace this most American of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 A virus known as "Hoosier Hysteria" grips the entire state of Indiana from 
December to March (remember the movie "Hoosiers"?). In Kentucky, grandmothers 
know who the backup point guard is for the local high school . . . and whether 
he can go to his left well enough to shake a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately writers and filmmakers have left the Rockwellian scenes of Middle 
America (basketball hoops nailed firmly to farmhouses, barns and garages) and 
headed to the cities for their basketball dramas. On urban playgrounds 
throughout the United States, the stakes are considerably higher. The boys of 
these 'hoods play first for survival -- and then the chance to escape, to win 
their version of the lottery: a basketball scholarship to a big-time Division I 
college, and the ample opportunities that come with it. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer emotional impact, it's hard to beat "Hoop Dreams," the current 
documentary film that tracks two Chicago teen-agers as they attempt to reach 
their separate goals of basketball greatness, and the promise of a better life 
that goes with it. Gritty and honest, the film is sure to be remembered as one 
of the most revealing portraits ever drawn of just how thoroughly sports can 
consume the lives of kids, especially those with little else to dream about. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not quite as powerful as "Hoop Dreams," two new books offer insightful 
profiles of schoolboy basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy Frey's "The Last Shot," set amid the dreary projects of Coney Island at 
the southern tip of Brooklyn, is a compelling book about basketball's street 
subculture and how profoundly it shapes the chaotic -- and often tragic -- 
lives of the kids who grow up in and around it. The author succeeds in crafting 
a layered story that will appeal not only to die-hard basketball aficionados 
but also to those more interested in how 16- and 17-year-old boys face the 
complexities of life while trying desperately to beat overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fall River Dreams," by Providence Journal-Bulletin sports columnist Bill 
Reynolds, provides in splendid detail (though at times, perhaps too much 
detail) a season spent with the boys basketball team at B.M.C. Durfee High 
School in the hoops-crazy, fading industrial town of Fall River, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 For the players in "Fall River Dreams," there is constant pressure to measure 
up to the greatness of past Durfee teams, whose championship banners hang like 
ghostly reminders on the walls of Luke Urban Field House. Reynolds is at his 
best when he focuses on the tempestuous relationship between Durfee's veteran 
coach and local legend, Thomas (Skippy) Karam and his rebellious star player, 
junior guard Chris Herren. It's a classic generational clash, as Herren tries 
to live up to his own lofty expectations, plus those of his family and college 
recruiters who recognize his natural talent. 
</P>

 "I never had toys," says Herren, who is now a freshman at Boston College. 
"When I was 3 I had a basketball in my hands. A basketball was my toy. I never 
sat around the house playing with toys. I was outside playing a game. Something 
to help you get better as an athlete, not to sit in the house and play with 
dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 There's good stuff here, but in the end the story is not compelling enough to 
hold up the length of a book, especially when it starts recountng the boyhood 
jobs and failed career hopes of Durfee High's longtime official scorekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are often deceiving in the athletic arena, but the bitter truth, as 
Darcy Frey points out, is that of about 500,000 males playing high school 
basketball, less than 1% will receive Division I scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they run, day and night -- on blacktop that is all-too-unforgiving, 
especially on swelteringly humid, 95-degree Brooklyn summer afternoons. For 
most of these kids, the future lurks a few feet away, in the shadows, where the 
drug dealers, gangbangers and assorted hangers-on hold a different kind of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pecking order of the Coney Island projects, the best games are played 
on a court called the Garden -- after Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, home 
of the National Basketball Assn.'s New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also get a game at Chop-Chop Land, so named for the bruises you are 
likely to acquire playing among the less elegant of the local talent; or at 
Run-and-Gun Land, popular among the small fry because of the short courts and 
low rims. But here's the reality of life at Run-and-Gun: Since the court is 
situated below one of the worst projects, players must be alert enough to dodge 
the beer bottles and batteries that sometimes come hurtling out of apartment 
windows 15 stories above. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're good enough, the best players from the Garden will go on to play 
for the Abraham Lincoln High School Railsplitters, traditionally the best team 
in New York's highly competitive Public School Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey tells his story mainly from within the inner circle of Lincoln High's 
three most talented basketball upperclassmen in the summer and fall of 1991: 
Tchaka Shipp, Russell Thomas and Corey Johnson. Another prominent player is 
freshman Stephon Marbury, an electrifying guard whose ball-handling wizardry 
and innate skills have earned him the moniker "future of the neighborhood." 
(Marbury, now a senior, is the consensus choice among college coaches and 
talent evaluators as the finest guard prospect in the country this season; he 
is expected to sign next spring with either Syracuse or Georgia Tech, but will 
probably take a recruiting trip to UCLA.) 
</P>
<P>
 Frey quickly becomes a trusted confidant and friend of the players. His 
observations are at once sensitive and enlightening, and his presence never 
seems disruptive to the kids' already fragile lives. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive one of the coveted big-time scholarships and assure freshman 
eligibility, National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules mandate that besides a 
minimum 2.5 grade-point average in certain designated "core" classes, a high 
school student must also score at least a combined 700 on the math and verbal 
portions of the standardized Scholastic Aptitude Test, or a 17 on the American 
College Test. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, that sounds reasonable -- the national average for all 
college-bound seniors is 800. But given the crowded classroom conditions, 
limited resources to afford test-preparation courses, and constant distractions 
in the learning process at chaotic Lincoln High, plus the grim home life that 
most kids must return to each evening, 700 is often unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's precisely the reason that prominent college basketball coaches such as 
John Chaney of Temple and Georgetown's John Thompson have become outspoken 
critics of the NCAA's controversial Proposition 48, the 1986 amendment that 
established the standardized test requirement. The playing field, they say, is 
simply not level both in the classrooms and in the homes of many students 
across the country who are competing for those scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hard to argue, but the sincerity of college coaches can be questionable 
when it comes to recruiting practices, especially as Frey portrays them during 
the face-to-face meetings with the star prospects at Lincoln High. 
</P>
<P>
 These slick salesmen display a variety of Dale Carnegie approaches; one coach, 
Rick Barnes of Providence College, began his visit by performing a magic trick. 
They stress their undying loyalty, their commitment, their love ; no other 
coach, they argue has the player's best interests at heart. Yet these same men 
are too often the first to jump at whatever higher-priced offer comes along 
from a rival school or the NBA. Then what happens to the commitment made to the 
player during the recruiting process? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a blatant double standard permitted by the NCAA: When players decide to 
transfer from one Division I college to another, they must sit out a full 
season at their new school before gaining eligibility; coaches, however, are 
free to come and go, leaving a string of broken promises on the way to their 
stockbroker's office. 
</P>
<P>
 So who can fault the kids in places like Coney Island and Chicago from 
dreaming those unrealistic dreams, or seeking the quickest and easiest routes 
to fame and fortune?

 It's time for television producers to realize that an important ingredient has 
been missing from many shows -- the theme songs. I enjoy such shows as "The 
Nanny" (CBS) and "Mad About You" (NBC) not only because they are good shows but 
because they have theme songs that I can hum along after the show ends.I 
understand the reasoning behind wanting to throw in some extra commercials, and 
not wanting people to turn the channel, but many of the new shows (without 
theme shows) are low in the ratings. So, people are obviously still turning to 
other stations. There must be a way of having shorter versions of theme songs, 
while still allowing for added show time or commercials.

 With its bright colors, upbeat rock 'n' roll soundtrack and strong ecological 
message, the 1992 animated film FernGully ... The Last Rain Forest (KTTV Sunday 
at 7:30 p.m.) should delight children and amuse their older siblings and 
parents. Set in an unspoiled tract of Australian rain forest guarded by a tribe 
of tiny fairies, the film is based on a series of children's stories by Diane 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The light comic wit of the 1990 Quick Change (CBS Tuesday at 8 p.m.) has a 
lovely premise: a trio of disillusioned New Yorkers -- a city planner (Bill 
Murray), his sweetheart (Geena Davis) and Murray's goofy longtime friend (Randy 
Quaid) -- execute a brilliantly clever bank holdup. The loot: $1 million. Now 
all they have to do to be home free is to get out of New York. With the city 
presented as an urban obstacle course of unmarked streets, wayward subway 
entrances and unfriendly natives, that proves to be easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the stunningly whimsical turtle suits supplied by Jim Henson's 
Creature Shop, the 1991 Teenage Mutant Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (KTTV 
Monday at 8 p.m.), like its predecessor, might just look like it sounds, which 
is pretty tacky. It takes up where the original left off, reintroducing us to 
Michelangelo, Leonardo and Donatello and their rat mentor, Splinter. With 
villains apparently in short supply, the movie resuscitates the monster-mobster 
of the previous movie, the infamous Shredder. 
</P>
<P>
 With his 1992 City of Joy (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m., again on Friday at 2:30 
a.m.), set in Calcutta, Roland Joffe seems under the delusion that you can lure 
in the multitudes with an obvious plot and a hot star while educating them 
about India's downtrodden masses. Patrick Swayze, though miscast, is game as a 
surgeon who by chance meets a poor Indian family and winds up working at a 
public clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1978 Same Time, Next Year (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.) adulterous Alan 
Alda sneaks off with an also-married Ellen Burstyn for an affair that lasts 
only a weekend each year but endures for a quarter-century. This is an obvious 
theater piece, but as adapted by Bernard Slade from his play and directed by 
Robert Mulligan, it has warmth and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mann's riveting 1986 Manhunter (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) offers an 
earlier incarnation of everybody's favorite cannibal -- this time played by 
Brian Cox.

 EVOLUTIONARY MEDICINE: Rethinking the Origins of Disease by Marc Lappe. 
(Sierra Club Books: $30; 255 pp.). One of the great weasel phrases of science, 
as even most scientists will agree, is " . . . provided all other variables are 
kept constant." It's a momentous qualification, for in real life variables vary 
-- almost invariably, one wants to add -- and render true statements inaccurate 
nanoseconds after they've been uttered. That's the issue at the heart of 
"Evolutionary Medicine," although Marc Lappe, a pathologist and director of the 
Center for Ethics and Toxic Substances in Gualala, states it more narrowly; he 
argues that by looking at diseases such as AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., 
in frozen, "snapshot" form rather than as ever-evolving products of an 
ever-changing environment, the medical Establishment has limited its chances to 
eradicate or ameliorate them. One simple fact demonstrates the power of Lappe's 
case: some bacteria can pass through 30 generations in a single day, meaning 
that they can mutate into new, antibiotic-resistant forms almost before the 
physician has turned his back. One problem with modern medicine, Lappe writes, 
is that doctors, being trained to treat individual patients, may worsen the 
health of the species as a whole; by over-prescribing antibiotics, utilizing 
outdated courses of chemotherapy and ignoring viruses' ability to reproduce 
quickly, they end up creating broadly resistant bacteria, cancer cells 
unresponsive to numerous drugs and more potent viruses. There is hope, however; 
perhaps the most fascinating section of the book is Lappe's brief discussion of 
one speculative AIDS treatment, a "controlled selection" in which a patient's 
HIV virus is encouraged to back-mutate into a form susceptible to, say, 
AZT."Evolutionary Medicine" is full of such thought-provoking proposals, but 
most valuable in providing a new lens through which to view intractable medical 
problems. It's only reasonable to think that medicine, itself a product of 
nature, is more likely to make progress working with natural forces rather than 
by bending them to its will.

 MGM POSTERS The Golden Years. Text by Frank Miller. (Turner Publishing Inc.: 
$24.95; 192 pp.). Of film poster books there is apparently no end, but more 
than a reasonable price adds special interest to this lively and colorful 
collection.Because all the work emanates from one studio, and MGM at that, the 
most prosperous and prestigious of the lot, it offers the opportunity for 
different kinds of visual comparisons. It is fascinating to examine the 
campaign book for the great "Camille," for example, and see the different looks 
the studio offered. And while some notable films got posters to match 
("Hallelujah's" Russian constructivist look is a beauty), it is also 
interesting to note the ordinary art attached to things such as "The Wizard of 
Oz," none of whose posters truly scintillates. Kenneth Turan

 GOING TOO FAR ENOUGH: American Culture at Century's End by Henry Southworth 
Allen (Smithsonian Institution Press: $21; 244 pp.). You can't get blood from a 
stone; that means, for the typical writer, you're only as good as your 
subject."Going Too Far Enough," by Washington Post cultural critic Henry 
Southworth Allen, makes that readily apparent, for the essays collected here 
range from the admirable to the trivial. Dealing with the latter first: Who 
wants to read another predictable journalistic take on Zsa Zsa Gabor? Stephen 
Hawking? The Miss America Pageant? The 1980s? Nobody; these pieces should have 
stayed in the morgue (although the last-mentioned essay is almost worth reading 
for the line "there were now so many famous people in America we hadn't heard 
of half of them"). Allen does a much better job with offbeat topics, the kind 
that make newspaper editors roll their eyes. The essay on "tract mansions" is 
devastating if you share Allen's wonderment at those who buy huge, Tara-like 
houses on tiny lots; the article on summer houses is charming, likewise, if 
you've ever been in a lakeside cottage populated with battered Dick Francis 
novels. Allen compares working at the New York Daily News in the late 1960s to 
entering a diorama at the Museum of Natural History; a former Marine, he gives 
loving descriptions of close-order drill, calling military parades Washington's 
answer to Broadway theater. "Going Too Far Enough" is a book to read 
selectively, for although Allen can be a lyrical writer -- he's also an 
award-winning poet -- his subjects often let him down.

 THE FRUIT COCKTAIL DIARIES by Brian Carmody and Gretchen Hayduk (St. Martin's; 
$18.95; 192 pp.). The publisher of "The Fruit Cocktail Diaries" kindly sends 
along with review copies a brief article from Interview in which Brian Carmody 
and Gretchen Hayduk are described as best friends "hoping to find a publisher 
for their book."They did, thanks to the publicity no doubt, and so we now have 
a novel that's been published less for its intrinsic qualities than its 
marketability to a specific audience, namely Generation X. The novel presents 
us with two twentysomething waiters in Manhattan -- she's straight, romantic, 
and confused; he's gay, hard-bitten, and confused -- who have set down their 
thoughts, independently, in identical hard-bound journals which an unknown 
someone has come across in an East Village street market. "The Fruit Cocktail 
Diaries" is a quick, undemanding read, and that's fitting, for it reflects the 
protagonists' self-admittedly shallow existence; she realizes her "great new 
life" consists of little more than "getting sloppy-drunk every night, with 
friends I'm not even sure I like," and he acidly resigns himself to sleeping 
only with "that special someone whom I will have no intention of ever seeing or 
speaking to again." Talent is at work here, but it's equally clear that Carmody 
and Hayduk are destined to be swallowed up by the media machine and promoted as 
spokespeople for their generation rather than encouraged to develop their 
embryonic literary skills. Worse, that's probably exactly what they want, for 
if Gen X has come to understand anything about U.S. culture, it's that glib and 
easy will always beat out complex and challenging.

 THE VIEW FROM MOUNT MORRIS: A Harlem Boyhood by John Sanford (Barricade Books: 
$22; 231 pp.). John Sanford, now 90, between 1939 and 1964 published books with 
Alfred A. Knopf, Harcourt Brace, Doubleday, and W. W. Norton; since 1976 he's 
published a dozen more books, none with a major publishing house. It's 
conceivable that these more recent titles had less merit than his earlier work 
. . . but I doubt it, for if "The View From Mt. Morris" is any indication, 
Sanford is the sort of author publishing houses should support regardless of 
the sales figures. The book is both a boy's eye view of adult life and homage 
to a distant age, an altogether charming collection of portraits from Jewish 
life in Harlem between 1910 and 1920. The author's widowed father, Phil: a man 
of courage and humor who liked to say, "A chip on the shoulder usually comes 
from a wooden head." Phil's brothers-in-law: Uncle Dave, a peripatetic 
Communist who sent cigars and a Panama hat to the imprisoned Eugene V. Debs; 
Uncle Harry, exploitative low-life who ate "as though merely filling a sack 
with sand"; Uncle Romie, who when not being sent away to institutions himself 
-- he was retarded -- sent away for every free sample available through 
magazine coupons. The author's mean-spirited, deeply Orthodox Aunt Sarah: "You 
killed my son! Killed!" she tells Sanford, since he had introduced cousin 
Melvin to his future wife, a Gentile. Natchie Weinstein: tall and clumsy, a 
"lifelong clunchfist" but bright, too, always reading Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, 
thus foreshadowing his future success as Nathanael West.As it turns out, 
neither Sarah nor West is as important to Sanford's story as Aunt Rae, for she 
effectively breaks up the family by convincing the teen-aged John Sanford that 
his father is betraying the boy's dead mother by remarrying. Phil and his 
second wife rent a new apartment . . . but John refuses to join them, Rae 
having alchemized his pain into poison. Sanford's understated guilt over this 
episode give "The View From Mount Morris" shape, substance, feeling, a little 
drama and above all a reason for being -- altogether, much more than you 
typically find in a memoir, and with much less dross.

 GHOSTS IN OUR BLOOD: With Malcolm X in Africa, England, and the Caribbean by 
Jan Carew (Lawrence Hill Books: $24.95 cloth, $14.95 paper; 176 pp.). The 
subtitle of this book is misleading, for Jan Carew spent only a few days with 
Malcolm X, when the Muslim leader was in Britain to give a speech at the London 
School of Economics. Those were important days for Malcolm, however; in the 
previous 14 months he had broken with the Nation of Islam, again traveled to 
Mecca and begun the transformation from angry black American revolutionary to 
angry international statesman . . . an evolution never completed, since Malcolm 
was assassinated in New York less than a fortnight after the London address. 
Carew, director of the Center for the Comparative Study of the Humanities at 
Lincoln University and a native of Guyana, provides some new details about 
Malcolm's Grenada-born mother and his latter-day thinking, but "Ghosts in Our 
Blood," to its detriment, is actually more about Carew than Malcolm X. Those 
who know Carew's work -- he's a novelist and playwright as well as an academic 
-- may be interested in this book, but those who want to know more about 
Malcolm X would be better off reading (or rereading) his classic 
"Autobiography," even if it scants his last, more conciliatory views on race 
and revolution.

COMMENTARY; 'HEAL 'EM AND WHEEL 'EM' -- IS 'ER' MEDICINE REALLY THAT GOOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diagnoses abound concerning "ER," but most draw the same conclusion: This new 
NBC medical drama is the season's best, brightest and most innovative. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cover story, Newsweek spoke of its "adrenaline rush of trauma, pathos and 
heroism," and the tabloid Star agreed that it "keeps viewers' pulses pounding." 
The New York Times weighed in with a theory for the series' epidemic success: 
"the American public's escalating anxieties over health care in the wake of the 
utter confusion and helplessness in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, its ratings speak for themselves. On Dec. 8, "ER," seen Thursdays 
at 10 p.m., not only nabbed its biggest audience yet (20 million viewers and a 
35% share), it beat out every other drama series. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, critics and audience alike are drawn to the well-healed folks of 
"ER." 
</P>
<P>
 But is there more going on here? Is the "ER" phenomenon anything beyond a 
sawbones love-in? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it just may be that "ER's" tonic effect on viewers has little to do with 
medicine and the healing arts. Instead, this series ultimately plays to 
something far more basic: a fascination with speed. "ER" has less to do with 
wellness than velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace is relentless, as one patient after another is whisked through the 
emergency room of this Chicago hospital. Here, "heal 'em and wheel 'em" is the 
modus operandi, and viewers are treated to one case on top of the next, from a 
frat boy who nearly parties himself to death, to a motorist's severed limb: 
"Rescue 7's looking for the rest of his leg," someone says, and indeed it is 
found and reattached. 
</P>
<P>
 No single affliction is dwelled upon too long, nor any resolution long in 
coming. It's all hurry, hurry, hurry as "ER" stays on the run, up this 
patient-stacked corridor and down that, with the Steadicam chasing the action 
all the while. 
</P>
<P>
 Action is primary on "ER." Despite such ongoing B-stories as the doctor's wife 
who's sick of her absentee marriage, the hospital psychiatrist who's losing his 
marbles, the torn-between-two-lovers nurse, along with occasional Hippocratic 
hanky-panky in the supply room or anywhere else with a modicum of privacy, 
extracurricular matters are dealt with only in drips and drabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "ER" concentrates on isolated patients and their respective 
complaints, to the near exclusion of any cohesive narrative thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, what character development there is can be found only in between 
spurts of bodily fluids. Along with Anthony Edwards as the selfless Dr. Mark 
Greene and George Clooney as playboy Dr. Doug Ross, others in the large 
ensemble tackle roles that can be capsulized as depressed, arrogant, wet behind 
the ears. A Medicare form has more heft. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing mechanics rather than humanity, "ER" trades on the notion that 
"graphic" is synonymous for "realistic," and that heroism is primarily a 
function of endurance (these doctors not only can do it all night long, but for 
shifts that go on 36 hours or longer!). 
</P>
<P>
 "ER" glories in its inhuman burdens. What with long hours, low salaries, high 
stakes and overtaxed facilities, the ER life is for life-givers who really 
don't want one themselves. With the medics fueling it, the ER is a contraption 
pressed to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER," then, is like watching cars race at Indy, barrelling around the course 
with speed, precision, racket and the occasional mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, on "ER" the race is run by foot, in sprints from body to body, or via 
gurney, with a doctor astride pounding life back into the patient. The viewer 
never gets an outside look at County General Memorial Hospital. Instead, the 
hallways are what count: "ER" exists as rooms and corridors, where its 
machinery can rip. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the strategy of "ER," and the likely source of its appeal. Most people 
understand neither doctors nor machines, but they like machines far better and, 
of course, feel more control over them. Obligingly, "ER" presents medical 
treatment not as drama but as reliable engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's gorgeously produced and exhilarating to watch. But for a series so 
taken up with blood and guts, "ER" is itself oddly bloodless. This ER is some 
machine. So, for that matter, is this show.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; HOW TO TELL 'SWEET VALLEY HIGH'S' 
TWINS APART FROM THE SISTERS WHO PLAY THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They walk alike, they talk alike and yes, they sure look alike. But on closer 
observation, Brittany and Cynthia Daniels, 18, who play the Wakefield twins on 
the syndicated "Sweet Valley High," are distinguishable from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls will explain. "Cynthia's face is rounder ..." Brittany begins. 
Cynthia, whose eyes are larger, jumps in: "Brittany's is sharper." 
</P>
<P>
 They say they're each 5-foot-7, but add that on some days one or the other may 
seem shorter or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences, they assure, are minor. Their characters, saucy Jessica and 
studious Elizabeth, are way too different for identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just too opposite," Brittany declares during lunch at a downtown Los 
Angeles restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't live in a room with someone for your entire life, look just like 
them and not be very similar," concludes Cynthia. 
</P>
<P>
 When their lunches arrive, Cynthia wrinkles her nose. Perched atop her Caesar 
salad are two delicately crossed anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take it off with your fork and then ask for another fork," instructs 
Brittany. The girls became vegetarians at 13. They have since converted their 
publicist for "Sweet Valley" producers Saban Entertainment, makers of "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The publicist, also lunching, adds that the Daniels' faces -- instead of a 
composite drawing or random blond twin models -- soon will adorn the covers of 
the "Sweet Valley" series of paperback books. There are about 200 books in the 
"Sweet Valley Saga," "Sweet Valley Kids," "Sweet Valley Twins," "Sweet Valley 
High," and "Sweet Valley University" library. The books originally were written 
by Francine Pascal, whose team of writers now puts together tales from her 
story lines. 
</P>
<P>
 All stories focus on the adventures of the popular Wakefield twins who attend 
school in Sweet Valley, a mythical land of sun and fun somewhere on the 
California coast (don't ask why it's called a valley). Valencia doubles as 
Sweet Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 From her New York offices, Pascal says the Daniels "are as if they walked off 
the covers of the books! Oh my God, they're absolutely perfect. None of the 
thousands of twins we saw compared to these two." 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the recent high school grads are actually more like each other's 
characters. "I was the one more into school," says Brittany, who plays 
nasty-edged and wild Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia, who plays more mild Elizabeth, adds, "And I was the one who had a 
wild phase, but wasn't" -- Brittany finishes her sentence -- "ever as nasty as 
Jessica gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the girls have done six roles as on-screen twins (check them out in 
the upcoming feature "Basketball Diaries," starring Leonard DiCaprio), they 
often go up for roles against each other. "We read very different," assures 
Brittany in actor-speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least," Cynthia says, "that's what we've been told." 
</P>
<P>
 Different reads landed Brittany a role in 1992 on the syndicated teen sudser 
"Swan's Crossing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I gave a bad audition," Cynthia says, "but no one was happier than me 
when she got it." The seven-month separation -- Brittany left their 
Jacksonville, Fla., home for the bright lights of Manhattan -- was the first 
time the girls had ever been separated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," says Cynthia decisively, "was the biggest change! When she came back 
we were totally different. I was still into the cheerleader-hanging out scene 
..." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was more mature, like a 30-year-old in a 16-year-old's body, and we 
dressed completely differently," points out Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they agree, things have "evened out." They also agree on a future: 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovered on a beach at 8, the twins were described by their mother to an 
agent as too young for modeling. But at 11 they went on their first job. And 
yes, as they are frequently asked, they were in two Doublemint commercials, but 
just don't call them the Doublemint twins. "We hated being called the Daniels 
twins, even," says Cynthia. "It's like we're not individual people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Valley High" airs Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on KUSI and 11:30 a.m. on KTTV 
. For ages 7 and up.

 A DIFFERENT PERSON: A Memoir by James Merrill (HarperSan Francisco: $14; 271 
pp., illustrated). Growing up with a substantial trust fund (his father was a 
founder of Merrill Lynch), National Book Award/Pulitzer Prize winning poet 
James Merrill could easily have become a dissolute idler. In this lively 
autobiography, he describes his coming of age as a man and an artist, learning 
to accept his homosexuality and developing the discipline to pursue his metier. 
Merrill never lectures or poses. With a poet's subtlety, he recalls travels in 
Europe, love and family relations, and allows the reader to share his discovery 
of his vocation.

 NORTHERN LIGHTS: A Selection of New Writing from the American West edited by 
Deborah Clow & Donald Snow (Vintage: $13; 395 pp., paperback original). These 
essays and poems focus on the remaining open land in Western North America. 
Richard Nelson muses on the names Native Americans applied to various landmarks 
and the heritage their words embody. John Roush contemplates the meaning of the 
wilderness, concluding, "A fully civilized life includes more than law and 
order. It includes mystery, energy, diversity, surprise, and beauty -- the 
qualities that make natural space nourishing and occasionally dangerous."

 DELUGE! The Flood of '94 by the Macon Telegraph, Columbus Ledger-Enquirer and 
Tallahassee Democrat (Andrews & McMeel: $12.95; 96 pp., paperback original). In 
July, 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto struck Georgia, northern Florida and eastern 
Alabama, leaving over 23 inches of rain in 86 hours. The runoff broke dams, 
swamped bridges, flooded towns and inundated farms. Taken from three regional 
newspapers, the stories and photographs in this book provide a day-by-day 
account of the destructive power of water. Readers in Southern California will 
take comfort in fact they live in a desert.

 SHARK! Nature's Masterpiece by R.D. Lawrence, illustrated by Gary Low 
(Chapters: $12.95; 177 pp.) . Sharks fascinate Lawrence, a well-known nature 
writer: Splendidly adapted to life in the sea, they've changed little over 
hundreds of millions of years. They don't get cancer and possess senses humans 
lack that detect microscopic electrical currents and chemical changes in water. 
Lawrence dismisses the media image of bloodthirsty killers, using his personal 
research to strengthen his argument that sharks are merely highly efficient 
carnivores. However, his descriptions of remaining underwater in a steel cage 
while trying to provoke a feeding frenzy may strike the casual reader as more 
foolhardy than scientific.

 IN THE PLACE TO BE: Guy Trebay's New York by Guy Trebay, photographs by Sylvia 
Plachy (Temple University Press: $19.95; 384 pp., paperback original). In these 
collected columns from the Village Voice, Trebay describes the mean streets and 
intersections of New York: "The city is a living organism, someone told me. But 
where is the head?" He refuses to patronize or romanticize his subjects, 
drawing clearly etched, often harsh portraits of junkies, pushers and hookers 
-- and of families trying to lead a semblance of a normal life in neighborhoods 
ravaged by the drug trade. In straightforward prose, he describes desperate 
lives and asks why society allows humans to exist in such squalor.

 LOVE IS HELL by Matt Groening (Pantheon: $9; unpaginated). This newly expanded 
anthology marks the 10th anniversary of Groening's delectably outrageous comic 
strip, "Life in Hell."Although Groening has never been a great draftsman, these 
early cartoons reveal how much his drawing has improved over the years. He was 
always wonderfully keen observer, with an ear for the mindless psychobabble 
that hangs over L.A. like intellectual smog. He's equally unkind to both 
genders, noting such unfortunately familiar types of couples as "I'm With 
Stupid x 2," "Mr. and Ms. Boredom" and "Sourballs vs. the World."

IN CIRCULATION; THE OXFORD AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Ehrenstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all began back in 1992. Fledgling magazine editor Marc Smirnoff, looking 
for contributions to the first issue of his new review of Southern literature 
"The Oxford American," asked John Grisham to write a piece. The best-selling 
author of "The Firm," "The Pelican Brief" and "A Time to Kill" responded with 
"The Faulkner Thing" -- "?? a darkly funny account of his verbal duel with a 
television reporter trying (and failing) to trick the pop mystery novelist into 
calling himself the literary heir to the author of "The Sound and the Fury." (" 
'How do you compare yourself with William Faulkner?' she asked. 'Faulkner's 
dead,' I said, glancing in her general direction but being careful not to look 
at the camera.") Sharp, irreverent and unlike anything its author had ever 
published before, the piece was just what Smirnoff wanted -- almost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some editing on it," the magazine editor recalled, speaking by phone 
from his office in Oxford, Miss. "I made little marks on the manuscript and 
sent it back to John. He made changes and sent it back to me until it became 
the fine little piece it is today. In fact, he liked the way I dealt with it so 
much he asked me to help him with the editing of his novels. We began to have a 
great working relationship. But when he agreed to become the publisher of the 
magazine this past August -- well it pretty much shocked the bees out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't difficult to see what impressed Grisham. In just four issues, "The 
Oxford American" has established itself as one of the brightest periodicals to 
appear on the American literary scene in recent years. Designed -- in 
Smirnoff's words -- "for the intelligent but non-academic general reader," "The 
Oxford American" has offered lively inquiries into sociocultural life and times 
below the Mason-Dixon line by such leading Southern literary lights as Roy 
Blount Jr., Donna Tartt, Willie Morris, Florence King and Barry Hannah. It has 
also featured such first-rate articles as Alan Huffman's re-examination of the 
murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, Steve Vineberg's appreciation of 
Tennessee Williams' little-known play, "Eccentricities of a Nightingale" and 
the lengthiest and most revealing interview film critic Pauline Kael has ever 
given. Altogether it's quite a package coming from an ex-bookstore clerk who 
isn't even from the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Mill Valley, California -- land of hot tubs and Berkenstocks," says 
Smirnoff. He migrated to Mississippi in 1987, partially spurred by his love of 
novelist Eudor Welty: "I'd bought a tape of her reading her short stories. I 
was curious to see whether people really talked that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff worked for the now-defunct "Southern Reader" ("a Village Voice-type 
weekly") before starting "The Oxford Review." "I tried to think about all the 
reasons why a magazine like this would fail, and I could never come up with 
any. We started the whole thing on an investment of about $9,000. I felt it was 
worth it to gamble everything I had on this because I always felt somebody was 
going to back it. Still, John didn't just give us a blank check. He's just put 
us into a position where we can become successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Grisham's investment, beginning with the February issue (which 
includes a photo-essay by William Eggleston and articles on Elvis Presley and 
the Blues) the periodical will begin appearing on a bimonthly rather than 
quarterly basis. As for Grisham's personal involvement, the magazine appears to 
be giving this supremely successful author something on the order of a second 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally we decided that John's role would be fairly easygoing -- reading 
the manuscripts when they came in and telling us what he thought. But he's 
really gotten into it! The last time I talked to him he had all sorts of 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 No, not at all like Faulkner.

GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Book Review section of the Dec. 4 Los Angeles Times contained the most 
malevolent piece of writing I have seen in a long time: "Beware of Holiday 
Kitsch" by Anne Lamott. Throughout the article, the writer proclaims her 
utterly bleak view of existence, in which the Christmas season is "the time 
when death is most visibly apparent in our lives" and books "where things make 
sense and love holds" and in which the past is shown "as it ought to have been" 
give her a chill because they remind us of happier times when "life had not yet 
become a living hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of the piece is to warn us against romantic or sentimental books 
that make us feel happy and cozy, because they will deafen us to the 
unrelenting pain and rage that we are all supposed to feel in these "hard and 
frightening times." The writer would have us believe that an hour spent with a 
coffee table book would lure us into giving up the fight for "what is right, 
for nonviolence and love and the belief that all people are created equal, that 
everyone be regarded with the same degree of respect." (Incongruously, in spite 
of these pleas for tolerance, she manages to sprinkle throughout the article a 
host of irrelevant and vicious slurs upon Republican leaders from Newt Gingrich 
to Ronald Reagan.) 
</P>
<P>
 How is such a malevolent view of life acquired? I believe the answer is 
contained in Lamott's self description as a "left-wing Christian crackpot." She 
has swallowed a double dose of anti-life belief systems: a political philosophy 
that inculcates guilt for ever feeling happy and cozy as long as there is still 
one person somewhere who is hungry or homeless, and a religion that teaches 
true happiness and bliss are experienced only after death and are not to be 
expected in this vale of tears.

 I strongly resent Anne Lamott's expression "old uncle Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 This is insulting to millions of Christians and Moslems. It is also repulsive 
to even nonbelievers who have any respect for other people's views and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Anne Lamott does not like this letter, she is welcome to call it "kitsch."

THE GRINCH TOLD THE TRUTH! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I almost did nothing about Anne Lamott's essay on holiday kitsch. It was so 
real I could defend myself only by shutting my eyes and remaining 
unresponsible.She has fingered the instrument of our wounding, and named the 
pus and flagrant soft tissue. She has described the slow-motion surgery upon 
our sensibilities that has passed for politics, for worship and for narcotizing 
comfort these last 14 years. From her diagnosis, concerning the enthralling 
power of kitsch, the narcissistic refuge it provides, and its idolatrous 
essence, her solution seems to me the only hope: "I have learned that the 
solution is to stay present, tell the truth and feel my feelings and rage my 
rage and cry. Then there is hope, of relief, of feeling cleansed and renewed. . 
. ." Her solution continues into struggling for peace and justice, for 
community and a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to thank Anne Lamott for saying what is so, and saying it so well.

<P>
 Regarding James Salter's informative "Rich in France" (Book Review, Dec. 4): 
</P>
<P>
 Helas , in the introductory sentence of the article the owner of a restaurant 
was called a restauranteur spelled with an "n." 
</P>
<P>
 The mot juste is restaurateur without an "n." It is both a French and English 
word in the same form. 
</P>
<P>
 The root is restaurer (to restore), to repair, to re-establish, to restore 
strength by providing nourishment.The restaurateur is the person providing the 
service; the restaurant is the locale of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The word as spelled in the article appears in no reputable dictionary.

 In the Dec. 4 article "Open Wounds" about pictorial books on the Bosnian 
tragedy, reviewer Charles Simic injects the Serb line and infers them to be 
propaganda since the books show no Serb bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not too long ago that your colleague, Carol Williams, reported on the 
fact that the Serbs have withheld entry to a sizable number of international 
correspondents. Was not Williams included in that number? Also, it has been 
widely reported that the Serbs made no bones about targeting press vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking Simic's "never show what we did" and his "own memories of WWII in 
Yugoslavia," I would ask Simic why Serbia has so carefully over five decades 
nurtured the myth that of all the countries occupied by Germany during that war 
that Serbia alone was immune to collaboration. The myth of Serbia's 
victimization is the vehicle that has fanned the hatred leading to the Bosnian 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose Simic would call the picture of the Serb quisling General Nedic on a 
state visit to Hitler propaganda.

 Regarding "So Many Americans . . . How Shall We Feed Them?", reviews by Philip 
Shabecoff and Marc Lappe (Nov. 27): 
</P>
<P>
 Over-population is a serious world-wide problem. However in the case of the 
United States, which has a population density one-quarter of Europe, it is not 
the apocalyptic disaster as suggested by the book "How Many Americans."We had 
slums and inner-city decay when the population was 150 million. We neglected 
the problem then and we have been neglecting the problem ever since; and as 
usual we find scapegoats for the problem -- this time it is immigration. 
</P>

<P>
 Overpopulation is a popular subject these days and worthy of front-page 
prominence in Book Review. The pieces convinced me that biologist Garrett 
Hardin had worked his way to the bottom line of this subject 20 years earlier. 
He asked the simple but profound question: "How can we control population 
without recourse to repugnant measures?" 
</P>
<P>
 I look forward to reviews of books that answer Prof. Hardin's loaded question.

ROBERT KIRSCH AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That Brian Moore, the winner of the 1994 Robert Kirsch Award, given for a body 
of work by a writer living in or writing on the American West, deserves such an 
award is beyond question; that he is a "distinguished novelist" is equally 
unassailable. But I take forceful exception to the designation by the anonymous 
judge who called him the "only one inescapable candidate" for such an award, as 
quoted by Jack Miles (Nov. 13).Both the anonymous judge and Miles impugn not 
only the many other fine writers living on the West Coast but the West Coast 
itself as a literary center. Would either writer even attempt to designate "the 
most distinguished writer" living on the East Coast? The provincialism that 
dogs West Coast writers is apparent in that rhetorical question.

 Unless you were in high school or college when this classic of misunderstood 
youth was released in 1955, it may well be hard to comprehend James Dean's 
impact upon young people -- who really did want to be understood by their 
elders. Yet the electrifying sense of recognition we experienced in seeing Dean 
in this legendary Nicholas Ray film apparently has not diminished all that much 
for successor generations.And that is something that also could be said about 
Dean's appearances in his two other films, "Giant" and "East of Eden." With 
Natalie Wood (pictured) and Sal Mineo (TNT Tuesday at 5 p.m.).

 Caught in the Mother of All Traffic Jams on the hottest day of the year in Los 
Angeles, Michael Douglas (pictured), with a scowl surgically planted on his 
face, heads west toward the ocean.On a Cook's tour of urban decay, he's passive 
no more. He is Everyman-turned-Terminator, wreaking vengeance for the slights 
of a lifetime on anyone who gets in his way. As written by Ebbe Roe Smith and 
directed by Joel Schumacher, this 1993 release is eager to have it both ways by 
calling attention to pressing urban problems while pandering to a mass 
audience. But it is entertaining. (Cinemax Monday at 9:45 p.m.) Kenneth Turan

CRITIC'S PICK: 'THE STORY OF QIU JU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Wilmington 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eyes opaque, mouth sullen, notably pregnant for most of the movie, Gong Li's 
Qiu Ju (pictured) is wrapped in dowdy farm clothes, playing a stubborn peasant 
woman who carries her case against an equally stubborn village chief. Qiu Ju 
goes all the way from local police to the highest courts.Moviegoers ready to 
sympathize with any individual bucking the system will have a harder time with 
Qiu Ju, whose quest is comic, and whose motives seem increasingly confused or 
petulant. Upset because her husband was kicked in the crotch by the chief, who 
contemptuously refuses to explain his actions, Qiu Ju carries her vendetta past 
self-interest and reason, bullying her way toward a scathingly ironic climax. 
In the process director Zhang Yimou subtly reveals the silliness, incompetence 
and artificiality of vast bureaucracies. (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Michael 
Wilmington

 This 1987 New Zealand film is pure enchantment, a perfect blending of cast, 
setting and story that brings to mind the visual impact of "Days of Heaven" -- 
and could just as easily have been set in the American Midwest during the 
Depression. It's such a familiar tale -- the plight of a pretty young runaway 
of 12 (Greer Robson) and a man (Peter Phelps) in his 20s on the lam -- that 
you're surprised how deeply you become involved.It's amazing how much suspense 
that writer Grant Hinden-Miller (adapting his own novel) and director Sam 
Pillsbury generate over this man's fate and its consequences for his young 
companion. The film's title, by the way, comes from Phelps' slang for sleeping 
out under the stars (KCAL Saturday at 1 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

ON VIEW; WITH HONORS; CBS AIRS THE CROWNING OF LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS AT 
KENNEDY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts" celebrates 
its 17th year on CBS Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour gala hosted by Walter Cronkite honors the lifetime achievement of 
five American artists: actor Kirk Douglas, soul singer Aretha Franklin, 
composer Morton Gould, director Harold Prince and folk singer Pete Seeger. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the participants in the festivities, taped Dec. 4 at the Kennedy Center 
Opera House, are Alan Alda, Jane Alexander, Lauren Bacall, Joan Baez, Michael 
Douglas, the Four Tops, Garrison Keillor, Andre Previn, Arthur Mitchell, Chita 
Rivera, Ron Silver and Tom Skerritt. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and his wife 
Tipper also are in attendance, along with Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy Center Honors were created in 1978 by producer George Stevens Jr. 
and the late Nick Vanoff. "The honorees make every show different," Stevens 
says enthusiastically. "Sometimes you think, 'Gosh. We are going to do this 
again?' And then you get five lives and careers in front of you and it spawns 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Don Mischer points out that the "Kennedy Center Honors" telecast 
(which has won multiple Emmys and the Peabody Award) isn't a conventional 
awards show "in a sense that people compete. There is no way to influence these 
decisions. It's just a different show entirely in its tone. It's wonderful for 
us who work in commercial TV to have the opportunity to do the 'Kennedy Center 
Honors' because it's different and we can do things at a slightly more relaxed 
pace. We can do opera. We can do classical music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy Center board of trustees selects the five honorees from 
recommendations made by an artists committee made up of about 80 people -- 
"from Isaac Stern to Steve Martin," Stevens says. Over the years, the honorees 
have included Stephen Sondheim, Gene Kelly, Arthur Mitchell, Arthur Miller, 
Tennessee Williams, Merce Cunningham, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Ginger Rogers 
and Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, who also founded the American Film Institute, came up with the 
"Kennedy Center Honors" concept. "I always felt that England had its knighthood 
and France had its legion of honor," he explains. "We even did some research on 
how all different countries honor their artists. But clearly, there was no 
recognition for artists here. This is an important occasion. The leadership of 
Washington is in the Kennedy Center on that Sunday night each year. It is a 
reminder of the vitality and the breadth of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mischer directed the first nine "Kennedy Center Honors" and has shared 
producing credit with Stevens since Vanoff's death four years ago. Louis J. 
Horvitz is now the director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have such fun putting this show together," Mischer says. "It is 
really wonderful to have a tradition like this. So much of television is 
skywriting. It is there for a second and disappears. This show is really 
anchored. It is something that is looked forward to by all the people who work 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers talk with the honorees when putting the show together, but won't 
discuss the tributes with them. "Many times an honoree will say, 'Hey, I would 
like it if so and so would perform for me,' " Mischer says. "Last year, Johnny 
Carson had said, 'Ted Koppel is a friend, you might consider asking him,' and 
we did. But in that instance we also booked David Letterman to come and pay 
tribute and we did not let Johnny know about that. That is what is fun about 
producing it -- when you can surprise people and put people on stage who mean 
something to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult aspect of producing the show is completing the film 
tributes on each honoree in the "time you have to mount the show. We do five- 
or six-minute pieces on the lives of each of the honorees. It takes some time 
to collect the material. That work starts immediately after the honorees are 
announced and continues up until the time we tape the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The film tributes, which are written and produced by Sara Lukinson, are 
emotionally anchored, Mischer says. "We try to put a career in an emotional 
context -- why was the work of this artist widely respected? Why was their work 
meaningful to us as a country? It is more than a documentary. The film has 
moments to think and reflect on what is being said or a certain image. They are 
not wall-to-wall narrations. They are not frantically paced." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more esoteric events to be televised on network TV, "The Kennedy 
Center Honors" never has been a real ratings grabber. Both Stevens and Mischer 
are thrilled that CBS has continued to air the specials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been years when the show has kind of struggled to stay on the air 
because it is not a show that lends itself to extremely high ratings," Mischer 
says. "It needs the support of the network to keep it on the air and CBS has 
been great over the years in supporting the 'Honors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts" airs 
Wednesday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

PROFILE; DELANE'S WORLD; 'DAVE'S' WIFE TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING ON A 
HIT SITCOM -- AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 DeLane Matthews wants to set the record straight: She was cast as Beth Barry 
on CBS' popular sitcom "Dave's World" before Harry Anderson was hired to play 
her husband, columnist Dave Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't audition for this," says Matthews, over a cup of coffee in the 
dining room of the cozy Beverly Hills house she shares with her fiance, actor 
Tyrone Power Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hired before he was. Let's make that very clear. It just turned out 
that way. His deal took a little longer to close than mine. I was signed on and 
he was still making decisions. He lives out of state and I think after 'Night 
Court' he was really interested in not coming to L.A. for a while. So he has 
either got the bug really bad or he couldn't pass it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on a hit TV series is a real change of pace for the Florida native, who 
previously appeared in the short-lived comedy series "Joe Bash," "Eisenhower & 
Lutz," "FM" and "Laurie Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Matthews says, there are pressures involved in being on a hit series. 
"Obviously, you trade one pressure for another," she explains. "But I prefer 
this pressure, keeping the ratings high, maintaining what we have and growing. 
Previously, it was desperately trying to achieve what I have now. It's a 
different pressure, and I pick this one. You don't really ever truly relax. 
..." 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of "Laurie Hill" was especially painful for Matthews. The ABC 
sitcom, the brainchild of "Wonder Years" creators Neal Marlens and Carol Black, 
premiered in the fall of 1992 in the cushy time slot after "Home Improvement." 
Matthews played the title role, a pediatrician trying to juggle career and 
family. The series, though, didn't hold the "Home Improvement" audience and was 
soon canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was unique about 'Laurie Hill' was that I was the lead in that, but I 
wasn't the star," she says. "Carol Black and Neal Marlens were the stars. I was 
never consulted about anything. I just played Laurie Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Matthews says, she was more devastated after it was canceled than she 
had been with her other series' demises. "Maybe it was an accumulation of 
devastation or maybe because I was Laurie Hill and it was hard not to take that 
a bit personally. It is really great to be on a hit show so people won't maybe 
associate failed shows with me." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Laurie Hill," though, "the issue I was dealing with was how much I had 
left to give. I don't have as much to give emotionally to the industry as I 
used to. It is probably better this way. I am tremendously lucky to have had 
all of these opportunities, but then to have them fall apart was so 
disappointing. I wouldn't have changed anything about it now because if it 
would have happened sooner, I probably wouldn't have been ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Matthews a while to feel comfortable in Beth's shoes. When she views 
the pilot episode of "Dave's World," she says she's dissatisfied with her take 
on Beth. "Now, I feel completely comfortable about it," she adds, especially 
since the writers have discovered they "love it when I get angry -- when Beth 
gets a bit miffed. It creates pretty comic situations. They found it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews also believes that Beth may seem more sensible than Dave, but in 
reality she's just as much of a big kid as her husband. "I want to make it 
clear (to the writers) as possible that Beth is a kid, too. What I don't want 
to happen is that I find myself being the one who always puts the kids to bed, 
who always is responsible for the meal being prepared. That bores me to death. 
I like it that Beth and Dave are equally inept, but in different areas." 
</P>
<P>
 During her break last summer, Matthews made the CBS movie "The Women of Spring 
Break," which is scheduled to air Jan. 10. Matthews, Shelley Long and Mel 
Harris play three friends who reassess their lives when they travel back to the 
vacation spot where they shared a spring break years before. Matthews plays a 
recent divorcee. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the film was a "wonderful experience" for Matthews. "Shelley and Mel 
were great to work with. You never know what to expect. The most you hope for 
is a good working environment, but to work with people that you really like -- 
it is ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Her character, Matthews says with a laugh, is "the gamut gal. My character 
goes from stricken grief to exuberant joy and we do that primarily with 
hairstyles -- just really down (in the beginning) to fluffy and high." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting has been Matthews' life since she was 15. "I remember seeing Sidney 
Poitier in 'A Patch of Blue' at about 12 or 13 and I wanted to be like him," 
she says, laughing. "So go figure that one out. When I was 15, the drama coach 
at high school asked me to play Alice in 'Alice in Wonderland' probably because 
I had long blond hair parted down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly discovered that theater was her wonderland. "That was it," recalls 
Matthews, who worked several years in off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway theater 
before Hollywood beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started taking classes in college when I was in high school and couldn't 
get it fast enough. I was tremendously focused to the point of being boring for 
10 years and found a way to change the subject (from acting) at about 25. I 
started with the weather and then progressed to: 'Have you seen any movies 
lately?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave's World" airs Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS.

RETRO; A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MODERN ATOMIC AGE FAMILY; TBS AIRS 24 HOURS OF 
'LEAVE IT TO BEAVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 TBS has a great cure for those post-Christmas blues: a visit with the 
Cleavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that a very long visit with June, Ward, Wally and the Beaver. Ted 
Turner's cable network is devoting the entire 24 hours of its programming 
Tuesday to one of the most well-remembered family sitcoms of the late 
1950s-early '60s, Leave It to Beaver. Forty-eight episodes are scheduled to be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
 So set the VCR or sit in front of the tube. Pull up a TV tray laden with 
peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, a dish of macaroni and cheese, some primo 
meatloaf and mashed potatoes and a glass of Ovaltine. And check out such blasts 
from the past as "Wally's Girl Trouble," "The Clubhouse," "Beaver's Short 
Pants," "Lumpy Rutherford," "Beaver's Old Friend" and "Beaver's Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 TV viewers got their first glimpse of Theodore Cleaver, a.k.a., the Beaver, 
when "Leave It to Beaver" premiered Oct. 4, 1957, on CBS. The heartwarming 
sitcom looked at life through the eyes of a young boy. Beaver (Jerry Mathers) 
was just 7 when the series began; his older brother, Wally (Tony Dow), was 12. 
Though the Cleavers lived in a big house, the two boys shared a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Billingsley played their nice, sweet, understanding mom, June; Hugh 
Beaumont was their equally understanding dad, Ward. Unlike that other '50s TV 
dad, Ozzie Nelson, Ward Cleaver actually had a job in the suburban town of 
Mayfield: He was an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaver's three most trusted friends were Larry (Rusty Stevens), Whitey 
(Stanley Fafara) and Gilbert (Stephen Talbot). Diane Brewster played Beaver's 
teacher, Miss Canfield, in the first season. Sue Randall joined the series in 
the second season as Miss Landers, whom she played until 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally's friends were a pretty strange bunch. Frank Bank played Wally's rotund 
friend Clarence (Lumpy) Rutherford. (Ward Cleaver worked for Lumpy's dad.) Ken 
Osmond stole every scene he was in as the slick bully Eddie. He'd always turn 
on the charm when he came to the Cleaver house by saying, "Good evening, Mr. 
and Mrs. Cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
 The series aired from 1957 to 1958 on CBS and then moved to ABC in the fall of 
1958, where it continued until Sept. 12, 1963. Though the show has lived in 
syndication for the past three decades, "Beaver" never cracked the Top 25 
series when it originally aired. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the series ended, Beaver was about to enter his teens and Wally 
was on his way to college. But that was not the last time TV audiences saw the 
Cleavers. The surviving members reunited in 1983 for the CBS movie "Still the 
Beaver." The reunion was so popular that the Disney Channel created the new 
series "Still the Beaver," which aired from 1985 to 1986. TBS picked up the 
series, retitled it "The New Leave It to Beaver," and it lasted until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 24 Hours of 'Leave It to Beaver' " airs from 3:05 a.m. Tuesday to 3:05 
a.m. Wednesday on TBS.

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT

 GERI ALLEN 
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty One" 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Note Records  
</P>
<P>
 Until very recently, 37-year-old Geri Allen was one of the best-kept secrets 
in jazz, a pianist honored and respected by musicians but not especially 
well-known to the wider audience. But gigs with Ornette Coleman, Betty Carter 
and Wallace Roney in the last year and a half have dramatically increased her 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 This new release should generate even more attention. Allen's previous two 
Blue Note albums signaled her capacity to take a place in the line of 
world-class jazz pianists. With "Twenty One," she shows every indication of not 
being satisfied until she can move to the very front of that line. 
</P>
<P>
 Her approach to the jazz piano trio has many of the qualities present in the 
classical piano trio. Both ensembles balance the timbrally rich, orchestralike 
piano against other, more tonally limited instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many jazz pianists deal with the disparity by taking a path of least 
resistance, using bass and drums as accompanists rather than full-fledged 
musical creative associates. But with this particular trio -- which is 
enormously aided by the presence of Ron Carter on bass and Tony Williams on 
drums -- Allen takes the classically oriented route of conceiving music that is 
structured around an equal and continually unfolding interaction among the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, of course, not necessarily a new approach. The Bill Evans trios of 
the '60s and '70s virtually defined the process of symbiotic trio 
improvisation. What Allen, Carter and Williams add to the style here is a 
surging rhythmic energy that was not always present in the Evans musical 
lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
 Pieces such as "RTC," "Tea for Two" and "Feed the Fire" are driven forward, 
not simply with great urgency, but with the kind of subtle but relentless 
rhythmic flow that allows players to improvise with a sense of floating on top 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen is clearly having a ball, producing solo after solo articulated with the 
crisp confidence of an artist who has finally found her voice. As always, 
Williams is astonishing, constantly adding propulsive flashes of snare, 
insistent undercurrents of bass drum and dramatic shivers of cymbals in a way 
that supports, rather than intrudes upon, the unfolding of the group 
improvisation. And Carter, freed for once of the obligations of being a leader, 
plays some of his finest choruses of recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

<P>
 It wasn't his clothes, one of those easy outfits that was born worn and 
comfortable. Navy blue cotton polo. Corduroys without a belt and deck shoes 
without socks. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the place or his pose. Alone on a bench, on a pier, relaxed but not 
hunching and with legs straight out the way cats stretch after hard play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eyes. They held calm. They were blue when he turned to the ocean, 
deep brown when looking at the beach and pure gold in sunlight; the eyes of 
both a wise elder and an unfearing child; the places where the best smiles 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Where everything else seemed wrong, these were the right eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I don't even own a pair of red socks," he says. With a good grin. 
"But then in Denmark they think I wear gray. In Holland it is a bishop's black 
robes and I ride a white horse. I've been dressed in green with britches and a 
full fur coat with broad-brimmed hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Papa Noel , Knecht Ruprecht, Jultomten, Pere Noel, Pelznickel, Ru-Klaus, 
Weihnachtsmann and Julenissen."  
</P>
<P>
 But still Santa Claus? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yes," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why all the identities? And why no Shredded Wheat whiskers? 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it has to do with me being whoever and whatever you perceive me to 
be," he explains. "In your case, you don't really trust men in suits and ties. 
You're a little too cultured for white whiskers and belly laughs. But you do 
find believability in an easy nature. So you see me in a polo shirt and cords. 
Would you have spoken to me if I'd decided to wear a 49ers jacket? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all ages and if you speak Russian, so do I. Whether you live in Berlin or 
Seattle, I can be in all places at once. You picked this pier and this ocean 
because it's where you dream a little easier. That works for me. Did you know 
that off-season I'm the patron saint of mariners?" 
</P>
<P>
 He's also believed to be at least 1,600 years old, born Nicholas of Bari in 
what would become Turkey. He was a bishop with a reputation for generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's all it was, a blessing here, a visit to a sick parishioner there," 
he recalls. "Then the miracle makers took over and suddenly I'd given dowries 
to three women to save them from the streets, tossed bags of money at the poor 
and become a first-round draft choice to be St. Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty impressive stuff -- especially if you were planning a religion with a 
festival in search of a mascot." 
</P>
<P>
 So 800 years ago the festival of Christmas and the character of St. Nicholas 
formed a partnership that survived even the Reformation. In Dutch he became 
Sinterklass . Which the British picked up and chewed into Santy Klass before 
spitting out as Santa Claus . 
</P>
<P>
 "Also La Befana in Italy and Baboushka in Russia and Father Christmas wherever 
English is heard and the Magi wherever Spanish is spoken," he says. "And I'm 
the patron saint of a thousand churches, entire countries, trade guilds, 
fraternities, unmarried women, merchants and pawnbrokers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how pawnbrokers got in there." 
</P>
<P>
 His intention, he continues, was to remain a doer of good deeds, a fuzzy 
figure focused by individual minds. But poets, authors, cartoonists and even 
the designer of Coca-Cola mugs wouldn't leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought in reindeer and sacks of toys, milk and cookies and falling down 
chimneys," he says. "Now I'm supposed to eat Oreo cookies and clean up crumbs 
with a Dirt Devil. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had me smoking a church warden's pipe, which really upset the Lung 
Association. They have me living at the North Pole, married and working all 
year in a workshop where I sort mail and employ only the vertically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what the hey. I'm this abstraction, right, a spirit of giving and 
something you can't see or hold. If giving me a friendly, harmless shape makes 
me real in a billion minds, then I am real. 
</P>
<P>
 "And life certainly becomes easier to handle if we accept that once upon a 
time is right now and we should believe in ghosts, tooth fairies, leprechauns 
and Simba. And there are worse images to wear than doofus glasses and an eggnog 
belly. Imagine being the Easter Bunny." 
</P>
<P>
 But he does not embrace all characterizations. Santa Claus is not Richard 
Attenborough or Tim Allen. The only miracle on 34th Street is finding a cab. 
Hollywood, he fears, has done for Santa Claus and Christmas what it did to the 
American cowboy and Elliott Ness. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not endorse the PC Santas who have surfaced on E-mail and grant every 
request via Prodigy. Or overeating, driving under the influence, stores open 
until midnight, no interest payments until February, plastic assault rifles, 
proud trees killed for the season, calling Tiffany's on a cellular phone, any 
gift that used to be an animal or public school policies reshaping Christmas 
pageants into "winter programs." Or "Jingle Bell Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Dickens did well with Ebenezer Scrooge," he says. "Repentance, 
generosity and sharing in one man. Nice premise. And I can live with 2,875 
clones ringing bells for the Salvation Army, Toys for Tots and Christmas for 
Caring." 
</P>
<P>
 But he believes couples miss the point when he spends $400 on cashmere for her 
and she spends $300 on leather for him and neither spares anything, not even a 
thought, for hungry kids sleeping in Downtown doorways. Does it occur to anyone 
that a silk bow on a Cadillac in a Beverly Hills showroom is a little tacky 
when innocents are being shelled in Bosnian basements? 
</P>
<P>
 "But hear this," he says. There's the sailor coming out again. "I'm willing to 
bet that today, nobody will be killed in Bosnia. Or in Northern Ireland, Haiti 
or the Gaza Strip. The Titanic didn't sink on Dec. 25. I kept the Chicago Fire, 
the Northridge Earthquake and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre from ruining 
anyone's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my gift to you every Christmas: a moment of love, an example of 
generosity and a day of devotion that precludes pain and tragedy. And that's 
the spirit of Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
 He claims he used his power to bring the Pilgrims to a safe landing at 
Plymouth Rock on Christmas Day, 1620. And, in 1899, to deliver a handsome boy 
to Mr. and Mrs. Bogart of New York City. They named him Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, my best work was getting Francis Church together with Virginia 
O'Hanlon," he says. "She was the 8-year-old who wrote to the New York Sun 
almost 100 years ago and asked if I really existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is completely off the record, but I dictated Church's reply: 'Yes, 
Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. The most real things in this world are those 
that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the 
lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can 
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives and he lives forever. A thousand years 
from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will 
continue to make glad the heart of childhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And while gladdening hearts, Santa would like to dump the notion that the day 
after Christmas is the start of another 364-day run of relentless ambition and 
killer competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to make like a saint," he suggests. "But why not one small act 
of Christmas each day? Light a candle for someone. Carry a Milk Bone for the 
next dog you see. Smile at a stranger. Support the Clippers. Put a quarter in 
an expired parking meter. Let a bug go free." 
</P>
<P>
 He sighed. Not in sadness, but from the downloading of Christmas Eve and 
surviving a million materializations to best monitor the season while hovering 
whenever, wherever there was need. 
</P>
<P>
 And all the time fretting a thought that although he is a vivid representation 
of Christmas, Santa Claus is but an accidental icon of Christianity. The 
Reformation saw to that. Hence his non-religious title of Father Christmas in 
Britain, Servant Rupert in Germany and Pere Noel in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work certainly overlaps the work of any Almighty, whomever he or she may 
be," he acknowledges. "But selflessness, sense of family, pacifism, virtue, 
honesty, loyalty, kindness, generosity, understanding, tenderness and 
thankfulness were human qualities long before they became religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And before they became, incidentally, the beliefs of all religions." 
</P>
<P>
 He stood and said it was time. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long month and there is much to catch up on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hanukkah may be done, but I'm still going to light a menorah," he says. "You 
got a problem with that? So put a lump of coal in my stocking." Biography

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A GIFT THAT SUSTAINS THE BODY AS WELL AS THE SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 9 a.m. today, the big new kitchen will come to life: Chefs will scurry 
around in white jackets directing a dozen volunteers who will peel and chop and 
stir and ladle. 
</P>
<P>
 By 11:30 a.m., the first meals will be packed up and ready to go: ham, 
marshmallow yams, peas with pearl onions in cream sauce, wild rice with 
currants, cabbage and braised apples, greens with cherry tomatoes, broccoli 
florets and trifle. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1 p.m., the food will have been dispensed to volunteers who will take it -- 
in their own cars, trucks and vans -- to South Central, West Hollywood, Granada 
Hills, East L.A. They will tote the meals up rickety flights of stairs into 
smoke-stained apartments, up fancy elevators to designerly townhouses, down 
little walkways into neatly kept bungalows, and along blacktopped driveways to 
red brick duplexes. Sometimes the food will be delivered into the arms of a 
grateful person, other times it will be left on a counter for someone too sick 
to leave bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the kitchen, there will be a lull after this, as volunteers and 
staffers break for coffee and a snack. 
</P>
<P>
 And by late afternoon, Project Angel Food will be busy again, as preparations 
begin for Monday's meals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a remarkably simple concept, and as it turns out, a remarkably 
successful one. The idea was to feed homebound people with AIDS. Beginning five 
years ago in a Methodist church with a handful of clients, Project Angel Food 
has grown like a weed. Nowadays, 17 staffers and 900 volunteers feed almost 700 
men and women out of a new building on Sunset Boulevard near Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has overcome management conflicts, growing pains and bad press to 
become one of the city's most visible AIDS charities. Its budget has blossomed 
from nearly nothing to $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say compassion fatigue? On Christmas Day, at least 100 more 
volunteers than usual will help. Many others will be turned away. ("Come back 
next week," they've been told in the past. "That's when we'll really need 
you.") 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has a few simple rules for volunteers, addressing mostly routine 
issues such as scheduling and hygiene. But some are unique to the work: To 
protect client confidentiality, volunteers are asked not to wear PAF T-shirts 
while delivering food. They are asked to identify themselves as "a friend" of 
the client if neighbors ask and to destroy the detailed route sheets issued 
with each run. 
</P>
<P>
 You could call Project Angel Food a fashionable charity -- its benefactors are 
some of the biggest names in Hollywood -- but so what? Glitzy generosity and 
desperate need make perfect companions. Everybody gets something; the trade-off 
is a fine one. 
</P>
<P>
 And how can you argue with the work? 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the occasional church has refused to help "people like that," 
said Executive Director John Gile, "but not very many people turn us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all the good vibes, though, the downside of the operation is pretty 
harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be very sad," said Gile, "We lose clients every week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's the part that hurts, the part that really gets to Jeanette Bird, a 
69-year-old former dental office employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird and her husband, Jerry, 70, have been delivering food for Project Angel 
Food every Tuesday for a couple of years. Jerry drives; Jeanette delivers. The 
arrangement suits their temperaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, they packed their plush Dodge van with eight meals and eight 
poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette recalled one client, who was, she said, "the loneliest person I ever 
heard of. He had friends, but they were so afraid of AIDS that he just dropped 
them. He really had nobody. I used to spend time with him until I nearly choked 
to death because he was such a chain smoker. He lived in one little room, no 
kitchen, just a little fridge and microwave. And we lost him last week." 
</P>
<P>
 She said this sadly, but matter-of-factly. The Birds have lost at least six of 
their clients since they began delivering meals. Death is a fact of life with 
this gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette maneuvered a labyrinth of hallways in one of those big West Hollywood 
garden apartments. She is greeted at the door by a client, who waits in his 
elegantly furnished apartment, a huge spray of flowers behind him in the entry. 
He invites her in, they exchange pleasantries, then hug goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope you get what you want for Christmas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles and shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is my health." 
</P>
<P>
 At the last apartment, at the top of a narrow flight of stairs, a handsome 
middle-aged man peeked around his door as Jeanette handed him lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never heard so heartfelt a thank-you. 
</P>
<P>
 The gratitude in his voice was as palpable as the hot meal in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as filling.

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: IT'S BEEN A VERY GOOD YEAR -- FOR GOSSIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COMPILED BY THE SOCIAL CLIMES STAFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 1994 comes to a close, once again your Social Climes reporters weary of 
being party animals and become reflective. We hang up our tuxes, evening gowns 
and black Lycra bodysuits, swear off mushroom polenta and micro - brewery beer 
and reminisce about our evenings out. Here are some of the highlights -- and 
lowlights -- of the year gone by. * 
</P>
<P>
 Best New Fund-Raiser: Face it, we've been warehoused in a gigantic hotel 
ballroom eating chicken with gelatinous gravy and listening to endless speeches 
just one time too many. That's why we were so appreciative of the "Art of the 
Palate" dinners in October, 46 soirees held over two nights to benefit the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. They ranged from a party at the "Psycho" mansion 
at Universal Studios to a back-yard barbecue to an intimate formal dinner in a 
penthouse. The $200,000-plus raised allowed the museum to open again on 
Tuesdays. Event planners, are you taking notes? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Line: Robin Williams guarantees absence of tedium for any black-tie 
banquet. Entertaining at the Weizmann Institute dinner at the Beverly Hilton in 
October , Williams played Dan Quayle as Forrest Gump. Said the faux Quayle , 
"Life is like a box of chocolates -- you just have to buy it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Idiotic Interview Question: "Grace, do you have any idea how the Simpson 
case will affect people in the entertainment industry?" a microphone-wielding 
reporter asked with penetrating intensity of rocker Grace Slick at the June 
premiere of "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Gump: The cleverest party among the few still imprinted in our 
short-term memory is the Gump premiere, a bash involving shrimp, Ping-Pong, 
gospel and hordes of hugging and kissing rival studio executives, including 
Columbia-TriStar Pictures Chairman Mark Canton, whose wife, Wendy Finerman, 
produced the film for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movie Star Philosophers: What could be a better time than Oscar night for 
sorting out the meaning of life, especially for those who didn't win? In March 
at the Governors Ball, the Academy's official bash, double nominee (but no 
Oscar) Emma Thompson said she wasn't depressed. "I'm 34, I'm from England and 
I'm not stupid," she said. Liam Neeson, also an empty-handed nominee, reflected 
on the awards evening at the party thrown by Vanity Fair and producer Steve 
Tisch. "It was great fun," he said, "but now it's back to reality. These 
clothes turn into rags in 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compliment Nonpareil: "I love Ann Miller's hair!" cried a guest at the 
premiere of "That's Entertainment III" in April. "It looks like a fabulous 
black croissant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Well-Behaved Audience: With Prince Charles attending the premiere of 
"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" last month, the locals were on their best 
behavior. They came early. They were seated as protocol dictates before His 
Royal Highness arrived. They sat quietly through every creeping inch of the 
credits. "It was the most sedate group I'd ever seen after a screening," one 
woman said. "It was a combination of all that death and all that prince." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then There's Our Own Prince: At the first VH-1 Honors in June, there was 
discussion of how to address "the artist formerly known as Prince." Ellen 
DeGeneres said she would call him "Formerly." A member of his entourage said, 
"We call him 'him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forget New Year's Eve: 1994 found Ash Wednesday to be a hot social night. On 
Feb. 16, there were hardly enough mega-stars to go around. Among the evening's 
events was a 25th-anniversary screening -- with Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight 
-- of "Midnight Cowboy" to celebrate the classic's re-release. Simultaneously, 
the Laker wives premiered "Blue Chips" with a bunch more movie and sports 
stars, and Barbra Streisand was on hand for a reception preceding Christie's 
auction of her castoff possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like, Totally Connected: While we've pretty much gotten used to seeing people 
on cellular phones in their cars, at restaurants and at the grocery store, some 
still have the power to turn our heads -- such as the guy we spotted 
phone-to-ear as he tossed out buckets of trash at a local recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moment: Publicists at the party for the American Comedy Awards in 
March brazenly rearranged place settings so their clients would get better 
camera time by being seated next to someone more famous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statements: At the September premiere of "Jason's Lyric," Pepa, of the 
rap group Salt 'N' Pepa, turned heads in a rubber, fuchsia and pink halter 
mini-dress. The outfit fits ultra skintight, which means body powder is 
required to slide it on. It also needs a special spray to gloss the rubber. 
"It's a package deal," Pepa said. "You get the dress, the powder and the spray 
-- then you are ready! " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, now: On the eve of the closing of the I. Magnin stores, at a party at the 
Pasadena store in November, a woman was heard to bitterly lament, "This is 
turning into a Third World Country. We're all going to have to shop at Target." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: As she watched the talent agents mingle among the doctors at UCLA's 
School of Medicine Aesculapians Ball in October, a guest said: "What they've 
got in common is, they both know where the jugular is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Silent Auction '94: At the Los Angeles Police Department's 125th-anniversary 
gala Oct. 6, a .38 Colt Detective Special was up for bid. It's not often one 
sees a gun laid out on a table at a black-tie dinner. One officer wrote a note 
on a bar napkin saying: "Please do not remove pistol from display case." This 
seemed like a good idea. With about a zillion cops standing close by, this was 
not the place to be waving a .38 around. It sold for $500. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Press Release We Couldn't Quite Finish: "Dozens of Marilyn Monroe and James 
Dean Look-Alikes to Descend on the joint opening of Rally's Hamburgers Inc. 
double drive-through restaurant and the new Unocal 76 retail station in 
Lakewood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TV Syndication 101: At the 100th-episode party for NBC's "The Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air" in September, co-star Joseph Marcell explained it all. "Syndication 
means your ex-wife knows the check will be coming regularly. It means you can 
be dead, buried and forgotten and the checks keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Party 101: "I'm 50," said actor Max Gail at the Museum of Television 
& Radio's 11th festival in March. "I've got four kids. I see braces coming. I 
see college coming. I figure I better do some networking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Outrageous Star Behavior: At the grand opening of the House of Blues in 
May, headliner James Brown was piqued when a scheduled press conference was 
late. With his formidable entourage in tow, he stormed out of the club and 
ended up buying boots at the nearby Paris Go store. Then Brown wanted to go on 
to dinner, but was persuaded to return to the club to do his gig. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Star Behavior: At the American Comedy Awards in March, hard hats were 
placed on each seat, apparently an earthquake-readiness party favor. According 
to the evening's producer George Schlatter, Jack Nicholson left the party with 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Idea Most Worthy of a Ballot Initiative: "I want a six-month moratorium on 
black Lycra," one woman said at the premiere of "Corrina, Corrina" in August. 
"This town needs it for its own sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We Think We Know What He Meant: "There are more publicists than people here 
tonight," said PR-adept Howard Bragman at the premiere of "The Mask" in July. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Blue: Allegra Yust likes tradition so much that this past summer, she took 
on the Los Angeles Blue Book, the hoary Society Register of Southern 
California, when its previous publisher retired. But Yust isn't any stodgy 
blueblood, although her family's been listed in the book for years. She's 25, 
reads Wired magazine and goes to the Viper Room. Although we don't think she'll 
radically alter the nature of the register, we hope she'll give it what it 
needs -- an infusion of new names, representing current L.A. movers and shakers 
who will shape the city during the next millennium. You go, girl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just Switch to Plastic, Please: "Earthquake registration." Yes, we couldn't 
help hearing those words as we were milling through the china and crystal 
department at Bullock's in Century City not long after Jan. 17. Just like 
brides- and grooms-to-be, quake victims were logging their choices in the 
store's computer, a saleswoman informed us brusquely, as if the whole thing 
were perfectly normal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ubiquitous: What a year for O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro, and we 
don't mean just in court. He and his wife, Linell, became omnipresent social 
animals. We knew we weren't imagining seeing the dashing duo night after night 
on the party rounds when we overheard this, from an eye-rolling publicist, as 
the Shapiros emerged at a bash in November: "He goes to the opening of every 
(bleep)-ing door. He was even at the Stones concert." * 
</P>
<P>
 Say What? We're bewitched by what may be our favorite book title of 1994: 
"Radical Honesty: How to Transform Your Life by Telling the Truth" from 
Sparrowhawk Publications. We didn't know truth was a radical concept. Is this a 
Hollywood thing? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could We Just Mail Our Check? "We are having a fund-raiser we think you might 
be interested in covering," wrote the Barry Manilow Fan Club in November. "This 
weekend, members of our club from all over Southern California are getting 
together for the Barry-a-Thon. We will be watching Barry Manilow videos for 24 
hours. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: What would be a year in the late 20th Century without Madonna 
sightings? At the premiere of "With Honors" in April, Madonna wore an outfit 
that suggested a harem dancer as seen by Vogue magazine: thick silver 
bracelets, a turquoise and magenta tight cropped top, bare midriff and a 
matching diaphanous silk skirt. "It was a Jasmine costume," assured the mother 
of a 3-year-old "Aladdin" fan.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider This Dissed: At the American Comedy Awards, unimpressed guest John 
Larroquette commented, "It's one of the great award shows. Right up there with 
'The Jackson Family Honors.' "

FATHERS ALSO FEELING THE CUSTODIAL PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Tales of Move-Away Parents Need Happy Endings" (Dec. 14): Why does Robin 
Abcarian always insist on taking custodial issues purely from the female 
perspective? Custody and visitation limit both parents, not just women who wish 
to move away to a new life or a new job. This goes with the territory of a 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation being discussed by Abcarian would not be necessary if she and 
other women were to take a more open view on custodial arrangements. They need 
to acknowledge that not all men are interested solely in a visitation 
arrangement. There are many men who wish to remain fully and actively involved 
with their children on a day-to-day basis after a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the woman Abcarian cited who has not realized her dream of a doctorate 
because her ex bonded with their children, I say, too bad. The children come 
first. The man should be commended for forging a relationship with his children 
and fulfilling his responsibility as a parent.  
</P>
<P>
 Big-time child-support payments, phone calls, extended visits and letters 
don't cut it. Fathers are needed, and we will go to court to protect our 
rights. Joint custody evens out the limitation, and stresses parental 
responsibility over more self-oriented concerns such as jobs and finding new 
spouses. 
</P>

 My thanks to Robin Abcarian for dramatically pointing out the need for legal 
guidelines concerning the move-away-parent issue. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies the importance of maintaining a child's relationship with both 
parents. No one sanctions moving away by the custodial parent for punitive or 
frivolous reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But with child-support awards usually minimal and often unpaid, an opportunity 
for the custodial parent to offer the child a better home situation should not 
be thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk lines of the National Council of Jewish Women's Women Helping Women 
Services receive many calls, which reveal the economic problems of divorced 
women and their children.

 Once again Robin Abcarian insists females be accorded greater rights than 
males. There are an equal, if not greater, number of stories of fathers whose 
rights have been quashed. 
</P>
<P>
 What of the father who wishes to return to graduate school for a doctorate? 
Would Abcarian suggest that child support be eliminated during his studies so 
that he could better his life?  
</P>
<P>
 What of the father who wishes to leave crime-infested California for a small 
town in New England? Would Abcarian suggest that the child support amount be 
adjusted to account for his reduced income? 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow I doubt it. At a time when the country has finally realized the 
problems that result when fathers are not active in their children's lives, 
Abcarian repeats the liberal, feminist rhetoric of a failed agenda that states 
fathers are mere sperm donors and paychecks.

<P>
 In the late 1950s, when I was 11 years old, my mother, stepfather and I moved 
from Los Angeles to Sacramento so that my stepdad could take a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 My father remained in Los Angeles. I saw my dad less often after the move, but 
flew down occasionally on weekends and frequently during school vacations. To 
this day, my father and I have a marvelous relationship and my parents can talk 
with one another free of rancor and bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Had my father taken my mother to court over the move, it would have poisoned 
their relationship, created conflict within our family and placed the burden on 
me to choose between my parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, my father acted responsibly and worked with my mother to fashion a 
new visitation schedule. Isn't this what family courts should be doing -- 
guiding parents toward reasonable solutions?

 Abcarian wrote incessantly about the poor mother.  
</P>
<P>
 I am a custodial father and an unemployed aerospace engineer who has been out 
of work for 1 1/2 years and has not received any child support. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had many out-of-state opportunities, but my son has a right to see his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Custody for women is not a God-given right, and they ought to be thankful the 
scales are tipped heavily in their favor. There are men out there who would 
jump through any kind of hoop to have custody. I know. I have not always had 
it.

PUPPET LOVE; JAMES HAYES' CUSTOMERS MIGHT BE AMONG THE BEST-DRESSED IN TOWN. 
BUT THEY DON'T GET TOO ANIMATED ABOUT THEIR SPECIALLY DESIGNED DUDS. AFTER ALL, 
THEY'RE PUPPETS. 
</P>

<P>
 Fashion designer James Hayes' home office is overflowing with foam, fleece and 
feathers -- not the remnants of one of his offbeat clothing creations but 
rather the stuff his customers are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes dresses puppets for a living. His most recent work will show up soon on 
the ethnically diverse puppet kids from "Puzzle Place," a new Sesame 
Street-like children's program from Lancit Media set to air on KCET starting 
Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by colorful spools of thread, bolts of fabrics, baskets of buttons 
and boxes of bows, Hayes, 33, spends his days concocting crazy hats, distressed 
overalls, way-out party dresses and frizzy hairpieces that will take the 
characters through one adventure after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like being in a toy factory," says Hayes, whose Silver Lake work 
space is also cluttered with puppet portraits ostensibly autographed by the 
"stars" he dresses. "It does sound a little juvenile but that's because it is. 
I mean, I am playing with toys all day." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not all play and no work, however. Hayes says puppets, unlike people, 
have superhuman needs when it comes to clothing. "You couldn't just go to a Gap 
store and buy clothes for these kids. Their arms are longer, their necks are 
smaller and their shoulders are way smaller than humans'," he says. Because 
shirts sometimes have as many as four sleeves (to accommodate the puppeteers 
hands) and most pants have three legs (to house the cable mechanism that works 
the eyes), "everything has to be built from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 They also have to be designed in multiples. "We did an episode where two of 
the characters, Leon and Kiki, were painting and had to have a second set of 
overalls with paint all over them," says Hayes, who does his own spray 
painting, sandpapering, grating and shredding. "It's called teching a garment, 
and I do it whenever a script calls for an activity that would cause the 
clothes to become different-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes' job is not confined to clothes, however. In one episode, a puppet 
dreams that he and the rest of the "Puzzle Place" kids wake up with dreadlocks. 
"I had to make little wigs for everyone with these funny little sausage things 
out of felt that I turned inside out and brushed. Then I hot-glued them to a 
skullcap."  
</P>
<P>
 All of this takes time. A typical T-shirt might take minutes to produce on an 
assembly line, but a puppet T-shirt can take as long as five hours to 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the "Puzzle Place" puppets -- a Norwegian-German boy named Ben, a 
Mexican-American girl named Kiki, an African-American boy named Leon, a Native 
American boy named Skye, a Jewish girl named Jody, and a Chinese-American girl 
named Julie -- pose an additional set of challenges for Hayes because of their 
unique personalities and ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiki is a little more assertive so I tend to dress her in bold prints and 
bright colors," says Hayes, who speaks of the puppets as living entities. 
"Jody, on the other hand, is very artistic and likes to wear hats so I make a 
different hat for her in every episode." 
</P>
<P>
 For a holiday episode (one of 40 shows already produced), Hayes had a $300 
budget to design outfits that celebrated each character's ethnic heritage. 
"Leon celebrated Kwanza along with Christmas and Hanukkah, so I had to make a 
kente-cloth-printed sari kind of thing for him. Jody wore a blue, cut-velvet 
dress with a Jewish star pendant. Skye needed to wear a buckskin shirt with 
beads on it and fringe." 
</P>
<P>
 For accuracy and authenticity on the latter, Hayes sought fashion advice from 
a White Mountain Apache reservation in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes never planned to be a puppet-costume designer. A native of Latrobe, Pa., 
he moved to New York in 1981 to study fashion at Parsons School of Design. For 
nearly five years he designed men's, women's and children's sportswear for 
Bugle Boy, Sergio, J. Crew and Tommy Hilfiger. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Los Angeles in 1990 with one dream. "I told my friends I would go 
to some Hollywood cocktail party, meet someone who needed someone to make some 
inexpensive science fiction costumes for a movie, and my talent would be 
discovered." In a roundabout way, the dream came true. 
</P>
<P>
 For Halloween, 1990, Hayes wanted to create a costume for himself that would 
literally stop traffic on Santa Monica Boulevard. To do that, it would have to 
be of prehistoric proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did 'Jurassic Park' even before Steven Spielberg," says Hayes, who created 
a realistic Tyrannosaurus rex costume out of gray, dyed springweave and 
sculpted foam padding with Ping-Pong ball eyes and satin teeth. The costume was 
7 1/2 feet tall, and the tail stretched out an additional seven feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were much more aggressive than I thought they would be," he says of 
the crowd's reaction. "They were touching me and jumping on my tail and stuff. 
It was just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching all this was Jeffrey Lampert of the Walt Disney Co. He was in charge 
of production on a newly created children's program called "Dinosaurs," about a 
modern stone-age family of dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it was a gut reaction to the costume," Lampert recalls. "I'm doing a 
TV show about guys in dinosaur suits and here's this guy walking around West 
Hollywood in a dino suit. I thought, who is this kid? He's phenomenal. And it 
turned out he was trying to get into the business. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting got Hayes an interview a few weeks later with Polly Smith, the 
costumer on "Dinosaurs," who immediately hired him to sew. Five months later 
when Smith left the show, Hayes ascended to the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Hayes admits the task was Gargantuan. "Earl (the father 
dinosaur) had a 110-inch waist. Fran (the mother dinosaur) was smaller. But she 
was still 65 or 70 inches around, which is unthinkable. And necks were anywhere 
from 45 to 60 inches. Nothing could just be bought and used." 
</P>
<P>
 During a hiatus from "Dinosaurs" before the show became extinct, Hayes was 
asked to costume the puppets for the pilot episode of "Puzzle Place." "The 
clothes he did for 'Dinosaurs' were brilliant, so I knew James was definitely 
the right person for 'Puzzle Place,' " says Kevin Clash, the show's senior 
creative consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working on "Puzzle Place," Hayes was recently hired as wardrobe 
supervisor on "Thunderbirds," a 1960s children's TV series being re-edited with 
live action sequences and re-released in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe a bank thought I was so successful they should give me 
a mortgage," Hayes says. "It was like 'this guy dresses puppets for a living, 
let's give him a loan!' The whole thing is just so funny. . . ."

BAMBINOS IN TOYLAND; BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVERY YEAR IN THE ITALIAN PROVINCIAL 
CAPITAL OF PORDENONE, THE CHILDREN OF THE TOWN PUT ON A BAZAAR AT WHICH THEY 
SELL THEIR OLD TOYS AND BUY NEW ONES SECONDHAND FROM THEIR PEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Who knows from Pordenone? Only the lucky few, and on a special Sunday in 
mid-October, children are the luckiest and happiest of all. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosperous, energetic Italian provincial capital of 50,000 located an hour 
northeast of Venice at the foot of the Alps, Pordenone is hardly a tourist 
town. With but a handful of hotels within its limits, its attractions not only 
didn't rate any stars in the Michelin Green Guide to Italy, it was in fact 
dropped entirely from that magisterial volume in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Pordenone has gotten to any kind of written fame is an 
uncomplimentary mention in Ernest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms." The great 
man, who passed through the town as a World War I ambulance driver, was 
apparently not much impressed. He had a character dismiss it as "not much of a 
place" and in addition had his hero desert to Switzerland rather than retreat 
to its friendly confines. Hardly a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Known 1,000 years ago as Portus Naonis because of its function as a port on 
the River Noncello, Pordenone does have a reputation for several things, none 
of which are calculated to inspire wanderlust in potential visitors or even 
hint at why children have a special reason to rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Pordenone is now a manufacturing center, the home of Zanussi, 
Italy's biggest maker of appliances and considered the country's second largest 
industrial firm after Fiat. In addition, the chaos in the former Yugoslavia 
just down the road has made the nearby Aviano NATO base quite a busy place, 
considerably increasing the American military presence in town. Forthright GIs 
in full camouflage regalia can be seen striding purposefully through its 
streets, and hotels post friendly warnings in English about the expense of 
calling back to the base. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Pordenone has become known for the event that lured my wife and 
I to its environs. This is an eight-day international festival devoted to the 
showing of vintage silent films called "Le Giornate del Cinema Muto," a 
matchless occasion with a wonderful combination of conviviality and 
comprehensiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is possible to arrive in Pordenone without setting foot in a car, my 
wife and I made other plans. Intent on visiting friends north of Verona, we had 
rented a car in that city's airport and so found ourselves driving into 
Pordenone down a tree-lined boulevard pleasantly reminiscent of streets in the 
south of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the NATO troop crunch, hotel rooms in Pordenone were a little 
difficult to come by. We settled first in the chilly Albergo Minerva in the 
center of town, a Spartan place with the cleanest, whitest, most unadorned 
rooms this side of a monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping for a little more comfort and taking advantage of our car, we soon 
moved to the Villa Giustinian, less than 10 miles away in the exquisite hamlet 
of Portobuffole. Built in the 16th Century as a country retreat by a noble (is 
there any other kind?) Venetian family, the Villa had recently been restored as 
a luxury hotel, and its calm grounds, quiet service and surprisingly hearty 
breakfasts were always welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once we settled in, we discovered that Pordenone was one of those places 
travelers dream about, a charming and comfortable town whose absence of 
tourists makes it possible to live within a culture and not feel like an 
outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of an underappreciated region of Italy known as the Friuli and inhabited 
by, one guidebook sensibly claims, "the warmest and most hospitable of the 
Italians," Pordenone has both elegant shops located on the cobblestoned Corso 
Vittorio Emanuele and the kind of cozy and welcoming restaurants you hate to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that made attending "Le Giornate del Cinema Muto" so 
pleasant, aside from the fascinating programming that went on for close to 10 
hours a day, was the event's regularly scheduled, very civilized 2 1/2-hour 
lunch and dinner breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After being warned off the only restaurant most guidebooks listed, my wife and 
I settled into a routine of frequenting one of two establishments for most of 
our meals. If we were in a hurry, we went to the casual All'Antico Cervo (The 
Old Stag), a no-reservations, no-credit cards neighborhood place with the 
freshest and most delicious pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a little more time, and there usually was, we headed to La Gatta 
Buia, which means "The Black Cat" but with an additional slang meaning of 
"jailbird." There we ate beautifully and traded small talk with the 
exceptionally friendly waiters who all seemed to have kind feelings toward Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The town is so hospitable, in fact, that once a year, on a mid-October 
weekend, it sponsors a city fair just to give its citizens a chance to mill 
around and greet each other. There is an "Autoexposizione," where well-dressed 
men kick the tires of all the latest model cars, an area set up for tasting of 
the area's famous San Daniele prosciutto and, in a normally quiet piazza near 
the center of town, something special hiding in a printed descriptive brochure 
under the mundane name of "Bazar 6-14."  
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to describe the gleeful sensation that stumbling on this bustling 
event caused in both of us. We rounded a corner and there, stretching out into 
the distance under a crisp, clear autumnal sky, were literally hundreds of 
stalls jammed with colorful merchandise. But while it might have looked like 
just another Italian street fair, this was radically different. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, there was nothing on any of these tables but toys. Sitting 
under posters of such modern icons as Jean-Claude Van Damme and the cast of 
"Beverly Hills 90210," the merchants kept sharp eyes on piles of dolls, board 
games, buttons, skates, ice skates and a huge variety of books, from the 
simplest Disney versions to racy science fiction items. 
</P>
<P>
 And quite unusual merchants they were. Not adults, not even close, but young 
people between the ages of 6 and 14 were sitting behind tables in this ninth 
annual event established to encourage children to sell their old toys and games 
and buy new ones secondhand from their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the presence of professionally printed badges showed that adults had 
organized this bazaar, they knew enough to vanish from sight on the big day. So 
it was an unalloyed treat to see these "aspiring business people" (as a 
descriptive brochure called them), their tables no doubt neater then their 
rooms at home ever are, proudly overseeing their own merchandise and intensely 
haggling with their compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 Egged on to take part by my wife, I approached a little girl who scrutinized 
me carefully when I pointed at an Italian language novelization of "E.T." She 
continued to look dubious as I thumbed through the book, but when I handed her 
the 2,000 lira asking price (barely more than a dollar), her uncertainty 
changed into the most magnificent and unexpected of smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot more to see in Pordenone than the children's bazaar, including 
a suitably ancient town hall-cathedral-bell tower combination on the Piazza San 
Marco and some examples of the painting of 16th-Century master and native son 
Giovanni Antonio De Sacchis, known to the world as "Il Pordenone."  
</P>
<P>
 And the town makes a good starting point for explorations of the rest of 
Friuli, a region that has had three different capitals in its long history. The 
town of Aquileia is the farthest away, almost as far southeast as Trieste, and 
we never quite got there, despite the lure of what is supposed to be one of the 
largest Roman mosaic floors in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 We did get to Udine, an hour due east of Pordenone, with its remarkable 
Venetian-style town square, and then pushed on to Cividale del Friuli, just 15 
minutes farther. Cividale is the home of the celebrated Tempietto Longobardo, a 
haunting and even magical white stucco relief of a sextet of maiden saints that 
sits on a high wall in a small temple building by a rushing river and which has 
lost none of its mystery in the 1,000 years since the Lombards created it. 
</P>
<P>
 But wonderful as all these ancient relics are, it is the image of that smiling 
young girl at the Pordenone children's bazaar that I believe will stay with me 
longest. She may have thought she got a great deal when I paid ready money for 
her discarded book, but my wife and I believe we received the best deal of all.

 Planning Pordenone 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: From Los Angeles, KLM connects through Amsterdam, Lufthansa 
through Frankfurt, and Alitalia through Rome, into Venice's airport, located 
near Mestre. Round-trip non-refundable air fare, with 21-day advance purchase 
and minimum and maximum stays, is about $860. A car can be rented there and 
Pordenone reached in little more than an hour. For those not wanting to drive, 
the Venice train station is only a short bus or water taxi ride away. Pordenone 
is a stop -- approximately 80 minutes away -- on the frequent Venezia-Udine 
commuter line. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The Villa Giustinian in Portobuffole (Via Giustinian 11, 31019 
Portobuffole Treviso; telephone from U.S. 011-39-422-85-02-44, fax 
011-39-422-85-02-60) is the most luxurious choice in the area. A single room 
costs about $105per night; a double about $180. In Pordenone, the two best 
choices are the Hotel Villa Ottoboni (Piazzetta Ottoboni 2; tel. 
011-39-434-20-88-91, fax 011-39-434-20-81-48. Single about $80, double about 
$100) and the Palace Hotel Moderno (Viale Martelli 1; tel. 011-39-434-28-215, 
fax 011-39-434-52-03-15. Single about $55, double about $90). A budget 
alternative is the Albergo Minerva, Piazza XX Settembre 5; tel. 
011-39-434-26-066. Single $25-$50, double $40-$75. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: The charming La Gatta Buia is located at Piazza XX Settembre, 
1/d (tel. locally 0434-29995). All'Antico Cervo serves dreamy pizza at Via 
Martelli 7; no reservations. Another worthy restaurant is La Vecia Ostria Del 
Moro, located in a 13th-Century nunnery at V. Castello 2 (tel. 0434-28658). 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: "The Cadogan Guide to Venice and the Veneto" ($15.95) 
has information on the Friuli, and the Michelin map of the area is quite good. 
Also of interest is "Eating in Italy: A Travel Guide to the Gastronomical 
Pleasures of Northern Italy," by Faith Heller Willinger (William Morrow, 
$14.95). Or contact the Italian Government Tourist Board, 12400 Wilshire Blvd., 
Suite 550, Los Angeles 90025, tel. (310) 820-0098.

TRAVEL INSIDER: COPING WITH HIGHER PRICES OF FREQUENT FLIER PROGRAMS; AIRLINES: 
LESS-GENEROUS MILEAGE AWARDS TAKE EFFECT JAN. 1. THE REMAINING BARGAINS WILL 
DEMAND SMARTER PLANNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the coming of the new year, travelers who are members of frequent-flier 
programs confront significant changes -- some immediate -- in their mileage 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, billions of miles will expire from members' accounts at several 
airlines' frequent flier programs on Dec. 31. Several years ago, a number of 
carriers (including Alaska, American and United) instituted three-year time 
limits on accrued mileage. Therefore, miles earned on these programs in 1991 
will expire at the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, in early 1995 most airlines (including American, Continental, United 
and USAir) are raising the "price" of a free coach ticket within the 
continental United States and Canada, from 20,000 to 25,000 miles (an estimated 
90% of all awards redeemed are for these types of tickets). USAir makes the 
change after midnight on Jan. 1. American, Continental and United follow on 
Feb. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Delta is decreasing miles needed for a free coach ticket, 
from 30,000 miles to 25,000 starting May 1, 1995. That's great for Delta fliers 
who have already accumulated mega-miles. But the carrier is also making it 
harder for members to earn miles on short flights. On May 1, Delta will lower 
minimum miles awarded on short hops, from 1,000 to 500 miles. For example, the 
337-mile flight from LAX to San Francisco will earn 500 miles, not 1,000, as it 
used to. 
</P>
<P>
 At most carriers, the number of miles required for other awards will also 
change next year. Some awards, such as a free coach ticket to Hawaii, are going 
up on several airlines (on United, for example, mileage needed rises from 
30,000 to 35,000). Others, such as two first-class tickets to Europe or Asia, 
will actually go down on some airlines later in 1995 (at American and United, 
the mileage cost drops from 200,000 to 160,000 miles for two tickets). 
</P>
<P>
 What should you do about expiring miles and redemption increases? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't overreact to the changes," says Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of 
"InsideFlyer," a monthly consumer magazine for members of frequent flier 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, (airlines) are boosting award redemption levels . . . but those 
deadlines don't mean you must fly before those dates to use the old redemption 
levels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, if you want to get a ticket on United for 20,000 miles (or four 
5,000 Mileage Plus award checks), make your travel plans and exchange your 
award checks for your ticket before Feb. 1," he advises. "Your ticket will be 
valid for one year. You can change your travel date on that itinerary for no 
fee (providing award seating is available). You can change your itinerary, 
within the award's same geographic restrictions, for a $35 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can follow a similar strategy to avoid American AAdvantage's increase by 
receiving a certificate from their frequent flier department before the Feb. 1 
deadline. The award will be good for one year, giving you plenty of time to 
book your free flight in 1995. If you still need more time, you can book a 
flight in late 1995 for up to 320 days in advance. In other words, an American 
20,000-mile award that would have gone up to 25,000 miles on Feb. 1, 1995, can 
be flown late into 1996."  
</P>
<P>
 The same basic strategy applies toward minimizing the impact of expiring 
miles. At American, for example, order your 20,000-mile award certificate 
before those miles expire on Dec. 31. With that certificate, you have a year to 
make reservations for your free flight. 
</P>
<P>
 What if you are just short of the magic mile level for a domestic coach 
ticket? "First, find out if your frequent flier program will let you go into 
negative flow," advises Petersen. "Although they don't publicize this policy, 
American, Delta and United will sometimes allow you to go into negative mileage 
in order to claim an award, particularly if you are a good customer. 
Continental even allows you to purchase miles to reach a prize level. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other ways to boost your mileage total. "You could rent a car for 
500 to 1,000 miles," Petersen says. "But those miles might not appear in your 
account for some time. If you need to reach an award level quickly, think about 
applying over the telephone for an airline-affiliated credit card. The banks 
are on-line with the airlines. If you are approved, the enrollment bonus 
(typically 2,500 or 5,000 miles) should appear in your account right away." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going to use your mileage for leisure travel, select your 
destinations wisely. Don't spend 20,000 miles on a ticket to San Francisco that 
can be purchased for about $100 round trip or less in advance. Use your free 
ticket on more expensive destinations, such as out-of-the-way cities with 
limited airline competition, hence higher-than-average fares. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to live on airplanes to reap the benefits of the frequent flier 
programs. In 1994, an estimated 40% of all miles were earned on the ground. And 
mileage opportunities have now expanded far beyond rental cars, hotels and 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, every time you spend more than $29.99 to send flowers by calling 
800-FLOWERS, you will receive 300 miles from United's Mileage Plus. On Dec. 1, 
American AAdvantage began a dining program, whereby three miles are earned for 
every dollar (excluding gratuity, but including tax) spent at more than 2,000 
restaurants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of today's on-the-ground mileage offers are quite generous. Be approved 
for a Diner's Club card (annual fee: $80) and receive 10,000 miles in any major 
U.S. carrier's mileage program. Send Delta a slide showing one of the carrier's 
vacation destinations (preferably without people) before Dec. 31. If Delta uses 
the photo in one of its publications, you'll be 10,000 miles richer. (Telephone 
800-323-2323 for information.)

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: AVOIDING THE COLD SHOULDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staying warm while skiing, camping, mountain climbing or participating in 
other cold-weather activities isn't just a matter of comfort -- it can reduce 
the risk of painful frostbite and life-threatening hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize these medical dangers, outdoor enthusiasts should learn the 
warning signs of cold-related problems, acquire basic first-aid and survival 
skills and dress appropriately, especially if their destination is the winter 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Even carefully prepared travelers can encounter extreme weather conditions, 
making it important to recognize symptoms of frostbite, tissue damage due to 
extreme cold, and hypothermia, an abnormally low body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 A painful sensation is usually the first indication of frostbite. Then feeling 
is lost. "The most susceptible parts are fingers, toes, nose, ears and the 
penis," said Dr. Ken Zafren, an Anchorage emergency physician experienced in 
wilderness survival techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, frostbite on the nose often escapes self-detection, said 
Zafren, who encourages outdoor enthusiasts to keep an eye on other members of 
their group. "If the nose starts to look white at the end," frostbite should be 
suspected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewarming the affected body part immediately is advised. "Stick your fingers 
in your armpits," Zafren said. "Put your feet on your friends' stomach, under 
his clothes." Drink hot tea and immerse affected body parts in water slightly 
warmer than body temperature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not rub the area with snow, an often-recommended treatment, because it can 
cause more tissue damage, Zafren said. Do not hold affected body parts in front 
of hot air dryers. The skin, because it has lost feeling, could burn easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Frostbite is more common in conditions of low temperature and high wind, 
Zafren said, although contact frostbite "can occur within seconds if you touch 
something really cold (with bare hands)." 
</P>
<P>
 Frostbite can be "a very nasty injury," said Zafren, who urges immediate 
medical attention if frostbite is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Should it prove severe, it is a good idea to request a telephone consultation 
with a physician at a hospital that includes a thermal unit, Zafren said. 
(Providence Hospital in Anchorage is one facility that maintains such a unit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another cold-related problem, hypothermia, can be fatal. The declining body 
temperature can affect the heart, brain and muscular functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hypothermia can start subtly," said Dr. Warren D. Bowman, an internist and 
hematologist in Billings, Mont., and president of the Wilderness Medical 
Society, an organization of physicians and others interested in outdoor 
medicine. Often a person will start to stumble and fumble as the lowered body 
temperature begins to affect intellectual functioning. "Watch your friend," 
Bowman advised, noting that it is difficult to recognize hypothermia in 
oneself. "If friends start saying something stupid, or mumbling, it's time to 
get them to shelter." In milder stages, generally defined as a body temperature 
above 90 degrees, hypothermia can be accompanied by skin numbness and chill. A 
person may have difficulty performing fine motor movements. Then 
incoordination, weakness and confusion can set in. 
</P>
<P>
 When hypothermia becomes more severe, generally defined as a body temperature 
below 90 degrees, shivering may stop. A person may be unable to walk or stand, 
or become unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Warming the body immediately is advised and obtaining professional medical 
attention quickly is vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning basic survival skills is a good idea before traveling to the winter 
wilderness, Bowman said. Knowing how to assemble a shelter and light a fire are 
among skills that could be useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid alcohol and drug use during winter sports, Zafren said. Alcohol can 
impart a false sense of warmth, he said, and drugs can impair judgment, which 
can be essential for surviving emergencies in cold climates. 
</P>
<P>
 For cold weather, a four-layer dressing plan is recommended, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first layer should be long underwear made of 100% wool, or a blend of 85% 
wool and 15% nylon, said Bowman, who acknowledged that this may be difficult to 
achieve. Also acceptable, he said, are materials such as Thermax, polypropylene 
and blends of these materials that can wick away moisture from the skin. Avoid 
cotton and cotton blends for the first layer. For socks, Bowman recommends a 
pair made of polypropylene next to the skin and then one or two pairs of heavy 
wool socks on top. 
</P>
<P>
 The second layer should include a shirt made of wool, polypropylene or similar 
materials, a neck warmer (a tube of fabric that covers the neck and can be 
stretched up to cover the face or head), wool pants, a ski hat or stocking cap 
and glove liners. Boots to fit the activity -- such as mountaineering boots or 
ski boots -- are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 The third layer should include a water-resistant, windproof parka of Gore-Tex 
or similar material worn over a pile jacket, wind pants (of Gore-Tex or other 
similar material) and mittens or gloves, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth layer should be easily available in the backpack or gear pack, he 
recommends. Include a vest or jacket filled with down or synthetic material and 
a pair of pile or quilted pants. Travelers should also pack rain gear, if that 
type of weather is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

CRUISE VIEWS: NEW SHIPS TO BREAK BOTTLES ON

 Nine new ships are due to arrive in 1995, beginning with American Canadian 
Caribbean Line's 84-passenger Niagara Prince, introducing cruises around Panama 
beginning Jan. 27. Silversea's second deluxe, all-inclusive ship, the 
296-passenger Silver Wind, is scheduled to debut Jan. 29 in Mombasa, Kenya, 
with a series of Indian Ocean sailings. April will see the arrival of P&O's 
1,975-passenger Oriana from the London-based parent of Princess Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The 960-passenger Crystal Symphony, a second ship for Los Angeles-based 
Crystal Cruises, is sailing from New York to Los Angeles on a long inaugural 
itinerary departing May 4. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's 1,808-passenger Legend 
of the Seas, the fastest major cruise ship built in the last 25 years (topping 
at 24 knots, or almost 28 m.p.h.), is due to debut May 16 with a sailing from 
Miami to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Queen Steamboat Co.'s 420-passenger American Queen, the biggest American 
river paddle-wheeler, will enter service June 27 on the Mississippi. Carnival's 
2,040-passenger Imagination, fifth in the flashy series that began with the 
neon-throbbing Fantasy in 1990, is due July 8 in Miami. Fort Lauderdale will 
see the arrival of Princess Cruises' 1,950-passenger Sun Princess Dec. 16, 
1995. And on Dec. 20, 1995, Celebrity Cruises' 1,750-passenger Century, fourth 
in that fleet, will sail its inaugural itinerary from New York to Fort 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapidly growing American cruise market is expected to reach 8 million 
passengers a year by 2000, nearly double the present 4.5 million, according to 
Cruise Lines International Assn. Look for the following trends in 1995: 
</P>
<P>
 * Good deals in pre- and post-cruise packages. * More truth in cruise 
advertising. Gone are the days when anything that floated was termed "a luxury 
cruise ship." * Fewer niche cruise lines in the near future. Overspecialized 
lines had a bad year in 1994, with both child-oriented American Family Cruises 
and Carnival Cruise Line's Latin-themed FiestaMarina Cruises going out of 
business. * More strenuous attention paid to cruise ship inspections. * The 
gradual departure of older ships as new Safety of Life at Sea regulations begin 
in 1995.

 Mexico: After almost a year of relative quiet, the state of Chiapas flared up 
again as armed Indian rebels and their peasant supporters seized town halls and 
barricaded highways throughout the southeastern state. A day later, Times 
correspondent Mark Fineman reported that hundreds of Mexican troops were being 
dispatched to clear roads and retake territory.There were no reports of 
clashes. But as of press time Wednesday, the situation was clearly unsettled, 
and anyone considering travel in southeastern Mexico is advised to defer it 
until the area calms down.

 Israel, Jordan and the West Bank: The Palestine Liberation Organization has 
assumed authority for tourism in the still-occupied West Bank. The transfer of 
authority by Israel is the latest phase of expanding Palestinian self-rule 
beyond the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Israel and Jordan, 
meanwhile, have opened embassies in each other's largest cities, making Jordan 
the only Arab country since Egypt to establish such ties with Israel. The move 
is significant to travelers because Arab countries hostile to Israel may not 
honor passports that show evidence of travel to Israel. Briefly . . .

where Americans are advised not to travel. Remaining on the list are

PILGRIMS' PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judith Bell's "Pilgrims' Progress" (Nov. 20) was a delight. For those who have 
been to Amsterdam, but want to return, it is definitely a keeper in the "Future 
Travels" file.Having said that, however, I would have liked the map to include 
the names of the countries outlined on the Baltic Sea. Putting the names of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on the map would help educate your readers about 
an area more aligned with Europe than the other countries in the former Soviet 
empire. Estonia and her Baltic neighbors welcome visitors and have much history 
to share with the world. Having been to Estonia six times in the last three 
years, I would like everyone in our country to read pieces such as this one, 
about the rich culture at this place that was buried for 50 years by political 
oppression. How about starting with a map so others know where to find them?

 Your article brought back many wonderful memories of the period I lived in 
Delft in 1993. My apartment overlooked the very canal on which the Pilgrims 
must have traveled to get from Leiden to Delfshaven before beginning their 
journey to the New World. As is evident from the name, Delfshaven was Delft's 
remote harbor at a time when it was an important center of commerce (much as 
San Pedro is Los Angeles' harbor). Now a quiet oasis and a delightful place to 
spend a few hours in the middle of bustling Rotterdam, Delfshaven maintained 
its independent status until swallowed up by Rotterdam in the late 19th 
Century.

 Regarding a hotel's right to "walk" guests elsewhere when it is overbooked 
("Travel Insider," Oct. 30): This is not rare (despite what the hotels say)! In 
our experience, we were appalled to see the desk clerk hand us a form letter to 
present to the alternative hotel. Then, the incompetent ninny offered no 
transportation or use of telephone -- and could not, by herself, think of where 
to send us! These three services were provided by a great shuttle bus driver 
who kindly and wisely waited around rather than abandon two women at night. The 
subsequent offer (after our written complaint) of a future free night's 
accommodation was, of course, no comfort at the time of our rejection!

POP EYE: SOME CROW WHILE OTHERS JUST KVETCH; COMPANIES THAT ARE PLUGGED IN TO 
THE NEWEST ARTISTS ARE THE ONES THAT FARE BEST IN THE LATEST EDITION OF RECORD 
COMPANY SCORECARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You can debate all you want about what is valued more in pop music -- image or 
craft, melody or rhythm, physical beauty or artistic vision. But here's the one 
common denominator in today's pop world: change. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the year's 25 best-selling albums (as of Dec. 12), guess how many were made 
by artists whom pop fans would have recognized just five years ago? Two: 
Salt-N-Pepa and Pink Floyd are the only "veterans." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mariah Carey, who sells so many records you'd think she'd been around 
forever, didn't surface until 1990, making her a veritable old-timer next to 
such '95 hit-makers as Ace of Base, Counting Crows, Boyz II Men, Green Day, 
Candlebox, Warren G and Offspring, an Orange County-based indie band who proved 
that you don't need a major record label to go triple platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 This dramatic influx of new talent is just one reason why the record industry 
had one of its most profitable years ever -- and why its most successful 
companies are the ones with A&R staffs best equipped to spot gifted young 
artists. In the early '90s, the rush was on to sign established free-agent 
superstars. But why pay a premium if an unknown artist can rocket from nowhere 
to No. 1? Seeing how quickly Nirvana and Pearl Jam emerged as mega-platinum pop 
icons, high-rolling record labels engaged in an unprecedented series of bidding 
wars for new talent, paying upward of $1 million to sign young rock contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of money to go around, thanks to the increasing popularity of 
the CD format, which provides record labels with a considerably higher profit 
margin on each purchase. With the industry adding a dollar to its superstar CD 
prices, the result is a huge boom in revenues, with domestic sales approaching 
the $11-billion mark by year's end, up nearly 10% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more complete picture of the year's ups and downs, Pop Eye offers its 
annual Record Company Scorecard, which analyzes the 1994 performance of the 
industry's major companies -- and picks each company's artists to watch in 
1995. The evaluations are based on SoundScan sales estimates and interviews 
with key industry figures, who evaluated companies on both image and 
performance. BMG 
</P>
<P>
 Arista: Forget about that $70 million-plus NBA contract Anfernee Hardaway 
signed this year. If you want to see a b-i-i-i-g contract, wait till you see 
what Clive Davis will get to stay at Arista, which is as hot as any company in 
the business. Most of Davis' acts are critical featherweights, but they're 
heavyweights on the charts, where both Ace of Base and Toni Braxton enjoyed 
huge records, while holdover albums from Alan Jackson and Whitney Houston 
remained top sellers. Other big releases included Crash Test Dummies and Kenny 
G's Christmas album, which hit No. 1 and is still going strong. Coming 
attractions: a new label with Offspring manager Jim Guerinot, a Houston hits 
package and new albums from Annie Lennox and Taylor Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
 RCA: At this label, "Dumb and Dumber" isn't just the name of a new soundtrack 
album. It's bad enough when a label's only success is a soundtrack ("Reality 
Bites"), but what really hurts is that RCA passed on a chance to sign "Reality" 
songstress Lisa Loeb, putting the label on the signing-war sidelines when 
Loeb's single "Stay (I Missed You)" became a huge hit. After signing ZZ Top to 
a $30-million deal, the label's first 'Top album fizzled. Is it any wonder that 
months after sending Joe Galante back to Nashville the label can't find anyone 
to take its top job? 1995 picks: the Dave Matthews Band and rappers Tha 
Alkaholiks. MCA 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen: For any other label, it would've been a disastrous year: Kurt Cobain 
commits suicide, Aerosmith and Don Henley defect to rival labels and Guns N' 
Roses, beset by inner turmoil, seems to have lost its sure-thing status. But 
Geffen has always had a knack for reinventing itself. President Ed Rosenblatt 
brought in a new crop of baby A&R execs who won more bidding wars than any 
other label, signing such promising acts as Veruca Salt, Elastica and 
Jawbreaker. With Counting Crows ending the year with SoundScan's 
biggest-selling rock album and Hole coming on strong, the label's future looks 
bright. Trade of the Year: Don Henley (last solo album: 1989) for the Eagles' 
"Hell Freezes Over," which debuted at No. 1. Coming attractions: Lisa Loeb, 
Elastica and Roots. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA: No one moves country music like MCA, where Nashville darlings like Reba 
McEntire and Vince Gill enjoyed continued success this year, with the emergence 
of the Mavericks making up for a disappointing outing from Lyle Lovett. Sales 
were slower on the black music side, with only Uptown's Mary J. Blige now 
emerging as a platinum contender. Despite some promising sales by Live, MCA is 
not considered a factor in the rock arena: The label's reissued Jimi Hendrix 
albums sold more than 1 million copies (though a pending legal battle over 
ownership looms) and it had success with its "Rhythm Country & Blues" project, 
but career building is still a major MCA weakness. '95 projects include 
alternative bands the Nixons and Dimestore Hoods. PolyGram 
</P>
<P>
 A&M: It was a good year here, thanks to patient artist development, which paid 
big dividends for Sheryl Crow and the Gin Blossoms as well as for Soundgarden, 
who had one of the year's top-selling CDs. On the black music front, A&M's 
Perspective label has been a bust, but Barry White, of all people, surfaced as 
a chart contender at year's end. The only nagging question: Can A&M keep its 
focus while releasing 60-plus albums next year (up from 35 this year)? 
Priorities for '95 include a new Aaron Neville release as well as albums from 
alternative acts Monster Magnet and Dishwalla. 
</P>
<P>
 Island: With Chris Blackwell actively involved with the label again, Island 
had a solid year, enjoying a big breakthrough with Melissa Etheridge while 
continuing its pop success with Salt-N-Pepa and the Cranberries. Sales were 
also strong at newly acquired Def Jam, which hit rap paydirt with a huge record 
from Warren G and is riding high now with Method Man. Coming attractions: 
Stereo MC's, LL Cool J and PJ Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury: It was a dreary year at Mercury, which remains a label in decline, 
especially in terms of attracting promising rock talent. The label's top brass 
deserves credit for making Vanessa Williams a pop star while recasting Jon Bon 
Jovi, with some success, as a Rod Stewart-type pop singer. But until it beefs 
up a weak A&R staff, it will have to survive on sales from such aging artists 
as Def Leppard and John Mellencamp. Due in '95: new albums from Def Leppard, 
INXS and Rusted Root. 
</P>
<P>
 Motown: The big story -- the only story -- is Boyz II Men's "II," which hasn't 
left the Top 10 since late August, giving the label its biggest hit since . . . 
the last Boyz II Men album. For '95: Stevie Wonder. Sony 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia: The industry's well-oiled hits machine delivered again this year -- 
but some signs of rust were showing. The label's mega-stars hit their marks, 
with big sales from Mariah Carey, Pink Floyd and Michael Bolton. But the label 
didn't break a rock band all year, contenting itself with strong sales from 
Alice in Chains and hip-hop newcomer Da Brat, who made up for rap rookie Nas' 
sluggish debut. To remedy matters, Columbia is launching a West Coast label 
with industry vets Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, who will absorb the 
alternative-oriented Chaos label. Priorities in '95 include singer Jeff Buckley 
and hip-hopstress Dionne Farris, plus new albums from Soul Asylum and Bruce 
Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
 Epic: In an industry full of self-promoters, it's nice to see Epic's 
self-effacing chairman Dave Glew enjoying a triumphant year. You couldn't ask 
for a better balanced label, with a monster rock band in Pearl Jam, mainstream 
pop from Celine Dion, Luther Vandross and Babyface, alternative pop from the 
Indigo Girls and gangsta-rap from MC Eiht. Top that off with a big year from 
Epic Soundtrax, which hit home runs with "Forrest Gump" and "Philadelphia." 
Even with a weak outing from the Spin Doctors, Epic's A&R signing coups portend 
a healthy future. '95 priorities include Brit faves Oasis, songstress Des'ree 
and Rage Against the Machine. Thorn-EMI 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol: The Tower raked in money through shrewd marketing of its deep 
catalogue, which provided re-packaged Beatles albums (and a "Live at the BBC" 
collection) and a Frank Sinatra duets sequel. Label mainstay Bonnie Raitt had 
solid sales, as did the Beastie Boys, whose Grand Royal label brought in 
newcomers Luscious Jackson. But Gary Gersh's fabled A&R skills have produced 
few results, with Capitol losing to Geffen and Interscope in the year's big 
new-talent bidding wars. Insiders say that Gersh might nab more new talent if 
he had more autonomy from EMI Group chief finance officer Terry Santisi. Key 
'95 projects include R&B songstress Rachelle Ferrell and rockers Triple Fast 
Action. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI Record Group: Out with the old president (Daniel Glass) in with the new 
(Davitt Sigerson). Few are betting it will make any difference at a label with 
such a spotty track record. The strength of EMI Records Group chairman Charles 
Koppelman (whose domain also includes Liberty and Capitol, where he was 
instrumental in both the "BBC" package and the Sinatra duets) is promoting 
records, not building careers. The image of EMI, which includes his old SBK 
label, is still one of a label that runs up huge marketing bills and concocts 
controversial stunts (the latest a Garth Brooks-McDonald's tie-in) while 
once-promising artists like Arrested Development and Sinead O'Connor fall off 
the radar screen. Key in '95: R&B singer-producer D'Angelo and super-model 
Milla. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin: The Rolling Stones did whatever it took (including a beer ad) to sell 
records, joining Smashing Pumpkins, Janet Jackson and Enigma as the label's big 
success stories. The label also joined the gangsta-rap world with Scarface, 
which arrived via Rap-A-Lot Records. Virgin's new-band signings were hampered, 
however, by turmoil between label president Phil Quartararo and executive vice 
president Nancy Berry (wife of Virgin CEO Ken Berry), prompting a her-or-me 
ultimatum before Quartararo won a vote of confidence. Coming attractions: indie 
faves Royal Trux, L.A. cow-punks Geraldine Fibbers and hip-hop soulsters 
Massive Attack. Time Warner 
</P>
<P>
 American: A disaster. With a bomb from Sir Mix-a-Lot and a woeful start for 
Black Crowes' much-touted "Amorica," the label didn't have any of the year's 
Top 200 albums. Memo to label chief Rick Rubin: Stop moonlighting as a record 
producer and focus on your own company. '95 priorities include Pete Droge, 
Danzig and the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic: It was a good year for the label's mainstream stars, thanks to huge 
sales from Stone Temple Pilots, All-4-One and John Michael Montgomery, plus 
strong showings from Tori Amos and Collective Soul. The label had less luck 
with its crop of critic darlings (Liz Phair, Juliana Hatfield and the 
Lemonheads), who couldn't match their modest past sales. Meanwhile the 
much-heralded Page-Plant reunion album is fading fast, hindered by a steep 
$19.98 list price. Outgoing label chief Danny Goldberg gave the label an image 
infusion; now it's up to new president Val Azzoli to provide some substance. 
'95 projects include Hootie & the Blowfish, Brandy and Bettie Serveert. 
</P>
<P>
 Elektra/East West: The label's artist-oriented image took a beating this year, 
first with the forced exit of chairman Bob Krasnow, then with a nasty tussle 
between his corporate chiefs and Metallica, the label's top act. Chairman 
Sylvia Rhone inherits the label's rich artist roster, which delivered a big pop 
album from Anita Baker and had a strong showing with its 10,000 Maniacs 
"Unplugged" album. Unfortunately, the label's costly Motley Crue re-signing has 
been a bust while Keith Sweat and Pantera couldn't equal previous sales highs. 
Good news: Artist-oriented exec Seymour Stein arrives as president. '95 
projects include Natalie Merchant, the Cure and Better Than Ezra. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant: Just why Warner Music is considering renewing its deal with Giant is a 
mystery to some who've perused this label's current artist roster (though a Don 
Henley-Eagles signing might give the label added commercial clout). Outside of 
speciality projects like the Eagles tribute album "Common Threads," Giant has 
little besides Big Head Todd & the Monsters (who had a weak second album) and 
country crooner Clay Walker. On deck: Green Apple Quick Step and Christopher 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Interscope: You must be doing something right if you're about to sell your 
company for a whopping $300-million-plus. Critics say the 'Scope wildly 
overpays for new bands, but while other new labels have struggled, Jimmy Iovine 
and Ted Field's company has flourished, enjoying huge sales from Death Row bad 
boys Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre (who also produced the soundtrack hits "Above 
the Rim" and "Murder Was the Case"). Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor also emerged 
as the year's alternative-rock icon. On the down side, Tom Jones has been an 
expensive flop so far, and 4 Non Blondes has broken up. Coming attractions: R&B 
singer Xavier, Brit-rockers Bush and rap newcomer Jewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros: It's hard to imagine anyone ousting the top brass of a more 
successful company. With hits flying from all directions, chairman Mo Ostin and 
president Lenny Waronker exit in style, dominating the charts with hits from 
both established artists like R.E.M., Eric Clapton and Tom Petty as well as 
newcomers Green Day and Candlebox, the latter the product of a savvy label deal 
with Madonna, who managed decent sales of her own. Warners even made progress 
in black pop, with big records from Tevin Campbell and Seal, while breaking 
country artist David Ball. The biggest downer: career-threatening nuttiness 
from not-so-fresh Prince. On deck: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Belly and the Flaming 
Lips. Best of the Rest 
</P>
<P>
 Offspring's punk energy put Epitaph Records on the map, outselling every new 
major-label alternative artist except Green Day. . . . Tim McGraw had the 
biggest country record of the year on Curb Records, which moves to the Atlantic 
Group next year. . . . R. Kelly had a big year for Jive Records, a joint 
venture with BMG. . . . New Age instrumentalist Yanni was a huge seller for 
Private Music. . . . Ice Cube had another strong year at Priority. . . . Coolio 
was a big hit for Tommy Boy. . . . And rappers Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had the 
biggest sales at Ruthless Records.

RECORD RACK: FORGET '411,' MARY J., BETTER CALL 911

 MARY J. BLIGE, "My Life" Uptow n (*1/2) 
</P>
<P>
 How could Blige lose so much heat in just two years? 
</P>
<P>
 The singer was a handful on her 1992 album "What's the 411?," a brassy debut 
brimming with ambition.She even had the nerve to do a velvety version of Chaka 
Khan's "Sweet Thing." Not many fledgling artists would have invited comparisons 
to such a soul-music icon on their first album, but that was Blige for you -- 
bold and in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this sophomore effort is drab, and the woman who has often been 
described as R&B's next reigning diva doesn't seem to be enjoying herself. 
Aside from one track in which she confidently states, "Come into my bedroom, 
honey / What I got will make you spend money," this album lacks funk and 
vinegar. It may evoke soul references from Barry White and the Mary Jane Girls 
to Rose Royce's "I'm Going Down," but Blige doesn't add her own hard-core 
signature to any significant degree. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is Blige's life, she could use a little jump start.

 Carla Olson, "Reap the Whirlwind," (***) Watermelon. The ex-Textones leader 
puts her husky, honeyed Texas voice to good use in duets with soul man Percy 
Sledge and Mark Lindsay (yes, that Mark Lindsay), spirited tracks that propel 
this earthy, rocking excursion. After years of "bubbling under" hit-dom, 
Olson's blues-informed pop has only gained heart -- perfect for fans of Bonnie 
Raitt's rougher side. Steve Hochman

 Spice 1, "Amerikkka's Nightmare," (***) Jive. The most alarming revelation 
derived from this bright young rapper's fourth album is that nothing appears to 
be getting better in the Hayward 'hood he's chronicled for the past seven 
years. "Amerikkka" finds the youth still as uncompromising as the tough streets 
he comes from, but even more bitter and, as "Strap on the Side" indicates, 
well-armed. Dennis Hunt

THE CHARTS: GARTH HITS BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garth Brooks' "Hits" entering the Times' Southern California chart at No. 6 
(and No. 3 nationally)--instead of his usual No. 1--is no sign that he's 
slipped drastically. Remember, it is a greatest-hits package that includes no 
new material. His fans already have all these songs. But it did do impressive 
numbers anyway--for a Brooks album. However, its sales simply aren't in a 
league with the mind-boggling totals racked up by Kenny G's "Miracles: The 
Holiday Album." Luis Miguel continues his stranglehold on both the Southern 
California and national Latin charts with "Segundo Romance." TOP 10 ALBUMS

PRIVATE LIVES: 1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; VIDEO; SEVEN DWARFS SLAY DINOSAUR!; IN A 
BOOM YEAR OF 'EVENT' RELEASES, SO FAR 'SNOW WHITE' IS WHOMPING 'JURASSIC PARK' 
IN THE FIGHT FOR VIDEO SUPREMACY.

 This was the year "Jurassic Park" was snowed in. Steven Spielberg's monster 
blockbuster may be the biggest box-office hit of all time, but when it came to 
video, T. rex and the raptors were no match for Doc, Grumpy, Sleepy, Bashful, 
Happy, Sneezy and Dopey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," with its reported 27 million copies sold to 
retailers and mass merchants, pulled the magic carpet out from under the 
previous sales champ, Disney's "Aladdin." "Jurassic Park" has shipped 24 
million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 This Super Bowl matchup for video supremacy, which kicked off in October 
during the video industry's lucrative holiday-oriented fourth quarter, is still 
being played out in stores (of these millions of titles shipped, how many will 
eventually be bought by consumers?). So far, Ms. White is outselling Mr. Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "event" releases capped one of video's most winning seasons, particularly 
from a retail perspective. A few years ago, it would have cost you about $90 to 
buy on video such hits as "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" or "Speed." This year, 
both were priced for the sell-through market for less than $25. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer did a title need to be primarily for children or their families, a 
classic collectible or one that took in more than $100 million at the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sell-through was really the story this year," said Bart Story, Video Store 
magazine's director of market research. "The studios took a greater risk 
putting out titles for consumer purchase, an option that in prior years they 
wouldn't have considered viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Family films continue to dominate sell-through. The year's Top 10 titles 
released directly to sell-through (as opposed to being first marketed as a 
rental title and later reduced in price for the consumer) were: "Snow White," 
"Jurassic Park," "Mrs. Doubtfire," "The Fox and the Hound," "The Flintstones," 
"Speed," "The Return of Jafar," "Beethoven's 2nd," "The Fugitive" and "D2: The 
Mighty Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 From "The Secret Garden," released in February, to "Tim Burton's 'The 
Nightmare Before Christmas' " in September, this year was also distinguished by 
the consistent stream of video hits, "more hits than ever before," said John 
Thrasher, Tower Records/Video vice president of video purchasing and 
distribution. "It proved that video is a year-round business rather than a 
fourth-quarter business." 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for more market share or at least more video store shelf space, studios 
continued to mine their vaults for buried treasures that they released on video 
for the first time. For the second year, Fox Video released at least one of its 
designated "Studio Classics" on the first Wednesday of each month. In 1994, 
"Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Carmen Jones" and "Call Northside 777" made their 
long-awaited debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabin Fever Entertainment launched its "Little Rascals" collection with 12 
volumes of the original, pre-MGM shorts. The series, hosted by Leonard Maltin, 
was one of the year's surprise hits, with nearly 3 million individual tapes 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was a great year for sell-through, which enjoyed a 14% increase over 
last year, it was considered merely a good year for rental, which experienced a 
2% growth, Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Top 10 videocassette rentals of 1994 were "The Fugitive," "Ace Ventura: 
Pet Detective," "The Pelican Brief," "Mrs. Doubtfire," "In the Line of Fire," 
"Philadelphia," "Grumpy Old Men," "Tombstone," "Speed" and "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Video is a Hollywood hit-driven business, but it was an encouraging year for 
other categories of programming. Special-interest video sales increased by 
nearly 25%, said Paul Caravatt, president and executive director of the Special 
Interest Video Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 SIVA defines a special-interest video as a program that deals with "subjects 
that teach, train, guide, inform, inspire, entertain, enlighten and enrich." 
</P>
<P>
 Special interest had its hits too. The 1992 release "Road Construction Ahead" 
is a phenomenon described by Caravatt as "the Jane Fonda workout of original 
children's tapes -- it was the right tape at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Its success spawned an increasing number of programs that give children the 
chance to live out their vehicular fantasies. These include the "There Goes . . 
. " series on A-Vision Entertainment's KidVision label, "Garbage Day!" from 
Child Vision and "What Do You Want to Be When You Grow Up: Railroaders" from 
Big Kid Productions.*

PRIVATE LIVES: 1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; A BONANZA OF BRINY BARGAINS; FAMILY: L.A. 
MAY NOT HAVE A MAJOR AQUARIUM, BUT SEEKERS OF UNDERSEA ACTIVITY NEEDN'T BE 
DISAPPOINTED.

 As a dark orange sea cucumber crept its way along a rock, a crowd gathered to 
watch. Unsure of what to make of its spiky, slimy body, the spectators reached 
out with their fingers, one by one, to touch the creature. 
</P>
<P>
 Some young children giggled, some squealed. Others, including many of the 
adults, simply smiled. Above the din, teen-agers on a high school field trip 
used a mixture of grody and cool to describe the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 1 at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro is that beauty is in 
the eye of the beholder. Lesson No. 2: There's something about marine life that 
fascinates young and old. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a public aquarium isn't easy in Southern California, where giant 
rubber sharks and synthetic sea bass roam the depths of some amusement parks. 
Indeed, Los Angeles is one of the few large American cities without a major 
collection of aquatic animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Chicago, Baltimore or, heck, even Chattanooga, Tenn., which all took 
steps to expand or build aquariums in the last decade, L.A. saw its premier 
site close in 1987 with the demise of Marineland on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
Since then, the closest some have come to seeing marine life in person is the 
robotic Jaws on the Universal Studios tour or on Disneyland's magical, mystical 
(and mechanized) submarine ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those interested in learning something about the real undersea world, 
there are a handful of Southern California activities to awaken the Jacques 
Cousteau in us all. And, as a bonus, most cost little, nothing or request only 
a donation: 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best values is the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, which houses more than 
30 saltwater tanks and numerous exhibits. Visitors can see live animals that 
inhabit the ocean's divergent environments, from the sandy beaches to kelp 
forests. Displays include tanks of octopuses, lobsters and sardines not 
destined for someone's plate. One exhibit lets people feel the sandpaper-like 
texture of shark skin. But perhaps the most popular area is the tide pool touch 
tank, which lets visitors pet prickly sea urchins, sea stars and giant keyhole 
limpets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro. Donations accepted; beach parking is 
$4.50 weekdays and $5.50 weekends. Closed Mondays and today for Christmas. 
(310) 548-7562.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Though located on the Manhattan Beach Pier, the Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab 
and Aquarium doesn't allow fishing. The collection of roughly half a dozen 
tanks includes a 2,200-gallon shark tank, a reef tank and a lobster tank with a 
50-year-old specimen named Lucy. The lab also has a tide pool touch tank, a 
video display and a special kids' corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manhattan Beach Pier, end of Manhattan Beach Boulevard. Donations accepted; 
metered parking (bring quarters). Wednesday-Friday, 3 p.m.-sunset; weekends, 10 
a.m.-sunset. (310) 379-8117.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away on a corner of Ft. MacArthur in San Pedro, the Marine Mammal Care 
Center treats sick and injured seals and sea lions. Stranded animals, often 
suffering from malnutrition, dehydration and attacks by animals and humans, 
arrive via animal control agencies from Ventura County to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The average stay at the center is about three months, Director Don Zumwalt 
said. The busiest time tends to be in the spring, when pups are weaned, though 
the center receives a steady stream of northern fur seals, California sea 
lions, elephant seals and harbor seals throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors view the mammals through chain-link fences but seem to bond with them 
despite the distance, Zumwalt said. A similar center operates in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3601 S. Gaffey St., San Pedro. Donations accepted. Daily, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. 
(310) 548-5677. Also: Friends of the Sea Lion, 20612 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna 
Beach. Daily, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. (714) 494-3050.

 The Orange County Marine Institute has a touch tank and displays, including 
the skeleton of a baby gray whale suspended from the ceiling. The institute 
also offers three-hour marine biology cruises that allow participants to 
explore the harbor or examine urchins, sea stars and mollusks freshly collected 
from the ocean bottom. A special bioluminescence cruise, which looks at the 
ability of certain plankton, fish and worms to create their own light, is held 
on Saturday nights with little or no moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. Donations accepted, though 
cruises cost $6-$22 for adults, $4-$16 for children. Call (714) 496-2274 for 
hours.  
</P>
<P>

</P>

 Farther down the coast, La Jolla boasts the Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum. Its 
33 tanks, including a 50,000-gallon display of a kelp forest, showcase research 
being done at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The aquarium is 
currently running several holiday events such as "Santa's Arctic Science Lab," 
which explains how polar bears, walruses and whales survive the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2300 Expedition Way, La Jolla. Adults, $6.50; senior citizens, $5.50; 
students or ages 13-17, $4.50; ages 3-12, $3.50; free for children under 3 or 
military personnel in uniform. Parking, $2.50. Daily, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Closed 
today for Christmas. (619) 534-3474.

 A heavy touch of showmanship mixes with science at Sea World in San Diego, now 
in its 30th year of operation. The 150-acre park features more than 20 exhibits 
on sharks, penguins and other marine life. Five shows, including the trademark 
show with Shamu the killer whale, run throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sea World Drive, San Diego. Ages 12 and older, $28.95; children 3-11, 
$20.95; free for ages 3 and under. Parking, $5. (619) 226-3901.

 For the more adventurous, the Santa Catalina Island Co. offers 
semi-submersible boat rides to view fish underwater. The 60-foot Starlight 
carries up to 36 passengers on a 40-minute tour off the island's coast, giving 
a view akin to what a diver might see. 
</P>
<P>
 On day trips, customers can tour kelp beds off the island and spot fish such 
as garibaldi, calico bass, rockfish and bat rays. At night, an ominous seascape 
emerges, with horn sharks, spiny lobsters and the occasional moray eel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adults, $18; children 2-12, $12. A round-trip ticket to the island adds 
about $35. (800) 242-4969.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the more frugal-minded, whale-watching along the coast costs nothing. The 
annual migra tion of gray whales from Alaskan waters to Baja California has 
just begun. Binoculars, a good view of the sea and patience are all you need. 
</P>
<P>
 For deeper background, the Point Vicente Interpretive Center, an official 
whale census location, offers exhibits and docents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 31501 Palos Verdes Drive W., Rancho Palos Verdes. Adults, $2; children ages 
4-13, $1. Daily, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; closed today and New Year's Day. (310) 
377-5370.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Exploring tide pools is another option that doesn't cost a dime, though 
aquariums frequently offer low-cost guided tours. The shallow pools contain a 
microcosm of animals and plants, from anemones and hermit crabs to red algae. 
In the spring and summer, grunion make their mating runs on area beaches, 
providing a unique albeit voyeuristic look at nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish fetish still not satisfied? Time and travel may be the only solutions. 
Several proposals are in the works to build major aquariums in Long Beach, the 
Los Angeles Harbor area and Ventura County. But all would take years to build. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, there's the Monterey Bay Aquarium, located on the Cannery Row of 
Steinbeck fame ((408) 375-3333). And in San Francisco, there's the Steinhart 
Aquarium at the Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park ((415) 750-7145).

HARASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo to Peter Rainer for eloquently articulating the disingenuousness of 
"Disclosure" and "Oleanna" ("Hollywood Just Doesn't Get It," Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 I find it amazing that in the post-Thomas-Hill era we still cannot move beyond 
the prurient elements of sexual harassment to a more substantive dialogue about 
the toll this phenomenon exacts on the sexes. This is the reason why I will not 
be paying my hard-earned dollars to see "Disclosure" or "Oleanna' -- they both 
reek of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer hits the nail on the head when he states that these movies are "a rant 
against the destruction of male privilege." They are a sort of male anxiety 
writ celluloid. And I fear that as the Great America Power Pie continues to be 
divided among the historically underrepresented, we will undoubtedly have more 
movies and novels of this mean-spirited ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 A note to Michael Crichton and David Mamet: Sexual harassment is a phenomenon 
that is still skewed largely in the direction of men as the perpetrators and 
women as the recipients. So let's cut the crap and get down to the business of 
ensuring that our wives, mothers and daughters do not have to experience this 
sort of demeaning treatment. And maybe then we'll be able to have these 
groundbreaking movies and novels about the reversal of male privilege. Or 
better yet, maybe this phenomenon will no longer exist. 
</P>

<P>
 Thank you for Peter Rainer's eloquent and insightful analysis of what lies 
behind the current crop of female sexual harasser movies. Contrary to the 
implication of the article's title, Hollywood does get it. The male studio 
executives greenlighting these pictures have shrewdly tapped into the lucrative 
well of backlash by the endangered white male. 
</P>
<P>
 As women have begun to gain equality, movie roles for women have become 
increasingly unrealistic, bimboistic and vampish -- there's a direct 
relationship, and it sells. When women, and thoughtful men like Rainer, learn 
to exercise their power in the marketplace by voting with their cash, the 
quality level of movies will improve drastically.

<P>
 If Hollywood is to accept Rainer's perspective, then blacks must never be 
depicted as thieves or crooks, gays must never be depicted as overtly sexual 
and women must never be depicted as power hungry. These are negative 
stereotypes, and the purpose of film (as all artistic expressions) is to depict 
life as we want it to be, not as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that some blacks are crooks, some gays are overtly sexual and, 
believe it or not, some women are power hungry. The fact that these groups have 
been at the receiving end of discrimination for so long does not warrant a 
complete disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment against women is an inexcusable practice, and undoubtedly 
occurs more frequently than against men. Yet what often makes art so appealing 
(and dangerous to some) is its willingness to depict the reality of what many 
consider to be blasphemous and taboo. Male sexual harassment certainly fits 
this bill.

 High technology and the illusion of "virtual fantasy" on the screen has 
finally allowed Hollywood to create a ride rather than a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique of excising story in favor of a mood ride was finally perfected 
in "Jurassic Park," and is now gradually insinuating itself into many 
mainstream movies. Witness "Speed" -- about nothing but short-term fun. And the 
same applies to "Disclosure." I doubt we'll be huddling in cozy clusters 
discussing the provocative issues raised in "Disclosure" a year from now, let 
alone a month or a week from now.

 Even though over 90% of sexual harassment victims are women, Hollywood has 
chosen to focus on male victims in its first two serious films on the subject. 
Typical, considering that this year's most notable mommy role in a movie was 
given to a man ("Junior")!

 As the wise King Solomon said, "There is nothing new under the sun." While 
reading Rainer's article, I was reminded of the ancient, fascinating biblical 
account of Joseph and Potiphar's wife (Genesis 39), a 3,000-year-old story of a 
woman's sexual quest for an unwilling male, culminating in his wrongful 
imprisonment.

 Although this much-loved gentleman was never a recording artist himself, Mo 
Ostin is definitely a tough act -- for anyone connected in the music industry 
-- to follow ("Quotations From Chairman Mo," by Robert Hilburn and Chuck 
Philips, Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 His unbelievable care and concern for the great (and not-so-great) artists he 
worked with allowed them to create the music that will be with us forever.In

 Reading your article on Mo Ostin rang true and clear. I remember the time when 
I had purchased a James Taylor record for demonstration in my high-end audio 
store in Hawaii, only to get three bad copies. I promptly packaged up the last 
copy and sent it off to Ostin. It said he was "the main guy" in the liner 
notes. I thought to myself, "Here goes nothing." Not too much later I received 
a perfect copy of the record and a letter from the desk of Mo Ostin. It is 
obvious that he cares about the right things!

 Thank God for the likes of Leonard Maltin, as quoted in David Kronke's article 
("The Warts Have It," Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Without Maltin, Kronke would have been short of copy for you and the excellent 
screenwriter Larry Karaszewski would still be in the dark.Not that the latter 
needs a light! Kronke's piece was ill-served by all-too-familiar Hollywood 
introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 He need only have had looked to European filmmakers for balance. Amazing that 
Kronke felt there was no place in his article for mention nor examination of 
such bio-pics as "Lawrence of Arabia," "Becket," "Gandhi," "Chariots of Fire," 
to name a few.

 Kronke rewrites (or ignores) movie history. His thesis (as expressed by Ron 
Shelton) is that "we've come a long way from 'The Glenn Miller Story' " in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
 While figures like Benny Goodman and Eddy Duchin received similar admiring, 
treacly treatment in their bios during that period, just one year after 
Miller's beatification came "Love Me or Leave Me," with Doris Day depicting 
Ruth Etting's ruthless ambition and mild dipsomania, followed closely by the 
serious alcoholism of Lillian Roth (Susan Hayward) in "I'll Cry Tomorrow" and 
the manic antics of Jim Piersall (Anthony Perkins) in "Fear Strikes Out." 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't have to wait until 1974 and "Lenny" to see unflattering movie 
biographies.

 Regarding art critic Christopher Knight's "Serrano's Critics Missed the Point" 
(Dec. 11), I was prepared to say that Knight missed the point, when lo, in the 
penultimate paragraph of this 1,500-word essay, there is a passing mention of 
controversy in Congress over funding of the "arts." 
</P>
<P>
 And there lies the point! It is typical of the overreach of centralized 
governmental involvement over the decades in nearly everything conceivable that 
we have taxpayers funding "artists" through the NEA.Regardless of the merits or 
otherwise of Serrano's "art," which Knight somewhat halfheartedly defends, as a 
taxpayer I do not relish having my pockets picked for this illegitimate 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 And while we're on the subject of Philistinism, who are the Philistines 
passing on the worthiness of these tax handouts?

A NIGHT WITH NEW YORK'S 911 LIFELINE, WHERE TIME IS THE THIEF; EMERGENCIES: 
IVEY BRUCE, POLICE OPERATOR 1784, IS REASSURING AS SHE HANDLES PROBLEMS RANGING 
FROM ASSAULT TO CHILDREN LEFT HOME ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "You want the police to come your house, because your mother didn't come 
home?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly 7 p.m. on a Wednesday in the weeks before Christmas and somewhere 
in New York City, two scared young girls watch the clock, more frightened by 
the minute. They call 911 and reach Ivey Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is soothing, and steady. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, what apartment are you in? And what's the telephone number? And how old 
are you and your sister?" 
</P>
<P>
 As she speaks, Bruce types on a battered gray computer. The figures 10 and 11 
appear on her screen, then "home alone." Another tap of a key speeds the girls' 
plea for help to a police dispatcher in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, a 45-year-old mother of two sons, nods as if to reassure the unseen 
child and then tells her police will be there soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a novel half-read, a mystery never solved, this story has no end for 
Bruce. After 14 years on the job, she knows that's as it must be. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only supper time in New York and by the end of her 3:30 p.m. to 11:30 
p.m. shift, this 911 operator will have heard accounts of panic and terror by 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Systems vary widely, from the hectic and gargantuan New York operation that 
will have fielded an estimated 10.1 million calls in 1994 to rural systems 
where response time is measured in hours, not seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But everywhere, this nearly ubiquitous lifeline -- a 1993 Federal 
Communications Commission report found 911 service available in 89% of the 
country -- rests on individuals like Ivey Bruce, police operator 1784. To spend 
a shift with Bruce is to wonder at her capacity to absorb the seemingly endless 
desperation of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her workplace is a hive of cramped cubicles and glassed-in rooms where 
computer screens jump with near-disaster and certain tragedy. Despite the dingy 
atmosphere, the welfare of 7.3 million New Yorkers and the tens of thousands of 
visitors passing through any given day feels cherished here, something precious 
and fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 To call 911 for help is to reach a disembodied voice, but these operators are 
very real. Most are women and most, like Bruce, are black. 
</P>
<P>
 They know that every screaming siren, every ambulance streaking past, every 
rude blare of a fire engine horn, even the scratchy barking of a police 
officer's walkie-talkie, probably started with 911. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Police Department, which runs the city's 911 system, invoked 
privacy rules to deny a reporter permission to listen in on calls or transcribe 
everything Bruce typed on her screen. This report is based on hearing her 
answer calls and on later interviews: 
</P>
<P>
 "Police operator 1784. What's your emergency? 
</P>
<P>
 "Con Edison turned your lights off? And you paid that bill? And they didn't 
turn the lights back on? Let me give you an emergency number . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the night, she will take calls about a stolen television set, a 
squirrel trapped in a bedroom, a motel assault, several reports of armed 
teen-agers, a couple of car accidents, civic-minded neighbors reporting couples 
fighting in the next apartment, people who couldn't breathe, a man found lying 
on a street corner, an unhappy soul who drank kerosene and a woman who feared 
the underworld was after her. 
</P>
<P>
 One man calls to say his landlord locked him in an apartment. Another is 
locked out of his car. Private alarm companies report devices going off. A 
Chinese grocer cries that thieves are stealing from her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, who was born in Alabama and grew up in Brooklyn, worked in accounting 
for 12 years before she took this job, finding it far more interesting and less 
stressful than worrying if her numbers added up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in comfortable navy slacks and a blouse in a swirling blue-on-white 
print, she tugs on her ponytail when pensive. But during most calls, she leans 
forward as she speaks and listens with an attentiveness that creases her brow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police operator 1784. What's your emergency?" 
</P>
<P>
 A woman feeling faint wants police to drive her home, all of one block. "Yes. 
Hello, ma'am. So you want an ambulance? The police is not a taxi service, 
ma'am. We can send you an ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the computer before her, Bruce works from an elaborate black telephone 
with tiny screens and several rows of buttons linked to Emergency Medical 
Services, fire dispatchers and a Spanish-speaking operator. Other interpreters 
are on call. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the phone, a green-gray box the size of a small refrigerator contains a 
tape machine that records every call. At her left elbow sits another phone with 
a tiny built-in typewriter for calls from the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police operator 1784. What's your emergency? 
</P>
<P>
 A woman's shrieking leaks through Bruce's black headset. Her mother has passed 
out and might be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to me, babe," Bruce says, lowering her voice. "Listen to me. What's 
wrong? She passed out or what? Listen to me, listen to me. I want you to calm 
down. All right? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to the Bronx." She's got EMS on the line. Now, Bruce listens and 
coaches the caller. "Hello? Tell them your cross streets. Tell them your cross 
streets. . . . OK, they're gonna be there. Hello? Hello, ma'am? You can call up 
now if her condition's changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Going home at night, Bruce says, "I have no problem leaving the job here." Yet 
some calls haunt her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, many years ago, this woman was screaming." She throws her head back and 
shakes it as if hearing it again. "That was the kind of scream that you never 
want to hear in your life." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman lived in a building where the elevators didn't work properly. Her 
son had been decapitated by the doors "and his head went riding up and down in 
the elevator," Bruce said. "My heart jumped and my adrenaline went to pumping. 
I calmed myself down. I sent one ambulance for her, and one for her son." 
</P>
<P>
 She strives not to get too involved, but after upsetting calls, she often has 
to take a walk or get a drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what qualities enable her to do her job, she grins and responds, "I'm 
basically a humanitarian. I like helping people." 
</P>
<P>
 New York's 911 system occupies the eighth floor of police headquarters, a 
14-story red-brick tower overlooking a wind-swept plaza at the foot of 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Capacity and staffing vary, but during the summer, major holidays and 
emergencies such as plane crashes, all 74 terminals on the main floor and the 
20 more usually designated for training can be in use. The usual staffing is 50 
to 65 operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The operators occupy clusters of desks and cubicles barely wider than the 
swivel of an office chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is the thief here, and the taskmaster. Every word spoken, every second on 
the phone, is monitored, by computer and eavesdropping supervisors. The NYPD 
can respond to 99.5% of calls within four telephone rings, and dispatch in two 
to three minutes, Platoon Commander Denise Marbury says. 
</P>
<P>
 If New York's system has a flaw, it's the inability to weed out crank calls, 
but the operators' phones will disclose callers' numbers and locations with 
Enhanced 911 under upgrading expected to be completed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants for the job -- which offers an annual starting salary of $24,198, 
rising to $27,461 after three years -- must survive a civil service test, an 
interview and scrutiny of their mental and physical fitness before receiving 
seven weeks of training capped by a crucial final exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on The Floor, they're assigned to a senior operator who guides them 
through the first couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police operator 1784. What's your emergency? . . . You were what? You were in 
the movies and you were attacked? Who's at home with you? All right. Let me 
speak to your mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce chuckles. A small boy has called saying he is stuck in the moon and 
can't get out. When Bruce asks for his mother and he tells his mom it's the 
police, the woman slams down the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of calls from children," Bruce says. "But we have to take them 
seriously." They may be giggling as they report a friend just broke his neck 
skateboarding, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police operator 1784. What's your emergency?" 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, now what time are they selling these drugs? Twenty-four hours a day, 
seven days a week? Do you know the person? OK. Do you know what one of them 
looks like? OK. What color are they? Black or Hispanic, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 She coaxes out descriptions of two men -- their height, build, weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "So tell me, is there a password or something? No password. So what do they 
do, just knock on the door? To get the drugs. Do they have weapons there? 
</P>
<P>
 "So listen to me. Do you want to leave your name and telephone number?" The 
caller does. "Thank you, sir. Someone will be there as soon as possible to 
check it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, calls rush in one after the other, barely allowing a breath before 
the soft, high beep indicates another is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, Ivey Bruce displays a prize-worthy calm. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman sobs into the phone. Her husband had been hitting her. He's upstairs. 
Bruce begins as she always does, by getting the address and telephone number, 
enough to summon police with one press of a button while she takes more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right. Listen. Take a couple of deep breaths. You relaxed? I'm going to 
send the police over. Don't go upstairs. Stay downstairs. And relax. I'm going 
to get the police over." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Haleyville, Ala., became the first city with 911 emergency service; 
later that same year, New York City got it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quarter-century, despite their more sophisticated equipment and 
training, 911 operators still require the special mix of endurance and 
compassion witnessed in Ivey Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 She offers a simpler explanation: "I don't find this stressful because I like 
what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 By night's end that Wednesday, she has taken 138 calls. A light night, she 
remarks, almost ruefully. Then, her brown eyes brighten with a forecast. "And 
tomorrow, all hell breaks loose!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Ivey Bruce taps a key and signs off.

QUOTAS OFFSETTING CASTE SYSTEM HELP INDIA'S POOR, BUT STIR VIOLENT DEBATE; 
ASIA: NEARLY EVERYONE AGREES THAT RESERVING JOBS HAS GIVEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
A CHANCE FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. NATION HAS DONE JUST THAT FOR MORE THAN 70 YEARS, 
BUT EQUALITY IS STILL FAR AWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 By the code of India's ancient caste system, Asim Arun should have been a 
cobbler or tanner of hides, socially unfit to touch an upper-caste Hindu or 
even look him in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Defying history, Arun is in an elite academy, training for a coveted position 
in India's civil service. 
</P>
<P>
 He was admitted under a quota that reserves one in five government jobs and 
university places for people from India's primitive hunter-gatherer tribes, 
members of Hinduism's lowest castes and the even lower-placed "Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
 For about 70 years, long before the term "affirmative action" was coined in 
the United States, India has used quotas to try to undo its caste system -- one 
of the most widespread, rigid and exclusive systems of social discrimination 
ever devised by man and sanctioned by religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone agrees reserving jobs through quotas has given hundreds of 
millions of Indians a chance for upward mobility, spread literacy and given 
confidence to social classes doomed for centuries to oppression because of 
their birth. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite its long history, the "reservation policy" still excites furious 
-- sometimes lethal -- argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and 
powerful, announced it was broadening the list of castes eligible for quotas. 
More than 50% of the bureaucracy would be reserved for low castes, which 
account for more than eight of every 10 Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing they would lose their places in good schools, hundreds of upper-caste 
students marched through the narrow streets of Mussoorie shouting protests. 
</P>
<P>
 As so often happens in India, the crowd became a mob, police opened fire, and 
six people were killed. Since then, at least 30 people have died in Uttar 
Pradesh during violence in similar protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The new quota would apply all over the state, even in sparsely populated 
mountain areas where few low-caste Hindus live. That has brought demands by the 
hill people to break up Uttar Pradesh and give them their own state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that quotas amount to reverse discrimination, that they are 
undemocratic and that they deny the best jobs to the best people. India has 
outlawed discrimination by caste, but it paradoxically perpetuates it, they 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to the day when we get rid of reservations," said Arun, a 
soft-spoken policeman's son. "But right now we still need them, not because we 
are innately incapable, but because (for) over 3,000 years we have been denied 
all opportunities for education or advancement." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Academy of Administration, set in a forest of cedars and pines in 
Mussoorie, a hilltop town on the edge of the Himalayas, is a crucible of the 
quota policy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the British left India in 1947, the academy became the reserve of 
Indians from the best families who spoke English with an Oxford accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, because of the quotas, some students come from dusty villages that have 
erratic or no electricity and where water wells are still segregated by caste. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this school is a culture shock," said Arun. Unlike him, his 
upper-caste classmates drink alcohol, date girls and know Western dancing. 
"This is alien to my community." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy pays more attention these days to leveling people from varying 
backgrounds. An etiquette class teaches how and when to shake hands rather than 
use the traditional Indian greeting of folding one's palms like someone 
praying, how to use knives and forks, and how to show sensitivity to other 
folkways and religions in India's sometimes explosive cultural mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Caste is Hinduism's hereditary hierarchy based on occupation. At the top are 
Brahmins (priests) and aristocracy; then warriors; then merchants and artisans; 
and, finally, peasant farmers and tradesmen. Each of the four castes has 
thousands of subcastes. 
</P>
<P>
 People like sweepers and grave diggers are outside the caste system and are 
considered so low that even their shadow is polluting to the high caste. They 
are the outcastes, or Untouchables. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern India, where more than 80% of the 900 million people are Hindus, 
recognized the system as odious. In the 1950s, it wrote the reservation system 
into its constitution, expecting that within 10 years quotas could be abandoned 
because they would have uplifted the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, politicians use the system as a tool to curry votes. Rather than 
disappearing, quotas are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the federal government unexpectedly agreed to enlarge the 
quota list to include many new categories. The decision set off a wave of 
impassioned protest. Over a three-month period, more than 100 students 
committed suicide by setting themselves on fire with gasoline or swallowing 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenged in the Supreme Court, the policy was upheld. "Equality is secured 
not only when equals are treated equally, but also when unequals are treated 
unequally," it ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said 50% should be the ceiling for quotas. Still, the controversy 
goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the southern state of Karnataka enacted a 73% quota for state 
jobs, leaving only 27% to be given on a merit basis. Tamil Nadu, the southern 
state where job quotas were first introduced in the 1920s, legislated a 69% 
quota. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the policy worked? 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of India's 180 million Untouchables and tribespeople still 
live in undeveloped villages, shantytowns or urban slums. India's middle class 
is still overwhelmingly from the Brahmin and other upper castes, said Dhirubhai 
Sheth at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 But increasingly, political power is flowing to the lower castes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change is incremental. A one-stroke revolution has never been possible," said 
Sheth.

DIET WOES DANGER FOR DANCERS; DISORDERS: UNHEALTHY THINNESS MAY BE AN 
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD FOR MANY IN THE PROFESSION. THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ARE LESS 
LIKELY TO ABUSE DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unhealthy thinness may not simply be an occupational hazard for ballet 
dancers. Some researchers fear that it may also be an occupational disease. 
</P>
<P>
 One report finds many dancers have eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also indicates that dancers' problems may not be as bad as those 
facing non-dancers who have eating disorders. It says non-dancers are more 
likely to also abuse drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 This may mean the dancers' weight problems are driven more by the demands of 
their profession, the researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The report in the American College of Sports Medicine's journal, Exercise and 
Science in Sports and Medicine, compared 50 dancers with 56 non-dancers, all 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers used questionnaires and clinical interviews to check for 
eating disorders and substance abuse. They also looked for medical problems 
including weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers were primarily drawn from national and regional ballet companies; 
the non-dancers, primarily from private high schools and colleges. Dancers 
averaged 21 years of age; non-dancers, 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six percent of each group had missed periods for five months or more. 
Although this can result from high levels of exercise, it also can result from 
a sharply restricted diet. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers averaged almost 11% below ideal weight, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a normal person to try to keep our weight down there, we would have to 
starve ourselves," said Dr. Michelle P. Warren of Columbia College of 
Physicians and Surgeons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-dancers' weight averaged about 5% low, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-dancers also "do not represent a normal population in terms of normal 
eating," said Warren, an associate professor. "These people were struggling to 
stay thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one percent of dancers met clinical definitions of anorexia nervosa, 
which is characterized by a pathological fear of weight gain. Fifteen percent 
of non-dancers did, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this greater tendency of dancers to have anorexia fell short of the 
statistical level needed to say that the two groups were clearly different. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups had no statistical difference in the prevalence of bulimia, which 
is characterized by compulsive eating followed by self-induced vomiting. Twelve 
percent of dancers and 15% of non-dancers had this condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren and her colleagues wanted to know about drug use in each group, 
thinking that a greater tendency to use drugs would indicate greater 
psychological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers who had anorexia or bulimia were no more likely than other dancers to 
use drugs, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-dancers who had anorexia were more likely to use amphetamines, while 
non-dancers who had bulimia were more likely to use amphetamines, barbiturates 
and hallucinogens, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-dancers also were more likely than dancers to develop other signs of 
emotional distress, such as anxiety and depression, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 This indicates that at least part of dancers' preoccupation with thinness "is 
imposed upon them by their profession," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate researcher who also had been studying the eating patterns of 
dancers agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found almost no substance abuse," said Jane Bonbright, a board member 
of the National Dance Assn., an educators' professional group in Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren and Bonbright are concerned that dancers are not getting enough calcium 
to build strong bones while they are relatively young. They say the dancers may 
suffer for this after menopause by developing osteoporosis, a thinning of bone, 
which can led to fractures.

WHITE HOUSE WARMS TO GHOSTS FROM CHRISTMASES PAST; YULETIDE: JEFFERSON PLAYED 
THE VIOLIN. JACKSON SHED TEARS OVER TRINKETS. THE CLINTON TREE STANDS AMID 
BRIGADES OF TOY SOLDIERS, PLATOONS OF CANDY CANES AND POINSETTIAS.

<P>
 Amid the garlands of evergreen, the red-ribboned wreaths, the spruce and pine 
spangled with ornament and light, the White House harbors many ghosts of 
Christmas past. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the contemporary sparkle are nearly two centuries of memories: 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson bringing out his violin to play for a Christmas gathering of 
children. Andrew Jackson, remembering his own poor and painful childhood, 
shedding a tear over the Christmas trinkets given him by his nephews and 
nieces. Abraham Lincoln strolling out to Pennsylvania Avenue to buy a toy 
soldier for a young son. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent decades, Christmas at the White House has become an elaborately 
choreographed and costly public display. 
</P>
<P>
 This year some 30,000 people will troop through the marble halls to see Bill 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Christmas decor. They'll see the light-bedecked 
Christmas tree reaching to the Blue Room ceiling. They'll be surrounded by 
brigades of toy soldiers, platoons of candy canes, acres of poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Roosevelts' informality to the military correctness of the rites of 
the Truman and Eisenhower years, the story of Christmas at the White House has 
evolved into its present-day extravaganzas organized and executed by a 
battalion of staff members and consulting professionals," said writer Alvin 
Rosenbaum in his 1992 book, "A White House Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Stories abound from those earlier holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Civil War year when Tad Lincoln tearfully intervened with his 
father and won a presidential pardon and years of pampered celebrity status for 
"Jack," the turkey intended to be the main course for the Lincoln family 
Christmas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1864, Lincoln, his war anxiety lifting, read aloud a telegram 
from Lt. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman at the end of his army's march through 
Georgia: "I beg to present to you as a Christmas present the city of Savannah . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 According to one story, Franklin Pierce installed the first Christmas tree as 
a holiday innovation in 1853. Others say that didn't happen until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1889, in the Benjamin Harrison Administration, the tree was a 
well-established tradition as described in Edna M. Coleman's 1927 book, "White 
House Gossip From Andrew Johnson To Calvin Coolidge." 
</P>
<P>
 "A very large, gorgeous tree was put up in the library, in the trimming of 
which the President, his family and the staff assisted. It carried toys not 
only for the children of the family but for everyone attached to the White 
House and their families. Around it, too, were piled the hundreds of gifts and 
remembrances sent by friends and presidential admirers." 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Roosevelt bucked that tradition when he entered the White House. 
Cutting down healthy trees and discarding them after a brief display went 
against his conservationist grain. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1983 book, "Christmas In The White House," an encyclopedic look at 
Christmas customs at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., author Albert J. Menendez recounts 
that the President's children were so disappointed -- and public opinion so 
hostile -- that Roosevelt relented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's heart was touched and he no longer prohibited a tree," 
Menendez wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1902, his first White House Christmas, Roosevelt wrote this account: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday morning at a quarter to seven all the children were up and dressed 
and began to hammer at the door of their mother's and my room, in which their 
six stockings, all bulging out with queer angles and rotundities, were hanging 
from the fireplace . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But first there was a surprise for me and their good mother, for Archie had a 
little Christmas tree of his own which he had rigged up with the help of one of 
the carpenters in a big closet; and we all of us had to look at the tree and 
each of us got a present off of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, Calvin Coolidge pressed the button to light the first National 
Christmas tree. Characteristically, "Silent Cal" refused to make a speech. And, 
ironically, the ceremony itself had a commercial core: It was inspired by 
lobbyists for the electric light industry to create a market for outdoor 
holiday lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all White House Christmases have followed the holiday script. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster struck Herbert Hoover's White House on Christmas Eve 1929, following 
close on October's stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire broke out in the West Wing during an icy evening and destroyed the 
executive offices of the President. Hoover, in evening dress, marched grimly 
out of a Christmas party and puffed on a cigar as he watched 16 fire engines 
fight a losing battle with the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the White House his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, kept the party bubbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt was determined to keep Christmas well despite the 
Great Depression and World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roosevelts always insisted on real candles on the Christmas trees in their 
family quarters despite the protests of insurance underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Roosevelt said: "A tree doesn't look right without real candles and 
does not give the right atmosphere unless it smells of hot evergreen." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Roosevelt, writing in "As He Saw It" in 1946, remembered the last 
Roosevelt family Christmas in the White House: 
</P>
<P>
 "The center table in the long living room was pushed back, the Christmas tree 
was in place and decorated, the piles of presents were ready for the unwrapping 
-- each person's pile heaped on a separate chair. And on Christmas Eve father 
took his accustomed rocker to one side of the fireplace, and opened the 
familiar book, while we all found places around him." 
</P>
<P>
 The President read Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" to the children every 
White House Christmas, using his resonant voice to portray Scrooge and Tiny Tim 
and the ghosts of Christmases past, present and yet to come.

WHEN 911 CALLS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 911 mistakes occur, the results often are horrendous, seeming to 
obliterate the rescues operators make around the clock day after day after day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia on Nov. 11, for example, a flurry of calls about roving thugs 
got less than good attention. When they finally evoked a response, a boy had 
been beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just concerns me that people around the country may begin to doubt the 
effectiveness of their own systems because of this one incident," said Kevin 
Duffy, a spokesman for the Assn. of Public Safety Communications Officials 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators around the country handle millions of 911 calls a day, Duffy said, 
"and they're all handled well." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the recent Philadelphia tragedy evokes memories of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five days before, a man died of a heart attack in Castleberry, Ala., a 
town of 670 people, while his wife dialed 911 for help and got no answer. 
That's when county authorities discovered the 911 phone line had been out of 
order 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 When a house fire killed three children in Portland, Ore., in 1991, the city's 
understaffed 911 system was held partly to blame for a 25-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
 San Franciscans still recall what happened to the college student who called 
911 at 1 a.m. in 1990 from a closed service station where his broken-down car 
had been towed. "Someone is breaking into my car and I need help!" he told the 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite sounds of a struggle and the young man's shouts, the operator gave the 
call a low priority. Scott Quackenbush's father found him days later, beaten to 
death, behind the gasoline station. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, a Los Angeles woman called 911 after being told her estranged husband 
was on his way to her 27th birthday party to kill her. The operator said she 
should call back. When her husband turned up, he burst in firing a handgun and 
killed her -- and three other women, as well.

BULGARIA SEEKS ECONOMIC BOOST IN ARMS; EASTERN BLOC: SOME OFFICIALS SAY 
ARMAMENT EXPORTS REMAIN FAR BELOW THE 1980S. THEY PREDICT INEFFICIENT FACTORIES 
WILL HAVE TROUBLE COMPETING IN THE WORLD MARKET. 
</P>

<P>
 Desperate for ways to recover from its post-Communist economic slide, Bulgaria 
is turning again to the arms industry -- the motor of the national economy 
before the Soviet bloc collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Government ministers no longer heed Western demands that the arms industry 
convert to civilian production. Orders for weapons are rising again, bringing 
jobs to a poor nation with 16% unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 But some officials say arms exports remain far below the high point of the 
1980s and predict Bulgaria's inefficient arms factories will have trouble 
competing in the world market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's post-Communist rulers inherited an enormous foreign debt -- $12.9 
billion -- run up under the longtime rule of Stalinist strongman Todor Zhivkov. 
They hope a resurgent arms industry will boost foreign revenues and help reduce 
that debt while bolstering the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are coming back on the market, indeed slowly and with difficulties, but we 
are returning," said Ivan Kolev, deputy chairman of the state commission on the 
arms industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling the emphasis on weapons exports, Bulgaria held its first 
international arms fair in Plovdiv in November. It was the first time 
Bulgarians were given a glimpse of the deadly products that once kept the 
Communist state afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair bristled with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, armored personnel 
carriers, rifles, pistols, ammunition, radios, radar, optical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weapons were standard fare also produced under communism. Just as then, 
the state arms dealers were mum about potential customers and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolev said about 5,000 workers were added by arms producers in 1994. The 
industry employs 140,000 people directly and as many as 300,000 in related 
sectors, about 12% of Bulgaria's work force of 4 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Details on arms sales always were -- and remain -- a closely guarded secret. 
But speaking on condition of anonymity, experts said arms exports in the late 
1980s totaled $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 After Zhivkov was ousted in 1989, Bulgaria and many other former Soviet bloc 
countries heeded advice from the West to convert military production to 
civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, with moves toward a free market paralyzed by political infighting, 
Bulgarians decided that conversion did not pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a chance I would impose a ban on the word 'conversion,' " Defense 
Minister Boiko Noev said during the Plovdiv arms fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time when Bulgarian military plants produced jar tops has already gone. 
Highly qualified experts will now manufacture what they are used to -- 
top-level weapons," Noev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria became a major weapons exporter during the 1960s. Its Warsaw Pact 
allies, several Middle Eastern countries and Communist-oriented nations in 
Latin America, Africa and Asia were major clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the arms trade collapsed as communism crumbled. East European clients were 
no longer interested, preferring to spend their limited cash on higher quality 
weapons manufactured in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major purchaser, the Bulgarian army, is little help. The Ministry of 
Defense estimates about 20% to 30% of the army's equipment is "practically 
unusable," but it has only $23 million for modernization and technical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolev said he was encouraged because arms sales in the first half of 1994 were 
twice the total for all of 1993. He would not release specific figures.

 At least 20 Christmas holiday travelers died and 20 were injured Friday when 
two buses collided on the Pan American Highway near the fishing town of 
Chimbote on Peru's north coast, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Chimbote said a bus heading south to Lima and another northbound for 
Chimbote crashed head-on near the port of Samanco about 255 miles north of 
Lima.

CREEPY-CRAWLIES TICKLE TASTE BUDS; CULINARY: FOR STARTERS, MEXICAN MENUS MAY 
FEATURE SUCH DELICACIES AS ANT PUPAE AND BUTTERFLY AND MOTH LARVAE. PALM GRUBS 
ARE A POPULAR FOOD ON THREE CONTINENTS.

 The Insect Club in downtown Washington, D.C., has suffered a setback. Gone 
from the menu are crispy cricketburgers, mealworm won tons and pizzas with 
cricket toppings. 
</P>
<P>
 The chef who created these culinary delights left, so now the nightclub's more 
adventuresome customers can get in tune with the creepy decor by munching trail 
mix laced with baked crickets and mealworms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to keep serving bugs in some form," explained co-owner Rob Newkirk. 
"Our customers demanded it. Regulars bring their friends here to try them. It's 
sort of a rite of passage." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people in the United States, Canada and Europe won't even touch a bug, 
much less eat one. But in Mexico, Latin America, Africa, Asia and Australia, 
creative recipes for winged and crawly things abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a revival of insect-eating in Mexico," said Darna L. Dufour, an 
anthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder. "Mexicans now have 
quite an elaborate insect cuisine that's served in some fine restaurants. It 
may be a back-to-their-roots kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican menus may feature such delicacies as ant pupae and butterfly and moth 
larvae, fried or roasted in butter, chili or garlic sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, grilled queen ants are a seasonal specialty relished by the 
affluent. Dufour remembers trying them during a reception at the U.S. Embassy 
in Bogota. "They had a strong taste, kind of like bacon bits," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Weevil larvae, known as palm grubs and roughly "the size of small mice," are a 
popular food in South America, Africa and Asia, Dufour said. Amazonians 
sometimes cultivate them by felling palm trees, which are then invaded by 
weevils that produce several pounds of grubs per tree in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Amazonian Indians serve the white, fatty-looking creatures smoked. Dufour 
compares their appearance to German bratwurst. "The grubs have a strong, cheesy 
taste," she said. "You either like them or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The insect epicure cautioned against over-large servings of South American 
termites: "Too many can give you heartburn." 
</P>
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, most people consume at least one species of 
caterpillar. The mopanie worm, known as "the snack that crawls," is a favorite 
African food that is fried, dried or stewed in tomato sauce. The tasty insect 
has become so popular that people fear it may be eaten to extinction in some 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some trendy Australian restaurants are featuring bush tucker, which includes 
the original foods of the Aborigines, such as witchetty grubs," said Gene R. 
DeFoliart, a University of Wisconsin entomologist and editor of The Food 
Insects Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, "Grasshoppers as big as your thumb, stuffed with minced peanuts, 
often make a formidable piece de resistance, " said Vietnamese-born Germaine 
Swanson, a Washington restaurateur. But, she made it clear, they're not part of 
the cuisine at her establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Insects double as food and medicine in China. No prescriptions are needed for 
ant concoctions in wine, syrups, pastes and powder, which are used to treat 
everything from asthma to insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The outstanding performance of a women's track team at a September, 1993, meet 
in Beijing aroused suspicions of steroids or other drugs -- until the coach 
revealed a well-guarded secret. He attributed his hard-charging team's success 
to quaffing large quantities of a potion brewed from a rare worm found on 
western China's high plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that some insects are rich in minerals and vitamins. 
Studies by experts in many parts of the world have concluded that the increased 
use of insects as food could provide more nutrition in many poor countries. 
Bugs could also bolster local economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If insects become more widely accepted as a respectable food item in the 
industrial countries," DeFoliart said, "the economic implications are obvious. 
They would form a whole new class of foods made to order for low-input business 
and small-farm production. International trade in edible insects would almost 
certainly increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Dufour compares the food value of ants, palm grubs and caterpillars to that of 
goose liver, pork sausage and beef liver. She found that some Amazonian insects 
contain more protein than dried fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Using crickets and long-horned grasshoppers in protein feeds for animals, 
DeFoliart found the quality to be as high as soybean-based meals. 
</P>
<P>
 For human gastronomes, recipes in DeFoliart's newsletter have included 
caterpillar crunch, grasshopper fritters and mealworm quiche. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance that creepy-crawlies will tickle American, Canadian and European 
palates on a large scale any time soon? Slim. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Americans who patronize "more yuppified restaurants" -- Dufour's 
description -- already consume them without realizing it. Nasturtium flowers, a 
salad ingredient, frequently conceal tiny insects beneath the petals.

EASTSIDE, WESTSIDE, ALL AROUND THE TOWN, GIULIANI IS KNOWN; NEW YORK: THERE 
HAVE BEEN MISCUES, TO BE SURE, BUT THE MAYOR ENJOYS A 70% APPROVAL RATING. 
BLOODIED BUT UNBOWED, HE IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER IN A TOWN THAT PRIZES 'HIS 
HONOR'S' INDEPENDENCE.

 In this year of voter revolt, in this city of paleo-liberal gridlock, an 
incumbent named Rudy Giuliani has cracked down on squeegee men, panhandlers, 
unlicensed food vendors, three-card monte dealers, underage drinkers, truants, 
prostitutes, unlicensed drivers and sidewalk cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 He has ordered the biggest cuts in city government since the fiscal crisis 15 
years ago, starting with more than 100 positions in his own office. 
</P>
<P>
 He has suffered defeats, as well -- most notably and recently, after his 
endorsement of extremely Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over GOP nominee George 
Pataki. Cuomo's loss left Giuliani bloodied but unbowed -- and more popular 
than ever in a town that prizes its mayor's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters want politicians to be like them -- straight, honest," Giuliani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A politician, perhaps, like Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-year-old former prosecutor who grew up in the days before the Dodgers 
moved out and the underclass moved in. A man with a slight lisp and a major 
comb-over, who likes to spend New Year's Eve dancing in his living room with 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A New Yorker who lacks sugar-coating. When a high school student asked about 
prospects for a government scholarship to law school, Giuliani told her she'd 
have to raise the money herself, just like he did. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was invited to visit a former squeegee man who had, as Giuliani 
suggested, gotten a job washing dishes in a restaurant, the mayor said he would 
wait until next year to see if the man could hold the job. 
</P>
<P>
 After a speaker at a neighborhood meeting in Greenwich Village complained 
about the street noise from portable "boom boxes," the mayor hopped into his 
car to check things out. 
</P>
<P>
 He found not only boom boxes, but crowds of kids wandering the streets, 
drinking beer and raising hell. "We've got to do something," an upset Giuliani 
told aides. The crackdown on noise and public drinking followed. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, Giuliani's New York seems safer, cleaner and quieter, a place where 
truants must hide and panhandlers have lost their swagger, where the jails are 
bursting with drug peddlers and the sidewalks are free of nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's half mirage. A pot dealer on Eighth Avenue still mutters 
"Smoke." Kids still play hooky at Coney Island's video game arcades. A 
prostitute still works the shoulder of the Cross Bronx Expressway now and then 
during the morning rush. 
</P>
<P>
 But historian Thomas Kessner says impressions are important: "He's banking on 
the notion that if people feel things are better, then they can actually get 
better over the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Fiorello LaGuardia's first term, exactly 60 years ago, has the city 
seen such a blast of reform. Again, a Republican of Italian descent, elected as 
a fusion candidate, has taken office in a Democratic city facing a fiscal 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani's independence from some municipal employee unions has allowed him to 
negotiate the first severance deals ever for city workers. By June, severance 
and attrition are supposed to have reduced the municipal work force by almost 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the implicit threat to contract out services now provided by the 
city, he hammered out new contracts with sanitation workers and school 
custodians. The former, notorious for knocking off at midafternoon, must 
collect 20% more garbage (as well as put in a full day's work); the latter will 
now have to wash the floors if the principal says to. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani has won support for his agenda by dramatically creating a sense of 
purpose. "There is a line that has to be drawn if you want to have a civilized 
city," he said the day he announced his quality of life offensive. "This is the 
line.' 
</P>
<P>
 The police, accordingly, have been given decibel meters and told to nab noise 
law breakers. They have been sent to Central Park with orders to move the 
homeless into shelters. They have been sent on horseback to 125th Street to 
stop illegal street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: a 70% approval rating (in a city that is only 14% Republican). 
</P>
<P>
 But that was civics; the governor's race was politics, and Giuliani performed 
with more verve than he did in either of his own mayoral campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani didn't just stump FOR Cuomo; he stumped AGAINST Pataki -- and 
Pataki's patron, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 A Pataki victory, Rudy crowed at one point, would mean "government of Al 
D'Amato . . . by Al D'Amato . . . and for Al D'Amato!"

 Instead of repenting when Cuomo lost, Rudy hugged him on stage and said he'd 
do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Giuliani faces more potholes than a New York taxi. Pataki, who comes 
into office with little incentive to help Giuliani or the city, and D'Amato, a 
political animal with a reputation for getting mad AND getting even, are just 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Giuliani probably won't surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't succumb to the feeling that you can't make a difference," he said the 
day he backed Cuomo. "And please don't succumb to the notion that politics 
cannot change."

RANKING OF NAVAJO AS POOREST OF INDIANS OVERLOOKS PECULIARITIES OF WEALTH;

 Leroy Yellowhair lives in a cramped, one-room home carved out of a dirt hill. 
The roof is draped with plastic bags to keep out dust and rain. A stove 
concocted from the bottom of a corroded oil drum heats the center of the 
circular room. 
</P>
<P>
 The dugout and the scrap metal, broken crates and more rusty oil drums 
littered around it stand in contrast to the stark beauty of the muddy red 
cliffs and canyon the home overlooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all I've known," the 48-year-old Navajo said of the home where he lives 
with his younger brother and their 75-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navajo Nation, an area the size of West Virginia that stretches across 
northeastern Arizona and portions of New Mexico and Utah, is home to the 
poorest of the 10 largest Indian tribes, the Census Bureau recently reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on 1990 census figures, the tribe had the highest proportion of people 
in poverty, 48.8%, and the lowest median family income, $13,940. The Navajo 
also had the lowest per capita income, $4,788. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iroquois, situated mostly in Upstate New York, had the smallest share of 
tribal members living in poverty, 20.1%. The median family income for the 
Iroquois was $27,205, while the per capita income was $10,568. 
</P>
<P>
 Navajo officials and Indian rights advocates say the statistics overlook 
factors unique to tribal culture -- a thriving barter economy and a philosophy 
of wealth that's difficult to judge by mainstream American standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised by the census figures. It shows the great need to educate 
the federal government on what is happening," said Duane Beyal, a spokesman for 
Navajo Tribal President Peterson Zah. 
</P>
<P>
 LaDonna Harris, director of Americans for Indian Opportunity, said that one of 
the nation's poorest rural tribes -- she wouldn't say which one -- had a 
$10-million barter economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among Indians, possession is never perceived as a form of wealth -- unless 
you can give it away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the primary sources of income on the Navajo Reservation are mining, 
tribal government, agriculture and the sale of native art. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Navajo had hoped casino gambling on the reservation would generate enough 
revenue to reduce an unemployment rate of 30% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navajo voters, worried about the effect on their culture, narrowly 
rejected gambling in a referendum recently at a time when many other tribes 
have turned to casinos as a major source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the economic disparity among tribes may be a matter of 
geography, said Mary Helen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, the Iroquois are in a demographic area of large populations and 
are in a better position to attract more economic development," she said. "The 
Navajo are in a more isolated situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Bitsuie, executive director of the Navajo-Hopi Land Commission office in 
Window Rock, said some of the Navajo living without electricity or running 
water have simply chosen a traditional way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Navajo gauge wealth by such factors as family structure and the ability 
to pass on cultural skills like rug weaving and jewelry making, said Percy 
Deal, a Navajo County supervisor. Owning livestock also is a determinant of 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of economic and religious value in livestock. Caring for 
livestock teaches responsibility and having enough of it means you are not 
poor, even if you live in a hogan with a dirt floor," Deal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Wharton, a lawyer with the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colo., 
said the census figures obscure serious health issues affecting Indians, such 
as high infant mortality and a greater incidence of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the federal government is doing is to provide programs through the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, Housing and Urban 
Development and other federal program agencies that are largely unrelated to 
real local priorities and concerns because they are nationally managed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While tribal members like Yellowhair are considered poor even by Navajo 
standards, others like Freddie Hatathlie are seen as fairly well off, although 
he, too, would be classified by the U.S. government as living below the poverty 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatathlie, a plant operator at a power plant in Page, lives in a spacious but 
rundown stone-brick hogan outside Tuba City. 
</P>
<P>
 His home and his parents' nearby sit on land that was recently turned over to 
the Hopi tribe by the U.S. government. Repairs and other improvements are 
forbidden without approval from Hopi officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That has meant living with cracked windows and missing floor tiles. It also 
means the family has had to leave a third hogan -- an octagonal log cabin -- 
unoccupied because of a sagging roof and termite-infested walls. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 siblings who often visit and stay over, the number of people in 
Hatathlie's household fluctuates, making it hard to calculate per capita income 
or other government measures of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of money, I'm just like anybody else," he said. "But yes, I consider 
myself rich."

AGELESS BEAUTY; PORTRAITS: PHOTOGRAPHER CAPTURES A SENSE OF POWER IN JAPAN'S 
CENTENARIANS, WHO ARE UNBOWED BY THEIR FRAILTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Photographer Shoichi Ono is only 31. But he finds beauty and poetry in the 
lives of his centenarian subjects. "I have the impression that these people 
have the universe in their time," he said. "Light and life." 
</P>
<P>
 Light, in fact, is what drew the free-lance photographer to spend two years 
photographing people more than 100 years old, from all over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he saw a cedar said to be 7,200 years old. What impressed him the most, 
he said, was imagining the light the tree must have been bathed in over the 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In his collection of portraits of 104 centenarians, Ono looks for that light. 
</P>
<P>
 To find his subjects, Ono scoured newspapers in libraries, finding the names 
of local centenarians. Japan leads the world in life expectancy, with nearly 
6,000 citizens aged 100 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent weeks with some subjects, visiting their homes, talking to their 
families. He learned their lives; he spent time where they had spent theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ono, who has the soft manner and contemplative air of a philosopher, said he 
was humbled by his subjects' grace and fascinated by their life stories. But 
the strongest impression, he said, was a sense of power beyond human reach in 
the frailest bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken with a 4x5 view camera, Ono's portraits speak of light and shadow. In a 
century-long life in Japan, his subjects have lived through war, deprivation 
and finally prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is an unacknowledged companion, but most of his subjects have enjoyed 
extraordinarily good health. Ono attributes his subjects' longevity to their 
attachments to friends and relations, and their pleasure in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even small tasks, like weeding the garden or chanting a sutra, give a sense of 
meaning, he said. One of his subjects plays gateball, a kind of croquet. That 
same man told Ono he likes to hang out with younger people. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he is talking about people in their 70s," said Ono. 
</P>
<P>
 His past works include a series of photos of a dancer, Kazuo Ohno, and a 
collection of pictures of a Tokyo garbage dump. For his next project, Ono wants 
to photograph the centenarians with their great-great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is refreshed by the freedom and fearlessness of his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy told me, 'Once you hit 100, there is nothing to fear at all,' " he 
said.

MAYAN WAYS MAY SAVE RAIN FOREST; GUATEMALA: INDIANS ARE RENOUNCING THE 
SLASH-AND-BURN TECHNIQUE IN FAVOR OF INTERPLANTING, AN ANCIENT FARMING METHOD 
THAT ENRICHES DEPLETED SOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTENA COLCLOUGH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maya-descended Indians in northeastern Guatemala are being encouraged to 
revert to ancestral methods of farming in an effort to save the Peten jungle, 
Latin America's second-largest tropical rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment aims to replace the traditional slash-and-burn method by what 
is called interplanting, a method that also enriches the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, the Peten Indians have planted their corn and other grains in 
jungle clearings. 
</P>
<P>
 When the soil becomes depleted every two years or so, they move on, clear a 
new area, sell the wood, burn the underbrush and plant their crops again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the private, nonprofit Rodale Institute is persuading them to stay where 
they are and plant such natural fertilizers as velvet beans between the rows of 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 When the corn is harvested, the beans are plowed under; in that way, the 
nitrogen content of the soil is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, for those who do not slash and burn, the Pennsylvania-based institute 
will help them stop using chemical fertilizers, virtually all of which are 
harmful to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The institute's aim is to teach people how to modify agricultural production 
systems dangerous to the rain forest and adopt positive land management," said 
Sergio Ruano, a member of the Rodale team. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment began last year when Rodale workers distributed velvet beans to 
10 families. 
</P>
<P>
 At harvest time, the families were asked to repay the beans to a small 
non-governmental organization and introduce five more neighbors to the project 
with the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 It has since extended to 62 communities; in five years, the institute hopes to 
have enrolled 30,000 families in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peten covers 3.9 million acres, but has only 400,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute experts believe the project stands a good chance of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the Maya used slash-and-burn methods of farming. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Spanish conquerors arrived, they had started to look at 
alternative methods, but then those methods fell into disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are also encouraged to cultivate breadfruit, a nutritious staple 
favored by the ancient Mayas that does not harm the land and requires little 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodale researchers in the Peten community of Motul San Jose also are 
investigating other ancient Mayan cultivation techniques, including the use of 
raised gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruano said the project is studying those techniques to improve and capitalize 
on the ancients' knowledge of how to maximize production without damaging the 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Gustavo Porras Castejon, an independent anthropologist, put it: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mayas made an effort to ecologically adapt to their environment and were 
capable of achieving productive agriculture without destroying the entire 
forest."

THIEVES STEAL LIVING TREE HONORING DEAD BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a solemn moment five years ago, Paul Laming planted a tree to honor his 
dead brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the tree is gone, too -- cut down and stolen from Laming's front yard in 
broad daylight while he was running an errand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I've had a piece of my heart taken out twice," Laming said Friday. "What 
do they want next? A pint of blood, or a gallon?" 
</P>
<P>
 Laming and his father planted the tree in May, 1989, two months after George 
Laming died of a heart attack at age 35. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-foot tree grew to 11 feet and dominated the front yard. It even became a 
neighborhood landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped that maybe a part of him in spirit would go on," Laming said. "It's 
kind of ironic because his life was cut short and so was the tree's."

JOLLY ELF, 1,714 YEARS OLD TODAY, IN PRINT WITH THE INSIDE STORY; CHRISTMAS: 
SANTA RELATES IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY HOW HIS LEGEND UNFOLDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus, also known as St. Nicholas, Pere Noel, Father Christmas, Bafana 
as he is known in Italy, has written his autobiography at long last, aided and 
abetted by a Texas journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Guinn of the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, editor of "The Autobiography of 
Santa Claus: It's Better to Give," set up an interview with the jolly old man. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa speaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in the year 280 in a country called Lycia, which has become part 
of Turkey. So I imagine that makes me 1,714 years old this Christmas. But I 
still feel fine, very spry. I stopped aging apparently when I was 63 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important things for people to realize is the difference 
between magic and illusion. Illusion is something that can finally be 
explained. And in the book I try to explain some of the illusion of my legend, 
going down chimneys, etc. Magic is something that simply is. I've never 
understood why I stopped aging. Maybe if I live another few hundred years, I 
might." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa's book says he was born to affluent but aging parents in the town of 
Patara. They died within months of each other when he was 9. He learned several 
languages and he was something of a scholar in the polyglot Middle East. Named 
Nicholas (which means "Victorious"), he was put in the care of priests, and 
stayed at the local inn, financed with the considerable purse left by his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a gnawing guilt because he had so much while all around him had so 
little. An old priest named Philip told him that the richest men in heaven 
would be those who gave the most on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Christmas present he gave was money enough for dowry for three 
unmarried daughters of an impoverished man in Patara. 
</P>
<P>
 At first mistaken for a thief, he left 12 silver coins in their stockings, 
which enabled them to marry and live happy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, he realized that his philanthropy would require help. His 
first recruit was a man named Felix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Felix guesses that his ancestors might have been Jewish and might have been 
brought to Rome after the sacking of the Temple in Jerusalem in the year 87." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, Santa met and married Layla, who has been instrumental in his 
life and his philanthropy. It was she, for instance, who recommended that they 
stop doling out food and clothing and begin delivering toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa remembers: "After giving gifts and food to needy children for several 
hundred years, we began to feel very frustrated because no matter how many 
children we were able to help, there were always far more in need and even 
after we fed children the equivalent of a meal, they would be hungry again the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Layla suggested that the children needed to be reminded that there was joy 
and goodness in the world, in life. And if we could give them toys instead, 
they would have something lasting, a memento that there is someone who cares 
for them, who loves them." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he picked other helpers, St. Francis of Assisi, a war chief 
from England named Arthur who fable knows as King Arthur, Ben Franklin, Attila 
the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
 Attila, who had tired of war, was and is a great help as Santa skirts 
battlefields with his small but growing band. There are now 185 in his ageless 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the benefits for my helpers is that they, too, stop aging," Santa 
says. "Felix, who is my oldest companion, is almost 1,600 years old, as is 
Layla. Layla still looks as young as she did when I met her. She asks often and 
I reassure her." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he wait so long to tell his story? 
</P>
<P>
 "Layla has been after me to do it ever since Clement Moore (now one of Santa's 
group at the North Pole) wrote, ' 'Twas The Night Before Christmas,' because in 
it he referred to me as an elf, and I'm a full-sized man. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you read about when the first Christmas carol was written or the first 
Christmas tree decorated, this is the real history. Whether you're 6 years old 
or you're reading it to your grandchildren you'll get a better sense of how we 
came to the modern-day Christmas, how it's been an evolution of so many 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa now operates a global enterprise. The erstwhile King Arthur runs the toy 
enterprises in Europe, but with operations expanding into Eastern Europe he has 
his hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attila has become quite interested in video games. One of the ways we pay for 
operations is to design video games software for some of the big 
manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the staff are Santa's personal navigator, Amelia Earhart, and Western 
toy designer, Bill Pickett, the first great black rodeo cowboy, and Willie 
Skokan, the great Czechoslovakian artisan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that children will learn from this book that gender and ethnicity 
don't have a thing to do with what people can accomplish," Santa says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clement Moore wrote his poem, "it caused an awful stir for all of us. It 
was necessary for Leonardo to invent a sled that could fly." Ben Franklin and 
Willie Skokan had to train eight reindeer to run fast enough to become 
airborne. Then Santa had to overcome his fear of heights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the few skeptics left in the world, Santa would refer them to the letter 
newsman Francis Church wrote to 8-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon in the New York 
Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Church's reply was so perfect I found myself wondering if Felix and Ben 
Franklin might have written it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Church assured Virginia there is a Santa Claus. "Thank God, he lives and lives 
forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10 thousand years 
from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood."

BLUE FLORIDA KEYS REFLECT NEW HEW: DIRTY BLACK; POLLUTION: THEIR SWEET TROPICAL 
AROMA IS A BARNYARD STINK. THEIR CORAL REEFS HAVE CANCER. UNLESS AN ECOSYSTEM 
IS SAVED SOON, AN ECONOMY WILL DIE AS WELL.

 Amy Knowles steers her skiff near an area of dead mangroves in Florida Bay, 
searching in vain for clear water. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterflies, white specks of life, flutter in ironic beauty among the dead and 
dying trees, but the bay itself, once clear as tap water, is lifeless. Once 
near Islamorada in the Keys the water was aqua, then it turned green, now it is 
black as coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The tide is out. Clumps of dead turtle grass lie on the surface. A barnyard 
smell permeates the fetid air, normal ammonia discharge gone haywire in what is 
essentially a compost stew. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the stench of a dying ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100,000 acres of sea grass and sponges are dead in the bay. This has 
created a mushy under-layer that feeds algae blooms. The slime smothers life 
that used to nurture lobsters, pink shrimp, a host of fin fish and all types of 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody paid any attention until last year when the blooms started to affect 
the coral reef track," Knowles said. "Then it was something you couldn't close 
your eyes to." 
</P>
<P>
 The blooms eat up the 1,000-square-mile fish nursery off the edge of the 
Florida peninsula like a cancer. Even worse, researchers believe the bay's 
altered water is spreading under channels beyond the Keys into the Atlantic 
Ocean. On North America's only coral barrier reef, coral is dying at an 
alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blame much of the bay's problem on the diversion of fresh water from the 
Everglades, which is also having devastating consequences on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 While environmentalists, regulators and farmers argued in court over who 
should pay to clean up and restore the Everglades, the rest of the watershed 
ecosystem -- Florida Bay and the colorful coral reefs -- were ignored until 
just recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lawton Chiles angered environmentalists by pushing legislation that they 
believe will delay cleaning up pollution in the Everglades by a decade. Under 
the $685-million restoration plan, a system of giant marshes will be created to 
filter out pollution from sugar growers and vegetable farmers in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation includes a plan to put more fresh water into Florida Bay by 
flooding some farmland south of Miami -- a plan already facing fierce 
opposition from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles, in her skiff, is determined to find some clear water on this 
four-hour trip around Florida Bay. She finds some around Rabbit Key Basin, but 
says it "really wasn't that clear." 
</P>
<P>
 She should know. She has fished in these parts for more than a decade and 
teaches people how to fly-fish. She scans the water searching for tarpon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most exciting thing I can think of," she says when she spots a 
school of the shimmering, big-eyed fish -- some 5 feet long -- hanging out near 
a dock. 
</P>
<P>
 The water at Rabbit Key Basin may not be up to the Knowles standard, but it is 
at least a glimpse of what Florida Bay looked like just a few years ago: miles 
of water tinged tawny by the mangroves on mud islands, but always clear enough 
to see the sea grass sway beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so wonderful to go exploring back here," Knowles says as she navigates 
her skiff over the flats. "Now I get very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Florida Keys make their money from the water. The bay 
produces $420 million a year in commercial fish and shrimp catches, about 
one-fifth of Florida's total harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ecosystem fails, it will take an entire economy with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Lessard, a fisherman, has trolled the waters for 24 years, searching 
mainly for lobsters and stone crabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of Marathon in the early 1970s, there were 25 shrimp boats," he said. "We 
no longer have a single shrimp boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessard estimates that 20% to 35% of commercial fishermen have left the Keys 
in the last decade in search of better waters or a new profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen say their catch has declined as much as 80% since 1981 on species 
such as pink shrimp. Ironically, pink shrimp catches increased 64% last year 
for the first time since the algae blooms appeared in 1987. The shrimp, 
however, were scrawny, and some believe the catch increased because fish no 
longer could see the shrimp in the murky blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessard first noticed the greening of the bay in the 1970s in an area he used 
to fish that's now known as the Dead Zone. These days, he said, he must wake at 
3 a.m. and take his boat 30 to 50 miles out to catch enough fish to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problem is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessard now sees the algae blooms hurting recreational fishing and other 
industries vital to the Keys' economy. This spring, scuba-diving trips to the 
reef were canceled when visibility dropped to 5 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) said a study by his office found 5,000 jobs could 
be lost if the environment in the Keys collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like fishermen are saying, 'I'm not making as much money.' Divers say, 
'The water is dirty.' Guides say, 'I'm losing 10% of my business,' " Deutsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As fresh water flowing to the Everglades is diverted to farmland and to the 
burgeoning cities of southeast Florida, the effects trickle to the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have linked the sea grass die-offs and algae blooms to pollution 
and man-made changes that have reduced the flow of fresh water to about 
one-fifth of what nature intended. 
</P>
<P>
 To rescue the bay, environmentalists are lobbying the government to buy up 
farmland south of Miami and flood it in hopes of returning some type of 
freshwater flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Rampley and Michelle Harrison of England had just finished canoeing 
among the mangroves at John Pennekamp State Park, Florida's 178-square-mile 
nautical preserve on Key Largo. They had been to Florida before and came back 
for one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here particularly to see the reef," Rampley said. "But if we had 
heard there wasn't that much to see, if the fish weren't coming and coral was 
dying, what's the point of coming?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiments like that are the Keys' worst nightmare. The reef and the marine 
life it supports are a major tourist lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reef is an international resource," said DeeVon Quirolo of Reef Relief in 
Key West, "and it's dying before our eyes." He blames farm runoff and sewage 
from the Keys for killing the coral. 
</P>
<P>
 The barrier reef stretches for 128 miles, from near Miami to the end of the 
Keys. About 1 million divers visit the reef annually for a firsthand look at 
the bounty of colorful fish and the coral varieties that range from purple fans 
to stolid brain-like caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Marr, owner of Del Mar Resort in Key Largo, said the people who either 
fish Florida Bay or dive the barrier reef generate $2 billion a year for the 
Keys and provide about 75% of Monroe County's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that happens is Florida Bay goes, then coral reefs die, then 
it's going to impact Miami and all of South Florida," Marr said. "I can't 
believe it won't impact the entire state because people come here to see more 
than Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck." 
</P>
<P>
 Just so. Next to the Orlando area's Walt Disney World, the Keys are the 
most-visited spot in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a rub. While tourism drives the Keys' economy, tourists are part of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the dive industry has grown, there are bigger boats with more people, and 
they are using more and more of the reef system," said Walter Jaap, who works 
for the Florida Marine Research Institute.

POULTRYMEN TAKING EGG BASKET INTO FUTURE; PERDUE FARMS: FATHER AND SON HAVE A 
PASSION FOR THE CHICKEN BUSINESS. THEY ARE LOOKING AHEAD WITH A PROPOSED 
MERGER, STATE-OF-THE-ART PROCESSING PLANTS AND A FOCUS ON FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Perdue and his famous father, Frank, both have a passion for the chicken 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the men, and their missions, are very different. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Perdue was a workaholic who built Perdue Farms Inc. into the nation's 
fourth-largest poultry processing concern. His son, James A. Perdue, is a 
soft-spoken man who is taking the family-owned business into the next century 
with a proposed merger, state-of-the-art processing plants and a focus on 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Perdue, the youngest of four children and the only son, puts in 12-hour 
days, but still has enough time left to coach his children's soccer teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong work ethic at Perdue, but I think it's important for people 
to have balance in their lives," said Perdue, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, in building the business, he put in the hours. I seldom saw him as a 
child growing up. He could spend 18 hours a day at the plant and get by on 
three or four hours' sleep. He had a cot in his office, even though he only 
lived 50 yards away." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know the two agree Jim and Frank are men of distinct personalities 
who have used their special skills in doing what's best for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly Frank was and still is the entrepreneur and Jim still has the 
entrepreneurial spirit. But he also has the education and the temperament and 
the understanding that the company needs to move into a different type of 
management now," said Bill Roenigk, senior vice president of the National 
Broiler Council, the trade association for poultry processors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more complex now in terms of the issues you deal with in the 
marketplace. Jim seems to have an understanding of that," Roenigk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Perdue, 74, is chairman of the company's executive committee and still 
has a say in company affairs. But Jim Perdue, who became chairman of the 
company in 1991, is very much in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Perdue is negotiating a merger with Showell Farms, the 10th-largest 
poultry processor, also headquartered on Maryland's Eastern Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming years, he foresees expansion in retail markets in the Midwest -- 
most of Perdue's business is in the East -- and in exports to Southeast Asia. 
He wants the company to expand its turkey business and food services division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth for us has to be market driven. We don't want to be the biggest 
poultry business. We want to be the best. That drives our growth plan," Perdue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue credits his father for making a lot of single-handed decisions and 
expanding the company. But with the transition from Frank to Jim came a change 
in management style, largely because Perdue Farms was no longer an 
entrepreneurial concern, but a major corporation with 13,800 employees in 10 
processing plants in six states and $1.3 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a bigger operation now. It's a matter of using a lot more teamwork in 
running the business. That's a concept a lot of corporations use. It's a sign 
of the times," Perdue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue said he respects and welcomes his father's advice and there's a healthy 
tension between the two as they continue to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue chuckled as he recalled decisions he has made that grated on his 
father. One was when the younger Perdue decided to scrap the variety of company 
labels for a uniform blue logo that simply reads "Perdue." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simpler and clearer. It represents all the products," Perdue said. 
"(Frank) accepted it. But he let me know he would have gone in a different 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue began laying the groundwork years ago to emerge from his father's 
shadow. After working for the company during summers in high school, he went 
off to Wake Forest University in North Carolina to study not chickens, but 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a bachelor's degree in biology and a master's in marine biology from 
Southeastern Massachusetts University and then went to the University of 
Washington in Seattle for a doctorate in fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue has an interest in fish farming, but don't expect to see Perdue fish 
sticks any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had to leave home to "have some victories of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was applying for and getting research monies and making presentations in 
fisheries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he had to decide whether to pursue a career in academics or return to the 
poultry business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, he came back to Salisbury to run the family business his grandfather, 
Arthur W. Perdue, founded in 1920, raising chickens to sell the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt ready to come back. Self-confidence is something you gain from those 
victories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perdue, who is married and has three children of his own, doesn't see his 
father ever getting completely out of the business to which he devoted his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's delegated authority very well for someone who is a strong entrepreneur," 
Jim Perdue said. "The thing that has driven him his whole life is the success 
of the company. It's a tough business and it took a tough man to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Frank Perdue how he thinks his son is doing and he says, "I couldn't be 
prouder."

FIRST ELECTRIC LIGHTS COME TO REMOTE EGYPTIAN VILLAGE BY WAY OF THE SUN; POWER: 
GOVERNMENT INSTALLS PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS IN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO 
DESERT DWELLERS. 
</P>

<P>
 The flat blue-and-white panels atop the sand-colored Bedouin houses look 
totally alien in the stark landscape of this tiny desert village. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have catapulted its inhabitants into the 20th Century. The tribal 
life, little changed for centuries, has been given a jolt -- solar energy 
technology has brought electricity for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is as though we were dead and have become alive, as though we were buried 
under the ground and have been dug out," said Karima Senoussy, her brightly 
embroidered robe contrasting with a wizened face bronzed by the scorching sun. 
</P>
<P>
 For the village's 450 residents, the fluorescent lights with white plastic 
shades mean they now stay up at night seeing friends and relatives. They talk 
of buying a television but have yet to realize what other changes might come. 
They have a battery-powered radio now. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrification of the Western Desert village 100 miles northwest of Cairo is 
part of a project that the government hopes can be expanded to dozens of other 
remote villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Egypt's 58 million inhabitants have electricity, especially along the 
Nile and the great river's delta, generated by power plants fueled by natural 
gas and by hydroelectric stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government is looking for other sources to meet the combined problems 
of rapidly increasing population, decreasing natural gas and petroleum 
resources, and rising pollution. Solar energy is on the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solar energy technology has expanded tremendously, and the price of the units 
is becoming more affordable," said Maher Abaza, Egypt's minister of electricity 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a study found that it was cheaper to provide desert villages like 
Awlad el Sheik with photovoltaic cells, which transform solar rays into 
electricity, than linking them to the main power grid. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of solar energy in Egypt dates back to the 1970s when the American 
University in Cairo used Bassaissa village in the Nile delta as a prototype for 
fostering development through natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Salah Arafa, a physics professor at the university who helped start the 
project, stressed that solar energy was feasible only in rural areas with 
unfettered access to the sun. High-rises in cities block the light. 
</P>
<P>
 He said money was needed to spread solar energy, and recommended that Egypt 
subsidize solar as it does conventional electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since solar energy is the future . . . we should have a long-term financing 
system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials have not said how much would be spent on solar energy. In 
Awlad el Sheik, which means "children of the sheik," a German grant is helping 
finance electrification. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty of the village's 40 houses got rooftop solar panels in September. The 
families paid 105 pounds (about $30) for each unit and were told they would 
have to pay more later, but the government has not said how much or when. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term effect of electricity on their primitive life is still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Mud-brick houses replaced their tents in recent years, but the floors are 
still sand. Furniture is minimal; the villagers sit and sleep on handmade 
carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 With water available only from a well 2 1/2 miles away, the women do not dream 
of washing machines. And with kitchens consisting of outdoor mud-brick ovens, 
refrigerators and toasters are a world away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 62-year-old village head, Abdel-Wanees Breik, said electricity already 
has changed their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to sleep shortly after sunset," he said. "Now that we have 
electricity, we stay up late and visit with the neighbors who are all cousins." 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers are shepherds, like their forefathers. They live on the meat and 
milk of camels, cows and sheep. The women use wool from the animals to weave 
colorful carpets to supplement family incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year-old named Nagwa said she enjoyed playing into the night with friends 
under the village's eight new street lights. But she added: "We still get up 
early to tend to the animals."

PANETTA FACES CHALLENGE -- WORKING WITH REPUBLICAN CONGRESS; POLITICS: CLINTON

 Old friends from his home state have long been aware of Leon Panetta's affable 
personality and deal-making skills, his knack of bringing hostile camps 
together to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't know how successful the Democratic President's chief strategist 
will be in working with a Republican-controlled Congress, but they have a good 
idea of how he'll go about it. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw Panetta as a congressman, for example, convert a closed military base 
near Monterey -- Ft. Ord, with 16,000 jobs at stake -- into a plan now under 
way for a university and research complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panetta solution was "a consummate bit of statesmanship" in the view of 
one community activist, Fred Harris. "And one of the most admirable things was 
that he didn't even give the appearance that he was directing or manipulating 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
 An environmentalist who has worked with Panetta in California, Dan Haifley, 
commented: 
</P>
<P>
 "Leon was very good at getting people who had not talked to each other into 
the same room. At the end they would not only be talking but shaking hands. He 
brought together warring factions over just about any volatile issue." 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years representing his hometown of Monterey in Congress, and more 
than a year as the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Panetta was 
tapped by President Clinton last June to apply those skills in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton's political career on the line and therefore his own, the 
56-year-old Panetta is facing his most difficult challenge ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the recent Democratic loss of congressional control to the 
Republicans, Panetta's voice trembles in a brief and rare show of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who works for the President shares the responsibility," he says. 
"And we're responsible basically for putting the pieces back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hometowners note that Panetta's personal skills and detailed knowledge of 
issues were the assets that enabled him as a congressman to establish a 
bipartisan record as a shrewd, level-headed negotiator whom almost everybody 
likes as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is able to laugh at himself, which is why he has been successful in 
Washington," says J. Breck Tostevin, who was on the Monterey High School 
student council with Panetta in 1955 and is now his accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't get as many scars as other people because he doesn't put issues in 
personal terms," says Alan Schick of the Brookings Institution. "He's a fairly 
honest broker and that's important in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's political opponents, not surprisingly, have another view. David 
Mason of the conservative Heritage Foundation, says Panetta performed a 
"strip-tease" over the summer when he promised sweeping changes of the White 
House but failed to deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta replies that he has significantly improved the White House by 
controlling access to the Oval Office and tightening the lines of 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before,' says Panetta, "the President would answer questions on the run and 
did not have any kind of regularly scheduled press conferences. Now we have 
more regular press conferences and we try to control the events and statements 
so we get a clear message out each day to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But an internal Administration memo leaked to the press just after the 
November elections suggested a White House staff "that never got its act 
together" was partly to blame for the Democrats' debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 If Panetta is able to get the White House on track he will do it by drawing on 
the consensus-building skills which helped him turn the failure to save Ft. Ord 
into something of a success. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ft. Ord conversion also helped him realize his other crowning California 
achievement, the 1992 designation of the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary, the 
nation's largest marine refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 But one element of Panetta's success has been diminished in his new role of 
chief of staff. His wife, Sylvia, manager of his district offices and most of 
his campaigns, was his eyes and ears back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very much a partner in everything we did," Panetta says, but she 
"never questioned my judgment" on substantive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped her husband set up his office when he became White House chief of 
staff but now spends most of her time in Monterey -- heavily involved in 
choosing a president for the new university at Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the marine refuge and the budding university, Panetta is not without 
critics back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McCampbell, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Panetta for his 
House seat in 1992, says Panetta gets too much credit for both and believes 
people are otherwise misinformed about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised with FDR," Panetta says, referring to President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. "My first recollection is my mother crying when FDR died. Even 
though I was small at the time, it was enough to affect me that something 
serious had happened to somebody I saw in newsreels and heard on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 While he was growing up he says he respected progressive Republicans such as 
Earl Warren, the California governor who later became chief justice. But when 
he was searching for a job after law school at Santa Clara University, he 
knocked at the door of a California Democrat, Joseph Califano, an assistant to 
President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know him but I figured a guy who's name was Califano might be kind 
to a person whose name was Panetta," says the American-born son of Italian 
immigrants. Califano, who later became a member of President Jimmy Carter's 
Cabinet, set up some meetings but Panetta ended up working for California's 
Sen. Thomas Kuchel, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Panetta resigned as President Richard M. Nixon's director 
of civil rights and soon switched to the Democrats. His first elective office 
in Monterey County was as a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former Senate aide, he says he "looked at the House as sort of a mob 
scene while the Senate is a place for statesmen who almost always try to fix 
the problems that are developed by the House. So I thought no, I don't ever 
want to wind up in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta did end up in the House in 1977, defeating a fiery conservative. 
Nearly a generation later he has opportunity once again to confront 
conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton sent Panetta to the first meeting with the new congressional 
leaders. The veteran negotiator says he hopes both parties can work together 
but that "we will not in any way allow anyone to undermine what we have 
accomplished in the last two years on the economy, on crime and on education."

EXPERIENCE TEACHES CAUTION ON CHIPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have noticed the attention your newspaper has devoted to the error in the 
Pentium computer chip. Particularly interesting was Michael Schrage's 
"Computerdom's Winds of Change Will Bring a Blast of Fresh Errors" (Dec. 15). 
While the analyses you have published are largely correct, I think some 
additional comments reflecting my participation in the computer software 
business since 1957 may be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was much younger, I owned several automobiles. My experience with those 
cars and with their manufacturers was analogous to my experience with computer 
hardware and software in the present day. I think that computer technology is 
in the same phase of its life as automobile technology was in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of the automobile from a quirky product that required a lot 
of technical know-how and enjoyed poor support from manufacturers and dealers 
to its present relatively reliable state took several decades. Its midwife was 
the development of strong foreign competition to give consumers alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the material on the Pentium emphasizes the difficulty of testing such 
a complex device thoroughly. Edsger Dijkstra, one of the world's greatest 
programmers, pointed out decades ago that testing cannot demonstrate the 
absence of error. It is necessary to apply formal methods to the designs to 
prove consistency and completeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Few software designers apply formal methods to prove their designs correct. An 
encouraging sign in this respect was Reudiger Ashe's statement at a 1993 
Microsoft seminar to the effect that formal analysis is the only way that 
operating system software can be shown to function correctly. The emphasis on 
testing, as opposed to formal analysis, is analogous to looking for one's car 
keys under a street light because one can see there, even though the keys were 
probably lost somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the comment that the prevalence of errors is to some degree 
attributable to shortening product introduction cycles is true, but saying this 
does not solve the problem. The industry is working hard to automate design and 
manufacturing processes to reduce development time and improve accuracy; 
however, the race itself is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If consumers want reliability, they should buy products that have been on the 
market for a year or two, rather than ones that are newest. Avoid the first 
release of any product.

VICTIMS AND CULPRITS IN ORANGE COUNTY'S CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Flanigan has raised the Times' call of victimization in the Orange 
County fiscal debacle to a new level ("California's Faulty Tax System May Be at 
Bankruptcy's Root," Dec. 14). The unfortunate thing is that he distinctly 
misses identifying the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 To clarify the situation, there is definitive fault to be placed. County 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron was well aware of what he was doing. He is a 
sophisticated investment manager. He advised other bureaucrats and agency 
managers to risk public funds to increase the amount of monies they had to 
expend within their domain. If these people did not understand the relationship 
between risk and reward, they should have been required to take a high 
school-level economics class. 
</P>
<P>
 In no way are they victims of the changing tax system within California. They 
are irresponsible people who overstepped their authority. If the system was not 
providing these bureaucrats with sufficient funds, their only responsibility 
was to either cut expenditures or inform their constituents they needed 
additional revenues. The taxpayers could then make a decision to increase the 
burden upon themselves to cover the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us make this crystal clear: The only victims here are the citizens of 
Orange County and possibly the rest of California who are going to have to foot 
the bill for this tomfoolery. 
</P>

 James Flanigan almost had it right when he blamed Proposition 13 and the 
California taxpayer for the Orange County investment fiasco. He correctly noted 
that the taxpayers are unwilling to provide unlimited tax revenues to fund 
increasing expenditures in a declining economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was right on the mark by observing that the taxpayers really do want 
smaller government, less regulation, less services and, most of all, less civil 
servants.  
</P>
<P>
 But he somehow missed the fact that the greedy investment houses duped Mr. 
Citron into buying derivatives that were not only ill suited to the investment 
objections of the county but also flew in the face of the clearly stated 
Federal Reserve intentions to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, he seems to have forgotten that government exists for the benefit 
of the taxpayer, not the other way around.

 Why can't the rich, greedy, conservative Republicans of Orange County accept 
the blame for their fiscal problems created by their own greed? They voted 
overwhelmingly for Proposition 13 and Reaganomics, from which they no doubt 
sowed billion of dollars while welcoming every Defense Department tax dollar 
that came their way. 
</P>
<P>
 The linkage of the words conservative and prudence is one of the major follies 
of our time.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: MEGA-CITIES NETWORKING SENDS A MESSAGE TO A CHANGING 
WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III, J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III is director of UCLA's Center 
for Afro-American Studies and an associate professor in the university's School 
of Public Policy and Social Research. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the eighth annual Mega-Cities Project meeting in Cairo two weeks ago, trend 
watcher John Naisbitt suggested that a paradox helps explain much of the global 
change occurring today. "The bigger the world economy," he said, "the more 
powerful its smallest players." 
</P>
<P>
 In Naisbitt's scheme, large companies will gradually cease to be major players 
in the global economy. They will be replaced by networks of small entrepreneurs 
that, over time, would become highly influential. The dynamic, according to 
Naisbitt: To be more competitive, very large businesses will continue to 
shrink, while smaller companies in strategic alliances will emerge to dominate 
the world economy. Thus, he said, networking between businesses will become one 
of the critical elements enabling small companies to play major roles within 
world markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the information superhighway is crucial for his vision to 
become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction from representatives of 18 of the world's largest cities -- 
including Los Angeles and New York -- was not very positive. From their 
perspective, Naisbitt had framed a perfect scenario for widening the gap 
between the haves and have-nots in most of the world's urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Naisbitt failed to realize that he was not speaking to captains of industry or 
emerging entrepreneurs. His audience of Mega-Cities coordinators consisted of 
individuals who have dedicated themselves to looking for solutions to problems 
faced by large cities throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 One premise of the Mega-Cities Project -- a 10-year-old program backed by the 
United Nations, the World Bank and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, among others -- 
is that the world's largest cities have more in common with each other than 
they do with smaller cities in their own countries. In part, that's because the 
populations of these cities -- 10 million or more each -- suggests that they 
share similar problems such as traffic congestion, pollution, housing 
shortages, crime and high unemployment rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A second premise of the Mega-Cities Project is that the governments of these 
cities are ill equipped to cope with the problems they face. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the project presupposes that the private sector sees no major role 
for itself in addressing these problems. What is left is a cadre of 
community-based organizations, struggling to the best of their abilities to 
address day-to-day problems with limited resources and little political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key objective of the Mega-Cities Project is identifying and documenting 
the best practices being carried out by community groups around the world -- 
the assumption being that what works in one big city quite likely will work in 
most of the others. A key activity of the project coordinators is to introduce 
these workable "innovations" to as many other cities as possible, with the 
belief that meaningful solutions can be transferred in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the Cairo meeting was Charlotte Bullock, co-founder of Concerned 
Citizens, a community-based organization in South-Central Los Angeles. Through 
the Mega-Cities Project, Concerned Citizens learned about the activities of the 
Zabbaleen, an innovative economic development enterprise in Cairo. Started by 
"rag pickers" -- essentially, junkyard combers -- the project has become a 
thriving set of micro enterprises, including businesses that manufacture paper, 
quilts and plastic products made from recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock traveled to Egypt to see what aspects of the project might be 
replicated by low-skilled residents in South-Central. As a result of his visit, 
which was underwritten by Mega-Cities, Concerned Citizens is likely to create 
an enterprise that will produce paper from recycled materials, and the paper in 
turn will be used by the group's newly created printing business. In addition, 
Concerned Citizens is negotiating for exclusive rights to import quilts, place 
mats and other products produced by one of the Zabbaleen enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 While Naisbitt may have underestimated his audience, the participants in the 
Cairo meeting failed to hear his broader message: that networking among units 
with similar purposes is a powerful way to influence policy formulation and 
implementation at both the local and international levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An important test of the real potential of the Mega-Cities network will take 
place here in Los Angeles at the Convention Center on Jan. 13 and 14, when 60 
of the city's most innovative community-based organizations will meet with 
corporate representatives, federal and locally elected officials, 
representatives of the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum and other 
Mega-Cities coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 The exposition, which is open to the public, will feature the innovative 
solutions to urban problems that are being implemented by L.A.'s most creative 
community-based organizations. The leaders will introduce their innovations to 
policy-makers and discuss ways of expanding them.  
</P>
<P>
 The results could prove the truth of Naisbitt's notion that small units have 
the power to make a significant impact on local and global problem solving.

BALANCED U.S. BUDGET SHOULD BE THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reading Robert Eisner's "Balanced-Budget Amendment Would Spell Disaster for 
Economy" (Dec. 11) I found myself quickly in a skeptical position. He says 
there is $3.5 trillion of outstanding federal debt. But on D12 of the same 
issue of The Times, under "U.S. Finances," the public debt is shown as $4.7 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes an analogy between borrowing by individuals and companies and 
borrowing by the federal government. This comparison is flawed because the 
private sector must pay off its debts with money it earns, whereas the 
government can just go on borrowing more and more indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the government spends more than it takes in is the reason the 
dollar continues to buy less and less goods, services and many foreign 
currencies. But Prof. Eisner doesn't mention this problem (inflation). 
</P>
<P>
 We need the amendment, and if passed, let's hope it is obeyed. The original 
effort to do something on excess spending -- the debt ceiling -- is a joke. 
There used to be some concern when the debt bumped the ceiling. Now raising it 
is a routine action by Congress. The current ceiling is $4.9 trillion, versus 
the debt of $4.7 trillion. 
</P>

 Eisner likens the federal deficit to investment of capital by a family or 
business. This is misleading. A wisely run firm will not borrow at 5% and 
invest the money at 3%. Does the increased tax revenue form deficit spending 
outweigh the interest paid on the additional debt? 
</P>
<P>
 If it did, we wouldn't have a persistent deficit. The returns on the 
"investment" would show up as an eventual surplus in the federal budget. Would 
you put money into a company that always ran at a loss, claiming that their 
outlays for more capital equipment kept dipping them into the red? 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Eisner sets forth a compelling argument that a balanced budget amendment makes 
little economic sense. But it is this same argument that we have heard from 
economists since the end of World War II when Congress realized the economy 
would likely outgrow any deficit they could squander on their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all of this pork-barreling is the current $3.5-trillion national 
debt. The legacy of the debt is a relatively low standard of living in the 
United States when compared to other countries long considered our poor 
stepchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 So while the balanced budget amendment may not make perfect economic sense, 
its backers know that it will force our lawmakers to place their well-fed 
snouts into an empty trough.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: AGENCIES, FUNDS AIM FOR IMPROVED PROSPECTUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the optimism that precedes the start of a new year, some regulators and 
mutual fund industry officials are expressing hope that they will be able to 
introduce changes in 1995 that will make it easier for fund shareholders to 
figure out what they own. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy level of redemptions by bond fund investors this year suggests that 
many people didn't really understand the risks they were assuming. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a survey by the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 1993 
found that many investors lacked knowledge of even such rudimentary points as 
whether mutual funds sold by banks and even brokerages are covered by federal 
deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, when a small number of funds suffered big losses this year from the 
speculative use of derivatives, it pointed up a need for more understandable 
explanations of these esoteric investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect: motivation to go back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are not as informed as they should be," SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
Jr. said in a speech last month. "There are misconceptions even about such 
basic products as mutual funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The target of reform is that unwieldy old standby, the prospectus. At Levitt's 
urging, fund companies are taking a new look at making these important 
disclosure pamphlets more user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, eight large fund families are working as a group to develop a 
prototype "profile" prospectus. This would summarize key information contained 
in the regular prospectus, allowing investors to make comparisons among funds 
more quickly and easily. Investors would receive both the short and long forms 
as a package. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC research indicates that "people want the whole prospectus but don't want 
to have to read the whole thing right away," said Jane White, head of 
shareholder communications for T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore, one of 
the eight firms working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summary, key topics such as the fund's description, fees, risk profile 
and more would be presented in a standard order. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt is also prodding fund companies to make their regular prospectuses more 
readable. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospectuses are legal documents that serve not only to inform investors but 
also to protect the fund's management company and other contractors from 
lawsuits. This helps explain why they have become so complex and lengthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tension between what lawyers will want to draft as a way of 
protection and investors' desire for a very simple explanation," said Roy W. 
Adams, a securities lawyer and chief operating officer of Solon Asset 
Management, a fund group in Walnut Creek, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are going to want to sue fund groups, then the lawyers will want to 
err on the side of more disclosure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, the SEC itself has been an obstacle in the pursuit of brevity and 
clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major source of the problem is the SEC itself, which, along with several 
state securities regulators, has required that mutual fund prospectuses be 
loaded with technical details and legalisms," Erick Kanter, a spokesman for the 
Investment Company Institute, said in response to Levitt's November speech. The 
ICI is the fund industry's trade association and is headquartered in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In his talk, Levitt promised that the SEC would offer an expedited review 
process for fund companies that develop more readable prospectuses. 
</P>
<P>
 One notable prospectus make-over idea that the SEC has floated in recent 
months would provide for a standardized risk measure, perhaps summarized by a 
numerical rating. In theory, this would make it easier for investors to size up 
the various dangers facing a particular fund and also make risk comparisons 
among funds simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea is already drawing fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one risk measure can possibly account for all the risks a fund assumes," 
said Catherine Gillis, an editor for Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based 
fund-rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 A single rating, particularly if it is made by a government agency, could lull 
investors into a false sense of security, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
 And because prospectuses are printed only once or twice a year, it's possible 
that such a measure could quickly become outdated in a fast-moving market, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded, though, that there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of state and 
federal regulators for some type of single risk rating or seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the prospectus changes noted above, a few other regulatory 
modifications could come about in 1995, including the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tougher investment standards for tax-exempt money market funds, including 
requirements that they diversify more broadly. Taxable money funds must already 
meet these. 
</P>
<P>
 * More prominent discussion of derivatives within the first few pages of the 
prospectus for any funds using derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * New disclosure guidelines for funds with different classes of shares. 
Specifically, funds would have to prominently disclose the existence and costs 
associated with the other share classes. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these proposals will prompt lots of snappy headlines. But they do 
promise to make 1995 a fairly active year for mutual fund regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Lerner, one of the mutual fund industry's senior stock pickers, will 
retire as lead manager of the AIM Charter Fund on March 31. Lerner, 70, has 
been at the helm of the $1.58-billion portfolio since 1968, compiling an 
impressive track record. Morningstar gives the fund an above-average four-star 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Lerner's departure, AIM Charter will be led by Lanny Sachnowitz, with 
other management team members to be announced later. Lerner, also a senior vice 
president of Houston-based AIM Capital Management, will remain as a consultant 
for one year.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW TO CLAIM EX-SPOUSE'S BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Q :I am 77 and was divorced in 1979 after 40 years of marriage. How do I go 
about applying for benefits on my ex-husband's account? - D.R.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: A divorced person is entitled to receive Social Security benefits 
accumulated by his or her ex-spouse if they had been married at least 10 years 
and the ex-spouse is already receiving benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 (If that spouse is not yet receiving benefits, the couple must have been 
divorced for at least two years and the working spouse must be at least 62.) 
</P>
<P>
 If your ex-spouse is alive, you may start collecting benefits at 62, but the 
benefits will be just 37.5% of the wage earner's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 If you wait until age 65 to begin collecting, the payment is 50% of the wage 
earner's benefits. If your former spouse is dead, you may start collecting at 
age 60, but your benefits will be just 71.5% of what the wage earner would have 
been entitled to receive. If you wait until age 65, you can receive 100% of 
what your ex-spouse would have received. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are disabled, you may start collecting benefits at age 50 if your 
former spouse is dead. If your former spouse is still alive and you are 
disabled, 62 is the minimum age at which you may begin claiming benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 You may apply for benefits by mail, telephone or in person at your local 
Social Security Administration office. To apply by phone, call the nationwide 
Social Security number: (800) 772-1213. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what method of application you choose, be sure to ask for assistance 
in applying for "divorced spouse benefits." Also, be prepared to present a 
marriage certificate, divorce decree, proof of age, proof of death of the 
former spouse (if applicable) and both your Social Security number and that of 
your ex-spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about ex-spouse benefits, order the Social Security 
Administration's pamphlet No. 05-10084, "Survivor's Benefits" by calling (800) 
772-1213. New Yield Schedules for Savings Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I purchased some EE Savings Bonds in February, 1993. The following month, 
the government lowered the guaranteed interest rate paid on bonds held a 
minimum of five years, from 6% to 4%. Once I have held my bonds for five years, 
what is the guaranteed rate I am entitled to receive? -- J.F.R . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are entitled to receive the 6% guaranteed minimum rate because that was 
the rate in effect at the time you purchased your bonds. Bonds purchased before 
March 1, 1993, and held at least five years earn at least 6%; bonds purchased 
after that date and held at least five years earn a guaranteed minimum of 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also know that bonds held at least five years can yield more than 
the guaranteed level; they pay either the guaranteed minimum or 85% of the 
average rate paid by Treasury notes with five years left to maturity, whichever 
is higher. Interest Deductible Only on Recorded Lien 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My father and I own the house where I live. He recently paid off the 
mortgage and I now owe him half that amount. I expect to repay him next year 
when the house is sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I am paying him $530 a month, the agreed-upon interest on my 
outstanding loan balance. May I deduct this interest from income on my tax 
returns? -- N.K . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your ability to deduct your payment to your father depends entirely on two 
key factors: how the note is secured and whether it was officially recorded. 
For the interest on your debt to be deductible, your note must be secured by 
your interest in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, you must have signed a trust deed. Further, that deed must 
have been recorded in your county recorder's office. If these two conditions 
are not met, the government does not consider the interest you are paying to be 
true mortgage interest, which is deductible, but merely personal or consumer 
debt interest, which is not deductible. Ordinary Income Tax Due on IRA Yields 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am 68. One of my individual retirement accounts contains $10,000 that is 
invested in a limited liability company investing in oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Do I have to reinvest any of the money generated by that account back into the 
IRA, or may I spend it as I wish and pay taxes on it? -- T.E . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Taxpayers older than 59 1/2 are entitled to make withdrawals from their 
IRAs without owing the 10% federal government penalty or the 2.5% California 
penalty. The only proviso is that they pay ordinary income taxes on any 
withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 Since you are over the minimum age, you may spend the dividends generated by 
the oil investment and pay Uncle Sam whatever ordinary income tax you owe on 
the proceeds. Bank Has Own Rules on CD Withdrawals 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife and I are both over 65. We invested an IRA in a bank certificate of 
deposit. The bank says we can withdraw any interest the CD generates, but it 
will charge us a penalty if we withdraw any part of the principal before the 
maturity date. I thought an IRA could be freely disbursed once the holder 
turned 59 1/2. Am I correct? -- J.R.C . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have confused your penalties. Taxpayers older than 59 1/2 are not 
subject to government early-withdrawal penalties, but they are still subject to 
penalties imposed by banks and other investment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty you were told about is imposed by the bank to discourage savers 
from withdrawing funds from term certificate of deposit accounts; it has 
nothing to do with your age or the government.

WESTSIDE WATCH: SCOUTS ALL ABUZZ OVER KILLER BEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Boy Scouts has changed its motto to "Bee Prepared" as 
part of a community service project in Culver City to get out the word about 
Africanized honeybees -- the so-called killer bees that have struck fear and 
fascination into Southlanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scouts take the bee threat so seriously that they staged a simulation of a 
bee-stinging incident. Media packets include "Don't Tease the Bees" milk caps, 
primers on anaphylactic shock and sting survival, and a "Ghostbusters"-style 
"Who Ya Gonna Call" list for information on the buzzing little terrors.

 ALL WET: When trying to squeeze information out of tight-lipped felons, police 
officers often employ a questioning method called a "fishing expedition." 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Beverly Hills cops found themselves having to fish for more 
than just answers. They also had to fish for the suspect -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they responded to a call of a suspicious person in the 200 block 
of South Williman Drive in Beverly Hills. The description of the man, police 
noted, matched that of a suspect wanted in a Los Angeles rape that occurred a 
half-hour earlier only blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills officers called in a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter to 
aid in the search. The chopper almost immediately spotted the man trying to 
hide on a nearby rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect dashed across the roof and leaped to an adjacent house. He then 
tried to jump to the roof of the next house, but he fell -- right into a 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Police fished out the suspect, who sustained back and leg injuries in the 
landing, and took him to the hospital, where he was identified as the rape 
suspect. He was treated and handed over to the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 NAUGHTY AND NICE: Santa Claus isn't the only one keeping track of who's 
naughty and who's nice this Christmas. So is the Santa Monica Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The naughty should beware that the police have started their annual holiday 
program to curb drunken driving. On Dec. 16, Santa Monica officers, joined by 
the California Highway Patrol, set up a checkpoint at 7th Street and Santa 
Monica Boulevard. Officers stopped more than 850 cars and -- Santa would be 
proud of this -- found only two intoxicated motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers will also be on the lookout for revelers who have over-imbibed on 
New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 And for you nice drivers, Santa Monica police have been issuing Good Driver 
Citations. Motorists who have displayed conscientious driving skills or have 
been "caught" performing an act of kindness have been rewarded with two movie 
tickets from Mann Theaters.

MALIBU FILM FEE RAISES INDUSTRY IRE; PERMITS: FILMMAKERS AND OTHERS OBJECT TO 
CHARGING FOR USE OF COUNTY- AND STATE-OWNED BEACHES WITHIN CITY BOUNDARIES. 
LEGALITY OF PLAN IS BEING STUDIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A move by the Malibu City Council to charge fees for filming on state- and 
county-owned beaches within the city limits has raised eyebrows among county 
officials and film industry representatives who say the fees may be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed amendments Dec. 12 on a film permit fee resolution that, 
effective Jan. 12, will create an in-house film permit office and establish a 
new fee schedule for television and film producers and commercial 
photographers. Currently, permits to film in Malibu cost $715 and are processed 
through the Department of Regional Planning's Los Angeles County Film Office, 
with $400 of the fee going to Malibu and $315 to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment approved by the City Council called for the city to collect $600 
for a standard permit to film in the city and $250 to film on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's move to charge $250 to film on state- or county-owned beaches has 
drawn fire from county film officials and industry representatives. The city 
fee must be paid in addition to a county permit fee of $315, plus a daily fee 
of $400 to the County Department of Beaches and Harbors for beach maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the industry is on city property, then I feel they do have a right to 
charge," said Stephanie Liner, director of Los Angeles County Entertainment 
Industry Affairs, a county agency that deals with entertainment matters. "But 
the city of Malibu does not have to recoup any fees to maintain the property on 
a daily or weekly basis. They should not charge a fee. It's not a rental fee, 
it's a use fee." 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel is currently exploring the possibility that Malibu's fees 
are illegal, Liner said. Malibu City Atty. Christi Hogin argued that the city's 
right to charge film permit fees to use private beaches and other property 
should extend to county-owned beaches. Hogin added that the fee is applicable 
to property within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just regulate filming anywhere in the city," Hogin said. "We are not 
trying to over-regulate film permits. We've invited the lawyers (from the 
county and the film industry) to give us some authority that preempts the city 
from imposing a film permit fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Another complaint being lodged against the city's newly amended resolution is 
the creation of a second permit, an additional hassle that industry officials 
say makes Malibu unfriendly to film and television producers, who have a long 
history of using Malibu beaches for such popular programs as "Baywatch." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just about money, it's about double permitting," said Kathleen 
Milnes, vice president of the Public Affairs Coalition of the Alliance of 
Motion Picture and Television Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milnes added that Malibu's move is contrary to efforts among local government 
bodies to streamline the permit process. "Los Angeles city and the county are 
looking at consolidating their film permit processing," she said. "There is a 
six-region area that is working with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments and my organization toward creating a one-stop film permit 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 film permits are processed each year for Malibu area beaches, 
generating about $150,000, Liner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county dropped fees for photographers a year ago after modeling industry 
executives started using Florida beaches, where there are no fees. The county 
film office now charges a yearly fee of $100 to still photographers to use 
county beaches. Malibu's permit fee for commercial photographers will be $100 
per shoot when the new amendment takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fee drew criticism from a top modeling executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Malibu wants to compete, then they have to compete with the most effective 
competitors, and right now that is Miami and Arizona," said Jack Maiden, 
director of fashion for Nina Blanchard Agency, a Los Angeles modeling firm. "I 
don't know if they're charging the fees just because they want to drive people 
away or because they're doing it for revenues. But the long-term effects will 
be detrimental to all business."

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTWOOD IMPROVEMENT -- A vote to establish the Westwood Business 
Improvement District was delayed until Jan. 4 in response to strong objections 
from many businesses along Wilshire Boulevard, who argued that they would be 
assessed too severely for the benefits they would receive. The improvement 
district, which would assess businesses in return for security, landscaping, 
street and lighting improvements, would be divided into two zones: the area of 
Westwood Village and the mostly high-rise office buildings that line Wilshire 
Boulevard from Veteran Avenue to half a block east of Glendon Avenue. Although 
they would be charged 50% less than businesses in zone one, tenants from zone 
two contended that the improvement district, designed to attract people to the 
once-thriving area, would not significantly affect their businesses. The plan 
calls for an assessment based on a percentage of an enterprise's yearly 
business tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTWOOD PARKING -- Approved lowering parking meter rates on Westwood 
Boulevard from Wilshire Boulevard south to Ohio Street from $1 per hour to 50 
cents per hour. The four-block stretch was the only part of the Westwood area 
that still had the higher rate; rates elsewhere were lowered two years ago. The 
Department of Transportation estimated that the lower prices would result in a 
$100,000 loss of revenue, but proponents of the move argued that it would 
increase business in the area, resulting in more sales tax for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANIMAL POUND FEES -- Approved a new fee for claiming rabbits or poultry from 
city animal shelters. Previously there was no charge. A charge of $15 has been 
instituted because it was discovered that some people were cooking the rabbits 
or poultry after claiming them from the pound, according to a Department of 
Animal Regulations official. In other fee changes, $3 to $5 will be charged for 
the use of traps used to catch such nuisance animals as skunks and raccoons. 
The traps previously were free. Also new is a $130 yearly permit fee for dog 
and cat grooming parlors. The cost of claiming a dog or cat from a shelter will 
remain the same -- $5 and $3, respectively. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

POP CULTURE; SHARONA'S LYRICAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUISE YARNALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even after 15 years, it's a rare day when someone doesn't remind Sharona 
Alperin of the raunchy rock 'n' roll anthem that made her first name a 
household word. 
</P>
<P>
 The pulsating, pounding "My Sharona" first catapulted to No. 1 in 1979 and 
enjoyed a brief revival when it surfaced in the soundtrack of the film "Reality 
Bites." 
</P>
<P>
 "M-m-m-myyyy Sharona." The insistent beat and yelping mating cry of her former 
lover, Doug Fieger, lead singer of The Knack, are etched into many a memory -- 
for better or worse. For Alperin, it's usually worse. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, the mere mention of her first name provokes raucous laughter and 
off-key renditions of the notorious song. Telephone operators have sung it to 
her. It's a conversation starter at every party. What began as a simple Israeli 
name chosen by parents who sent their daughter to a private Hebrew school in 
Beverly Hills became inextricably associated with the wild excesses of sex, 
drugs and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were not sure what a sharona was. . . . In Japan, they thought it was 
a penis," Alperin recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Alperin, 34, acknowledges that she led a "decadent" life back in the early 
'80s. But she has left those days behind. Although still single, she has 
settled down. She sells real estate on the Westside and usually makes lunch and 
dinner reservations under an assumed name to avoid the Sharona jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was permanently changed by a detour her life took years ago, when she 
broke up with a steady boyfriend in L.A. and accepted Fieger's invitation to 
join him on The Knack's nationwide tour. The four-year liaison with Fieger 
transformed her from a teen-age clothing store sales clerk to a rocker's "main 
squeeze," a woman who wore dark glasses at night, signed autographs, lived the 
lifestyle of limos and trashed hotel rooms, and hung out with the likes of Cher 
and Debbie Harry of Blondie fame at Le Dome restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to call it 'The Home,' " Alperin said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alperin eventually split with Fieger, she kept up with her contacts. The 
years on the fast lane opened doors and laid the foundation for her successful 
real estate business with Dalton Brown & Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the raven-haired, sapphire-eyed Alperin does business with 
entertainment industry types, totes a cellular phone and closes million-dollar 
deals over lunch at House of Blues, one of her favorite Sunset Boulevard 
haunts. Her social calendar is busy with "in" parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But she still keeps a file of the old press clippings and a 45 single of "My 
Sharona." The cover of the single, which sold 6 million copies, is graced with 
a photograph of a pouty, teen-age Alperin -- hair dyed a punk jet black, face 
turned away from the camera ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the press has described the song disparagingly as an ode to a 
"groupie," the young women who gather at the backstage door after rock 
concerts, eagerly awaiting a chance for one passionate night with a star. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alperin was the pursued, not the pursuer. Fieger, now 42, remembers his 
attraction to her as romantic in the most traditional sense. He says she was 
"instrumental" in the band's success, recruiting friends to attend the band's 
early concerts, establishing the group as a local phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger "discovered" her one day in 1978 when he walked into the Fairfax 
clothing store where Alperin was working. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my groupie," Alperin recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger says he was "extremely taken with her." She entered his life at a 
critical time. He was breaking up with a longtime girlfriend and had just put 
together a new band -- The Knack -- a group designed to give a bunch of guys in 
their mid-20s a chance to write songs from the perspective of their 
"14-year-old selves." 
</P>
<P>
 With songs like "Good Girls Don't" and "My Sharona," The Knack established 
itself in the late 1970s as the voice of teen lust and angst. But when Alperin 
and Fieger first met, the band was rehearsing in a humble warehouse near the 
shop where she worked. Sometimes she would stop by for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 All that year, Fieger pursued Alperin, but she wasn't interested. One day, she 
walked into a rehearsal session and the band surprised her by performing "My 
Sharona." 
</P>
<P>
 As Fieger remembers it, the band had written the song the day before. They 
wanted a signature piece for their encores, and band member Berton Averre had 
had the distinctive drum riff in his head for years. 
</P>
<P>
 To Sharona, who still wasn't dating Fieger, the song was an ode to sexual 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frustrated was the basic reality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, after the song went through the L.A. club circuit and such 
stars as Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty jammed onstage with The Knack, several 
record companies bid to release the band's debut album, "Get the Knack." Within 
months, Fieger and his group were touring Japan, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as his band took off, Fieger was still a man obsessed with one woman. He 
recalls that most of the songs in the first two albums were about Sharona. Her 
picture appeared on both album covers. To him, she was more than just another 
rocker chick -- she was his muse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sharona agreed to accompany Fieger on the Hawaiian leg of the group's 
tour, it marked the beginning of a "fire and gasoline" relationship that 
ultimately burned out in 1982. As the years have gone by, the two have remained 
friends. Fieger has married. Alperin hopes to be married by the time she's 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all about heartbeat," Alperin said. "It wasn't about sex."

BRIEFLY: ART: TILES TELL HISTORY OF COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Venice artist's ceramic tile panels depicting the cultural history of 
Compton were installed last week to decorate the Metro Blue Line's Compton 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Eva Cockcroft designed the ceramic tile panels and two columns 
illustrating the city's diverse cultures, including Native American, Spanish, 
Mestizo, Samoan and African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Cockcroft's work is a fine example of how MTA's rail art projects are 
reflecting the spirit of the communities served by the Metro Blue Line," said 
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels were installed along with a large mural, also depicting cultural 
diversity, created by a team of 11 students from Compton's three high schools 
and directed by Cockcroft.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; A LEAP OF FAITH; MANY LATINOS ARE REJECTING CATHOLICISM 
IN FAVOR OF EVANGELICAL PROTESTANT CHURCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Shibuya Brown

<TEXT>
<P>
 VICTOR CASTRO IS TALKING about his past sins, his catholic education and how, 
after a loyal but unexamined allegiance to that church, he left it to find his 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents raised me as a Catholic, but I never put my faith in it," says the 
37-year-old Echo Park fabric worker, who eight years ago forswore Catholicism 
for an evangelical Protestantism. "This is not just religion; it's an 
experience with God." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience came quickly for Castro, he says. It took less than a month 
from the time he was approached by Pentecostal church members to overturn years 
of a staunch Catholic upbringing. "In the past, when I prayed, nothing 
happened. Now, it's different because Jesus is alive to me," Castro says 
simply. 
</P>
<P>
 In Silver Lake, meanwhile, the Rev. Moises Sandoval is shaking the rafters of 
an auditorium that houses the overwhelmingly Latino congregation of the Iglesia 
Evangelica Latina church. Responding to shouted approvals by members of his 
flock, Sandoval implores them to discover Jesus in their everyday lives. "The 
people don't want to have a religion that is habitual, that is a practice," 
says Sandoval, a dapper man in his 50s who has been preaching Pentecostalism 
for more than two decades. "They want a personal relationship with God." 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America has been home to many revolutions, but perhaps none as 
fundamental and far-reaching as this. During the last 20 years, Protestantism 
-- primarily evangelical Pentecostalism -- has exerted a powerful and 
unprecedented undertow against the prevailing Catholic current, winning 
millions of new believers. As a result, Los Angeles, which draws most of the 
nation's Latin American immigrants, is witnessing a similar, profound shift in 
the religious habits of its 2 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 From storefront parishes in Hollywood to sprawling church complexes in Silver 
Lake and East Los Angeles, Christian evangelism, mostly with services in 
Spanish, is galvanizing a huge population long considered to be a steadfast 
legion of the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Catholics) have a lot to learn from Pentecostalism," said Father Alan 
Figueroa Deck, coordinator of Hipanic Pastoral Programs at Loyola Marymount 
University. "This is the most dramatic development in the world of religion 
today," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers, on a local, national and global level, testify to the enormity of 
the change. Between Santa Barbara and San Diego, there are 2,000 to 3,000 
Protestant parishes with primarily Latino congregations, said Jesse Miranda, an 
associate dean at Azusa Pacific University and president of Alianza de 
Ministerios Evangelicos Nacionales, a national organization of Latino 
evangelical ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Miranda added, about 60,000 Latinos each year convert from 
Catholicism to Christian evangelical sects. And, Deck said, the number of 
Latinos in the United States who identify themselves as Catholics has dropped 
in the past 25 years from 90% to between 70% and 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 At Iglesia Evangelica Latina, Sandoval and Larry Barnes, a church trustee and 
its sole African American member, eagerly recount the church's growth. Begun 15 
years ago in storefront fashion with 20 members, the church within five years 
grew to a congregation of 120. Now it has 1,800 members and has spawned seven 
additional missions -- five of them in Los Angeles and two in Las Vegas. 
Services at the Silver Lake church became so crowded that they are now held in 
the cavernous auditorium of a nearby middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evangelical church has people Hispanics can relate to," Miranda said. 
"This appeals to the needs of Hispanics, culturally and spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 Those needs, according to Latino pastors, are many, given that the city's 
Protestant churches with predominantly Latino congregations are mostly filled 
with immigrants and the poor. The Rev. Sammy C. Fernandez, pastor of the 
longstanding church La Puerta Abierta -- which means "the open door" in Spanish 
-- in East Los Angeles, said he counts 12 different Latin American ethnicities 
in his congregation, including Hondurans, Puerto Ricans, Costa Ricans and 
Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 His parishioners are particularly drawn to an evangelical church, Fernandez 
said, because it offers a sense of community in a new and often hostile 
environment. Moreover, evangelical services involve fewer people than do 
Catholic Masses, and many church leaders have risen from the local community -- 
unlike priests and nuns who are frequently transferred in from other areas -- 
which makes the religious experience less anonymous for immigrant worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider the No. 1 problem to the Latin people to be isolation," said 
Barnes, who with his wife is a member of the Iglesia Evangelica Latina 
congregation. "This is proof that these people have found their place and 
resettled here spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason that immigrants become open to Christian evangelism is that, 
unlike in their native lands, Catholicism is not inexorably tied to American 
culture. "They don't sense that pressure to stay in the church in this 
country," said the Rev. Philip Lance, who presides over an 85-member Latino 
Episcopalian parish in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Victor Castro, going to Mass in his native Peru was often seen as a social 
outing, not as an opportunity to renew religious faith. "You go because your 
uncle, your daddy or your friends go," he said. "You don't go by yourself. And 
your heart and mind are not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Another attractive element of Christian evangelism to Latinos, pastors say, is 
the religion's style of worship, which places less emphasis on the church as an 
institution. In addition, unlike Catholicism, which the pastors say emphasizes 
the rituals of faith, evangelical services encourage outpourings of emotion and 
spontaneous displays of religious commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 At one recent and typical Sunday service at Iglesia Evangelica Latina, the 700 
parishioners joined in heartfelt song, accompanied by an organ, drums and 
tambourines. As a long procession of male and female church leaders took the 
stage to minister to the flock in Spanish, many in the well-dressed 
congregation broke down in tears and became lost in prayer. Some members rose 
to speak in tongues. Later, Sandoval prayed over a line of emotional parents 
and grandparents who took the stage to "present" their infant children to the 
Lord amid the flash of photos. Today's Christmas services, Barnes said, will 
include the distribution of presents to the members' children and a choir of 
guest singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rituals and ecclesiastical means of worship doesn't fill the soul of 
man," Sandoval said. "Ceremonies are not a way to know God. We believe in a 
'right-now' conversation with God." 
</P>
<P>
 Concurred Fernandez: "To us, the church is not important. What's important is 
your relationship with the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Many evangelical churches also include a strong social component in their 
community outreach. Iglesia Evangelica Latina, for example, runs a much-used 
immigration service next door. Stored in its computer are the names of 12,000 
immigrants who have sought help from the church in obtaining green cards and 
other official documentation. Likewise, at La Puerta Abierta, Fernandez says he 
deliberately has only one office for himself and his four staff ministers. "I 
want them out in the streets and in the homes, touching people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By its own acknowledgment, the response of the Catholic Church to the rise of 
Latino evangelism has been a mixture of remorse and alarm. The church, said 
Father Pedro Villarroya of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, took its 
Latino flock "for granted." It has stumbled in tending to its Latino 
constituency -- especially its poorer members -- and needs to find ways to 
again make itself relevant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years, (the poor) were not the priority of the church," said 
Villarroya, who directs the archdiocesan Office for Hispanic Ministries. Now, 
he says, the church is playing catch-up. One example: 10 years ago, the 
archdiocese mandated that all of its priests and bishops speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Other efforts to rise to the challenge of evangelical Protestantism are also 
being made. Villarroya said the Catholic Church is beginning to hold smaller, 
more intimate services and has started educating its lay members in 
interpreting the Bible, a function traditionally reserved for the church 
leadership. In perhaps the biggest departure, many Catholic parishes are 
offering charismatic services, which emphasize direct divine inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving away from a passive version of the church to a more active one," 
said Deck of Loyola Marymount. "We could very legitimately call the charismatic 
Catholics 'charismatic Pentecostals.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The church is also counting on history. Although it may be weakening, the bond 
many Latinos feel with Catholicism is still a strong one. Many Latinos say they 
have had difficulty asserting their new faith in the face of families and 
friends and the overriding context of the community's Catholicism. At the very 
least, the reaction is one of sharply raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone comes into Christianity, there's always somebody in the family 
who objects and says, 'You were born Catholic,' " said Jose Ramirez, who 
preaches to a 40-member Latino congregation at the Foursquare Church in Culver 
City. "It's the tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Umana, 40, a Whittier X-ray technician who belongs to the Universal 
Christian Gnostic Movement in Los Angeles, said he initially had difficulty 
talking to his mother and father about his conversion 14 years ago. Eventually, 
though, he brought himself to have the discussion, and eventually both his 
parents joined his church for a brief time as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of philosophy is sometimes difficult (for Catholics) to swallow," 
said Umana, who says he grew up in a "drugs and sex era," on which his Catholic 
upbringing had little influence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the matter, too, of whether Christian evangelism can maintain its 
rate of growth among Latinos. Some religious observers say that the fervency 
with which many Latino evangelicals embrace Pentecostalism and reconfirm their 
faith in the religion can be difficult to sustain over a long period. 
</P>
<P>
 Deck said that the move of immigrant Latinos away from Catholicism is in 
keeping with documented cycles among other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of different immigrants, the first generation always 
represented a movement to churches that were not the traditional ones," he 
said. "It's a phenomenon of American sociology." 
</P>
<P>
 In East Los Angeles, at La Puerta Abierta, Fernandez is acutely aware that the 
appeal of Christian evangelism among Latinos may be transitory, and that the 
strength of his message lies in maintaining contact with day-to-day needs of 
his congregation. The attraction of Pentecostalism, said Fernandez and others, 
is that it is theology for the common folk, an "experiential religion" with a 
promise of empowerment that speaks directly to those in society without power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopalians and Presbyterians have lost millions 
of people to Pentecostalism," said Fernandez, whose family converted from 
Catholicism after they became poverty stricken decades ago in New Mexico. "They 
went the route of the Catholic Church and became a sophisticated, rich, social 
and political religion. There's nothing to say that we won't follow suit. But 
we're not there yet. We found our success in the Lord, not religion."

FOR SENIORS; LUCKILY FOR USC, THOSE WHO CAN DO, ALSO TEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought everyone with wisdom and historical perspective has 
either been given a golden handshake or helped out the door with a buyout, 
along comes Murray Fromson. He's 65 and USC hired him last month to be director 
of its School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Between his stint as a reporter for the Associated Press and his 
long career as a news correspondent with CBS television, Fromson has seen and 
reported on a wealth of historic events. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fromson brings to his new title at USC more than his career achievements. 
He's passionate about his profession and deeply concerned about the education 
of young journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fromson doesn't forget the horrors he has seen or what shaped him as a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my first knife fight when I was 8. I probably should have been a thug 
after growing up in a tough Bronx neighborhood," he said, putting his feet up 
on the couch in his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe he would have if he hadn't looked up one day when he was 7 and seen 
the Hindenburg fly overhead. When he raced home and turned on the radio to hear 
the news about it, what he heard, instead, was the now-famous broadcast of the 
airship's fiery destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted to be a journalist. To be able to report that sight with only 
language and leave such images -- well, there couldn't be anything better," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fromson's early life was hardly rosy. Deserted by his father during the 
Depression and left with a mother so tortured by ill fortune that she could not 
care for her son, he was placed in a foster home at age 5. He was removed from 
that home five years later when a social worker thought the couple caring for 
Fromson were too old. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers being humiliated by getting clothes and medical care through 
charity. "Being on relief is a terribly degrading experience," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all he wants to say about it. He doesn't even want to dwell on his 
professional past, saying his reticence is due to an article he's doing for the 
New Yorker and a book he's writing about the Cold War, America and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even a short talk with Fromson is rich enough to recapture a rich 
career. After starting as a copy boy at the Los Angeles Times in 1946, he 
reported on the Korean War, was in Vietnam during the Gulf of Tonkin incident, 
lived in Moscow during the height of the Cold War, and covered the Chinese 
invasion of Burma and the war between India and Pakistan. Back home, he was 
with Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, at the trial of the Chicago Seven and in 
Berkeley during the Free Speech Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the profession, he says: "Television news and print reporting in 
general are in decline, but the free press is essential to the service of a 
healthy democracy. I'd rather live with a flawed institution than be subject to 
government censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fromson is doing more than living with the flaws. He's offering 
opportunities to correct them through the USC Center for International 
Journalism. The center, which he founded in 1985, offers fellowships to 
journalists to study politics, economic systems, languages and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fromson got the idea for the center in 1972 when CBS asked him and his family 
to move to Moscow, recalls his wife, Dodi. "Murray wanted to study the language 
before he went, and CBS said no -- not enough time or money," she said. "I 
mean, how could we move to the Soviet Union and not even know what the store 
signs said? Finally, he told them he wouldn't go without some Russian, and he 
received eight weeks of instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Fromson considers the center to be his most satisfying accomplishment. 
"History is important, and a good journalist has to be a student of history," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fromson is enthusiastic about working with student journalists and warns that 
he will never retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalism made my life. I love this business with a passion -- though I'm 
probably not good-looking enough to break into television today," he said.

IRVINE WAS BETRAYED BY CITY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for publishing Stephen Smith's revealing column about the Irvine City 
Council's mismanagement and loss of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds. 
("Easy Money's Just a Fairy Tale -- but the Sky Really Was Falling," Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 In plain words, Smith described how a reckless city management team led a 
foolish and negligent City Council to borrow $62 million -- without vote 
approval -- in order to make a high-risk bet on the Orange County investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dice stopped rolling, city officials had lost nearly $20 million of 
the $62 million borrowed in this single irresponsible transaction. By my 
calculation, that's a loss of about $500 for every Irvine household. Of course, 
Irvine's total stake in the (county) pool was over $200 million; the total loss 
was $56 million, or more than $1,300 for every Irvine household. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's once-proud reputation for sound fiscal management is now ruined. City 
Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. is either lying or stupid when he says there will be 
no reduction in public services in Irvine. There are bound to be service cuts, 
layoffs and increased taxes and fees. There is only one answer for this 
unprecedented betrayal of public trust in Irvine: City Manager Brady and the 
City Council should resign immediately!

RAZOR BLADE INCIDENT POORLY HANDLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The treatment received by Tyler Palmer ("Boy Transferred in Razor Incident," 
Dec. 15) is the grossest form of child abuse that any innocent child could 
suffer. What has happened to us as Americans? Are we so bent on revenge now 
that we've decided 5-year-olds are equivalent to adults? Even in churches, 
5-year-olds are not considered to have reached the "age of reason."  
</P>
<P>
 I am sick that mature adults can treat a little child with such malice and 
vindictiveness. And these are "educators?" Whatever happened to the "timeout" 
in the principal's office when we did something quite wrong? If he had found a 
pill on the ground and decided to taste it, would the Centralia School District 
board have suspended him? 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on every adult who had input into this form of policy that abuses little 
children, and a bigger shame on the adults who haven't the common sense to work 
out when a policy does or does not need enforcing. 
</P>

 * The school board's "zero-tolerance," action of kicking out a 5-year-old 
kindergartner from school because he found a razor blade and showed it to his 
classmate is unbelievable. It is actually a "zero-brainer" on the part of the 
school board -- a triumph of paranoia over reason.

 * Any 5-year-old will pick up something interesting -- a marble, a bug, a 
coin, a rock, a paper clip. This time it just happened to be a razor blade. Why 
didn't the bus driver say, "Here son, that's dangerous, you'd better give it to 
me"? The child had no intention of slitting someone's throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, what efforts are made to educate the K through 6 children about 
what "weapons of any kind" might be, and what to do about them?

 I applaud the geniuses of the Buena Park school district who brought swift 
action against the kindergartner for picking up a razor blade (curiosity) and 
showing it to the other kids (sharing). At last, someone is standing up against 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the boy's picture in the paper. Sure, he looked cute, even innocent, but 
underneath the baby fat, behind those sparkling eyes, there lurks a criminal 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 This is his first strike. Two more, and I say off with his head! 
</P>

the school district's mentality, maybe the blade should be used for a lobotomy 
on the trustees.

BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS DECISION LEAVES DIVISIVENESS IN ITS WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am appalled to read Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's comments in The Times 
("O.C. Supervisors OK Wetlands Development," Dec. 14) in relation to her reason 
for voting in favor of developing the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county needs economic development, particularly given the events of the 
past two weeks. Large projects like Bolsa Chica need to be brought on line as 
quickly as possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Supervisor Wieder really see the solution to the county's financial woes 
as one that would cause environment disaster? The county government has ruined 
any kind of decent financial rating it may have had; please don't ruin the few 
remaining environmental treasures in Orange County with Supervisor Wieder's 
reasoning (if that can be called reasoning). 
</P>
<P>
 MARILYN J. VASSOS 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I would like to commend the Orange County Board of Supervisors on the fine job 
they have done with regard to the Bolsa Chica wetland restoration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 14, this body of people, in the midst of all the O.C. bankruptcy 
madness, kept cool heads and forged ahead with business in a manner very 
complimentary to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition to the Coalition Plan for the restoration did not miss a step 
in its mud-slinging campaign to discredit everyone from the Koll Real Estate 
Group to the coalition supporters, or the Board of Supervisors themselves. 
Harriett M. Wieder stood tall, along with the other supervisors, to show the 
grit and gumption of our elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As was pointed out by several of the speakers for the project, the citizens of 
Huntington Beach showed their support of the plan by voting all four of the new 
city council seats to supporters of the Bolsa Chica plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Board of Supervisors has voted the plan in, after long, grueling 
hours of hearing public comment, I hope the opposition groups will join with 
the citizens of Huntington Beach. There has been far too much taxpayer money 
spent in opposing this project over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not be bad sports. Democracy is the American way, and it has now been 
voted. The majority has made its wishes known. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "This county needs economic development," says Orange County Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, defending her vote to allow development on the 
environmentally sensitive Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Since when are jobs for builders economic development? It is a specialized and 
short-term fix at best. But then the Orange County Board of Supervisors is 
practiced in short-term fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, eager to make a fast buck, the board members ignored the warnings of 
financial experts to pare down their risky investment portfolio. Today, still 
holding fast to their myopic vision, and eager to satisfy the appetite of yet 
another developer, they ignore the warnings of economic, traffic, pollution and 
environmental experts, along with the city councils of Huntington Beach and 
Seal Beach, and vote unanimously to allow Koll to build 3,300 homes on the 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will the board be when the bill comes due, which it surely will, on this 
fiasco? 
</P>
<P>
 HARLENE GOODRICH 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the worst financial debacle ever hanging over the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors' heads, it's business as usual with the approval of 
development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. The Koll Real Estate Group is the 
direct benefactor of this project. Even after an eight-hour meeting (during 
which) numerous speakers voiced opposition to this project, it seemed like it 
was a slam dunk for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be as Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder indicated: "The county needs 
economic development," or could it be that the special interest that controls 
Orange County won out again? 
</P>
<P>
 It would be very interesting to see who gave financial contributions and how 
much to election campaigns of our Orange County supervisors. Then one would 
understand why this project won approval. 
</P>
<P>
 FRED SCHWARTZ 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 At last! We're finally going to see some actual wetlands restoration! Our 
County Board of Supervisors' recent action in approving the Koll Real Estate 
Group's plan for Bolsa Chica was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we've seen how a noisy few can delay progress for their own selfish 
reasons! 
</P>
<P>
 But for them, we could have seen restoration underway a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, supervisors, for your great gift this season -- for the 
"inhabitants" of the Bolsa Chica wetlands and indeed for us all!

RELIGION DOESN'T BELONG IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a popular conception in this society that the state of public 
education is in a decline. What scares me is that some people would like it to 
stay that way.In his letter ("Teach America's Christian Traditions," Dec. 18), 
Jack R. Dortignac advocates the return of prayer and the teaching of Christian 
tradition in public schools. With the new Republican Congress, this issue has 
unfortunately been reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious right, ignoring that pesky "separation of church and state" 
clause in the U.S. Constitution, is once again putting forth the idea that 
talking to God in homeroom will raise SAT scores, eliminate school violence, 
and just create a happier society in general. Anyone who disagrees with this 
view is, in Mr. Dortignac's words, "elite, liberal, agnostic and atheist," and 
therefore his or her opinions can be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I do not believe in the Christian God, I believe that there are 
places for him in America: in church and in the home. Parents who believe that 
their child's education should include Christian tradition have the option of 
supplementing this education with Sunday school, church services and in-home 
teaching. Public school is a place for the trinity of mathematics, science and 
the humanities -- not the holy Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mr. Dortignac and others like him should keep in mind that this is 
America, and because of this everyone has a right to an opinion, even if they 
do support Madalyn Murray O'Hair.

SUPERVISORS' HEADS IN CLOUDS ON EL TORO; BY NOT LISTENING TO IRVINE AND LAKE 
FOREST, BOARD MISSED CRUX OF THE LAND-USE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In dismantling the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the Board of Supervisors 
has disenfranchised the cities most affected by the use of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station after the Marines leave. It was a bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had been late in forming the authority, which had nine members 
-- the five supervisors, three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake 
Forest. They did so only after trying unsuccessfully to reserve the planning 
authority to themselves and freeze out the two cities closest to the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an ever-widening rift between South County cities, opposed to a 
commercial airport at El Toro, and North County cities, favoring a commercial 
airport there, and with loud protests from Lake Forest and Irvine, the 
supervisors eventually made the planning authority more inclusive. The 
structure lasted less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In November the voters narrowly passed Measure A, requiring the county to 
build a civilian airport on 2,000 acres of the 4,700-acre base and develop the 
rest in a manner compatible with the airport. It was bad planning, because it 
limits the county's options. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A did not require the supervisors to scrap the reuse agency, and they 
should not have done so. By excluding Lake Forest and Irvine, the board has 
taken two cities that were part of the planning process and forced them to 
become foes of the new process. Measure A did call for a 13-member advisory 
committee, but the two cities said they did not want mere advisory roles when 
the committee is formed. Lake Forest and Irvine asked for 30 more days before 
the supervisors voted, saying they had less than a week to study the new 
planning proposals. But the supervisors wrongly rejected even that minimal 
delay in dismantling the old authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors did have to acknowledge passage of Measure A, but abolishing 
the reuse authority appeared to be ridding themselves of a political hot potato 
rather than advancing the planning. The board also must acknowledge that the 
federal government did not consider Measure A binding. Washington has insisted 
that the opinion of neighboring communities be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been any number of possible uses suggested for the base, from a 
jail site to housing for the homeless, to the airport. All will have to be 
considered, and one way or another, Lake Forest and Irvine will have to be 
given a voice in determining the future of that land.

O.C. NOBLY UNITES IN SPIRIT OF GIVING; THE HOLIDAY SERVES AS REMINDER OF 
CONCERN FOR OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boats in Newport Bay are decorated and so are the churches in Mission 
Viejo. Tons of food have been collected and distributed. Finally, it is 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County bankruptcy stunned county residents and occurred at a time 
when most people gladly would have been turning their thoughts to the holidays, 
to spiritual concerns and to families, and to wondering where the year went and 
whether to put flocking on the tree. It was more difficult this year, but the 
important concern for others at the core of the season did shine through. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, more than 100 police and firefighters, Salvation Army 
representatives and volunteers from community groups drove through 
neighborhoods singing carols and collecting food for the needy. The day of 
caroling and collecting has become an annual tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, the Philharmonic Society and the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center had their first Christmas celebration for children. It deserves to 
become an annual event. Children watched gleefully as Mexican folk dancers and 
mariachi bands entertained; performers staged Las Posadas, the traditional 
Mexican processions portraying Joseph and Mary's journey to Bethlehem. Some 
were children of recent immigrants; others were the sons and daughters of AIDS 
patients. Local companies and volunteer groups provided toys. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, a retail store donated a Christmas tree, the Fire Department 
delivered it and parents planted and decorated it to symbolize new hope in a 
neighborhood plagued by gangs until a police sweep last fall. The parents have 
done good work all year, banding together to walk children to school safely 
along streets that too often echoed with gunfire. Their actions reflected the 
need to help police and other government agencies stop a neighborhood's decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross brought Santa Claus along 
to help pass out toys collected from high schools and businesses. The 
recipients were children from elementary and intermediate schools in Santa Ana 
who one volunteer said, "might not have a Christmas otherwise." The Red Cross 
wisely enlisted more than 100 youth volunteers to help pass out the gifts and 
work with children to fashion crafts. That helps build a sense of community, 
which is especially needed in tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, volunteers also helped Abrazar Inc., which conducted its 15th 
annual food giveaway, but which also required something from the recipients. 
Each family receiving a shopping cart filled with $125 worth of food had to 
contribute $25. The director of Abrazar (Spanish for "to hug") said families 
showed up on time when they had a financial stake in the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were ceremonies, too, at the homeless shelters, food distribution 
centers and other locations where workers labor year-round to help those 
needing it. The Salvation Army said it expects to give Christmas food and gifts 
to 10,000 families in Orange County, the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The charitable organizations deserve thanks and support. Last year the county 
marked Christmas less than three months after the devastating Laguna Beach 
fires. This year it came only weeks after the bankruptcy that caused many to 
wonder if they would lose their government or teaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Christians, today is a religious holiday. For everyone, regardless of 
belief, it can be an occasion to remind us of our concern for others. And the 
decorations and trees all around can help spur optimism, and sustain a spirit 
of sharing and giving that goes so well with the season.

TICKETS TO DRIVE HOME A HOLIDAY MESSAGE; CHP CRACKDOWN ON SPEEDERS IN SOUTH 
COUNTY IS AIMED AT BOOSTING ROAD SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Highway Patrol officers said they were increasingly concerned about speeding 
along Interstate 5 in South County, a problem exacerbated by the elimination of 
center dividers and shoulders because of highway construction. They were 
particularly worried about the southbound grade in San Clemente, where the 
average speed was said to be 70 m.p.h. So they decided to send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the holiday season got off with a wake-up call for hundreds of 
motorists on Dec. 7, when a task force of Highway Patrol officers issued 
speeding tickets from early morning to midafternoon. Targeting both sides of 
the freeway, the officers issued between 300 and 400 citations for speeding and 
seat-belt violations. In all, some 15 patrol cars were used. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one ticketed motorist, "People were stacked up along the side of 
the road; I find it highly ironic that it happened the day after Orange County 
declares bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 The speed crackdown over an 8 1/2-hour period did send a message. It was 
similar to one delivered earlier this year when more than 400 tickets were 
issued over four hours, resulting in a massive slowdown by wary motorists the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown this month was possible fiscally by adjusting shifts of CHP 
volunteers who obviously recognized the importance of highway safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though speed limits are widely disregarded, the law is the law. One 
officer pointed out the obvious problems of controlling a vehicle traveling at 
high speeds.  
</P>
<P>
 The safety message is especially important over the holiday season, when 
people are rushing around trying to get everything done.  
</P>
<P>
 The Highway Patrol crackdowns may have inconvenienced some, but they also 
contained an important message about traffic safety. In the end, they are 
designed to remind people that speed limits are in place to help people arrive 
at their destinations safely.

 In response to Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson's comment that she was not 
sure how she could get around her sprawling district after turning down her 
county car ("2 Supervisors Pledge 5% Cuts in Their Salaries," Dec. 22), I 
suggest she do what the rest of us do: drive her own car. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't take exception to the fact that supervisors get free cars, but given 
her position on this issue, Mrs. Bergeson should have the capacity to realize 
that it is possible to drive a car that is not paid for by tax dollars.

ALL BETS ARE OFF ON EL TORO AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of South County can rest much easier this holiday now that the 
County Board of Supervisors has abolished the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
The El Toro Marine base isn't going to become a commercial airport any time 
soon, thanks to the board's imperious behavior, probably never. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's precipitous decision to deny Irvine and Lake Forest any planning 
authority over the future reuse of El Toro should raise serious suspicions at 
the Department of Defense about the inclusiveness and rationality of the 
county's new reuse planning process. The department is not likely to view the 
board's action as one designed to encourage consensus-building about various 
reuse options. Nor, given the county's financial debacle, is the department 
likely to view the Board of Supervisors sufficiently competent to plan the 
reuse of El Toro unilaterally, without the direct involvement of the two 
adjacent municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the Defense Department could deny the county reuse authority 
over El Toro until such time as: (a) the planning authority gives impacted 
cities a direct say in all land use decisions and/or (b) the county manages to 
get its financial house in some modicum of order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the board's hasty aggrandizement of planning authority 
liberates both Irvine and Lake Forest to challenge all subsequent county 
decisions regarding land-use planning at the base in court. Neither Irvine nor 
Lake Forest will sit still while the Board of Supervisors makes decision that 
directly impact the quality of life in their neighborhoods. Not only will the 
legality of Measure A be challenged in court by South County cities, but so 
will all subsequent El Toro land-use decisions made unilaterally by the county. 
A decade or more of litigation over El Toro is now in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as El Toro Reuse Planning Authority was in operation, the Defense 
Department would have remained satisfied with the reuse planning process and 
the cities of Irvine and Lake Forest, as authority members, would have been 
reluctant to take the county to court. Now all bets on the future of El Toro 
are off. What Orange County voters came ever so close to achieving on Nov. 8, 
the Board of Supervisors may have accomplished in a single, ill-advised vote on 
Dec. 20. Another holiday gift from the gang who couldn't shoot straight at the 
County Hall of Administration.

COMMENTARY ON GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE; O.C. IS A $3.6-BILLION BUSINESS -- IT OUGHT 
TO BE RUN LIKE ONE; A SWITCH FROM GENERAL LAW TO CHARTER WOULD ALLOW 
FLEXIBILITY TO EXPAND THE BOARD AND PUT A MAYOR IN CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS J. AIGNER, Dennis J. Aigner is dean of the Graduate School of 
Management at UC Irvine and a member of the board of directors of Downey 
Savings & Loan and the Industrial League of Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little over one year ago, in testimony before the State Senate Committee on 
Local Government chaired by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), I had 
the audacity to argue for the complete elimination of elected county government 
(the Board of Supervisors) in large urban counties. 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County, my argument was based on recognition of the facts that, as 
of 1992-93, the board had discretion over less than 10% of the county budget, 
represented fewer than 200,000 people in unincorporated areas, was losing its 
clout in land regulation to the cities, and was ineffective in handling 
regional problems that transcend county and city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county structure may have made sense in 1850 when the state 
Legislature created it, it doesn't today. Appealing to the principles of 
business process re-engineering, I asked that absolutely everything be put on 
the table for critical examination as we consider restructuring our 
state-county-municipal government relationships and funding mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 What's most ironic about the crisis that now faces our county, in light of 
what I said then, is that something the board still does have responsibility 
for was so badly botched. Apparently lulled into a false sense of security by 
former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's rosy annual reports and 
historical success, the supervisors had no clue that the Citron investment 
strategy carried with it excessive risk in a rising interest rate environment 
and what the implications of that might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances are sadly reminiscent of the early '80s when, with 
portfolios consisting mainly of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages at low yields 
and facing a prime rate that ultimately rose above 20%, the S&Ls pursued very 
risky investment strategies in order to survive. They, too, were operating in 
an essentially unsupervised environment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the standards set in the fire sale of assets that ultimately resulted, with 
California and Texas leading the pack of states with failed thrifts, the Orange 
County bankruptcy is merely a burp in the grander experience of national 
indigestion. But it's a big burp when we must bear the entire burden of such a 
debacle locally. 
</P>
<P>
 As we all know, every crisis presents opportunity. In response to the S&L 
crisis, the federal government rushed to impose onerous regulations on the 
remaining thrifts that were aimed at controlling interest rate risk to such an 
extreme that sometimes one wonders if that simple goal were not more important 
than whether responsible, competently managed businesses should be allowed to 
make a profit for their shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing to this same sort of solution in the current situation would surely 
result in overkill, just as it did then, although some of the mechanisms which 
have been applied -- like marking a portfolio to market and regularly examining 
its vulnerability to interest rate shocks -- would be useful controls in this 
case too. Instead, we should seize the opportunity to restructure county 
government -- not only to prevent a similar event from happening in the future 
but also to address more fundamental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The County of Orange is a $3.6 billion business. It ought to be run like one. 
Since it would take action by the state Legislature to demolish county 
governments -- something unlikely in the foreseeable future (ever?) -- let's at 
least do what we can to restructure county government locally, by converting 
Orange County from a "general law" county to a "charter" county. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are restrictions even then on what's permissible under state law, 
a charter county can "customize" its structure to a great extent. For example, 
we could create a more corporate structure by establishing the position of 
elected county mayor (a sort of CEO), with the Board of Supervisors expanded 
beyond its present five members into a more legislative-like body. Each 
supervisor would represent fewer people and, with new supervisory districts 
corresponding closely to existing city and community clusters, this will ensure 
that the board represents specific, community-based concerns more effectively 
than is the case today. Charter counties are required to elect only the 
assessor, sheriff and district attorney. The county treasurer could be an 
appointed office, and hence more beholden to the mayor and board. 
</P>
<P>
 We might even conceive of electing a county mayor with business experience who 
knew something, at least, of derivatives and interest rate risk, accounting, 
marketing, organizational development, management and the like, and who, most 
importantly, would instruct the county treasurer to manage our money as if the 
downside risk was worthy of at least some discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The current situation in the City of Los Angeles bears watching in this 
regard, with Richard Riordan and his team in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing a business perspective to government operations isn't easy even when 
it seems to be an obvious need, as our own Roger Johnson is discovering at the 
General Services Administration. The soon-to-be created Orange County Business 
Council has proposed bringing in a "red team" to provide guidance during the 
financial crisis, as was done in Cleveland and New York years ago. While this 
offers important temporary help, it really begs the main issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In business, you hire the most qualified person to do the job. In politics, 
people are often elected for reasons other than their job qualifications and, 
as we are discovering once again, that can produce disastrous results.

LAW STRIKES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good try, lawmakers. You almost got it right. Last year our elected officials 
(in Sacramento) were tripping over themselves to get some kind of 
"tough-on-crime" legislation on the books before voters had a chance to 
embarrass them by voting in their own "three strikes" initiative at the ballot 
box this past November. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one small problem. In their haste, they forgot to put into the law the 
provision that the "third strike" must be a felony. Now, we are going to have 
our burgeoning prisons filled with people like J. Demyers for selling $50 of 
cocaine to undercover cops. Just think, a criminal who is convicted of a 
violent rape, goes to jail, comes out and violently rapes again and then goes 
to jail again may very well be out on the streets before Ms. Demyers. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all fed up with crime, and really fed up with the early release of 
criminals who then quickly repeat their offenses. But what people are really 
terrified of are the types of violent crimes that diminish our sense of 
"personal safety." I would propose that society would be in favor of paying the 
$12,000 to $15,000 yearly cost of incarceration of criminals who have proven 
(through violent felonies) to be too great a risk to society to tolerate. Not 
for criminals selling $50 of cocaine.

LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GUILTY OF BAD JUDGMENT IN WAKE OF FUND FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Orange County's currently disastrous financial state, the politicians 
once again prove that their priorities are out of order. Just when the county's 
bankruptcy threatens funding for police, firefighters, schools and libraries, 
the developer-controlled politicians are pushing through their pork barrel 
projects in spite of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Saddleback Valley Unified School District laid off 47 employees one 
week before Christmas, the developers still control the game. The Board of 
Supervisors gave the Koll Co. approval to build over 3,000 new houses on the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands, without providing funding for police, firefighters or 
schools. The Transportation Corridor Agencies, a quasi-governmental agency 
accountable to nobody, continues to build the San Joaquin Hills toll road 
without being able to show that it has the money to pay for the negative 
impacts resulting from this project. 
</P>
<P>
 The public health, safety and education of Orange County are at risk because 
of funding problems, but developers continue to force their narrow, special 
interests on the rest of us. Who pays, and when will it end? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Whether it be the overdevelopment that they have allowed over the years, 
bowing to special interests, or the current financial crisis here in Orange 
County, the Board of Supervisors is ultimately responsible. The supervisors 
have taken large campaign contributions from developers, and as we now know, 
they have seriously neglected their main responsibility of overseeing the 
financial stability of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Whining has taken the place of acceptance of accountability, finger pointing 
is the name of the game, and the buck certainly doesn't stop with them. At 
least (former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L.) Citron had the good sense to 
step down. Each and every supervisor should follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of what has recently transpired, when we cast votes for our next 
Board of Supervisors, or any other public office, let's do something innovative 
for a change. Instead of blindly casting our vote for the candidates with the 
(R) word or the (D) word next to their name, we just might think about giving 
our vote to the candidates who are most qualified.

 Someday check out the Laguna Beach Water District buildings, which are also

 * Irvine City Councilman Barry Hammond has called on Peer Swan to resign his 
position as vice chairman of the Orange County Sanitation District board of 
directors ("Sanitation Board Member Wants Swan Out," Dec. 16). Hammond says 
Swan breached his "fiduciary responsibility" in connection with the ongoing 
county bond crisis. This is the same Hammond whose own incompetence has cost 
Irvine at least $56 million in losses. That translates to more than $1,200 for 
every Irvine household! 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Hammond voted last July to have the city of Irvine borrow $62 
million, without taxpayer approval, in order to sharply increase the city's 
stake in the high-risk county investment pool. That vote alone has cost Irvine 
taxpayers $16 million, which will have to be made up with higher local taxes or 
huge cuts in basic public services. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Barry Hammond who has breached his fiduciary duty. He should resign now 
and save the taxpayers the trouble of a recall. (Incidentally, Mayor Mike Ward 
and City Councilwoman Paula Werner joined Hammond in last July's ill-fated 3-2 
vote).

 * Taxpayer residents of North Orange County Community College District 
(NOCCCD) should be cognizant of the fact that only one trustee, Chris Loumakis, 
voiced prior caution regarding the district's investment of $56 million of 
borrowed funds in Citron's derivatives portfolio folly. To date no 
administrator in NOCCCD is assuming accountability for the projected monetary 
loss to the district. The only action the Board of Trustees has lately taken is 
resolutions to protect any new money funds coming into the district by 
segregating these funds from the defunct county pool and placing investment 
monies in the state Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 No prudent measures to ensure financial austerity like a freeze on all hiring, 
nonessential spending, travel or sabbaticals have been initiated by the Board 
of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 With the probability of a projected $23-million deficit to the district, 
taxpayers should be asking for accountability from their elected trustees. Is 
it time to take the "trust" out of trustee?

<P>
 * May I offer a word of sympathy for Robert Citron, the fallen hero of Orange 
County's financial legerdemain? True, at the very least, he showed bad judgment 
in putting public money in high-risk investments, However, he was everyone's 
hero until those risks went sour. But he wasn't the only one guilty of bad 
judgment. County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and his staff showed 
bad judgment in treating Citron's repeated gambits to raise cash as routine 
matters by placing them on the consent calendar of board agendas; and the 
supervisors showed equally bad judgment in never questioning what was going on 
in the treasurer's office. They all violated their fiduciary responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a little charity toward Citron and a little courage on the part of 
his detractors to admit their culpability? 
</P>
<P>
 DIANTHA SMITH

those county audits. It's obvious that no one looks at them anyway!  
</P>
<P>
 SANDY HENRY 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Peter King's wonderful description of citizen Stephen D. Johnson chiding the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors for squandering taxpayer money and then 
being removed from the meeting by a sheriff's deputy had a biblical ring to it. 
Like an Israelite prophet, citizen Johnson confronted the secular authority, 
demanded accountability and -- like an Amos, Isaiah or Jeremiah -- was told 
that his words were unbearable. "Sheriff, sheriff, get this man out of here!" 
fumed the imperious (Board Chairman Thomas F.) Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's time for Riley and his supervisorial accomplices to play the part of 
another biblical figure, King David, and ask the taxpayers forgiveness for 
their reckless handling of other people's money. Of course, they didn't intend 
for the great fiscal meltdown to happen, and, yes, I am sure they are 
devastated by this turn of events. But the need for a gesture of repentance by 
them remains nonetheless.

RAIDERS EARN SPOT IN LAYOFFS; PRO FOOTBALL: HOSTETLER'S INTERCEPTION JUST 
BEFORE HALFTIME IS RETURNED FOR A TOUCHDOWN. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IN 19-9 
LOSS TO CHIEFS, WHO CLINCH LAST POSTSEASON BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler sank to his knees on the wet Coliseum grass 
Saturday afternoon and watched his season disappear into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad call. Bad throw. Bad year. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute, the Raiders were marching toward the field goal that would have 
put them within a point of the Kansas City Chiefs at halftime. One ill-advised 
flick of Hostetler's wrist later, Chief defensive back Mark Collins was going 
the other way with a 78-yard interception return for a touchdown. That 
shattered the Raiders, sending Kansas City on its way to a 19-9 victory and a 
wild-card playoff spot and the Raiders home for the holidays, eliminated on the 
last day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 So frustrating for the silver and black and the sellout crowd of 64,130, so 
painful and so typical of this season. All the problems that turned this year 
from one of bright hopes in the summer to the dark days of another winter of 
discontent for the Raiders surfaced again Saturday, leaving the team out of the 
playoffs for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties, mistakes, dropped balls, injuries and questionable play-calling. It 
was all there. 
</P>
<P>
 And so was Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who left the team in anger two years ago after his longstanding feud 
with owner Al Davis went public came back to haunt his old team in the stadium 
where he enjoyed his greatest glory as a Raider and USC Trojan. 
</P>
<P>
 If it indeed turns out that the Raiders, unhappy with the Coliseum, decide to 
play elsewhere next year, it was only fitting that Allen would gain 132 yards 
and become the ninth man in NFL history to go over 10,000 yards rushing in what 
might be the last pro game ever played here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders didn't need to look across the line to find the reason for the 
defeat that dropped them to 9-7 and out of action. A look in the mirror would 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They couldn't run. The Raider offense generated 53 yards on the ground, 
Harvey Williams gaining 48 to leave him 17 yards shy of 1,000 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They couldn't pass. Hostetler completed 14 of 27 for 167 yards before being 
knocked from the game in the fourth quarter because of a sprained ankle. But he 
didn't complete a pass from the time he threw the crucial interception on the 
final play of the first half until the Raiders' final drive of the fourth 
quarter, going zero for six over a span of 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They couldn't play defense, surrendering 422 yards in offense to Kansas 
City. Chief quarterback Joe Montana lived up to his reputation of being one of 
the greatest big-game players of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And they couldn't stop making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when the Raiders laid claim to their own spot in the NFL Hall of 
Shame by becoming the most penalized team league history, two penalties in 
particular stood out. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came on the opening drive of the game. Raider defensive tackle 
Chester McGlockton was whistled offside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs never hesitated, Montana spotting receiver Willie Davis streaking 
down the right side. But safety Patrick Bates pulled up, leaving Davis wide 
open to catch a 47-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the flag is thrown," said obviously distressed Raider Coach Art 
Shell, "you don't stop. But he (Bates) didn't have the depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider cornerback Albert Lewis put it a little more bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't hesitate," he said. "We screwed up. We all saw the same thing, but 
we had different reads. We just blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't anything Montana did? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell," Lewis said, "It had nothing to do with Montana. It had to do with us. 
You (reporters) could have thrown it. He was that wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders came back in the second quarter with a drive that consumed 12:14. 
They made it all the way to the Kansas City three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But no further. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down, Williams was stopped for no gain. On second down, Hostetler 
threw incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 On third down, a strange option play went awry, Hostetler making a nearly 
disastrous lateral to Williams that the Raider tailback recovered for a 
nine-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders settled for a 30-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger, but that was 
small consolation for 12 minutes of possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the most disastrous play of all. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 seconds to play in the half, the Raiders had driven to the Kansas City 
28. From there, Jaeger, who kicked five field goals last week against Seattle, 
would have had a 45-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were out of timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were kicking," said Hostetler, who has had his differences with 
the play-calling this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Raiders called one more pass play to try to get closer for 
Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hostetler faded back to pass, Kansas City lineman Neil Smith got past Greg 
Skrepenak and got his hands on Hostetler, who was trying to get rid of the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to throw it away, into the second row," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, when Smith smashed his arm, the Raider quarterback threw the ball 
right into the arms of Collins, who never looked back, scoring the touchdown 
that gave the Chiefs a 14-3 halftime margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight," Shell said, "I should have gone ahead and kicked the ball. 
With 12 seconds, I wanted to move it up a little closer. It was a breakdown in 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Elliott's 22-yard field goal gave Kansas City a 17-3 lead heading into the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With one last shot for the Raiders to get back into the game, they gave up a 
safety when they committed yet another penalty, center Don Mosebar being called 
for tripping Dan Saleaumua in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were called for nine penalties totaling 49 yards. That gave them 
156 penalties for the season. The 1989 Houston Oilers held the old NFL mark of 
149. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hostetler left, his backup, Vince Evans, completed a 65-yard touchdown 
pass to Alexander Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too little too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders began the game with the knowledge that the New England Patriots 
had beaten the Chicago Bears, putting the Raiders' fate in their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the problem.

CHARGERS GET WIN, SAY HELLO TO A BYE

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't easy stopping the Pittsburgh Steelers, even when the team was 
reduced to a slew of second-stringers. 
</P>
<P>
 Natrone Means' 20-yard touchdown run on fourth and one with 4:32 left tied the 
score and John Carney's 32-yard field goal with three seconds left gave the 
Chargers a 37-34 victory in a battle of AFC division champions on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (11-5), winners of the West Division title, earned a first-round 
bye in the playoffs as the AFC's second-seeded team. The Steelers (12-4), 
winners of the Central title, already had locked up a bye and home-field 
advantage as the No. 1-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 If these teams meet again, it will be in the AFC championship game, at 
Pittsburgh. And barring further injuries, the Steelers will have Rod Woodson, 
Greg Lloyd and Eric Green back, as well as players like Barry Foster, who were 
pulled early. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we see this team again down the road it will be a completely different 
team," Charger defensive end Leslie O'Neal said. "There was no incentive for 
them to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers know how lucky they were to win this one. A loss would have 
dropped them into a wild-card game next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score reminded O'Neal of a computer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not playing defense . . . that's Sega Genesis," O'Neal said. "I want 
to play a whole lot better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers had nothing to gain but momentum, and their seven-game winning 
streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to show everything, no doubt about it," said quarterback Neil 
O'Donnell, who was pulled after the first quarter but came back only because 
Mike Tomczak sprained a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney's third field goal of the game capped a 28-point fourth quarter in 
which Charger quarterback Stan Humphries was knocked out with a bruised right 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego blew an 11-point third-quarter lead, then won the game behind backup 
Gale Gilbert, who finished one scoring drive and led two more. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Chargers trailing 34-27, a drive was extended on a 
roughing-the-passer call on third and 11 from the Pittsburgh 44. Four plays 
later, Means ran off right tackle for his second touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers started their final drive from the Pittsburgh 48 with 2:39 to 
play. The key play was a 16-yard completion to Mark Seay to the 29. Carney's 
kick came five plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know the status of Stan's thumb, so if we had to come back next week 
. . . there was a lot riding on this," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries said he hit his thumb on a helmet. He had the same injury three 
weeks ago in a loss to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do anything with it for a day or so but it kinda gradually goes 
away," said Humphries, one of many who will benefit from the bye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers went up 24-13 when Means ran two yards untouched to finish the 
opening drive of the second half, which went 78 yards in 17 plays and took 
7:39. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomczak returned from his sprained knee in the first half and directed a 
seven-play, 83-yard drive that fourth-string running back Fred McAfee capped 
with a six-yard run with 3:05 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the fourth quarter, Tomczak and rookie Charles Johnson 
combined on an 84-yard scoring pass. Johnson pulled in Tomczak's short pass, 
slipped Darrien Gordon's tackle at the 25 and was gone. Dwight Stone caught the 
conversion pass to give Pittsburgh a 27-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to learn how to tackle again," San Diego linebacker Junior Seau 
said. "If we learned how to tackle we can limit plays to 9 yards instead of 
90." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries was hurt on the next drive, and Carney's 40-yard field goal tied it 
with with 10:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomczak connected with Johnson on a 51-yard pass play to set up an 11-yard 
touchdown pass to Andre Hastings that gave Pittsburgh a 34-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries was 21 of 35 for 249 yards and one touchdown, Gilbert three of six 
for 24. Means had 85 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 27 points in the second quarter, including Andre 
Coleman's 90-yard kickoff return and two successful drives in the final two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman became the first player in Charger history to return two kickoffs for 
touchdowns in a season. He had an 80-yard scoring return in a 23-17 loss at New 
England on Nov. 20.

NEWSWIRE: SOLIDARITY NOT ISSUE TO SWINDELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Houston Astro pitcher Greg Swindell is considering breaking ranks with other 
major leaguers if the baseball strike isn't resolved before spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have very few friends in baseball right now that I'm close and personal 
with anyway," Swindell told television station KRIV of Houston. "If the time 
comes and things happen, they can think what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got house payments, I've got ex-wife payments, I've got a 5-year-old, a 
3-year-old and a 7-week-old. So it's going to be a tough decision. We'll make 
that when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell, an eight-year veteran, was 8-9 last season with a 4.37 earned-run 
average. He is to make $4.2 million in 1995 and $5.3 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dodger pitcher Tom Candiotti and Cleveland Indian outfielder Candy Maldonado 
have gone to court trying to slash family support payments because of the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti asked to temporarily stop alimony and child support amounting to 
$960,000 a year, according to Contra Costa County court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado wants to cut his child support payment to the mother of his 
3-year-old daughter from $7,500 a month to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado refused to comment, but Candiotti said the strike made his request 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ex-wife's support is based on my salary, and when you lose the salary, 
that should be reflected in the support level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, 37, has a four-year, $15.5-million contract. He said his wife has 
savings, and he will resume payments when the strike ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm trying to leave her out on the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado, 34, who was earning about $1.5 million a year playing for 
Cleveland, became a free agent at the end of the strike-shortened season. 
Hockey  
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman David Williams has become the second player on his team 
to receive unemployment benefits because of the NHL lockout, joining defenseman 
Don McSween. Williams, 27, was scheduled to make $250,000 this season and is 
receiving the maximum of $230 a week paid workers whose salaries were the 
equivalent of about $30,000.

MORNING BRIEFING: ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A DAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Laker Coach Del Harris has a Christmas streak going. He never has missed being 
home for Christmas in 10 years as an NBA head coach. Those familiar with the 
unpredictability of the NBA travel schedule will recognize this as quite a 
feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said the closest call was in 1982, when he was coaching the Houston 
Rockets. After playing at Portland on Dec. 23, the Rockets were trying to get 
home on Christmas Eve, but Denver was snowed in and they couldn't make 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris and assistant Coach Carroll Dawson managed to get the last two seats on 
a flight to San Francisco and made it home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as far as gifts go, Harris was sort of hoping to find a power forward 
under his tree.

 Trivia time: In the movie "Forrest Gump," Gump wore football uniform No. 44 
for Alabama during the Joe Namath era. Who actually wore No. 44 then?

<P>
 Treemendous: Eddie Jones of the Lakers bought 25 Christmas trees last week and 
gave them away to some people who couldn't afford them. Twenty-five matches his 
jersey number. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 That's baseball: In its best-and-worst-of-1994 edition, the National Sports 
Review lists under Worst Event: "The baseball season. Next year, the teams 
shouldn't even start. That way, fans will get an early start planning their 
summer vacations." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the players.

 Here's the score: Remember Rod Baxter? He was the coach at York College in 
Nebraska who asked his players to score points for the other side in a 124-69 
defeat on Dec. 10. He got fired last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said he was being punished for spending time with his ill wife, who has 
had two operations for tumors since the summer. The York administration isn't 
saying anything.

<P>
 Dudley, do right: Portland Trailblazer center Chris Dudley, who had 20 
rebounds and 15 points against the Clippers, hasn't totally impressed Steve 
Brandon of the (Portland) Oregonian with his offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brandon, "Dudley has given no one but the Clippers reason to worry about 
his post-up move." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 UnBearable: Bernie Lincicome of the Chicago Tribune doesn't sound too 
impressed with the Chicago Bears' chances if they get into the NFC playoffs. 
</P>

 Said Lincicome, "They are among the many still available to fill out the 
Dallas-San Francisco undercard."

 Auld lang syne: Last week's victory over Atlanta was the Green Bay Packers 
last game in Milwaukee after 61 years.

 For what it's worth, the first Packer home game in Milwaukee was a 10-7 
victory over the New York Giants on Oct. 1, 1933, at Borchert Field, the home 
field of the old Milwaukee Brewers of the American Assn.

 It's the end of an era in Milwaukee. Now let's get some pizza and go bowling.

PRO FOOTBALL: SPOTLIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 VIKINGS' SHIP CAME IN EARLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings earned a playoff berth Saturday without breaking a 
sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories by the Patriots, Falcons and Giants propelled the Vikings into 
postseason play, no matter the outcome of their regular-season finale against 
the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Viking offensive tackle Chris Hinton said. "But we really 
didn't want to depend on other people. We've still got a game Monday night to 
win the division." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Coach Dennis Green became the seventh coach in NFL history to reach 
the postseason each of his first three seasons, and the Vikings' receivers 
became recipients of some expensive gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cris Carter, keeping a preseason promise to reward his teammates if he made 
the Pro Bowl, doled out wristwatches -- complete with the price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be more goodies in store for everyone. If the Lions beat Miami 
tonight and the Vikings lose, Detroit wins the Central Division title. In that 
scenario, Minnesota would travel to Green Bay for a wild-card game. If Detroit 
and Minnesota both win or if the Lions lose and Minnesota wins, the Vikings 
play host to Chicago. If both teams lose, the Packers win the division and the 
Vikings play host to the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Got that? GET WELL SOON 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Steinberg, vice president and general manager of the New York Jets for 
the last five years, received a preliminary diagnosis of treatable stomach 
cancer. Further diagnostic procedures and tests are proceeding to determine the 
course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Haley, director of player personnel, will assume Steinberg's duties when 
necessary. DOING THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY 
</P>
<P>
 Players who suffered through the New England Patriots' 46-10 loss to the Bears 
in Super Bowl XX got an extra bit of satisfaction from watching the current 
Patriots beat the Bears, 13-3, Saturday to earn a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish this was the score nine years ago," said former inside linebacker 
Steve Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former quarterback Steve Grogan: "I'm thrilled with the way they're 
playing. It's been a very big surprise they're in the playoff hunt. I thought 
they'd finish .500." 
</P>
<P>
 His new perspective has allowed Nelson to get caught up in New Englanders' 
fervor over the Patriots' success, an experience he missed when he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were on the road for three weeks and the town got so excited from our 
victories, we didn't get a chance to enjoy it," Nelson said. "Now I really am. 
. . . I know what the fans felt like." McGWIRE GIVES CLEVELAND NO BROWNIE 
POINTS 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle quarterback Dan McGwire won't be applying for membership in the 
Cleveland Browns' fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Cleveland's 11-5 record, which was embellished with a 35-9 trouncing 
of the Seahawks, McGwire claimed he wasn't impressed by the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a legitimate chance, but they are beatable," McGwire said. "They're 
not by any means a great team. Our team was plagued by injuries, and we played 
as hard as we could with what we had." HERE'S A LUMP OF COAL TO PUT IN YOUR 
STOCKING 
</P>
<P>
 In the true spirit of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals gave their fans a 
special gift on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 After their 33-30 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, the Bengals issued a 
press release announcing a $3-per-seat increase in ticket prices for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a calculator handy, that works out to an increase of $1 per 
victory this season. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Reed topped his 1989 Buffalo record of 88 receptions in a season with 
his second catch of the game, and finished the season with 90. . . . Ray 
Buchanan of Indianapolis made his seventh interception in seven games since 
moving from safety to cornerback. His eight interceptions are the most by a 
Colt since Eugene Daniel had eight in 1985. . . . Marshall Faulk finished his 
rookie season with 1,282 yards rushing, including 12 runs of 20 or more yards 
and 31 runs for at least 10 yards. His total is the third highest in franchise 
history, topped only by Eric Dickerson's 1,659 in 1988 and 1,311 in 1989. . . . 
Sterling Sharpe had the 29th 100-yard receiving day of his career. Sharpe's 18 
touchdown catches this season lead the NFL and broke a 52-year-old Green Bay 
record of 17 that Don Hutson set in 1942. . . . Brett Favre had 24 completions, 
three for touchdowns, to set Packer single-season records in those categories. 
He finished with 363 completions, surpassing Don Majkowski's 353 in 1989. He 
threw 33 touchdown passes, one more than Lynn Dickey had in 1983. . . . Natrone 
Means' two rushing touchdowns gave him 12 for the year, the most for a Charger 
since Chuck Muncie had 12 in 1983. . . . Carl Pickens of Cincinnati had nine 
catches for 135 yards, tying a club record with his fifth 100-yard game of the 
season. He also went over 1,000 yards receiving (1,127) and tied the club 
record by finishing with 71 catches. Dan Ross also caught 71 in 1981. . . . 
Bengal defensive lineman Tim Krumrie, retiring after his 12th season, was 
honored on the field at halftime. The club presented him with a motorcycle, 
which he rode off the field. After the Bengals rallied to win, he drove back 
onto the field for a celebration. . . . Cleveland safety Eric Turner got his 
ninth interception of the season, tying him for second on the Brown 
single-season list. Thom Darden set the team record with 10 in 1978. Felix 
Wright (1989) and Tommy James (1950) also had nine. . . . The Cowboys are 
winless in their last three games without Emmitt Smith -- the first two games 
last season and the last one this year. . . . Giant running back Rodney Hampton 
carried 26 times for 91 yards to finish the season with 1,075 yards, the fourth 
consecutive season he has gone over 1,000 yards, and the first time in history 
any Giant has had four 1,000-yard seasons. . . . Arizona's Gary Clark had six 
catches for 96 yards, making him the only receiver in history with 50 or more 
catches in each of his first 10 seasons. . . . Jeff George started all 16 games 
for Atlanta this year, the first time a Falcon quarterback has done that since 
Steve Bartkowski in 1981. . . . Since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule in 
1978, only four teams have finished with 1-15 records: New Orleans (1980), 
Dallas (1989), New England (1990), and Indianapolis (1991). WHETHER THEY WON OR 
LOST, THE RAMS COULDN'T DRAW 
</P>
<P>
 This one was for all the comedians who said the Rams were so bad this season, 
they couldn't beat a high school team. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out they couldn't beat a couple of high school teams -- at the gate, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams drew 25,705 to Anaheim Stadium on Saturday for their season finale, 
which might also be their farewell appearance as a Southern California team. 
Two high school playoff games this month attracted more fans than that to the 
Big A.  
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's Division I semifinal victory over Los Alamitos on Dec. 2 drew 
30,065. In the Division I final, played on Dec. 10, 26,295 watched Mater Dei 
defeat Bishop Amat, 28-21. ON SECOND THOUGHT . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oiler Coach Jeff Fisher jokingly said he would fine the player who doused him 
with Gatorade near the end of Houston's 24-10 victory over the New York Jets, 
which ended an 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that the culprit was defensive end Ray Childress, who stands 6 feet 6 and 
weighs 272 pounds, Fisher let reason prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have to rethink that decision," he said. ZOOMING OFF INTO THE SUNSET 
</P>
<P>
 Bengal defensive lineman Tim Krumrie, retiring after 12 seasons, went out in 
style -- Hell's Angels style. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony at halftime of Cincinnati's game against the Eagles, the Bengals 
gave Krumrie a motorcycle, which he rode off the field. After the Bengals 
rallied to a 33-30 victory, he drove back onto the field to celebrate. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Joe Montana left Kansas City's game against the Raiders in the 
fourth quarter because of a bruised left knee. Montana was hit by Chester 
McGlockton after completing a 13-yard pass to J.J. Birden with 11:36 to go. The 
injury was not considered serious and Montana was able to walk along the 
sideline. Other quarterbacks hurt were San Diego's Stan Humphries (bruised 
right thumb), Houston's Bucky Richardson (sprained knee) and New Orleans' Jim 
Everett, who bruised his throwing elbow late in the third quarter of the 
Saints' 30-28 victory over Denver. . . . The Broncos' John Elway didn't play 
against New Orleans because of a strained muscle behind his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys played without Emmitt Smith, who has a hamstring injury and was 
deactivated before their game against the Giants. . . . Several minor injuries 
occurred in Atlanta's 10-6 victory over Arizona. Falcon defensive tackle Jumpy 
Geathers sprained his right ankle, wide receiver Bert Emanuel bruised his right 
knee and wide receiver Terance Mathis sprained his right shoulder. Arizona 
defensive end Clyde Simmons sprained his left foot. . . . The Chicago Bears' 
Mark Bortz, who started the first 12 games at guard, sat out the last four 
games because of a knee injury. He might return for the playoffs. . . . Viking 
quarterback Warren Moon did not practice Saturday because of an injured left 
knee. Moon, who wouldn't talk to reporters, is questionable for Minnesota's 
game against San Francisco on Monday. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat the Super Bowl champions and I don't care what you say or what they 
say. They had their special teams out there and their defense and they were 
minus one player for the game. I know people will say it would have been 
different if Emmitt had played and maybe so. But we won the game. It's 
history."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Giant linebacker Corey Miller after the Giants defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 
15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 ' ' This is about as happy as I've been in a long time."

 -- Patriot Coach Bill Parcells after his team's seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in, crawl in, fall in, once you're in, you're in."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes, explaining why he didn't mind that his team 
qualified for the playoffs through losses by the Bears and Cardinals. TONIGHT'S 
GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit at Miami 
</P>
<P>
 5 p.m., ESPN 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit running back Barry Sanders needs 169 yards to become the third player 
to gain 2,000 yards in one season. Miami's strength this season has been at 
stopping the run -- Marshall Faulk gained only 69 yards last week -- but 
Sanders is undoubtedly the the best the Dolphins will see this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has six runs of more than 60 yards this season. The rest of NFL has 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sanders plays well, the Lions will be able to use play-action passes 
against the porous Miami pass defense. Quarterback Dave Krieg has turned around 
the Lion passing game since taking over for former Dolphin Scott Mitchell seven 
games ago. Krieg has thrown for 13 touchdowns and only one interception. His 
top receiver has been Herman Moore, who has 67 catches for 1,118 yards and 11 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (9-6) and the Dolphins (9-6) are in the playoffs regardless of the 
result. The Lions win the NFC Central title with a victory and a Minnesota loss 
to San Francisco on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins, who played poorly while having an opportunity to win the AFC 
East title last Sunday, can still clinch the division title with a victory. 
Last Sunday, the Dolphins lost to the Colts, 10-6, after failing at four 
attempts from inside the Colt five-yard line with two minutes left in the game. 
It was the second goal-line stand of the game by the Colts.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite those problems, the Dolphins remain the top-scoring team in the AFC.

PATIENCE, BLEDSOE PAY OFF FOR PATRIOTS; INTERCONFERENCE: QUARTERBACK'S LATE 
TOUCHDOWN PASS WRAPS UP 13-3 VICTORY OVER BEARS. BOTH TEAMS MAKE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All the Raiders wanted for Christmas was Drew Bledsoe's two front teeth. For 
more than three quarters Saturday, the Chicago Bears obliged, forcing the New 
England Patriot quarterback to duck from thundering linemen, a blistering wind 
and his own head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But then something happened. Just as something has happened in each of the 
previous seven magical games that could make the Patriots the most dangerous 
team this January. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it luck. Others credit the wiles of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriot Coach Bill Parcells had a different word for it after his team 
defeated the Bears, 13-3, to clinch its first playoff berth in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Integrity," Parcells said. "It happens once in a while. And it doesn't happen 
by accident." 
</P>
<P>
 It happens when a kid quarterback can forget his balks and wild pitches and 
never stop believing his next pass will be his best. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens when the rest of his team has the mindless, endless patience to 
wait for that kid. 
</P>
<P>
 It all happened during about one minute in the fourth quarter Saturday against 
a Bear team that also qualified for the playoffs because of losses by other 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is, the Patriots have won seven consecutive games with a 
defense that has not given up a second-half touchdown in five consecutive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears have lost three of their last four games and scored only three 
touchdowns in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling, but it's a kind of crazy feeling. . . . You really don't 
know how to feel," said Bear defensive end Alonzo Spellman, whose team reached 
the playoffs for the first time in the post-Mike Ditka era. 
</P>
<P>
 The only losers here were the Raiders, who were hoping to witness a Bear 
victory that would assure them a playoff berth without needing a victory over 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 And even after a Bear field-goal attempt was blocked and another was missed 
Saturday, that possibility still existed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was that integrity thing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think that there isn't too much on the football field that's 
really going to rattle me," Bledsoe said, shortly after proving it. 
</P>
<P>
 His team holding a 6-3 lead with three minutes remaining in the game, Bledsoe 
calmly held the ball while receiver Vincent Brisby broke a chokehold from 
Donnell Woolford. 
</P>
<P>
 The instant Brisby was free, Bledsoe lofted a 31-yard pass that hit Brisby in 
the hands, moving the ball to the nine-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Bledsoe found Leroy Thompson between two flying, colliding 
linebackers for a three-yard touchdown pass that sent the kid quarterback 
dancing into the arms of tackle Bruce Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dance not merely of happiness, but relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief for a team that thought it had clinched a playoff berth last week 
before Seattle's John Kasay missed that 43-yard field-goal try against the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 And relief for a 22-year-old quarterback who earlier set the NFL record for 
most passing attempts in a season . . . shortly before he threw an interception 
that gave the Bears the ball with five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of amazing to be on a team coached by Bill Parcells and set the 
record for pass attempts," Bledsoe said after ending the season with 691 
passes, breaking a record held by Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, he qualified that amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if I'm going to set the attempts record, I gotta set the completions 
record too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before his game-clinching throw, he had a pass picked off by Bear 
safety Mark Carrier on the Chicago 11-yard line. It was Bledsoe's first 
interception of the game, but this is a player who has thrown two more 
interceptions this season (27) than touchdown passes (25). 
</P>
<P>
 When Parcells stalked him on the sideline immediately afterward, Bledsoe held 
out his hand and gestured animatedly at his angry mentor as if to say, "Get out 
of my face." 
</P>
<P>
 Too late for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drew played fine," Parcells said with a wince and a smile. "Just don't put 
him in Canton yet." 
</P>
<P>
 That does not appear a likely destination for Bear quarterback Steve Walsh, 
who completed less than half of his attempts (17 for 38) and nothing longer 
than 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one instance where he led the team on a long drive, a 72-yarder early 
in the fourth quarter, Walsh chose Raymont Harris as the receiver on a 
third-down pass that required 11 yards for a first down. Harris was only six 
yards deep, and the drive was turned over to kicker Kevin Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, rookie Troy Barnett had blocked Butler's potential 
game-tying, 38-yard field-goal attempt. This time, the Patriot defense watched 
Butler hook his 36-yard attempt wide left with eight minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in four games that Butler's miss cost the Bears dearly. 
During a Thursday night game against Minnesota on Dec. 1, Butler's miss in 
overtime was followed by a long touchdown pass from Moon to Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots smiled and joked as they passed the solemn Bears out of Soldier 
Field. Once a team mired at 3-5, they now believe that all the problems belong 
to somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be a sleeper team in the playoffs, there always is," 
Patriot linebacker Chris Slade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody get him a mirror.

PACKERS JUMBLE PLAYOFF PUZZLE; NFC: A 34-19 VICTORY OVER BUCCANEERS MAKES IT A 
THREE-TEAM RACE FOR CENTRAL DIVISION TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Word spread quickly that there's still hope for Green Bay to win the NFC 
Central title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers didn't need any help to earn a playoff berth Saturday, but they 
may have to wait until Monday night to learn if they'll go into the postseason 
as division champions for the first time since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Sharpe went over the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the fifth time in 
his career and caught three touchdown passes as Green Bay (9-7) defeated Tampa 
Bay, 34-19, to clinch at least a wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chicago losing to New England, the Packers can still win the division 
title if Detroit (9-6) loses at Miami tonight and Minnesota (9-6) falls to San 
Francisco in the Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to watch some TV, that's for sure," Coach Mike Holmgren said. "It's 
a special day. We've had our backs to the wall all season. If the breaks fall 
right, we'll host a playoff game next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre passed for 291 yards and set team records for completions and 
touchdown passes in a season as the Packers outgained the Buccaneers, 433 yards 
to 214. He was 24 of 36 with one interception, finishing with 363 completions 
and 33 touchdowns to break records held by Don Majkowski and Lynn Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers (6-10) had won four games in a row but extended their record 
streak of consecutive seasons with double-digit losses to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest crowd of the season (65,076 with 9,225 no shows) filled Tampa 
Stadium for what could be the Buccaneers last game in this area if the team is 
sold to investors hoping to move it to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a fun time walking into a locker room after a loss," said Buccaneer 
Coach Sam Wyche, whose 100th defeat including playoffs also made him the first 
coach in league history to lose at least 10 games four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that we have a lot of good players, a lot of quality people 
in there. The players will rebound from what's been a long, tough year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe had nine receptions for 132 yards, his fourth 100-yard performance 
against the Buccaneers, and has 94 catches for 1,119 yards. He scored four 
touchdowns in a game at Tampa Stadium last season and has now topped 1,000 
yards five times in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of failing to score after recovering a fumble at the Tampa Bay six, 
the Packers were virtually unstoppable in the opening half. Besides Favre's 
touchdown passes of six, 22 and six yards to Sharpe, Edgar Bennett scored on a 
39-yard run on Green Bay's first possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're peaking," Favre said after the Packers extended their winning streak to 
three games. "I think everybody would agree that this 9-7 team is much better 
than last year's 9-7." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Erickson completed 16 of 32 passes for 161 yards for Tampa Bay, which 
gained more than a third of its total yardage on a fourth-quarter drive that 
produced Tyji Armstrong's one-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Errict Rhett, a rookie who didn't make his first start until the ninth game, 
also went over the 1,000-yard rushing mark during the 89-yard march. After 
being held to no yards in seven carries in the first half, he finished with 54 
in 15 attempts for a season total of 1,011.

 The emergence of quarterback Brett Favre and rejuvenation of wide receiver 
Sterling Sharpe in the last six games of the season lifted the Green Bay 
Packers (9-7) into the NFL playoffs. A look at how Favre, Sharpe and the

BROWNS' DEFENSE SHINES AGAIN, 35-9; AFC: STELLAR PERFORMANCE AGAINST SEATTLE 
HELPS CLEVELAND SET TEAM RECORD FOR FEWEST POINTS ALLOWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No one expected this much of the 1994 Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 No one except the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at our schedule and said we were supposed to be an 8-8 club. But 
we finished with 11 wins and beat the teams we weren't supposed to beat," 
safety Eric Turner said Saturday after the Browns dominated the Seattle 
Seahawks, 35-9, clinching the home-field for next week's AFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns (11-5) finished off one of the best defensive seasons in franchise 
history, limiting opponents to 204 points -- easily a team record for a 16-game 
season, and the fewest by an AFC team in a full season since Pittsburgh yielded 
195 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 victories are the Browns' most since they went 12-4 in 1986. The 
winning record is their first in four years under Coach Bill Belichick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been better, and our goals are high, but my hat has to go off 
to the team for what they have accomplished," Belichick said. "The big feeling 
is, we expected to be here. We expected to be in the playoffs, and the real 
season starts next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle (6-10) closed a season it would prefer to forget, a season in which at 
least eight starters, including quarterback Rick Mirer, were lost to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Testaverde threw touchdown passes of 35 yards to Mark Carrier and three 
yards to rookie Derrick Alexander and also scrambled one yard for a score late 
in the first half. Carrier added a 14-yard touchdown run on an end-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, stung by a 17-7 loss at archrival Pittsburgh a week ago, was 
determined to set the tempo from the start, driving 60 yards in 10 plays capped 
by Eric Metcalf's six-yard sweep. Leroy Hoard ran seven times for 37 yards on 
the drive and had 71 yards rushing by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier's 35-yard catch in the second quarter gave Cleveland a 14-0 lead. 
Seattle had minus one yard of total offense at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns made it 21-0 at the half on Testaverde's run. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle, whose only first-half threat ended when John Kasay's 47-yard field 
goal try bounced off the right upright, ended the shutout bid when Kasay kicked 
a 30-yarder early in the third quarter.

DANCE IS DIFFERENT, SONG STAYS SAME FOR THE BILLS' FINALE; AFC: BUFFALO'S FINAL 
GAME IS A DEFEAT, THIS TIME 10-9 TO THE COLTS. BUT THIS SEASON, THE BILLS DON'T 
MAKE THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>

<P>
 Once again, the Buffalo Bills ended the season with a loss -- only this time 
it wasn't in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the last four Super Bowls, the struggling Bills wound up 7-9, 
losing to the Indianapolis Colts, 10-9, Saturday, their third successive 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't win as we would have hoped all year," Bill Coach Marv Levy said. 
"We didn't advance to the playoffs as we'd hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to always be in the game and part of the game and to be let down. 
It's just disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harbaugh, entering the game after Browning Nagle's audition lasted barely 
more than one half, rallied the Colts (8-8) to their second consecutive victory 
for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh came in with Indianapolis trailing, 6-0, and passed 13 yards to Floyd 
Turner for a third-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo had a chance to win on the final play, but a 46-yard field-goal 
attempt by Steve Christie bounced off the right upright. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that the last play pretty much summed up our season," Levy 
said, "coming close a lot of times but coming up short." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle, who had not played all season, was given his first start in two years 
but set up the first two of Christie's three field goals with an interception 
and a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh replaced Nagle on the Colts' second possession of the third quarter, 
and his first play was an 11-yard completion to Turner.  
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Roosevelt Potts ran 24 yards to the Buffalo 11. Then after a 
loss of two by Potts, Harbaugh connected with Turner for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say?" Nagle said. "I got the look. We got the win, and that's 
the main thing. It's a team game. I feel I have the ability to play. I got the 
opportunity, but it just didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 The next Buffalo series after Turner's touchdown reception ended with an 
interception by Ray Buchanan off Frank Reich, who was starting for the second 
game in place of injured Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts then moved 51 yards, including a 28-yard run by Marshall Faulk, 
before Dean Biasucci kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie kicked his third field goal, a 24-yarder, with 10:33 left in the 
game, and the Bills' final possession reached the Indianapolis 28 in the 
closing seconds before Christie's missed field-goal try, his second of the 
game.

GIANTS KNOCK COWBOYS OFF HIGH HORSE; NFC: DEFENDING CHAMPIONS LOSE FOR THE 
SECOND TIME IN THREE WEEKS, 15-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Perhaps the Dallas Cowboys could use a little of what the New York Giants had 
at the end of the season -- a turnaround -- if they hope to win their third 
consecutive Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (9-7) capped a season-ending six-game winning streak by defeating 
Dallas, 15-10, Saturday as the Cowboys (12-4) rested injured halfback Emmitt 
Smith and played quarterback Troy Aikman less than a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the streak that followed a seven-game slide, the Giants missed the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas, which already had clinched the NFC East title and a first-round 
playoff bye, lost for the second time in three weeks and third in seven. Now, 
the Cowboys seem vulnerable heading into their first postseason under Coach 
Barry Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're where we want to be," Switzer said in downplaying the poor finish. 
"Everything in the past doesn't count." 
</P>
<P>
 The past worked against the Giants, however, particularly the losing streak in 
October and November that left them all but dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants did everything they could to overcome it, but they needed help in 
the final weekend. The Giants had to end Dallas' 14-game NFC East winning 
streak and hope Tampa Bay could upset Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants did their part, getting the winning points on a third-quarter 
safety caused by Jessie Armstead's sack. However, the Packers (9-7) earned 
their way to the postseason by ripping the Buccaneers, 34-19, winning the 
tiebreaker with the Giants on a better conference record (8-4 to 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 "I have very mixed feelings," said William Roberts, one of the last members 
left from the Giants' two Super Bowl championship teams. "We didn't expect it 
to end like this. We wanted to beat Dallas and keep playing. I'd love to have 
one of those gifts we gave away back again." 
</P>
<P>
 During the losing streak, the Giants lost five games by a touchdown or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bittersweet to finish by winning six in a row," defensive tackle Erik 
Howard said. "But it was just a matter of a little too late. Regardless of 
whether we made the playoffs, it was important to beat Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys did little against the Giants. They were held to a season-low 183 
yards, including 27 in the second half when the Giants held the ball for 23:17. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, who started even though the team said he wouldn't, said the indecision 
was caused by a wet field caused by overnight rain. He played five series. 
</P>
<P>
 On the safety, Armstead sacked Aikman's backup, Rodney Peete, near the goal 
line and the ball was recovered by the Giants but not before it went out of the 
end zone. The safety put the Giants ahead, 12-10, late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Hampton carried 26 times for 91 yards, giving him 1,075 for the season 
and making him the first Giant to have four 1,000-yard seasons.

OILERS PROVIDE EXAMPLE OF TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE; AFC: HOUSTON ENDS 11-GAME 
LOSING STREAK WITH 24-10 VICTORY OVER NEW YORK AND ENDS SEASON 2-14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just when they got it right, the season ended for the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve quarterback Bucky Richardson, who hadn't played in the last two games, 
ran for one touchdown and ignited the dismal Oiler offense to a 24-10 victory 
over the New York Jets on Saturday, ending an 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about this, but I wish we could have done it all year," wide 
receiver Haywood Jeffires said. "It seems like a shame we had to wait so long 
to get our offense going. We ought to be all set for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (2-14) had only four touchdowns in their last five games to rank 
28th in NFL scoring. But Richardson gave Houston its best offensive output of 
the season with 382 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston hadn't won since defeating Cincinnati, 20-13, on Sept. 25. The Jets 
lost their fifth in a row after being in position to take over first place in 
the East on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' victory didn't even jeopardize their No. 3 spot in the draft. With 
victories by both Washington and Cincinnati, the Oilers still had the worst 
record in the league and will pick behind expansion teams Carolina and 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our performance today is similar to how it's been for us all season since the 
Miami game," Jet Coach Pete Carroll said. "It's hard to believe that one game 
could have that kind of effect, but it did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets led Miami, 24-6, going into the fourth quarter but lost 28-24, 
initiating their losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest crowd at Houston this season, 31,176, viewed the game, breaking 
the previous season low of 31,453 that watched the Oilers lose to Seattle on 
Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson completed 17 of 30 passes for 220 yards and rushed six times for 46 
yards before leaving with 13:42 to play because of a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets, and not the Oilers, must live through the off-season with a losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no answers right now," Esiason said. "I'm sure that our team, the 
coaches and the staff will take a real good look at what's going on. But to 
fail is something that's very difficult to stomach."

WADE PHILLIPS, SAINTS WIN ONE FOR WADE WILSON. EVERETT HURT, BUT SETS RECORD.

 The Denver Broncos hoped to win one for Wade. But the New Orleans Saints had a 
better idea -- win one with Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett passed for 343 yards and three touchdowns before being injured, 
and backup Wade Wilson made a lead stand up as the Saints defeated the Broncos, 
30-28, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a 14-year veteran who played sparingly this season in Everett's 
shadow, helped the Saints (7-9) capitalize on three Denver turnovers in the 
final period. Everett left late in the third quarter with a bruised right 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim banged his elbow and felt he couldn't throw the ball properly," Saint 
Coach Jim Mora said, "so we decided to go with Wade. Jim played a great game, 
and Wade got the job done. I'm really proud of these guys. This is a difficult 
place to get a win in." 
</P>
<P>
 Morten Andersen kicked field goals of 37 and 40 yards in the final six 
minutes. The latter, which gave the Saints a 30-21 lead, came with 1:56 left 
after cornerback Vinnie Clark's interception off Hugh Millen, who played in 
place of the injured John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (7-9) made it close at the finish as Millen threw a five-yard touchdown 
pass to Shannon Sharpe with 44 seconds to go. The Saints, however, recovered 
the ensuing onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final game for retiring Denver linebacker Karl Mecklenburg and 
probably the last one for safety Dennis Smith. It might be the last, as well, 
for Coach Wade Phillips, who is 16-16 in his two seasons and has failed to win 
a show of support from owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way too much has been made of all that," said Phillips, referring to reports 
of his impending dismissal. "I don't think there's any truth to it. Pat is 
going to talk with me later -- I assume about next year and what my plans are 
for the team. If he doesn't feel like we're heading in the right direction . . 
. I can find another job." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed 23 of 27 passes and set a Saint record for passing yardage 
in a season with 3,855, eclipsing the 3,716 of Archie Manning in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to distribute the ball to all the receivers," Everett said. "It's 
great to finish the season this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Small caught six passes for a career-high 200 yards, including 
touchdown catches of 36 and 75 yards.

EAGLES SAY IT LOUDLY: 'GOOD NIGHT, KOTITE'; INTERCONFERENCE: BENGALS KICK TWO 
FIELD GOALS IN FINAL THREE SECONDS FOR A 33-30 VICTORY THAT PROBABLY SEALS 
COACH'S FATE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Philadelphia Eagles showed Saturday why they're out of the playoffs and 
probably out of a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 17 points in the second half, the Eagles couldn't put away one of 
the NFL's worst teams. And for the second consecutive week, they wound up 
losing in a bizarre finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals kicked two field goals in the final three seconds for a 
33-30 victory in what may have been Rich Kotite's final game as the Eagles' 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Pelfrey tied the score with a 22-yarder with three seconds left, and the 
Eagles' Brian O'Neal flubbed the squibbed kickoff to turn the ball over with 
one second left. Pelfrey then hit a wobbly kick from 54 yards to finish off one 
of Philadelphia's most miserable seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (7-9) started 7-2 and ended up with a seven-game losing streak -- 
their longest in 11 years. They were eliminated from the playoffs last week 
when Eddie Murray missed a 44-yard field-goal attempt as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 They topped it Saturday by letting the Bengals (3-13) score 13 points in the 
final 3:32. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd seen it all, but now I have," said Bubby Brister, the Eagles' 
starting quarterback the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite may have seen his last game with Philadelphia. He's scheduled to meet 
Monday with owner Jeff Lurie, who's expected to replace him. Kotite comes away 
with a 36-28 record in four seasons capped off by two madcap losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened there, especially in the second half, and the way we let it 
slip away and the bizarre way we lost it is kind of indicative of what's 
happened to us the last couple of months," Kotite said. "I don't have the 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lurie: "I'm going to sit down with Richie on Monday and we'll go from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning finish let the Bengals avoid the worst record in franchise 
history, but that was little consolation. They have finished 3-13 three times 
in the last four years, but are expected to retain Coach Dave Shula. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula's 11th victory in four seasons was one of his most unexpected. The 
Eagles appeared to have the game in hand after Michael Zordich returned their 
third interception 18 yards for a touchdown and a 27-10 lead early in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the NFL's third-ranked defense went soft and an erratic 
Philadelphia offense went cold, letting the Bengals score 23 points in the 
final 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pelfrey's final kick went through the uprights, the Bengals piled up in 
the middle of the field in celebration of one of their few good moments of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody had any doubts out there that there's a Santa Claus, they should 
be dispelled right now," Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bengals got within 30-27 with 3:32 left, the crowd of 39,932 got 
revved up when quarterback Jeff Blake ran 16 yards on fourth and 16 to keep 
alive the drive to the tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pelfrey tied it, the Bengals were just trying to bounce the kickoff to 
run out the clock. None of them was even thinking about winning it in 
regulation. Pelfrey put on his baseball cap and wound up dashing onto the field 
without his helmet when Adrian Hardy picked up the loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran out there in my baseball hat and had to run back. It was crazy," 
Pelfrey said.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWLS; ROSE; PENN STATE'S MAZYCK MAKES BIG RECOVERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the months after he was shot at a Columbia, S.C., gas station in 1991, 
Chris Mazyck talked a good game about playing football again at Penn State.  
</P>
<P>
 His teammates cheered him on during a two-year rehabilitation, but many had to 
turn away when they saw his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck had been shot six times in the leg, groin and buttocks with a .45 
automatic at point-blank range. The shooter, now in prison, was angry at Mazyck 
(Ma-zeek) for not allowing him to date his sister.  
</P>
<P>
 After nearly bleeding to death on the pavement, Mazyck, a 6-foot-3, 280-pound 
defensive tackle, slowly recovered. Then came two years of excruciating 
rehabilitation. He was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all encouraged Chris, but after we saw the leg, we all thought the same 
thing: 'No way,' " Penn State running back Ki-Jana Carter said.  
</P>
<P>
 This year, Mazyck -- who still carries all six bullets in his body -- came all 
the way back.  
</P>
<P>
 In Penn State's 11-0 season, he played in every game, started in eight and had 
41 tackles, 27 solos and two sacks. In Penn State's victory over Ohio State, he 
intercepted a pass and returned it 10 yards for a touchdown. EARL GUSTKEY

 The Nittany Lions, relocated in the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, 
are getting two days off after going through three two-a-day drills under Coach 
Joe Paterno at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Ten champions, 112 strong, arrived in Southern California a week 
earlier than most Rose Bowl teams and spent their first five days at the Hilton 
Waterfront Resort in Huntington Beach before moving to Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't had but one real workout since our last game (Nov. 26) so we worked 
them pretty hard after we got here," Paterno said. "Now we're going to give 
them a rest because we don't want a bunch of heavy-legged kids for the game."

 Spike Dykes, the slow-talking, homespun Texas Tech coach, has a big edge over 
USC's John Robinson so far in pre-Cotton Bowl laugh lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
 On long coaching tenures: "No matter where he is, a coach's popularity drops 
about 10% per year. Well, I've been in Lubbock 10 years now, and I'm down to my 
wife and my dog." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if his team has played an offensive line as big as USC's: "Sure, we 
played Nebraska. They're as big as Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nebraska's 42-16 victory: "They ground our corn pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 On his All-American linebacker, Zach Thomas: "Zach is a throwback to the 
1950s. He wears high-tops and looks like he just crawled out of a coal mine." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Craig Fertig, the USC football broadcaster and Trojan quarterback in the early 
1960s, talked recently of his 1960 recruiting trip to USC.  
</P>
<P>
 "The SC assistant coach assigned to recruit me was Al Davis," Fertig said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He took me on a walking tour of the campus. The first structure we came to 
was an old barracks, from World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 "Davis said to me: 'This thing is being torn down next month, and we're going 
to build a modern athletic department building right here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was 35 years ago . . . and the wartime barracks, next door to Heritage 
Hall, still stands.  
</P>
<P>
 It houses USC's Safety and Systems Management department.

 The Cotton Bowl game will be played on grass. The stadium's artificial turf 
had to be removed in order to qualify for last summer's World Cup. . . . Going 
home: Trojans John Herpin, Cedric Jefferson, Micah Phillips, Shawn Walters, 
Delon Washington and Brian Williams are Texans, and Washington and Williams are 
from Dallas. . . . USC sold nearly 5,000 of its allotted 11,000 Cotton Bowl 
tickets and turned the remainder over to the Cotton Bowl and Texas Tech. Texas 
Tech, which averaged only 32,032 at its home games this season, nonetheless 
sold all its 20,000 tickets in two days. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWLS; FREEDOM; CARTER CONCERNED ABOUT THAT FIRST HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arizona tailback Ontiwaun Carter will never forget the third-quarter play in 
the Arizona State game Nov. 25 that sent him to the hospital with what looked 
like a serious neck injury. And he acknowledges he's jittery about taking his 
first hit Tuesday against Utah at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Arizona State, Carter was swarmed upon by a number of tacklers and his 
head appeared to take the brunt of his weight and that of the Sun Devil 
defenders. Carter was motionless for many minutes, attended to by medical 
staff. An ambulance was quickly summoned to the field and a hush fell over the 
sellout crowd at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury to Carter, a senior from Granada Hills Kennedy High, was later 
diagnosed as a sprained neck and he was able to leave the hospital the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm about full strength," said Carter, Arizona's career rushing 
leader with 3,457 yards, including 1,163 this year. "But I haven't taken a hit 
yet in a game, and I'm a little leery about contact. This is my last game and 
I'm glad I'm here instead of in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of how Carter got sidetracked on his recruiting trip to Arizona has 
become a legendary chapter in recent Wildcat football lore. It seems Carter was 
flying from Los Angeles to Tucson with a change of planes in Phoenix. A tad 
nervous in sprawling Sky Harbor International, he asked a flight attendant 
about his connection, identifying himself as a football player. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed him toward another group of football players and Carter followed 
them onto a plane headed for Flagstaff, home of the Northern Arizona 
Lumberjacks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few laughs over his gaffe and a night in the dorms, the Northern 
Arizona staff got Carter headed in the right direction. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

 Ohio State seems to be taking the Jan. 2 game against Alabama rather 
seriously.The team arrived in Orlando, Fla., Dec. 18 and decided to go across 
the state to sequester itself in Melbourne for secret two-a-day practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State used a similar early arrival to beat Tennessee, 31-13, in the last 
Citrus Bowl. Meanwhile, Alabama is taking a lower key approach to the game. The 
Crimson Tide had single practices last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and a 
one-hour light workout on Thursday. The team has broken for the holiday and 
players are on their own and supposed to get to Orlando by Monday afternoon.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; WEBBER WASN'T TRYING TO SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
BREAKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Let's look at the bright side of last week's meeting in Oakland between the 
Washington Bullets and Golden State Warriors: 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had to win. 
</P>
<P>
 This was nice, because they each had two victories since trading Chris Webber 
and Tom Gugliotta . . . five weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, it was more like two ambulances colliding than a basketball 
game. Warrior Coach Don Nelson was already hospitalized, having all but 
announced this will be his last season on the sideline. Webber, making his 
return to the Bay Area, dislocated a shoulder and will be out six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior fans booed Webber all night. When ex-teammate Latrell Sprewell hugged 
him, they booed that. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some fans had also chanted "Nellie must go!" in a Dec. 13 loss to 
Sacramento. The next day Nelson entered the hospital. Viral pneumonia was the 
announced diagnosis but despair was the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nelson after that game: "I .jprobably agree with the fans. I understand 
the business. I told my staff the day we made the trade, I didn't think I'd 
survive this." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested he'd remain as general manager because "that's the most enjoyable 
part anyway, gathering talent and putting it together." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he had already gathered the talent but couldn't keep it together. 
His failure to pick up the phone and call Webber may have turned a farce into a 
disaster and he still has a problem with his new franchise player, Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the Bullets arrived in town, Sprewell mysteriously missed practice. 
The Warriors were unable to find him, although he claimed to have been home, 
oversleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprewell, in a funk, rumored at odds with Tim Hardaway, still wearing Webber's 
No. 4 and Billy Owens' 30 on his sneakers, suggested he might be the next 
ex-Warrior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'm going to be here or not," Sprewell said. "It depends on a 
lot of things, how the team does. I don't want to be part of a losing 
organization. We'll just have to see." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Webber had been talking nonstop since the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, because he is an intelligent young man, he never said the words 
"Maybe I made a mistake, too," although he tacitly acknowledged it. 
</P>
<P>
 His next contract, he said, will be negotiated face-to-face with Bullet owner 
Abe Pollin, a suggestion he wasn't happy at the performance of his agents, Bill 
Strickland and Fallasha Erwin, and all the advice of his many friends back in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Webber gracelessly suggested Nelson was hiding from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have felt that Nelson was scared to look me in the eye for a long time 
because he knows he's done a lot of wrong things," Webber said. "I just knew 
something would happen. I'm not saying he isn't sick. I just knew he and I 
would never get a chance to meet face to face and I don't think we ever will." 
</P>
<P>
 He turned a cold shoulder to former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great to see Sprewell," Webber said. "And Chris Mullin. 
Keith Jennings. Those are the only ones on the team that I really respect and 
want to see. They still have my back, even now." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Webber refused to shake hands with Rony Seikaly, who had 
publicly advised Sprewell his period of mourning had lasted long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game," Seikaly marveled, "I was thinking about all the good times 
and great things we could have done here together. Then I walked out on the 
court and that comes out of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to get over the thought that the whole world is against him." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Webber probably won't be given the key to any Northern 
California city soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors won, 107-87. Webber finished it in street clothes with his left 
arm in a sling, having fallen early in the third quarter after scoring 14 
points with seven rebounds, three assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet again in Washington Jan. 30. Imagine the possibilities. MERRY 
CHRISTMAS FROM EX-DYNASTIES 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Coach Phil Jackson, who used to complain about having to play a TV 
game against the barbaric New York Knicks on a holy day, has more important 
things on his mind this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like where he'll be working next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the commentary you can expect on the telecast ("blah, blah, great 
character on both these teams, blah, blah, can't ever count them out, blah, 
blah, they've both been there"), the Bulls, like the Knicks, are running on 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has railed at referees and speculated at the impact of a new arena, 
quieter fans and distractions on the scoreboard video screen, but he simply has 
too few players. Insiders think he may bail at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Gotham . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley's reign of terror produced home losses to New Jersey and Cleveland. 
Clearly taken back, he proclaimed a kinder, gentler Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could continue to show my anger, which isn't what this team needs right 
now," he said. "Enough has been said, enough guys have been railed on. I'm not 
going to humiliate them, yell and scream at them, point fingers in their face. 
Everyone else is doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be another time this year when I'll do that, but I have a Christmas 
party today and I'm not doing that. They won't come." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, after the loss to the Nets, practice ran long and Anthony Mason, 
who was supposed to make an appearance as Santa Claus (!), had to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Knicks need more is good health but constant pounding isn't likely to 
help Patrick Ewing's knee or Charles Oakley's toe. The bold move would be to 
rest Ewing and let Oakley have his surgery, hoping to have them at 100% by the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason to burn them up pursuing the leaders. That ship has already 
sailed. 
</P>
<P>
 At its current pace, the Orlando Magic would finish 59-23. The Knicks would 
have to go 47-12 to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indiana Pacers are on a 55-27 pace. The Knicks would have to go 43-16 to 
catch them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers, for heaven's sake, without Brad Daugherty and Gerald Wilkins, 
are on a 54-28 pace. The Knicks would have to go 42-17 to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley isn't famous for throttling down -- just the opposite -- but he has 
never been in a hole like this. A NIGHT AT CLIPPERS, ORANGE COUNTY-STYLE

<P>
 Heading down the 57, 6:45 p.m., stuck in Clipper traffic . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clipper traffic? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a problem they don't have at the Sports Arena, where they've drawn one 
crowd of more than 10,000 this season, the 12,498 who came out to see Shaquille 
O'Neal last week. 
</P>
<P>
 This was more than 3,000 bigger than their second-biggest crowd . . . and the 
smallest ever to see Shaq in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos are not famous for their support of losing teams, but Orange County 
has support just waiting to be mined. This would come in handy for an 
organization that might have another 60-loss season or two coming after this 
one but wants to convince present and prospective players it's serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's short-sighted thinking," says Pat Morello of Huntington Beach, sitting 
in a $50 seat at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year they might have a bad team, but they'll get a good draft pick at 
the end of the year. With the right leadership, they can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, children have grown to adulthood waiting for that 
leadership. In Orange County, there are pluses every way they look at this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as NBA basketball, more than a home-team situation," says Peter 
Prescott of Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would the Clippers face great resistance from their old fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't follow them," says Scott Braun of Marina Del Rey, who has had 
season tickets at the Sports Arena since the Clippers arrived and came down to 
see what the fuss is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't come here. It's ridiculous. But for some bizarre reason that 
defies the law of economics, Donald Sterling doesn't move here. You don't have 
to be from the London School of Economics to see the bodies in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the NBA experience. We don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't seem to have to have a good team here. You just need 10 live 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have 12 bodies, so think what they might do in a new venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling you," Sterling said last week, ever courtly, sitting with a 
group of writers, "we're interested in wins, not money." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one of the writers: "Better take what you can get." FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 I guess we can forget all those quotes about how the critics' lack of respect 
fired up the NBA champs: The Houston Rockets started 9-0 but are 6-8 since. 
Hakeem Olajuwon, suffering from wrist and leg injuries, has been posting lower 
numbers and the long-range bombers, who took a league-high 16 three-pointers a 
game last season, are taking 25% more. . . . Here's a sociological perspective 
on Shawn Kemp's showboating, from Seattle Coach George Karl: "If you spank in 
school, it's child abuse. You can't pray in school any more. Our society is 
getting ridiculous. Now it's overlapping into sports." . . . Here's another 
manifestation of a society in decline: The Nets lead the league in three-point 
attempts, are No. 22 in makes at 30.5% . . . Add perspectives: Pat Riley told 
TNT's Doug Collins that if more coaches stood up to players, as the Dallas 
Mavericks' Dick Motta did with Roy Tarpley, there would be two players per team 
suspended -- per week. . . . Said Dennis Rodman on the same subject: "A forward 
got suspended and it wasn't even me!" . . . Here comes his 19th physical 
breakdown: The Boston Celtics said they wouldn't play Pervis Ellison until his 
knees were 100%, but after coming off the bench to score 29 points with 14 
rebounds in his first two games, he went out again. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey assistant coach Paul Silas, on his time on Riley's Knick staff: 
"Pat is a very, very deep thinker. He tends to solve problems himself instead 
of relying on input from his assistants or confidantes. He tells his assistants 
to make their suggestions in writing, that he has a million things to think 
about and becomes too involved in games to digest what anyone else is saying." 
. . . They forgot to pound a stake through his heart: Philadelphia 76er owner 
Harold Katz, who promises annually to give up operational control, popped back 
on the scene to rip Shawn Bradley, despite his progress, and Scott Williams, a 
free agent signee who had been injured. "What he (Bradley) has been doing 
doesn't warrant the money that I'm paying him," Katz said. "He wanted the 
money. Now he's got to perform. Scott's not performing either. He's not doing 
the job he was brought here to do." . . . 76er scoring ace Clarence 
Weatherspoon is trudging along at 42% from the field, having been switched to 
small forward. When he snarled at Coach John Lucas, Lucas benched him for the 
last seven minutes of a victory over Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the response we were hoping for, big guy: O'Neal, down to 56% on 
his free throws, after missing 11 of 15 against the Clippers: "I'm trying my 
hardest, but I can't have everything. I can't have the looks, the rapping 
ability and the scoring ability -- and shoot free throws. But I'm going to hit 
them one day." He'll certainly get enough attempts, since opponents will grab 
him every time he moves. . . . Runaway leader in the first All-Star tally: 
Grant Hill, most gracious rookie star to enter the league since Magic Johnson, 
at 83,169, putting him 33,305 ahead of the next-highest player, Olajuwon. . . . 
Comment: Hooray! . . . Tune in next week for the divorce: Vernon Maxwell, 
running third among West guards: "I knew the fans liked me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic assistant Bob Weiss, fired as Clipper coach, after which the team sued 
him over the last two years of his contract before settling out of court: "It's 
not like I was there four years. In fact, I never got a California driver's 
license. If I ever got stopped, I was going to tell the cop, 'I'm the Clippers 
coach, I'm not going to be here that long.' "

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SKIMBLE CLOSES CAREER AND MEET WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skimble, a 5-year-old mare running her last race, won the $111,000 Dahlia 
Handicap on closing day at Hollywood Park Saturday after Bill Spawr, the 
trainer of morning-line favorite Exchange, scratched his horse because jockey 
Laffit Pincay told him the grass course was not safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting Exchange out of there made a difference to everybody," said winning 
jockey Eddie Delahoussaye. "But it made a big difference with my mare, because 
Exchange would have shown some speed, so without her my horse was able to get 
out to an easy lead. She relaxes well when she's allowed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Skimble's victory capped another three-victory day for Delahoussaye, his 
fourth in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to end the year," Delahoussaye said. "I was sick a lot at the 
beginning of the year, and it was very frustrating. It wasn't fun to be 
riding." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through Sunday's card, Spawr scratched Exchange, the 6-year-old mare 
who had won the Matriarch on Nov. 27 to go over the $1-million mark in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laffit rode a horse Friday night and said the grass course was dangerous," 
Spawr said. "He said horses were slipping on the backside, so I didn't want to 
take the chance. It rained here a few days ago, and they continued using the 
course even though it was wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Spawr also scratched Desert Orchid, who he said would have run only if the 
race had been taken off the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Spawr, among many horsemen who are unhappy with the condition of the Santa 
Anita turf course, said that he will consult with Exchange's owners, Sidney and 
Jenny Craig, about sending the horse to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the grass course at Santa Anita, forget about it," Spawr said. The 
Santa Anita season opens Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ward, one of the three Hollywood Park stewards, said that Spawr might have 
had a problem running Exchange for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get a Lasix slip from the vet," Ward said. "Without it, the horse 
wouldn't have been allowed to run with the medication." 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange is a bleeder who usually runs with Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
 The turf course was listed as firm and Skimble finished the 1 1/16 miles in 
1:42 1/5, beating Queens Court Queen by two lengths and paying $7.20. Trainer 
Bobby Frankel's horse was favored over Queens Court Queen by $307 in the win 
pool. Shir Dar, also trained by Frankel, finished third, a neck behind Queens 
Court Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Skimble won for the ninth 
time in 25 races and the $66,000 winner's share boosted her earnings to 
$777,678. Humberto Ascania, Frankel's top assistant, said that Skimble will be 
bred next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a nice mare," Ascania said. "Maybe not a top mare, but she was always 
right there. We scratched her from the Matriarch because the turf was soft that 
day." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens' 36th victory, which clinched the riding title for the Hollywood 
meet, came aboard It's Settled in the fifth race, after Alex Solis, the 
gelding's scheduled jockey, suffered a badly bruised toe in a gate accident. It 
was the same toe that Solis broke in an accident at home earlier this year. 
Solis returned to ride Shir Dar for her third-place finish in the Dahlia 
Handicap . . . Stevens overtook Kent Desormeaux on the final day after 
Desormeaux received a five-day suspension. The two riders were tied at 35 wins 
before Saturday . . . Ron McAnally won the trainers' title with 13 victories . 
. . Martin Pedroza, who rode Say Ow to a second-place finish behind It's 
Settled, donated his day's earnings to the Make A Wish Foundation for 
terminally ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani, who underwent minor surgery last week, didn't ride Saturday, 
missing his third consecutive day. Nakatani, whose mounts have earned more than 
$9.5 million this year, ranking him seventh nationally, is listed to ride six 
horses on opening day Monday at Santa Anita, including I'ma Game Master in the 
$100,000 Malibu Stakes . . . Cool Air, winning for the first time since July, 
notched her 13th victory in 29 starts as the 1-2 favorite in the Safely Kept 
Handicap. Carrying 124 pounds, the 4-year-old filly went over the $500,000 mark 
in earnings . . . Chris Antley, who rode Cool Air, has the assignment on 
Ferrara, the 8-5 morning-line favorite in the Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron said the executive committee of the Jockeys' Guild will meet 
via a conference call Monday night to discuss what happens next in the stalled 
negotiations with the Thoroughbred Racing Assns. tracks over health and 
accident insurance for the riders. The current contract expires next Sunday, 
with many jockeys not expected to ride without a contract on Jan. 1. . . . With 
$1.2 million being bet daily on races from Bay Meadows, Hollywood Park set a 
betting record for the fall meeting, with the overall handle hitting $8.3 
million. On-track business was up 7.4% to $2.1 million daily, and the $8.3 
million was a 17.5% increase. Attendance at the track, averaging 9,575 for the 
34-day meet, was up just over 1%, while off-track attendance dropped almost 5%.

HANS HERLIN, 68; WOVE CURRENT EVENTS INTO NOVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hans Herlin, who wove current history into his novels, has died at the age of 
68. 
</P>
<P>
 Herlin, whose best-known book, "Commentaries," was published in 1975 in the 
United States, suffered a heart attack and died Tuesday at his home in the 
Burgundy region of southern France, St. Martin's Press said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Herlin was one of only a handful of German authors whose novels have been 
published in the United States and England.  
</P>
<P>
 His first novel, "Friends," was published in 1974 in 18 countries and sold 1 
million copies, the publisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other works were "Fire in the Grass" and "Transfer to Siberia." His 
publisher said that more than 10 million copies of his books were sold 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Stadtlohn in North-Rhine Westphalia state, and during World War 
II was drafted into the German Luftwaffe and trained as a pilot. He fled to 
Switzerland in 1944, at the age of 19, but returned to Germany after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved back to Switzerland in 1972 and later went to France.

ROZZELL SYKES; ARTIST FOUNDED ST. ELMO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rozzell Sykes, founder of St. Elmo's Village, an eruption of rainbow-colored 
bungalows, sheds and garages set amid what was once the squalor of a decaying 
neighborhood, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the village said Saturday that Sykes was believed to have been 
in his 60s. The cause of his death Dec. 18 is unknown, pending an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sykes was an artist with a self-developed style of craftsmanship when he came 
upon the area, along St. Elmo Drive near Venice Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, a nephew, Roderick Sykes, joined his uncle in what Rozzell Sykes 
envisioned as a kind of ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozzell Sykes, the self-styled village elder, had found "only despair, lack of 
confidence, (and) fear" in the neighborhood when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that anyone can find success within himself, Sykes began 
improvements that included paint, plants and color, particularly the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 He began to enlist not only residents of the small neighborhood but their 
elected officials, and came to count among his supporters future Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sykes painted anything that didn't move. Sidewalks were decorated free-form in 
reds and yellows; metal sculptures of bulls, women and children seemed to grow 
from tree trunks. The small wooden bungalows built in the 1920s now looked out 
on verdant gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use what we have," Sykes was telling visitors by the early 1970s as he 
surveyed mounds of donated scrap metal and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Elmo's by then was being dubbed "The Little Village That Could" and was 
soon accorded nonprofit status to aid fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops in photography, painting, graphics, music, writing and computers 
were arranged for children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1971, the Sykeses were able to raise $10,000 from a Memorial Day festival 
for a down payment on the property which the landlord was going to convert into 
an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 As it matured, St. Elmo's came to be seen as an oasis in the heart of a giant 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the very epitome of urban renewal, of survival," Sykes would tell 
visitors. "You use what you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of his life, Rozzell Sykes had begun moving toward a new 
creative center for artists he was going to call Cafe de Arte. 
</P>
<P>
 He was divorced from Erma Sykes. He is survived by two sons and three 
daughters.

HIDDEN TREASURE; EXPERTS IN A RACE WITH NATURE TO STUDY CAVE'S ANCIENT ROCK ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pounding surf and buffeting winds slowly chip away the sandstone walls of a 
cave on San Nicolas Island, erasing the only rock art left by a mysterious 
tribe of ancient islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the whales or fish icons chiseled into the stone are no longer 
visible. The black painted pictographs can barely be distinguished from the 
blue-green algae that cling to the crumbling surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists want to protect the treasured artwork from further deterioration 
at the remote site they call Cave of the Whales. But they cannot figure out how 
to halt the very forces of erosion that have scooped the cave out of the 
sandstone along the island's south shore. 
</P>
<P>
 So researchers again plan to lug their equipment this week to the Navy-owned 
island 61 miles off Point Mugu to resume documenting the fading sea creatures 
that once danced boldly on the cave walls. 
</P>
<P>
 They will photograph the grooved petroglyphs, measure the artwork and plot 
precisely the location of each whale, shark, or zig-zag line. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, they may try to capture the faint images with special 
infrared cameras, sample the paint or conduct other tests to glean what they 
can from the images before they are lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole cave was covered with rock art," said Navy archeologist Steve 
Schwartz, tracing the outline of a dorsal fin with his finger. "I wish we could 
have seen it in its splendor." 
</P>
<P>
 Most archeologists agree that rock art by Southern California Indians is more 
than mere doodling. Instead, they think it was reserved for chronicling a 
historic event, a celestial phenomenon, or portraying something of religious 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My take is that the art in the cave had something to do with their belief 
system," said Kathleen Conti of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. An 
artist and rock art researcher for 20 years, Conti is leading the first 
complete documentation of the 40 drawings that can be found in the dimly lit 
cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the artwork is thoroughly recorded, she said, researchers can continue to 
look for clues that might provide insight into the rituals, ceremonies or 
spiritual beliefs of the Nicoleno Indian tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the Nicolenos, who spent thousands of years on San 
Nicolas until their numbers were diminished in the 1800s during battles with 
sea-otter hunters from the Aleutian Islands and by recruiters for Spanish 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Nicoleno, a woman left stranded on the island, was brought to the 
mainland in 1853. Her 18 years of solitude on the island inspired the fictional 
children's book, "Island of the Blue Dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nicolenos scratched out a living on the semidesert island by eating mostly 
shellfish, some roots, sea lions and small fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz points out that none of the usual prey appear in the rock art in the 
Cave of the Whales. Instead, the petroglyphs outline the features of whales, 
killer whales, dolphins or sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be some important connection to those animals, either 
spiritual power or that they were more valued than the shellfish which is so 
much more abundant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a whale washed ashore, it would be quite an event on the island, he said. 
Possibly the artwork depicted such an event or was created to lure more such 
creatures to its shores. "We think it is hunting magic, connected with the 
spiritual world." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1960 study of the cave, UCLA researchers asked a zoologist to help them 
identify specific species among the petroglyphs. Other studies have also tried 
to label each creature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fun game to play which animal is which," Schwartz said. "But I don't 
know if any are that successful. It is art, after all." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, researchers found a small slab of rock bearing petroglyphs that had 
slipped off the wall. In 1978, another larger piece fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 Both panels are now at the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles. The smaller panel 
is on display, clearly showing three grooved petroglyphs of marine creatures. 
Assistant curator George Kritzman said the cramped museum has no room to 
display the larger panel, a 2-by-5-foot slab of rock kept in a storage room 
crowded with other artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The petroglyphs on both panels are in better shape than those in the rest of 
the cave because they have been sheltered from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the erosion, little else seems to have disturbed the rock art on San 
Nicolas, the farthest flung of the eight Channel Islands off Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to San Nicolas is tightly controlled by the Navy, which uses the island 
as a platform for radar and other instruments to track missile-testing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some initials carved in the walls. Researchers have 
attributed them to Navy personnel stationed on the island before 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the cave and surrounding beaches -- used by sea elephants during their 
pupping and breeding season -- are off-limits to the 200 Navy personnel who 
live and work on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the cave is not easy to find. No trail or markings lead to it. 
And its entrance cannot be easily seen by anyone walking along the short 
sandstone cliffs that rise from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 A grooved petroglyph resembling a shark guards the opening of the cave, which 
stretches 19 feet across and nine feet high at the center. The main chamber 
extends back 35 feet where the walls behind pinch in and the ceiling drops. A 
narrow passage only a few feet high continues back another 150 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cave had a sandy floor until about a decade ago when a big storm flushed 
the sand back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 A large boulder blocks the surf from flowing freely into the cave. But patches 
of seaweed litter the rock floor, carried by waves that manage to slop over the 
rock during the highest tides. 
</P>
<P>
 The seaweed also draws swarms of kelp flies, and thousands of spiders to feed 
on them. Black widows lurk in every crack of the cave's walls and ceilings. 
Webs dangle from the ceiling and egg sacs are stuffed into crevices like puffy 
white cotton balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave is filled with the sounds of waves crashing onto the rocks just 
outside. The sea spray blows into the dank space, some of it clinging to the 
rock walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the moisture seeps into the soft sandstone, loosening its sloughing 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't seem to be much we can do to stop the erosion," Schwartz said. 
"But at least we can record all of the rock art before it disappears."

SHOPPERS FEEL THE RUSH OF FINAL GIFT BUYING; HOLIDAYS: RAINY WEATHER DOESN'T 
DAMPEN LAST-MINUTE PUSH IN STORES TO FIND THE PERFECT PRESENT BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Frenzied last-minute shoppers braved crowded, rain-slicked roads Saturday, 
jamming store aisles and mall parking lots in an 11th-hour Christmas Eve search 
for the perfect gift. 
</P>
<P>
 And just about every shopper had an excuse for procrastinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing atop a dumpster filled with fragrant fir trees on the site of what 
used to be a Christmas tree lot in Thousand Oaks, Mike Hanover blamed shifting 
family plans for waiting so long to pick out a tree -- and getting stuck with 
the leavings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposed to be in Big Bear, but everyone got sick," he said Saturday, 
poking through the discards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, woodworker Pat Milman, 32, waited in a line that stretched the 
length of four storefronts on the sidewalk leading to the HoneyBaked Ham store. 
The shopping trip from his home in Oxnard did not really count as last-minute, 
he said, because he ordered the 10-pound ham over the telephone two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking up the ham too far ahead of time is bad strategy because "you want it 
fresh," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeling a grocery cart full of Christmas ornaments through the aisles of 
Green Thumb International in Ventura, Nancy Velasquez denied that she was 
last-minute shopping at all. In fact, she said, she was way ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shopping for next year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At K mart in Ventura, Alex Lopez, 22, said she was not doing her own shopping, 
but simply helping out a friend who was too busy with wedding preparations to 
shop for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside The Gold Store, a Thousand Oaks jewelry shop, Greg Taylor said he had 
not had any time to shop until Saturday. He said he had been too busy working, 
earning money to pay for the silver necklace he was buying for his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the few who confessed to being last-minute shoppers, and even for some who 
did not, love -- or marriage -- was a frequently cited factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for his holiday ham, Milman had this to say: "My wife must have known 
what the line was going to be like, so she sent me instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Even big-ticket items were fair game in the Christmas Eve rush. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nesen Lexus at the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall, sales manager Mitch Bohn said 
he sold three of the luxury automobiles Saturday, all of them to husbands 
wanting to surprise their wives. Bohn said he supplied one shopper with a $28 
gold-colored bow to place atop the $66,000 car. 
</P>
<P>
 And at The Gold Store, Dave Grove, 27, a Thousand Oaks aircraft mechanic, 
happily admired the diamond engagement ring he had given Twila Monroe, 30, a 
legal secretary. He proposed to Monroe Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait" for Christmas Day, Grove said. They had returned to the 
store to have the ring sized to fit Monroe's finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady rainfall and crowded roads delayed mail deliveries in some areas 
until late afternoon on one of the busiest postal days of the year -- in some 
cases jeopardizing delivery of last-minute gifts sent through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 And the wet weather delayed takeoff of a helicopter-drawn Santa and sleigh, 
which make annual Christmas Eve appearances in the night sky over Oxnard, Port 
Hueneme, Camarillo and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Aspen Helicopters said the flying Santa's schedule over much 
of the west county was curtailed because of the rain and low-lying clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 For many shoppers, though, the rain was no deterrent. After all, there were 
still gifts to be bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 6 p.m., less than an hour before closing time at Salzer's Records 
in Ventura, Julie Richardson, 24, still needed presents for her grandmother and 
her cousin. She was having a tough time settling on the right present, picking 
up item after item before replacing them on the store's shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin likes dolphins," she said during her search for dolphin-related 
music. But there weren't any dolphins to be found, and, as Christmas songs 
blared on the store's speakers, Richardson said she wished that the last 
minutes of shopping time would expire and that Christmas would finally arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of zoned out at this point," she said.

RIPPLE EFFECT FROM '93 OIL SPILL SWIRLS ON; OXNARD: A YEAR LATER, CLEANUP OF 
84,000 GALLONS OF BUSH CO. CRUDE IS INCOMPLETE, OFFICIALS SAY, AND LEGAL ISSUES 
ARE UNRESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one at Bush Oil Co. noticed the sharp drop in oil pressure last December as 
a ruptured pipeline unleashed black crude into a man-made lake and surrounding 
wetlands near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil continued to flow into McGrath Lake for four days until a slick 
spread hundreds of yards into the Pacific Ocean and was spotted by federal 
inspectors flying in a helicopter to an offshore oil platform on Christmas 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the pipe was shut down, the line buried beneath Harbor Boulevard 
had released 84,000 gallons of oil to become one of Ventura County's worst oil 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
 It took months and $10 million to mop up the oil that soiled miles of beaches 
and inundated the sensitive habitat. Workers clear-cut acres of sensitive 
coastal vegetation. Swarms of volunteers scrubbed hundreds of oil-coated birds 
and other wildlife, but only saved a fraction of the dying ducks, coots and 
other waterfowl. An endangered pelican and snowy plover were among the 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, most of the oil, contaminated dirt and sand has been scooped 
up and carted away. Yet investigators still find oily residue buried in the 
sediment as they assess the wetland's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've noticed residual petroleum in areas gathered in the creek," said Robert 
Ricker, a California Department of Fish and Game toxicologist. "So we're 
continuing to monitor to get an accurate picture of where it is and how long it 
will persist." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush Oil executives have not admitted responsibility, though they pleaded no 
contest in August to criminal charges stemming from the spill and paid $600,000 
in fines. The foreman on duty also pleaded no contest to water pollution and 
was sentenced to 18 months probation and 320 hours of beach cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal prosecutors are now preparing a civil case against the 
company, which could lead to millions of dollars more in fines to pay for 
wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, company officials said public agencies should share any blame 
for the spill because they ignored early reports of the leak. Nonetheless, 
officials at Bush Oil and its parent company, Berry Petroleum, said they have 
done the best cleanup possible and have taken steps to prevent future leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done quite a bit of investment to make sure that nothing remotely 
similar to this ever happens again," said Ralph Goehring, chief financial 
officer of Berry Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started four days before last Christmas, when a corroded 8-inch 
transfer pipe pumping 1,200 barrels a day beneath Harbor Boulevard ruptured 
from high pressure and old age. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush Oil officials insisted at a hastily called news conference Christmas 
night that only 10 barrels of oil had spilled, an estimate they raised to 250 
barrels within 24 hours. But the next day a clearer estimation of the leakage 
emerged: this time an eightfold increase to 2,000 barrels, some 84,000 gallons 
of unprocessed crude. 
</P>
<P>
 Further spreading the mess, an unidentified farmer activated a pump at the 
lake sometime before Christmas, pushing thousands of gallons of contaminated 
water out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first impression was that we had a mess and I wasn't going home for 
Christmas dinner," said Mark Caywood, a state Department of Fish and Game 
lieutenant who was one of the first officials to arrive at the lake that 
Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, dozens of cleanup workers and government agents had converged on 
the scene, where thick globs of oil clumped along the lake's edges and the 
wetland surface was capped with six inches of heavy black tar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of migratory birds and other wildlife coated with oil began clawing 
their way to the shores, lodging themselves in thick reeds and marshland in 
desperate attempts to free themselves from the toxic substance. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, more than 50 workers had been summoned to mount cleanup 
operations on three fronts: the freshwater lake, miles of beaches and the 
offshore slick. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a Sunday, hundreds more cleanup workers joined wildlife rescue 
personnel to pitch in. Beach crews fanned out over miles of coastline, raking 
miles of sand for golf ball-sized tar bits while offshore workers encircled and 
cleaned up what oil they could. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge vacuums sucked up clumps of oil as they were loosened from the lake shore 
by wind generated by the beating blades of a hovering helicopter. Volunteers 
washed thick blankets of oil from mud hens, ducks and other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The product was like liquid asphalt -- very, very thick -- and the animals 
were literally stuck to themselves," said Mimi Wood-Harris of the 
Berkeley-based International Bird Rescue and Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the consistency of the product, it was the worst I had ever 
worked with," she said. "And I've been doing this for six years." 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest of the three cleanup efforts was offshore, where roughly 75 
barrels, more than 3,000 gallons, is estimated to have spread into the Santa 
Barbara Channel. The ocean cleanup was completed by 9 a.m. Monday, barely 48 
hours after the slick was first spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we practice 100 times a year: containment and recovery 
operations," said Darryle Waldron, manager of the Carpinteria-based Clean Seas, 
a commercial recovery company called in early Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offshore size was relatively small, probably 60 to 80 barrels," Waldron 
said, "about the size of one tanker truck that overturns in Los Angeles every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the oil had gathered on shore, choking the slough leading from the 
pipeline leak across Harbor Boulevard to McGrath Lake, and badly soiling 
another drainage canal leading from the wetland to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Outboard skiffs floated booms across the lake, dragging the oil toward a 
cleanup station, where men in protective white jumpsuits pumped the product 
into waiting 5,000-gallon tanker trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the drainage slough between the lake and beachfront, crews battled 
thousands of gallons of sticky black crude that had congealed in the stream bed 
like a thick stew. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dense vegetation between the lake and Harbor Boulevard, other crews 
carved out a work area from the trees and brush, where subcontractors hauled 
off tons of oil-stained soil and shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Light breezes, meanwhile, carried the stench of raw oil across the 160-acre 
cleanup site and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marshland hasn't got the potential for recovering fast, and beyond that, it's 
hard to get all the oil out," said state Department of Fish and Game biologist 
John Grant, who supervised cleanup of the grove between Harbor Boulevard and 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil gets ground in, then it makes problems that it's slow to recover 
from," said Grant, who spent weeks digging out and then rebuilding the entire 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
 By midmorning Sunday, a team of professional and volunteer wildlife rescue 
personnel had set up camp in a flat area northwest of McGrath Lake under the 
direction of Wood-Harris of International Bird Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll among waterfowl and other species rose by the hour as relief 
workers combed the lake shore in search of stranded animals. Gloved rescuers 
used cotton swabs to clean the birds' oil-soaked eyes and a saline solution to 
wash their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never seen so much confusion in my life," said Estelle Busch, who runs 
the Wildlife Care Network, a Santa Barbara nonprofit group that volunteered its 
resources to help save the soiled animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an oil spill, the chain of command is very confusing," said 
Busch, citing the litany of local, state and federal agencies that answered the 
emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through all this stuff before you can even touch a bird," she 
said. "But I spent 23 days washing birds, cleaning them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An impromptu care center was established on the grounds of the Ventura County 
Animal Regulation office in Camarillo, where volunteers treated as many 
waterfowl as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 But they fought a losing battle. Very few survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was messy and smelly," said wildlife rescue volunteer Susan Venegas. "It 
was a little distressing to see the birds, but we did save some and I felt good 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wood-Harris, relief workers were able to save fewer than 40 
animals, including a variety of birds, some lizards, a turtle and one toad. 
Only 25 of those creatures ever made it back to their habitat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did lose a number of animals, but every single one of them would 
definitely have died had there not been intervention," Wood-Harris said. "We 
look at it as a success if we save one life." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Fish and Game is now preparing a natural 
resources damage assessment on the region, a document to serve as the 
foundation for the civil case against Bush Oil and Berry Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game officials and other biologists have been studying 
the McGrath Lake habitat over the past year, inventorying the returning 
vegetation and migrating sea birds to measure the spill's full impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is tediously slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can take years," said Toni Abajian, a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 
biologist surveying McGrath Lake for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Abajian declined to discuss in detail how the habitat is recovering, saying 
she did not want to jeopardize the pending civil case against the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Jennifer W. Rosenfeld, handling the case against Bush Oil on 
behalf of numerous state agencies, said negotiations with the company are 
ongoing, but that any settlement or civil filing is months away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still actively investigating the damages that occurred out there," 
Rosenfeld said. "With damages to natural resources such as occurred in this 
case, it can take a long time to determine the full extent." 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators are looking into every aspect of the case, including the 
firm's immediate and long-term response, as well as the overall impact to the 
ecosystem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any civil damages recovered from Berry, a sum likely to be in the seven-figure 
range, would be used to pay for continuing restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be lasting effects on the habitat as a result of the spill," 
Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricker, the Department of Fish and Game toxicologist heading the state's 
damage assessment, said that more work clearly needs to be done at the site. 
Still, some progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to see some recovery," he said. "At least the plant life is 
returning." 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to speculate on how long the spill may affect the wetland, 
Ricker said. But in some cases, such residual oil can last for decades, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other officials also said McGrath Lake and surrounding wetlands are 
far from full recovery. Inches beneath the sand along the lake shore lie huge 
pockets of oily residue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are some spots where there is still oil left," said Shirley 
Birosik of the state Water Quality Control Board in Los Angeles, one of the 
agencies involved in the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably most of the (remaining) oil is on the edge of the lake," said 
Birosik, who visited the site as recently as September. "Getting the oil 
cleaned up in the sediment is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glen M. Reiser, a private attorney retained by the Ventura County district 
attorney to prosecute the criminal case earlier this year, said he found ample 
evidence that more cleanup needs to be performed when he visited the lake this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless it was some aberration that we were standing on a pocket of oil, there 
needs to be further examination and cleanup," Reiser said. "(Fish and Game) 
does the best it can under the circumstances, but in this case there could 
maybe be some remedial cleanup done that would assist the habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser said his investigation found that the pipe Bush used to move its oil 
beneath Harbor Boulevard was an abandoned, badly corroded gas line never 
intended to transport heavy crude. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also discovered that company officials failed to repair a faulty 
safety valve on the line, choosing to remove it entirely rather than interrupt 
production despite complaints from oil field workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline first ruptured Dec. 16, 1993, Reiser said, spilling at least 40 
gallons of oil. But Bush never reported that leak and continued to use the 
failed line until increasing pressure caused the major rupture Dec. 21, which 
leaked for days before being discovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berry's conduct reflects a substandard approach to oil field operations," 
Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruptured pipe itself was excavated in January and remains in the custody 
of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, state prosecutor Rosenfeld said. A 
new system was installed weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Goehring, Berry chief financial officer, acknowledged that his firm might have 
violated company policy by reactivating the line immediately after the Dec. 16 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously the right thing to do is correct the situation and make sure it 
doesn't re-occur," he said. "They must have felt it was a temporary situation 
and that they would get it corrected as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry has spent more than $800,000 upgrading its equipment at McGrath Lake 
since the leak, Goehring said. The pumps at the McGrath Lake oil field have 
been back on line since May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the company is seeking to minimize its liability, having filed 
claims against six agencies, arguing that each had ignored early reports of the 
spill made by citizens before Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry attorneys filed claims against the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, 
Oxnard police and fire departments, the California Highway Patrol, California 
Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol for 
failing to immediately respond to early reports of the spill from campers or 
other citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made a tremendous difference in the cost and where the oil went because of 
the lack of reporting," Goehring said. 
</P>
<P>
 The various agencies have all denied the claims, but lawyers for Berry 
Petroleum still may file suit to recoup some of its losses, Goehring said. 
Negotiations in those cases are ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser and others said the fact that some public response agencies failed to 
follow up early reports of the spill does not mitigate Berry Petroleum's 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company has made some headway restoring the McGrath Lake habitat to 
its natural state, according to records filed with the California Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter to the commission dated July 5 states that Berry consultants have 
succeeded in rebuilding many of the dunes affected by the spill, and that 
various plants "have re-invaded this area and are actively growing under jute 
netting." 
</P>
<P>
 They also created new breeding areas for migrating snowy plovers, and replaced 
most of the oil-tainted dirt with clean soil, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But information in the Coastal Commission application for a restoration permit 
concedes several other points, including an admission that the company has no 
inventory of its own transfer pipeline systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bush has no data regarding most of the pipelines which may be located on the 
property," attorney Marc L. Charney wrote. "They are considered unregulated." 
</P>
<P>
 All that may change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A law that goes into effect Jan. 1 requires the state fire marshal to study 
the fitness and safety of all low-pressure pipelines in California, and could 
lead to eventual monitoring of those lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even consider regulation unless you know what you're dealing with," 
said Gavin Payne, chief of staff to state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), 
who sponsored the bill as an assemblyman in response to the McGrath Lake spill. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bruce Fincher, the legislation is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura electrician spent part of Christmas Eve day last year walking with 
his son and dog along McGrath State Beach south of the lake. Right away he 
noticed a strong stench of petroleum, and his dog came back moments later caked 
in crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Fincher returned home, washed his mixed breed named Wilbur and called his 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my so-called obligation was satisfied," he said. "I had contacted 
our authorities, then I find out it had gone on 24 hours without any response." 
</P>

FOR ONE CALIFORNIA FAMILY, IT'S BARELY; CHRISTMAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for a few small presents her six children will open on the filthy wood 
floor of their house, Christmas will be just like any other day for Therese 
Alarcon and her family. Like many rural families dependent on seasonal farm 
work, traditional holidays aren't possible for Alarcon's family. 
</P>
<P>
 They live on $9,000 a year, more than $10,000 below the poverty line for a 
family of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the days blend into days," says Alarcon, 38. "Rich people make 
a big deal out of Christmas. We can't. On Christmas, they'll open their 
presents and the day will go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who lives with her illegal immigrant common-law husband, says her 
family barely survives. 
</P>
<P>
 They live in a makeshift wood-frame house with cobwebs lining the kitchen 
ceiling and torn up couches worse than anything given away by the Salvation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse for Alarcon, her oven broke two weeks ago, and her phone 
was disconnected when she couldn't pay a $600 bill. She owed five monthly 
payments of $209 on her car when it was repossessed three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the family manages to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 A wood-burning stove warms the main room, where the family sleeps during the 
winter months when evening temperatures can dip into the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two beds for eight people, sleeping isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we have everyone sleeping everywhere," she says. "We just kind of 
all pile on top of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The family has gotten used to the constant whizzing of traffic along Highway 
99 just 10 yards from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise seems to ease from 2 to 4 a.m., but Alarcon says her family has a 
constant ringing in their ears and has suffered permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as noisy are the sounds of Southern Pacific freight trains rumbling by 
five times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The family lives in Traver, an unincorporated rural farming community in 
Tulare County. Tulare has a child poverty rate of 38 percent, the state's 
highest, says Sandy Beals, director of FoodLink, a nonprofit charity food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people really do not have a dollar," says social worker Jana Mathias. 
"We take it for granted that we can always find a way to get money for food or 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Traver is such a small community, poor people there often can't get 
help from agencies in larger towns that only help their own residents, Mathias 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon normally applies for welfare this time of year but won't now because 
of the recently passed Proposition 187, which denies benefits to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Her common-law husband and father to two of her six children is a Mexican 
resident and earns $5 an hour during the summer as a farm worker. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't apply for citizenship because he has four drunken driving convictions 
from seven years ago, Alarcon says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon hates her house, but right now it's all she has. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in Mexico conditions," she says. "Sometimes I wish it would burn down 
when I wasn't here."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STORM FRONT EXPECTED TO MOVE INLAND

<P>
 Rain showers that contributed to a series of traffic accidents Saturday on 
Ventura County roads were expected to taper off this morning, with the 
Christmas Day forecast calling for overcast skies and temperatures in the low 
60s, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the accidents occurred Saturday afternoon as cars collided on 
rain-slicked streets and freeways during the last-minute Christmas shopping 
rush, authorities said.None of the late afternoon accidents resulted in serious 
injuries, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the National Weather Service predicted a 10% chance of rain for this 
morning, forecasters said the possibility will diminish as the storm front from 
the Gulf of Alaska moves inland in a southeasterly direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Saturday, at least eight motorists had been arrested on suspicion 
of drunk driving since a maximum enforcement period began at 6 p.m. Friday 
night, the CHP said. The enforcement period will continue through the long 
holiday weekend. CHRISTINA LIMA

U.N. SETTLES SEX BIAS CASE FOR $94,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations said Friday it had settled one of its most protracted sex 
discrimination cases, awarding American Catherine Claxton $94,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she will be reimbursed $110,300 for legal fees and $6,500 for 
costs in the case she brought against Luis Maria Gomez, an Argentine official, 
who was second in command in the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) before he 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the deal worked out with Claxton means she receives the money for 
compensation resulting from the "prolonged and complex nature of the 
proceedings that led to the resolution of her case," a U.N. announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also provides that Claxton, an office worker, can appeal a 
decision concerning her job classification at the United Nations without 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. sources said the settlement does not cover her suit in New York State 
court against Gomez personally, where she and her lawyers seek $2 million 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Claxton, in still secret papers, charged three years ago that in 1988, Gomez 
shut the door to his office, grabbed and kissed her, and in another incident in 
a routine meeting, made sexual remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez denied the entire episode as fiction and his lawyers at one point 
demanded the case be reopened.

RISE IN TURTLE DEATHS MAY BE GOOD SIGN -- OR A BAD ONE; TEXAS: MARINE 
BIOLOGISTS SEE A JUMP IN STRANDINGS ALONG THE STATE'S COASTLINE. IT COULD MEAN 
THERE ARE MORE SEA TURTLES NOW, OR IT COULD MEAN MORE ARE DYING IN NETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DRAGO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marine biologists say a drastic jump in the number of sea turtles washing up 
on Texas beaches this past year reflects both good and bad trends in 
conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 sea turtles, about half of them endangered Kemp's ridleys, have 
washed ashore so far in 1994, far more than any year in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 David Owens, a marine biologist at Texas A&M University, said the increase is 
caused partially by successful efforts to bolster turtle populations. But 
increasing numbers of Gulf of Mexico shrimpers apparently are ignoring use of a 
federally required device to eject turtles from nets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is the appearance that there may be some success in the 
(conservation) efforts," said Owens, who has spent 20 years studying sea 
turtles. "The bad news is if we don't increase the care with which we use 
turtle excluder devices, it's going to be for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Shaver, the Texas Department of Parks & Wildlife biologist in charge of 
a state network for tracking sea turtle deaths, said 506 stranded sea turtles 
had washed up on Texas shores this year as of Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 That total already is nearly triple last year's 185. The highest previous 
annual total over the past decade was 355 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 253 Kemp's ridleys, including 27 of the roughly 580 adult females 
known to exist, were among those that washed ashore this year, Shaver said. 
Another 120 or so Kemp's ridleys have washed up in Louisiana this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Female Kemp's ridleys lay their eggs on beaches in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, just 
south of the Texas border. The imperiled species neared extinction in the 
mid-1980s because of egg-eating natural predators and nest-raiding poachers. 
The adult female population dipped below 200 at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 An aggressive conservation plan on both sides of the border has included teams 
of volunteers rounding up the eggs and moving them to protected beach areas. 
Shrimpers have also been required to install the turtle excluder devices, known 
as TEDs, which allow turtles to escape nets through a hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts have paid off, with the adult female population tripling. Shaver 
said no one knows how many Kemp's ridleys exist, but their overall population 
is certain to have gone up along with the nesting females. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver was alarmed, however, by the drastic jump in stranded turtles in Texas 
this year. Some of the increase probably is caused by conservation efforts, but 
most of it is because shrimpers aren't using TEDs or use them improperly, she 
said. Shrimpers complain that the devices reduce their catches. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very large proportion of the turtles stranded this year were stranded as a 
result of being caught in shrimp nets," Shaver said from her office on South 
Padre Island. "The population doesn't go up 2 1/2 times in one year." 
</P>
<P>
 The shrimping industry claims that the vast majority of the state's 4,500 
licensed trawlers use TEDs. Owens, however, said even a small number of 
lawbreakers could offset conservation gains. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and other marine biologists in Texas are working on suggestions for 
persuading more shrimpers to comply with the law. He favors education over 
increased enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in education because I believe shrimpers have a vested interest in 
using those things right," Owens said, adding that TEDs eject such creatures as 
sharks and stingrays from nets. "Plus it's in their own best interest to get 
the government off their back." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Smullen, a National Marine Fisheries Service spokesman in Washington, 
said nearly all shrimpers are believed to be using the devices. Some, however, 
have sewn the devices shut or are using them at the wrong angles either out of 
ignorance or to skirt the law, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the agency, which works with the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect trawlers, 
is planning ways to improve oversight and educate shrimpers.

100 YEARS LATER, OREGON REMEMBERS WORST FIRE; TRAGEDY: FORTY-THREE PEOPLE 
PERISHED ON A BITTERLY COLD CHRISTMAS EVE IN A REMOTE TRADING POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a bitterly cold night 100 years ago Christmas Eve, the deadliest fire in 
Oregon history claimed 43 lives at a Christmas pageant in this remote Lake 
County settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 men, women and children had packed into the J. H. Clayton Hall above 
the Chrisman Store for a program of musical and dramatic performances and a 
gift exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a joyful occasion for the hard-working residents of the only 
established trading post between Prineville and Lakeview. 
</P>
<P>
 The families of Oregon Trail pioneers rarely had the time to celebrate on the 
high desert, so nearly everyone from the settlement was there. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest survivor, Veva Poorman, died last year just before her 99th 
birthday. She was only 7 months old when her father, John Buick, carried her 
and her older brother, Frank, from the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 But tales of the 1894 blaze still live in the memories of the children and 
grandchildren of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Poorman, for example, spoke often of the fire during her long life, according 
to her daughter-in-law, Joan Poorman of Manlius, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Poorman recalled her father telling her how he placed her on the bar of the 
saloon across the street and returned to search for his wife and a third child, 
who were killed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a marvelous storyteller," Joan Poorman said of her mother-in-law. "I 
think she was proud of being the last survivor. It showed that adversity is 
strengthening to character." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Lake rancher Marjorie Iverson recalls the story of her father, Jewell, 
a boy of 5 in 1894, whose sister probably saved the family by coming down with 
a cold and earache that kept them home that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Dad wanted to go with the Schroeders, who were neighbors," Iverson said. 
"But my grandmother wouldn't let him go." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Augustus Schroeder saw his first wife, Lucinda, and their 
young son, Eston, perish in the flames. Schroeder remarried later and had five 
children, including Neva Warner, 95, Silver Lake's oldest citizen until she 
moved to a Bend foster home in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner, who spent her entire life in the tiny desert community, said her 
father saved many lives even though he could not rescue his own wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father never would talk about it much," she said. "When you lose your 
loved ones like that, it does something to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Historian F. A. Shaver wrote an account of the fire for the Western Historical 
Publishing Co. in 1905. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Eve in 1894, family members sat side by side on planks set atop 
chairs and boxes, watching friends and loved ones sing and perform on the stage 
of a community hall that was used for dances, theater shows and sermons by 
roving evangelists. 
</P>
<P>
 The hall was decorated with paper chains and festoons of fragrant pine. A 
Christmas tree next to the stage was dressed in paper ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it started. The choir was finishing its last song of the evening when 
18-year-old George Payne stood and walked along one of the makeshift benches. 
His head bumped a large Rochester lamp suspended from the ceiling, causing it 
to slosh coal oil into the burner and flare and flame inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the building, Francis Chrisman, grabbed the flaming lamp from the 
chandelier and hurried with it across the crowded room toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't make it. Panic broke out and the lamp fell to the floor, where it 
was kicked around, spreading oil all about. A few men pleaded for order, but it 
was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 People stumbled over benches and surged toward the only exit, trampling each 
other in their rush. A young woman's dress burst into flames. Terror swept 
through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver wrote that some were calling loudly for loved ones, others were rushing 
through the blinding smoke and flames, trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only entrance, a door to the narrow stairs leading down to the 
Chrisman Store, opened inward and was quickly blocked by the crush of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the stage, two windows on the front of the building provided escape for 
only a few, such as Walter Duncan who crawled onto the porch roof just below 
the windows and helped rescue about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Water was pumped on those stumbling out of the building with their clothes 
aflame, until the hose rig jammed. Then the stairs, heavy with people, 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 A few still in the hall leaped through the flames into the dark night rather 
than face the swelling inferno behind them. The rest were overcome by heat, 
smoke and flame. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the instant the lamp was bumped, hardly more than two minutes passed 
before the entire building was engulfed by fire. The screams and groans . . . 
were heart-rending," Lake County Judge E. M. Brattain wrote to the Morning 
Oregonian several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he even knew the extent of the tragedy, Ed O'Farrell, a young cowboy 
working on a local ranch, fled on horseback to summon Dr. Bernard Daly in 
Lakeview, 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Farrell crossed the snowy desert in minus-20-degree weather at full gallop, 
changing mounts at ranches along the way and arranging for fresh horses to be 
waiting upon the doctor's return. 
</P>
<P>
 When Daly arrived at the grim scene on the morning of Dec. 26, every house in 
the village had been turned into a hospital. People from Paisley, Summer Lake 
and ranches throughout the area arrived for days to offer what help they could. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead included 19 women and eight children. Nearly every family saw a loved 
one perish. There was little left but ashes and bones that were gathered up and 
placed in a single large coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the tragedy took four days by mail stage and telegraph to reach 
Portland, where the Dec. 29 Morning Oregonian reported it, followed by The New 
York Times the next day, and newspapers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came to Silver Lake in 1912, people were still talking about it," 
said Vivian Stratton, now 90. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-foot-high granite monument bearing the names and ages of those who died 
was erected in 1898 and still stands today. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief memorial service is planned at 4:30 p.m. Dec. 29 at the Silver Lake 
Cemetery.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOLIDAY TREES TO BE RECYCLED AT 6 SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting Monday, residents who want to recycle their Christmas trees can do so 
at six Thousand Oaks locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who would rather keep the tree around for a while, the city will 
accept trees until Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The six locations are Borchard Park Service Center, 250 Reino Road, Newbury 
Park; Triunfo Community Park, 980 Aranmoor Ave., Westlake Village; Cal Lutheran 
University, Mount Clef Boulevard and Olsen Road; Home Depot, 500 N. Ventu Park 
Road; Park & Ride at Janss Road and the Moorpark Freeway, and Park & Ride, 
Rancho Road at the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's public works department asks that trees be stripped of all 
ornaments and tinsel and that nails and stands be removed. The trees will be 
hauled to the Calabasas landfill and turned into mulch to be used throughout 
the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, residents recycled more than 13,000 noble and Douglas firs and pine 
trees, Mayor Jaime Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you recycle your Christmas tree, you are helping the environment by 
keeping a valuable resource out of the landfill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees that are flocked, painted or fire-proofed will not be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the city's Recycling Hotline at 449-SAVE. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; 2 DOGS RETURNED TO OWNERS AFTER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Rottweiler dogs have been released from the pound and returned to their 
Newbury Park owners, five weeks after attacking two joggers and just days 
before the animals were scheduled to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs, Rommel and Heidi, were judged not dangerous after a dramatic, 
four-hour-long hearing earlier this month.But Los Angeles County Animal Care 
and Control officials found that the dogs' owners, the Hale family, had been 
negligent in allowing the dogs to escape and threaten neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the dogs back, the Hales had to pay boarding fees, promise to keep the 
dogs locked up and buy an insurance policy for $100,000 in liability coverage. 
If the conditions were not met in 15 days, the dogs were to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the insurance that posed a problem. The Hales said they spent days 
calling dozens of insurance companies without finding one willing to write a 
policy that included the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, the Hales located an insurance company that agreed to 
provide $100,000 worth of coverage for them and the dogs for a $500 annual 
premium. They signed the policy Friday morning and then picked up the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a lot happier around the Hale house today," Rocky Hale said 
Saturday. "We weren't going to have much of a Christmas. Now it's like 
everything's been lifted off us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said Rommel's weight had dropped from 135 pounds to 90 pounds during 37 
days at the pound. And he said both Heidi and Rommel were sick with kennel 
cough. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their illness, the dogs seemed pleased to be home, he said. "They're 
here and they're happy," he said. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 Police officers fired nine non-lethal "sand-bag" rounds at a Ventura man 
Saturday after the suspect reportedly threatened to kill family members and 
assaulted officers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Paul Carlson, 33, was booked into County Jail on suspicion of battery 
against a peace officer, resisting arrest and injuring officers, a jail 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police were called to Carlson's parents' home on the 400 block of Dayloma 
Avenue in Ventura after Carlson went into an unexplained violent episode -- 
threatening to kill his father with a hammer, police said. When officers 
arrived Carlson burst through the front door, tearing it off its hinges, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attempt to arrest Carlson, officers struck him several times with 
batons, doused him with pepper spray, and tried to wrestle him to the ground -- 
all to no avail. They finally fired a shotgun loaded with 2-inch-by-2-inch 
sandbag rounds, striking him four times in the chest, but Carlson would not 
fall. He ran from the scene, and was chased onto the Ventura College campus 
about two blocks away. There he was cornered by 15 Ventura police officers, two 
college police officer and a Ventura County sheriff's deputy with a police dog. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one very big, very angry man," a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson was shot five more times with the sandbag rounds, and while the dog 
attacked him he was swarmed by six officers, the spokeswoman said. Three 
officers were slightly injured in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson sustained a minor puncture wound to the elbow from the sandbag blasts 
and several dog bites to the legs and groin. He was treated at Ventura County 
Medical Center before being booked. Bail was set at $20,000. SCOTT HADLY

CHURCH CELEBRATES REBIRTH FROM ASHES; THOUSAND OAKS: TESTED BY A DEVASTATING 
FIRE, THE CONGREGATION OF REDEEMER LUTHERAN HAS A NEW SANCTUARY AND RENEWED 
FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The crisp fragrance of pine boughs may overpower the lingering smell of fresh 
paint during today's Christmas celebration at Redeemer Lutheran Church in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Rev. Elroi Reimnitz, the gleaming whitewashed walls are just as 
important as the pungent holly-flecked wreaths. For both symbols remind him of 
miraculous births. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's service marks the first time in three years that Reimnitz has been 
able to usher Christmas in to his own "spiritual home" -- the familiar, 
friendly sanctuary at Redeemer Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, on the corner of Camino Dos Rios and Lynn Road, was burned to a 
skeletal rubble in a mysterious blaze just a week before Christmas in 1992. The 
devastating fire scorched the Christmas tree, gutted the sanctuary and buried 
the altar under a swirl of soot. 
</P>
<P>
 This Christmas, however, Redeemer Lutheran Church is whole again -- thanks to 
a $1.1-million overhaul completed in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's 140 members are overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a chance to experience the true meaning of rebirth at 
Christmastime," said Bruce McDougall, the congregation president. "It's going 
to be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Resurrecting Redeemer Lutheran required two years of hard work. Starting just 
a few weeks after the fire, congregation members began to examine blueprints, 
interview contractors, haggle with insurance agents and review construction 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the reconstruction, the congregation met in a spare, cramped Sunday 
school classroom a few yards from the sooty sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't get discouraged, impatient or upset," Reimnitz said, marveling 
at his flock's faith. "They were very supportive. They realized that a church 
is not the building, it's the people. And they stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 They even learned to joke about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's recruitment brochure, designed to woo new members to the 
congregation, features a sepia-tone photo of the church as it looked just after 
the fire -- the altar reduced to rubble, the pews scorched, and every religious 
icon either singed or cracked beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry caption read: "Are you burned-out, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spinning a bane into a blessing, the brochure explains that worshipers at 
Redeemer Lutheran have learned new empathy since the flames destroyed their 
church. Welcoming potential worshipers who might feel lonely, depressed or 
adrift, the brochure states consolingly, "We know how it feels to lose 
something that is very dear to us." 
</P>
<P>
 However dear, the original Redeemer Lutheran Church was definitely outdated 
when the fire swept through it. Built in 1964, the church was full of what 
Reimnitz calls "the '60s look," from the bulky yellow lanterns on the walls to 
the faded maroon carpet on the floor. The building was not accessible for 
worshipers in wheelchairs, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The new church is designed to look stylish -- and remain serviceable -- 
through the year 2000 and beyond, Reimnitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's old wood doors -- heavy and forbidding -- have been 
replaced with a more welcoming entrance. Walls have been knocked down and an 
indoor balcony constructed to infuse the church with a light, airy feeling. 
Even the deep-colored, stained-glass windows were replaced with more 
translucent pastel panels that speckle the pews with colorful light. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more open, much more worshipful," Reimnitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time ever, Redeemer Lutheran has a public-address system to 
provide instructions during emergencies. Hearing-impaired worshipers can listen 
to the services on individual headsets at their pews. And congregation members 
in wheelchairs can maneuver easily through the parking lot, sanctuary and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The church also meets the latest seismic safety standards, and sprinklers have 
been installed in every building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally we can get on with doing what we're meant to do, which is praise the 
Lord and reach out to the community," congregation member Norm Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all their jubilation, congregation members still cannot put the fire 
entirely behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's insurance policy covered only $800,000 in damages, so the 
church now faces a $300,000 debt, Reimnitz said. He said the congregation plans 
to take out a 20-year loan from the Lutheran Church Extension Fund to cover the 
repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Repaying the loan will require a serious fund-raising effort. And Reimnitz 
anticipates that the new sanctuary will cost more to heat, light and insure 
than the old church. In all, he anticipates spending $177,000 to keep Redeemer 
Lutheran running next year -- a 36% increase over this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the church relies entirely on donations, Reimnitz said, "the 
congregation is being challenged" to come up with enough cash to meet the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the fire seems to have given some worshipers the confidence to 
tackle that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire has given us a stronger reliance on each other," McDougall said. 
"It's made us a family in the true sense."

WHY NOT FIORE CENTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza Visual Arts Committee chairwoman says she wants people to 
start thinking of the center as their own ("Art Panel Has Designs on Plaza," 
Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 We in Thousand Oaks used to think of the center as ours throughout its long 
development, until it suddenly adopted the name of someone that nobody has 
heard of.If it must be referred to by somebody's name, it should be called the 
Alex Fiore Civic Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Former council member Fiore is the one person who unquestionably had the most 
influence and provided the most support during its development. Nobody is going 
to call it by that other name and at the same time think of it as one's own.

MEDFLY MISINFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gwen Erickson of Ojai either is woefully misinformed or deliberately trying to 
mislead others in her letter on malathion of Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Lappe, Ph.D, who in 1979 headed the original state evaluation on the 
health risks of malathion aerial spraying has stated in a court declaration 
that aerial spraying is a "significant danger" to the elderly, infants and 
children, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 If aerial spraying of malathion is so safe, as Erickson says, why did Japan 
ban it many years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Her statement that the Medfly attacks 250 kinds of produce is simply nonsense. 
It attacks a few thin-skinned fruits. Most produce grown, or that can be grown 
in Ventura, is not vulnerable. It has not devastated the agriculture of the 
Mediterranean region, from which it gets its name, nor of Hawaii where it also 
is established. 
</P>
<P>
 As to her claim there is no beneficial insect to control it, Erickson would 
have been wise to attend the panel in Camarillo Springs on malathion spraying 
on Dec. 5. One of the founders of biological control in pest management, 
entomologist Everett J. Dietrick, that there are several insects in Africa that 
keep it at a very low level there. 
</P>
<P>
 As for accusing opponents of "hysteria," this is an outrageous tactic that the 
proponents of malathion spraying have been repeatedly using to silence those 
who have read the scientific literature and know that malathion spraying is 
dangerous to the public health.

COOT SLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard continues to kill birds at the River Ridge golf course and 
to lie about why it is doing it. The general manager said they have tried to 
remove the coots by other means but those alternatives did not work. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in talking to Humane Society volunteers, just the opposite is true. 
They suggested over a year ago planting bushes (which they offered to buy) 
around the golf course ponds as a way of discouraging the birds from landing 
there. But the city said no.  
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers even offered to catch and relocate the birds to Port Hueneme 
and got a permit from that city to do so but an Oxnard city employee called 
Port Hueneme and got them to change their mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the staff at the golf course continues its slaughter, blowing off 
beaks and feet and leaving injured birds to die slowly until someone comes 
along and bashes their brains out with a shovel. (It's all on videotape, 
folks).

SWIMMERS' ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I read that the Santa Paula High School swimming pool might be closed and 
made into a giant sandbox, I was appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you people of Santa Paula, high school trustees and City Council members 
realize that once you close your pool it will take years, maybe never, before 
you ever have a pool again? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more than 40 years since the city of Ventura closed the community 
swimming pool, "The Bath House." It was at the foot of California Street, about 
where the parking garage is now. The city promised to replace it. The people of 
Ventura are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 You swimmers at Santa Paul High, your parents, all of you former swim team 
members and the alumni of Santa Paula High, must attend a school board meeting 
or write them. Tell them you want your swimming pool kept open and, most of 
all, tell them that you want to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Get a committee together of swimmers, former swimmers, parents of all of the 
above and parents of future swimmers. Plan barbecues at the high school, along 
with an auction. The merchants of Ventura have been very helpful and generous 
in helping to raise money to rebuild the Ventura High swimming pool. We are 
sure the merchants of Santa Paula would be likewise, if asked. We suggest that 
a service club be asked to take you "under its wing" so that you would not have 
to go to the trouble of obtaining a nonprofit designation for tax purposes. 
This committee should write letters to the alumni of Santa Paula High and ask 
for a donation. Be sure and tell them why the money is needed and be sure to 
thank them with a personal note. Write to the big corporations, ranches and oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Write and get in touch with some of the families that have made Santa Paula 
the nice city that it is. These old families, I think, will want to help to 
keep the pool full of water, not sand. 
</P>
<P>
 This is to the Santa Paula City Council. The $6,000 that the newspaper 
reported you withdrew from the support of the summer swim program for the use 
of the pool is a small price to pay for all the benefits this kind of program 
provides. Do you expect or want the children and adults swimming in the gravel 
pits or even in the "old swimming holes" of the Santa Clara River and Santa 
Paula Creek?  
</P>
<P>
 We know that you people of Santa Paula can find a way to raise the money to 
help your school district keep your swimming pool open. All you have to do is 
want to.

SPECIAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to Mayor Jaime Zukowski and Councilwoman Elois Zeanah for 
their victory at the Thousand Oaks City Council meeting the evening of Dec. 13. 
Their victory was the decision to conduct a June election in Thousand Oaks to 
determine a replacement for former Councilman Frank Schillo's seat on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could have been spared the $100,000 cost of the election if 
Supervisor Schillo had abdicated his seat before the November election, but 
being a good politician, Supervisor Schillo wanted to play it safe in case he 
failed in his bid for a seat on the county board. Nevertheless, it must be 
pointed out that $100,000 for a special election is a small price to pay 
considering the $85-million investment in the newly completed Thousand Oaks 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who argue that Mike Markey should fill the seat since he garnered a 
substantial number of votes in the November election, it must be pointed out 
that Councilman Schillo's seat was not vacant during the election. Former 
Councilman Schillo didn't resign his seat until after the election. 
Consequently, the seat is open now and the June election is warranted.

IN SUPPORT OF MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rosa Lee Measures was elected to the Ventura City Council last year, she 
did so with a huge majority of the voters in the city. Her campaign was 
forthright and honest (a mirror of her personal life and longstanding 
reputation) and the issues she addressed are the very things she presses on to 
implement now. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, self-appointed community gatekeepers, disconcerted in their own 
perspectives, now seek to not only mobilize a recall but spend precious dollars 
of our city's resources to realize their own agenda. It would cost thousands of 
dollars to invoke a special election in answer to a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenging of Councilwoman Measures' ethics and integrity is laughable to 
anyone who knows her or has worked with her. Saying she violated legal codes, 
while questioning her honesty and professionalism borders on the slanderous. 
</P>
<P>
 Her promises to support the bringing of more business and therefore jobs to 
our city, as well as her support of "open spaces" and parks, was known at the 
inception of her campaign, throughout the days leading up to her election, and 
certainly now.  
</P>
<P>
 There has been no "conflict of interest," nor violation of trust on the part 
of Rosa Lee Measures. She has simply been doing what she promised, and was 
elected to do. Yet now she becomes a lightning rod of people's frustration. If 
there is any conflict, it is only of someone else's interests and desires. 
Watching this, it makes one wonder if there is any hope for us, when after 
electing those with a strong moral fiber, they are the ones to absorb attack. 
There certainly is something wrong with this picture.

QUESTIONABLE WORDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Dec. 9 report on the conviction of Robert Rose for child molestation, 
The Times twice used the word affair to describe what took place between this 
49-year-old man and his 12-year-old religious education student. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws against statutory rape recognize that it is not psychologically 
possible for a minor to have the capacity to consent to sexual activity with an 
adult many years older than herself or himself.What took place was not an 
affair, but sexual abuse. He used his power as an older person in a position of 
trust to manipulate a minor into being victimized and exploited by him. 
</P>
<P>
 We as a society give our young people mixed messages about sexuality. The 
victim of this crime, herself, may think of what transpired as "an affair." As 
psychotherapists working with survivors of abuse, we have often seen adults who 
were molested as children, believe it was "an affair" between consenting 
people. They cannot make the connection between their chronic symptoms of 
post-traumatic stress and the sexual abuse. This confusion leaves them feeling 
"crazy" when they have flashbacks and panic attacks and do not realize it is 
because they were traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusing, mixed messages society sends about sex between adults and 
minors also create an atmosphere in which this sort of abuse can continue, as 
it apparently did for many years at Ventura High School. How can the victim 
understand that what happened to her was wrong, and how can other victims 
expect anyone to help them stop being hurt, if they are surrounded by adults 
who call it "an affair?"

SOME PARENTS NEED LESSON IN TOLERANCE; FLAP OVER NEWHALL SCHOOL BOUNDARY

 Up in the Santa Clarita Valley, in the Newhall School District, some school 
attendance boundary changes are in order, according to Supt. J. Michael 
McGrath. Specifically, the changes are needed to ensure that there are a 
sufficient number of students attending the new Stevenson Ranch Elementary 
School, set to open next September.

 Well, what might be a routine bureaucratic exercise appears to be anything but 
to several parents. According to Times reporter Mark Sabbatini, those parents 
are worried that children from the poor side of this mostly middle-class, 
mostly white community will be coming to their school. Under the three student 
transfer proposals being considered, it's possible that students from mostly 
Latino east Newhall would be moved to Stevenson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 That has spawned an ugly storm front of protests. Among the things said in 
public meetings on the matter was a fear that crime, drugs and drive-by 
shootings would be sure to follow. Some folks actually said that Latinos just 
don't get heavily involved in parent-school activities. One parent even 
suggested segregating Latinos in their own "magnet school." To the latter idea, 
Supt. McGrath pointed out that "we'd end up in court and we'd lose." 
</P>
<P>
 And others insisted that the inevitable shift or expansion of bilingual 
programs would shortchange students whose native tongue is English. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba Steck, community liaison for the district's bilingual program, tried to 
counter that last argument, but about 10 parents loudly, and rudely, shouted 
her down. Now, that's a fine way to set an example for children. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll finish what Steck might have said by quoting a director of a nationally 
respected consulting firm known as The McKenzie Group. Among other things, it 
conducts national superintendent searches for school boards looking to fill 
vacancies. It also conducts analyses of school systems, and it has done 
extensive work in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is a well-run school," said a McKenzie director, "there is no adverse 
impact from adding or strengthening bilingual programs. There is no drop in 
performance. It has less to do with the language and more to do with how good 
the teachers and administrators are. Good schools are good schools. It doesn't 
matter where they are or who goes to them." 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point: nearby Newhall Elementary School. Minorities make up 53% of 
its student body, and it was one of only 220 schools in the nation this year to 
receive an award from the U.S. Education Department for excellence in its 
overall curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like those students might be able to teach a few angry parents a thing 
or two as well.

MANDATE OF THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you say in your editorial "Conservancy Should Keep Its Focus Local" (Dec. 
18), the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy should put its own house in order 
before spending money elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The conservancy's surprising expenditure of $3.9 million on the north edge 
of the Valley at the very time it is crying poverty at home raises enough 
questions to fill a book. 
</P>
<P>
 * Claiming it did not have enough money to buy the Soka property, the 
executive director recommended a compromise so onerous that the public turned 
out in droves to express outrage. The conservancy followed up with 
mean-spirited letters to our elected representatives suggesting that since they 
supported the purchase of Soka, they should find the money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subsequently the conservancy pulled out of an agreement to buy a parcel in 
the Fryman Canyon-Wilacre-TreePeople park complex in Studio City, causing a 
hole in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * There are ongoing discussions about defaulting on the Canyon Oaks purchase 
in Topanga, and everyone who uses the mountains is terrorized by the prospect 
of the conservancy selling off their favorite parkland to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy strikes out at the public for its own troubles, accepting no 
responsibility. And the self-proclaimed "crisis" may divert public attention 
from the longstanding management problems while we attempt to find yet more 
money to throw at the problem. The conservancy needs to come back home and 
bring the money with it. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * In response to your editorial (Dec. 18), which supports restricting Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy park acquisitions to the Santa Monica Mountains, I 
wish to offer the following comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Wilson Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains was funded by 
Proposition A, through the agreement and cooperation of the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Assemblyman 
Richard Katz. Additional acquisitions of parkland through Prop. A can be 
anticipated in other areas, and they will not deprive funding for projects in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains are not the conservancy's official principal 
mandate. All areas within the conservancy's statutory sphere of influence have 
equal priority. This sphere includes mountains around Los Angeles and around 
parts of the Simi, Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys. For various reasons 
including wildlife corridors and the presence of special environmental and 
recreational areas, the conservancy's jurisdiction has been expanded during the 
past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Discretionary funds should be used to secure some parklands peripheral to the 
Santa Monica Mountains. For instance, through an official feasibility study, 
the proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands Park in the Santa Susana Mountains has 
been approved for a California state park. The area has huge numbers of five 
species of oak trees, big-cone Douglas firs, and 10 forest (tree) plant 
communities not occurring elsewhere in California.

THE SNEAKY VIPER UNDER YOUR WIPER; THERE IS A LAW AGAINST PUTTING HANDBILLS ON 
CARS; UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS LITTLE ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Businesses sell things. To do this they advertise. Advertising has to win 
friends. Doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ads seem calculated to summon pagan rage, not the yen to spend. Such ads 
are the object of a widely shared pet peeve. Yes, we are talking about flyers 
left on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the scene. You're loaded with packages and fumbling for your keys and 
there it is, a dreaded handbill stuck under your windshield wiper. Even if you 
normally radiate goodwill, your immediate reaction is likely to be helpless 
fury. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing gives you three choices: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Leave it there (impractical). 
</P>
<P>
 2. Add it to the litter on the asphalt (tacky, punishable). 
</P>
<P>
 3. Finger-tweeze the damnable thing off the windshield to discard later, which 
of course is just what the foul knave who had it put there wants, since, at 
some point, you might actually read it. 
</P>
<P>
 There oughta be a law? There is a law. Los Angeles is one of a number of 
Southern California cities that have ordinances against handbilling cars. What 
there ought to be is enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago the L.A. City Council realized that nobody enforced it. 
Besides, it's pointless to collar the hapless wretches pitchforked by financial 
fate into distributing the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in 1992, the council cleared the way for a giant crackdown by amending the 
law. It created the legal presumption that whatever person or business whose 
name is on an offending flyer is the culprit. Now the invisible kingpins of 
such litter can be hauled into court! If you're on the ad on the windshield, 
buddy, you'd better have evidence that you aren't to blame for having put it 
there, or suffer the awful penalty of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, big deal. City prosecutors could not say for sure last week how many 
cases have been brought against suspected windshield litterers, but one highly 
placed source confessed to a specific recollection of zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers are still all over the place. A batch was spotted last week on cars 
at the Northridge Fashion Center. They are papering parking lots, blocking 
windshields, defiling auto interiors, pouring ink runoff into the bay, ruining 
shopping trips, smudging the fat innocent hands of car-seated toddlers, 
smoldering in pockets at breasts swollen with determination to throw them away 
without reading them. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, OK, this isn't the crime of the century. But officer -- officer? -- can't 
it at least be the crime of the week?

IT'S ABOUT TIME L.A. CAUGHT UP TO TREND; APPROVAL OF COMBINED PURCHASING FOR 
CITY IS CUMBERSOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, when Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs visited an office 
supply store to show how much the city can save on basic items, it was viewed 
as something of a publicity stunt. Well, the stunt worked, and the City Council 
just voted 12 to 0 to finally become a smart shopper. Mayor Richard Riordan is 
also behind the move. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of combined purchasing power is not rocket science: Buy in bulk, 
and get a better price. It doesn't get any easier than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing that shows what a behemoth this city 
bureaucracy is. Saving as much as $70 million annually out of a $750-million 
budget for supplies and equipment ought to be a fairly simple matter, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The council votes merely put the matter on the April ballot, giving voters a 
chance to clean house on what has been described as a series of costly and 
cumbersome charter restrictions on how the city makes such purchases. That 
would be Step No. 2 in this process. If the voters agree, Step No. 3 would 
involve a series of mayoral directives. Step No. 4 would be the submission of 
new ordinances. Step No. 5 would require council approval of these ordinances, 
and there would have to be enough controls to ensure that the whole thing 
passes the smell test for honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not calling for a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the current effort to 
save major dollars on purchasing. We are, however, pointing out that Los 
Angeles is well behind the times in these matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials, for example, are talking about pooling the 
purchasing power of various departments and agencies within the government. To 
say the least, that will not boldly go where no purchaser has gone before. We 
have examples. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Washington, D.C., government had been told by experts at the 
federal General Accounting Office and at the National Institute of Government 
Purchasing that it was paying top dollar for basic supplies and wasting 
precious tax dollars in the process. As is the case in Los Angeles, individual 
agencies there were also paying wildly varying prices for the same items. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in 1991, the D.C. government decided to maximize its considerable 
buying power by joining hands with purchasing cooperatives involving other 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 By so doing, counties and cities and towns have routinely reaped big savings. 
Washington, D.C., for example joined the Metropolitan Washington Council of 
Governments, which represents the local lawmakers in a tri-jurisdictional 
region that includes Washington's Maryland and northern Virginia suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 And it can be done on an even larger scale than that. The nation's 
southeastern states have been involved in a purchasing cooperative for years. A 
smaller buying group pools the resources of the states of Delaware, Maryland 
and Virginia. If this sort of thing is unheard of in these parts, we suggest 
that our locally elected officials start making a few telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Wachs has helped point out that the city has been routinely 
paying $300 for $125 answering machines, and $24.45 for computer diskettes that 
retail for less than $6.60. Times are simply too tight for such waste, and 
getting the most out of our tax dollar has never been more important.

EXISTING TRANSIT PLAN SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Dec. 4 editorial concludes with the statement "An overhaul that better 
serves the Valley's bus riders is long overdue." What the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority has failed to tell the Valley's transit users is that 
the basis for the overhaul is already finished. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, a study on restructuring public transit service in the Valley -- 
begun more than two years previous, back in the days of MTA's predecessors, the 
RTD and the County Transportation Commission -- was presented to the MTA Board 
of Directors after countless public hearings, meetings with community leaders 
and on-board ridership surveys. I have a copy of the executive summary prepared 
by the consulting firm that prepared the study (given to me as a "thank you" 
for my extensive input as a concerned citizen), and I believe it to be the best 
proposal to improve public transit in the Valley without raising operating 
costs. In fact. according to said study, MTA and the other service providers 
would actually save in excess of $6 million per year under this proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 What the MTA has not told the public is that this plan was designed to be 
implemented simultaneously -- not piecemeal. The changes announced last month 
reflect less than 25% of the changes proposed for service, and I fail to see 
how MTA intends to implement changes that are dependent on other changes taking 
place concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 I also fail to understand why MTA feels the need to hold additional public 
hearings when the proposal already in their possession was based on several 
public hearings held during the two-year-plus period when it was being 
formulated. 
</P>
<P>
 They have already paid for having a comprehensive plan for overhaul prepared 
for them; why don't they stop wasting the public's time and implement it?

'ILLEGAL' LATINOS WERE INVALUABLE AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Harris' column on home repairs (Dec. 15) certainly was right on the 
money for thousands of Valley homeowners, especially since the big quake a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I and all my friends just don't know what we would have done without all the 
"Juans" and "Pedros" waiting to be hired to do our moving, our home repair work 
and our yard cleanups.There were no union men waiting on the street corners to 
work, just our "illegal" Latinos, willing to give an honest day's work for $6 
to $10 per hour, depending on the skills involved. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, am thankful that the harsh provisions of Proposition 187 were not 
in place. Our recovery from the quake would have been delayed for years without 
the immigrant workers.

AIRPORT NOISE DIVIDES L.A. AND BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Robert H. O'Brien has again ruled against Los Angeles' lawsuit which 
opposes the new terminal facility at Burbank Airport. Why are hundreds of 
thousands of dollars being spent by the Los Angeles City Council (during a 
budget crisis) on a futile legal attempt to stop the building of a modernized 
terminal facility at Burbank Airport? 
</P>
<P>
 This much-needed facility will provide jobs in the economically strapped San 
Fernando Valley, develop an industry that cannot be moved out of state and 
provide safety and convenience to airline passengers, more than 60% of whom are 
city of Los Angeles residents. How many City Council members and critics of the 
airport use this facility while hypocritically spending scarce funds to run up 
enormous legal fees? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles built an elementary school directly under the airport runway 
approach in the 1960s (30 years after Burbank Airport had been in existence). 
Los Angeles rezoned and allowed the construction of several high-density 
residential units on Clybourne Street in the late 1970s within a few hundred 
yards of the airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, L.A. City Council -- let's get off your moral high horse and get down 
to reality. The reality is that the Burbank Airport Authority has done an 
excellent job of reducing noise. Do any of the critics remember the 
"non-scheds" of the 1960s -- the propeller-driven, overloaded planes that 
screamed out of the airport at any hour, including 3 a.m.? There are a litany 
of other noise problems of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles filed a fourth lawsuit recently. It should give up its delaying 
tactics and quit wasting taxpayers' money. Let's go forward with this regional 
facility, which will benefit everyone in this area, including Los Angeles 
residents.

 * In response to your Dec. 18 editorial on "The Costs and Benefits of Noisy 
Airport," your information is slightly misleading. The stated curfew for 10 
p.m. to 7 a.m. is loosely kept at best. As soon as daylight breaks, the first 
airplane is up and on its way. All one needs to do is look at the individual 
airline flight logs. Dozens of flights take off prior to 7 a.m. on a weekly 
basis, and the activity after 10 p.m. is not much better. 
</P>
<P>
 With regards specifically to the noise, one needs to pay special attention to 
the takeoff pattern of Burbank Airport. A majority of the flights that take off 
from the airport fly directly over Valley Village and Studio City. In fact, 
local homeowner groups are attempting to fight this incredible disturbance. The 
number of flights that take off over the city of Los Angeles has more than 
tripled over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport is a valuable resource for the community. But before any 
expansion should take place the flight patterns and related noise intrusion 
should be addressed at greater depth.

L.A. NEEDS NEW, VITAL LANDMARK; IT'S TIME THE CITY HAD AN INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL, 
LIKE THE REJECTED WEST COAST GATEWAY, TO REPRESENT AND FOSTER UNITY, 
CELEBRATION, PEACE AND FULFILLMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN CRANDELL, John Crandell of Shadow Hills is a landscape architect and 
vice president of the L.A. Millennium Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking back over the calamities of the past decade and the exhilarating and 
unforgettable Olympic Games, one perceives not only an acute sense of travail 
over things lost, but also a sense of anomie that continues to paralyze the 
regional psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' move onto the international stage in 1984 was something of an 
apotheosis, and our fall from grace is without precedent in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council underscored this circumstance during the week previous to 
last Jan. 17 by officially terminating the 1988 proposal for a symbolic West 
Coast Gateway (also known as the "Steel Cloud") to hover above the Hollywood 
Freeway near City Hall. That decision was well and good. Rather than a western 
equivalent of Lady Liberty, the Cloud would probably have become a southern 
echo of the Golden Gate Bridge, an industrial magnet for people intent on 
leaping to suicide at the center of the car capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Los Angeles needs an international symbol. Now, having passed the low 
point, after nearly half a decade of dissolution, the metropolitan region ought 
to resolve that it has sufficient wealth, energy and talent to conceive and 
build something to bring us together. Is it possible that, in this age of 
distraction, Mayor Richard Riordan might venture a wee bit of his political 
capital and gather a representative group of individuals and charge them with 
formulating an appropriate symbol and event? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely it is time for this city to seriously consider whether its array of 
cultures, its social barriers and the internecine results merit the appointment 
of one place on the map to be established and be held by each and every one as 
neutral and sacred terrain -- a place to mourn at or to celebrate, to hear a 
great oration, to learn, receive an important visitor or join one another in 
creative dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could we not all give up something and enter into the excitement of an effort 
larger than any single segment of our general community? Can we not join in an 
effort signifying faith in ourselves and our city at the approach of a new 
millennium? To those who eternally ask why, we ought to reply, "Why not?"  
</P>
<P>
 There is one location where such an effort can and ought to take place. It is 
located in the historic center of the city, along Hope Street leading from the 
resplendently restored Central Library. What follows is the essence of a 
proposal by the nonprofit L. A. Millennium Project, a small independent group. 
A competition that we had planned to provide us with detailed plans was 
derailed by the riots of 1992. It is time to restart the project. 
</P>
<P>
 We could build a tall civic monument aligned on Hope Street with the Central 
Library, but we could build more than that, to create 24-hour life in these 
underused city blocks. There could be an intimate urban square for daily 
cross-cultural programming, mid-rise housing, a convention-oriented hotel, a 
college extension facility for joint use by area universities, a trade mart for 
the computer and telecommunications industries -- including a paperless, 
all-digital public library which could be sponsored and operated by the 
electronics industry -- a future-oriented entertainment attraction of a type 
that might be designed by Disney's "imagineers," a grocery arcade inspired by 
Broadway's Grand Central Market, shops, restaurants and sidewalk cafes. Add a 
couple of cinemas to top things off. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the sort of activities which the city ought to rely upon to spur 
economic activity and development of a thriving, urbane environment adjacent to 
the bright new Convention Center. This, as opposed to the officially adopted 
plan for a politically correct, suburban-style housing enclave for which there 
is little market. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that has been said and done in the past four decades of 
redevelopment, Downtown Los Angeles still lacks one particular element which 
many of us still have much hope for: an extraordinary gesture which elicits a 
clear and lucid response from the entire social spectrum of Los Angeles -- one 
place which would clearly resonate with a sense of human affinity and 
overriding joy -- a high and brilliant new azimuth, appearing to all as 
something eternal -- as our own dream of peace and fulfillment.

LET PARENTS HAVE VOTE ON STAYING IN LAUSD; A BILL TO BE INTRODUCED IN THE 
ASSEMBLY WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO BREAK UP THE GIANT SCHOOL DISTRICT, WHOSE VAST 
SIZE LEADS TO WASTE AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. 
</P>

By PAULA L. BOLAND, Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) represents the 38th 
District in the California Assembly. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nov. 8 election sent a powerful message. The people said they will no 
longer accept politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 By sending Republican majorities to Washington and the state Assembly, I 
believe, they were also calling for smaller government that is more accountable 
to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 A revolution in government is transpiring throughout our nation with one 
notable exception -- the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The failures of the district can be attributed to its vastness and to a school 
board devoid of leadership and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer size of the district is an impediment to efficiency and 
accountability. LAUSD is the second-largest school district in the country, 
spanning 708 square miles and serving 792,239 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 The district comprises 418 elementary schools, 71 middle schools, 49 senior 
high schools, 18 opportunity schools, 44 continuation schools, 18 schools for 
the handicapped, 132 magnet schools, 26 community adult schools, 97 children's 
centers and 11 employment preparation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for fiscal 1994-95 is $4.2 billion. That exceeds the annual 
budget of the state of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the status quo claim the size of the district saves tax dollars 
through economies of scale. But the savings opportunity offered by such 
hugeness is lost through waste and lack of accountability. Two examples come to 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 A local TV station did an expose on district waste. The camera showed a 
district catalogue offering a Dr. Seuss book for $12.95. The reporter then went 
to a membership department store and purchased a Dr. Seuss three-pack of books 
for $15.95! 
</P>
<P>
 The second is the recent indictments of two individuals with the Institute for 
Successful Living Inc., which managed an independent-study program for dropouts 
in South Central Los Angeles. The indictments allege that LAUSD was defrauded 
of at least $730,000 for services never rendered. As early as 1990, a district 
employee reported billing irregularities, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the mammoth size and structure of the district have led to waste and 
lack of accountability. Moreover, the Los Angeles school board's turn away from 
core academics to pursue self-esteem development and other social engineering 
has robbed a generation of children of the opportunity to acquire the needed 
tools to compete in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times in September, 1993, published a 16-page report on 
Northridge Middle School. LAUSD claimed the school was in the vanguard for 
self-esteem-building as a priority in learning. The principal felt that 
"feeling good" about oneself was more important than academics. The school even 
offered classes in video watching and baseball card collecting so the kids 
would be interested in attending class. 
</P>
<P>
 When I confronted a member of the board regarding this, he said, with a 
straight face, that baseball card collecting built language skills. Baseball 
cards as English literature? 
</P>
<P>
 This vignette to me is symptomatic of the Los Angeles School Board. I believe 
a political agenda, not an education agenda, directs its actions and passions. 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents of the status quo claim that I am wrong. Maybe I am. But, 
unlike the entrenched special interests that run the district, I am willing to 
let the people decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most citizens don't realize what a powerful special interest education really 
is. In fact, the California Teachers Assn. spends more money than any other 
interest group in Sacramento. The results of their effort? An education code 
that is written not to protect parents and children, but the school lobby 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How a community may detach from an exiting school district is a classic 
example of how the law is written to protect the school lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how it works: Citizens draft a plan and circulate a citizens petition 
that must be signed by at least 25% of all registered voters in the affected 
area. Interestingly, amending the state constitution requires only 8% of the 
votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
 After the signatures have been acquired, the plan is then reviewed by the 
county Committee on School District Organization and the State Board of 
Education. An election is called, and the voters must then approve the plan by 
a majority vote for the dissolution to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens can successfully wend their way through this onerous process and the 
incumbent school board can veto the plan and prevent the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Would we have term-limits today if the California Legislature had veto power 
over the people's ability to place Proposition 140 on the ballot? 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that I intend to introduce to make possible the breakup of the school 
district is simple: First, it would lower the citizens-petition signature 
threshold from 25% of all voters to 8% of those who voted in the last 
gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it would eliminate the Los Angeles School Board's veto power over a 
citizens' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it. My proposal simply democratizes the process so that disaffected 
parents, for the first time, have a legitimate chance of affecting real change 
over this bloated bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that parents, not some downtown bureaucrat, know what is best for 
their children. Let's give parents the opportunity to vote on what kind of 
school district they want.

ON 187, THE CARETAKERS OF IDEAS WERE AFRAID TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS; 
SCHOOLTEACHERS WHO SUPPORTED THE INITIATIVE KEPT QUIET FOR FEAR OF BEING 
LABELED RACIST OR LOSING FAVOR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1992 presidential campaign was the occasion of lively debate in our 
teachers lounge. Posters supporting all the candidates were plastered on 
classroom walls as prompts for civics lessons. Teachers heatedly argued 
campaign issues, then shared coffee and doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so in November, 1994, when Proposition 187 was the hottest item on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, teachers were deluged with anti-Proposition 187 
rhetoric. It was mailed to our homes by the teachers unions and state teachers 
organizations and to our schools from district offices. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the union propaganda, the measure would turn teachers into spies 
and cost thousands of California teachers their jobs. Districts sent the 
message that it would harm children and cost the schools millions in federal 
dollars. I couldn't tell the difference between the privately financed 
political propaganda and the taxpayer-supported informational leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most disturbing aspects of the campaign to me was the fact that 
although many teachers supported 187, they were afraid to say so even among 
their colleagues. The one-sidedness of the information they were receiving 
chilled their willingness to hold a frank discussion. This is a sad commentary 
whatever you think of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 I spoke recently with teachers from seven geographically and ethnically 
diverse schools. Although each was willing to talk with me, none wanted me to 
print their name or their school's. Whether they taught in the East Valley, 
North Hills, Sherman Oaks, Las Virgenes, Long Beach, Saugus or Downtown, they 
all reported no teacher debate on 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't mean there were no political debates at all. Teachers hadn't lost 
their voices nor stopped having opinions. Proposition 186 (health care reform) 
and the Wilson-Brown and Feinstein-Huffington races all had vocal advocates on 
both sides. But Proposition 187 was taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked pro-187 teachers why they hadn't expressed their opinions, they 
said they were afraid -- afraid of being labeled racist, of student claims of 
discrimination to explain low grades, of their colleagues' long memories. Some 
teachers have not spoken since the contentious teachers strikes in 1971 and 
1989. They were afraid of reprisals from their administrators and school 
boards. So they were silent. But when they went to the polls, the silent 
teachers were heard: no services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't read any exit poll statistics on how teachers voted on 187, but from 
dozens of private conversations, I suspect they voted in the same percentages 
as did the rest of the electorate -- about three to two in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for supporting the proposition varied. A second-grade bilingual 
teacher voted for 187 on the grounds that bilingual education doesn't work. The 
extra federal funds schools receive are for teachers aides, coordinators, 
testing and administrative services they wouldn't need if they tossed bilingual 
education out. There's no net financial gain and, in her opinion, a net 
education loss. But she wasn't about to announce that the emperor is naked. 
</P>
<P>
 A Saugus teacher said: "I'm tired of seeing Mexican flags. I would love to 
have my classroom size dropped for American kids -- of all colors." In his 
faculty it was "OK to be against it, but if we voted for it, we were racist." 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Beach special-education teacher said she feels guilty about having 
voted for Proposition 187 because it might hurt those few students who have 
come from war-torn countries in Central America. For the majority, she's tired 
of paying for services for people who break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 A West Valley high school teacher felt that no matter what he said in support 
of 187, he would be considered wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles the district superintendent directed teachers not to voice 
their opinions in the classroom. Teachers carried that directive to the faculty 
lounge, afraid to speak even among their own colleagues -- unless, that is, 
they were against 187. Then they spoke to student groups in open forums, in 
their classrooms and in the teachers' cafeterias, without any reprimand from 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Board of Education President Mark Slavkin announced the district's filing 
of a lawsuit challenging Proposition 187, many of my colleagues were (quietly) 
enraged. Teachers are paying for the lawsuit with their continued 2% pay cut. 
Could they voice their opposition to Slavkin and the board? Not, they felt, if 
they want workable class schedules, perks like a classroom computer or a 
friendly relationship with their administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Many educators question the purely humanitarian motives claimed by the 
Establishment. Could it be that some teachers are concerned about their jobs 
more than about the kids? Might the union be concerned about the loss of 
teacher positions and membership dues? Is the district worried about losing 
federal funds that help support an already bloated administration? 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the education Establishment opposes Proposition 187, its 
supporters, to be politically correct, must remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a shame.

SALARY CAPS TO KNEE CAPS, IT HAS BEEN A STRANGE YEAR; OVERVIEW: THE THREE BIG 
SPORTS STORIES OF 1994, NONE OF THEM REALLY ABOUT SPORTS AT ALL, DESTROYED ANY 
LINGERING ILLUSIONS OF INNOCENCE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY GAMES.

 Goodbye 1994 and good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you strike weary? Locked out? Fed up? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you o.d.'d on O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Do your eyes glaze over when you hear about Tonya & Nancy? 
</P>
<P>
 Three big sports stories of 1994, none of them really about sports at all, 
destroyed any lingering illusions of innocence about the people who play games. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre and nasty overwhelmed mere victory and defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you need a break from all the talk of murder, greed and assault? 
</P>
<P>
 Would it cheer you to get a video of the 0-0 World Cup final for Christmas? 
How about samba lessons? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it still weird seeing Michael Jordan in a baseball uniform? Are you 
waiting for him to rip it off, reveal his Bulls jersey, say the whole thing was 
just a joke? 
</P>
<P>
 Can you believe George Foreman, fatter and funnier than 20 years ago, is 
heavyweight champion again? Think he'll defend his title in Zaire? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you feel sorry for Matt Williams, Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr. and Frank 
Thomas, stopped in pursuit of Roger Maris? 
</P>
<P>
 What about Tony Gwynn aiming for Ted Williams, or Cal Ripken stalking Lou 
Gehrig? 
</P>
<P>
 The players and owners didn't care about the records or pennant races as much 
as they did about money, so why should the fans? 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 54 years and 
everyone talked about exorcised ghosts. A fan in Madison Square Garden held up 
a sign, "Now I can die in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're talking about an exorcised season, empty seats in every arena. A 
sign posted at the Garden this fall, outside facing the cold, gray street, 
"Hockey Lies Here, RIP." 
</P>
<P>
 The few transcendent moments of the year, when the human spirit soared, were 
all the more poignant for the relief they offered: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dan Jansen skating an Olympic victory lap at last, baby Jane in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oksana Baiul, a 16-year-old waif, gliding elegantly to gold then trembling 
in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton hugging sweaty Hogs in the Arkansas locker room after they 
won the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans learning to like soccer and screaming "Goooooooaaaaaallllll!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Martina Navratilova summoning the strength to reach one last Wimbledon final 
and plucking a patch of grass as she waved goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andre Agassi, unseeded, winning the U.S. Open after just three tennis 
lessons from Brooke Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about odd couples and strange scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 How about Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and coach Jimmy Johnson stabbing 
each other in the back while embracing after a second straight Super Bowl 
victory? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Family Feud, starring the Bodine Brothers playing bumper car at Indy in the 
Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Was there anything that didn't happen in 1994, besides the World Series and 
the NHL season? 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican named German took a wrong turn into Central Park, escaped unscathed, 
and still won the New York City Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati dyed her hair purple, stuck a silver ring in her nose, and 
landed in drug rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Seles kept up her Garbo act. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the matter of respect, the demand for it, earned or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was framed with a hard edge and filled with meanness, the same 
incivility seen in the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to get dissed. No one is willing to yield anywhere -- on the 
highway, on the streets, on the field. And now there's the popular idea that 
respect can be gained through violence, that we live in a culture of cruelty 
where nastiness pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be seen in the taunting gestures in football and basketball, as if 
humiliating opponents had replaced merely beating them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident in baseball, before it disappeared, with batters charging 
pitchers at the slightest provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be heard in locker rooms all over, athletes with attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the whole crazy year came down to respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson, fresh out of college, wanted $100 million worth of respect 
from the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley felt disrespected by the New York Knicks till he settled for an 
$8 million balloon payment tacked onto his $2.2 million season salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber's feelings were bruised so much by Golden State coach Don Nelson 
that he slipped out of his $74 million deal to pursue happiness in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding wasn't getting enough respect from the figure skating 
establishment, so her husband and concocted a scheme to grab that respect by 
clubbing Nancy Kerrigan to get her out of the way. It worked for a few days, 
until Harding herself became implicated. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson? Who knows what's lurking inside his mind? He battered his wife, 
Nicole, and on the infamous 911 tape replayed thousands of times he could be 
heard screaming at her, cursing her for talking about him. 
</P>
<P>
 And what exactly was going on in the most surreal image of 1994? There was 
Simpson pointing a gun to his head in the rear of a white Ford Bronco, his pal, 
Al Cowlings, driving and leading a caravan of squad cars in slow-motion pursuit 
along the San Diego Freeway while Simpson's fans cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Were those fans paying homage to a fallen hero, trying to save him, hoping 
he'd somehow make one last broken field run? Is this a weird world, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Respect, or the lack of it, even became one of the central elements in the 
strike that wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 years. If the 
dispute were simply about how to divide up money, reasonable men might have 
come to a reasonable solution months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came down to personalities, the players had no respect for acting 
commissioner Bud Selig or the owners' hired gun, Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig and Ravitch, in turn, took a dismissive attitude toward the union's dour 
leader, Donald Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, the talks went nowhere, and one of the greatest seasons in 
baseball history vanished in August. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that sports were an escape from the gravity of the real world, 
irrational in part but altogether worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, that flight from reality was canceled.

COMMENTARY; MEGGETT CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATES WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There would have been no Giants season to save without Dave Meggett, who 
sometimes can do everything in football except get into the game. When the 
Giants started out with a record of 3-0, he was one of the best players in the 
league. He scored touchdowns and threw touchdown passes and even recovered a 
fumble in the first quarter of the season, against the Eagles. When the Giants 
needed him to make fourth-quarter plays last Sunday against the Eagles, Meggett 
scored a touchdown running and nearly scored another on a pass from Dave Brown. 
Saturday he will try to get the Giants into the playoffs, in what might be his 
last game at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chances are I'm gone," Meggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 28 years old and one of the most versatile and useful backs in the NFL 
and a free agent after this season. Meggett saw what happened last year when 
other Giants free agents came to the end of their contracts. General manager 
George Young did not exactly throw money around and beg anybody to stay, and 
that included Phil Simms. When this season is over, Young and coach Dan Reeves 
will have to make a decision about Meggett. He gets the ball in his hands only 
a dozen times a game, returning kicks and catching passes and taking a few 
handoffs. It does not stop him from being one of the most talented football 
players the Giants have ever had. The Giants will have to decide if a utility 
man, even a champion utility man, is worth a lot more than the $1.1 million a 
year he is making already. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett is first in the NFC in punt returns this season. He has gained 284 
yards rushing and caught 30 passes and scored six touchdowns. He has even 
thrown a touchdown pass against the Redskins. Maybe Michael Brooks, a 
linebacker, is the MVP on this Giants team. Maybe it is Chris Calloway, who 
made big plays of his own. I will go for Meggett, because the Giants would not 
be anywhere near a game like Saturday's without him. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is his last game with the Giants, it would only be right that he make 
more third-down plays and leave with style. He has always played bigger than 
his size (5-7) and bigger than his numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I say I'm gone, I'm just going by what I saw last year," Meggett said. 
"I didn't see the Giants doing very much to keep our free agents, and that's 
why you saw a lot of guys who were important to this team leave. That's why I 
think the chances are that I'm gone. Unless they didn't like the hits they took 
last winter for letting all those guys get away, in which case, they might 
decide they want me to stay around, make a few more plays for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He made enough this season. In the opener against the Eagles, Meggett's fumble 
recovery set up one touchdown. Then he returned a punt 68 yards for a 
touchdown, which meant he handed Dave Brown a 14-0 lead. Later in the second 
half, Meggett ran 26 yards from scrimmage for another touchdown. When Rodney 
Hampton got hurt against the Cardinals the next week, Meggett gained 36 yards 
on the Giants' last drive and ran out the clock and the Giants won again. The 
next week, he started in Hampton's place against the Redskins and seemed to do 
everything. That was the game in which he threw his touchdown pass. The Giants 
were 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Dan Reeves forgot about him, which is never very smart, while the Giants 
tried to fall out of the season. But last Sunday, Meggett was right there at 
the end to tie the score with his touchdown run, then close the Eagles out by 
running 26 yards after Brown found him all alone on the left side of the field. 
Meggett always made the most of his chances. In his one Super Bowl appearance, 
Meggett gave the Giants 129 all-purpose yards, 48 of them from halfback. As 
usual, they all seemed important. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always talk about me as a role player," Meggett said. "They say 
there's not enough ball to go around, meaning there's not enough carries for me 
if Rodney gets his. I just want to hear my number called. If they call my 
number, I will make the plays. Even when I fumbled against the Eagles in the 
last game (on the Eagles' 13-yard line), I think it's because nothing had been 
happening for us. I was trying too hard to make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 He was there in the fourth quarter, of course. Brown handed Meggett the ball 
near the goal line and the Eagles seemed to have him stopped. But it is hard to 
stop Meggett. Greg Jackson, one of the free agents who left the Giants last 
winter, was underneath him. Meggett rolled over Jackson and got the touchdown. 
On the Giants' last drive, he made a block and slipped out into the left flat, 
and waited for Brown to find him. Then waited for what felt like an hour for 
the pass Brown floated to get to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking a thousand things while that ball is in the air," Meggett said. 
"I'm thinking about getting redemption for fumbling in the first half. And I'm 
thinking that if the damn ball would get to me, I'd score another touchdown, 
because there was no one near me. You have to understand something: I very 
seldom touch the field. When I do touch the field, I want to score, always." 
Meggett didn't score. He got the Giants close enough, before Brad Daluiso won 
the game with a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has had his moments lately on offense. So has Mike Sherrard. Meggett 
still has more big plays than anyone. Even in the losing streak, he tried to 
bring the Giants back against the Lions with a 56-yard punt return that was one 
of the most splendid, broken-field runs ever made at Giants Stadium. Of all the 
people in the stadium that day, perhaps only Barry Sanders fully appreciated 
Meggett's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Meggett's feet hurt as he comes to the end of his sixth Giants season. 
Bone spurs caused him to miss (Dec. 21st's) practice and it was suggested he 
might need surgery after the season. He will play Saturday, of course. Meggett 
is one of the handful of Super Bowl champions the Giants have left. He will 
take any kind of big game, especially after being 3-7.

 When you ask him if he wants to stay with the Giants, he says yes. It does not 
mean he will not listen to other bidders. It is a good bet that Bill Parcells 
will come after him. So will Bill Belichick. Maybe they will push Meggett's 
price up and give George Young a reason to say the price is prohibitive. It 
would be a mistake to let him. Young is trying to build one more Super Bowl 
champion before he retires. If that is the object of the game, he cannot let 
someone like Meggett leave. Because it is clear Meggett has not lost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of me touching the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He played two years for Parcells, two for Ray Handley, now two with Dan 
Reeves. None of them let him touch the field enough. Somehow they all found a 
way to call his number when they needed a first down. Then Meggett has been one 
of the Giants who will be remembered. Now he gets one more big game. He 
deserves this kind of game as much as any of them, even if it is his last.

COMMENTARY; PICKING ON LENDL'S FAULTS EASIER THAN PRAISING GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, people called him EYE-vin, even as he kept telling them his name 
was pronounced e-VON. But he played like an EYE-vin, so terribly hard and 
unrelenting, always grimacing, never like a graceful, feathery e-VON. 
</P>
<P>
 The words flair and Ivan Lendl have rarely appeared in the same sentence, 
which probably tops the list of reasons Lendl, who retired from tennis Tuesday 
because of a chronic back problem, never got the credit he deserved. His 
robotic style won him many matches but few hearts, especially in the late 
1980s, when he was No. 1 in the world and mechanically dismantling American 
icons John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis commentator Bud Collins delighted in calling him "the Ostrava Ghost," 
Ostrava being the dreary industrial town in Czechoslovakia where Lendl grew up, 
ghost a reasonably apt description of Lendl's sunken eyes, concave cheeks and 
pale, unsmiling countenance. If Lendl had a theme song, it surely wasn't "Ain't 
We Got Fun." 
</P>
<P>
 We first met Lendl more than a decade ago, at a tournament in Palm Springs, 
Calif., when he was then represented by Jerry Solomon, now infamous as Nancy 
Kerrigan's main squeeze. As you might expect of someone raised in an Iron 
Curtain country, the squirming, staccato-speaking Lendl was suspicious of 
anyone pumping him for information, no matter how seemingly harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in later years, as his rapier sense of humor and near-flawless English 
bespoke his obvious intelligence, Lendl turned aside questions plumbing his 
emotional depths. He had his millions and his family and he wasn't about to 
open a vein in an attempt to win over an America that had long since succumbed 
to stereotyping him. 
</P>
<P>
 Free at last, he lived behind Connecticut fortress walls as an American 
citizen. A colossal capitalist, he battled behind the scenes with McEnroe, who, 
for the good of the game, wanted more prize money distributed to the 
comparatively poorly paid doubles players. Lendl opposed any siphoning from 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much money," asked an exasperated McEnroe, himself a multimillionaire, 
"does a guy need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl, 34, won more than $20 million in tournament prize money, but he never 
won tennis' greatest tournament, Wimbledon. He was a finalist twice, losing to 
Boris Becker in 1986 and Pat Cash in 1987. Although he was No. 1 longer (270 
weeks) than any man and won more titles and matches than any man except 
Connors, it is the lack of a Wimbledon title that will forever relegate Lendl 
to a notch barely below the supreme champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl's great endurance and ground strokes showed themselves best on slower 
surfaces like clay, where he won three French Opens, and the asphalt-like 
DecoTurf II at the U.S. Open, where he won three consecutive titles (1985-87) 
and was a finalist eight years in a row (1982-89). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lendl then lived in nearby Greenwich, he had a court identical to 
that of the Open stadium court built in his own back yard. He was that kind of 
perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the superior serve-and-volley game that grass and Wimbledon invariably 
favor (Bjorn Borg's five titles there being a notable exception) was never 
Lendl's strength. His conditioning and work ethic won him enduring respect, but 
never tennis' greatest prize. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Lendl lacked a Wimbledon champion's athleticism, he was not without 
a tennis pedigree. His father, an attorney, once ranked as high as No. 15 in 
Czechoslovakia, his mother No. 3. When Ivan was a toddler, she leashed him to a 
netpost while she practiced. Tennis, he played for money. Golf, he plays for 
enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 The world is very different from what it was in 1980, when Lendl first cracked 
tennis' Top 10. Ronald Reagan was becoming president, depicting the Soviet 
Union as the Evil Empire. To many Americans, the shadowy-looking Lendl was just 
another Eastern European to goof on. Connors, who always knew how to work a 
crowd, led the goof, calling him EYE-vin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody calls him EYE-vin anymore. Nobody goofs on a man who played in a record 
19 Grand Slam finals. Unless, of course, they're pointing out that his record 
in them is 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for those who threaten to enter the pantheon of greatness is that 
we spend more time pointing out what they're not than praising what they are. 
If Ivan Lendl can make his peace with that, that will be his greatest triumph.

TIDINGS OF FEAR AND SADNESS; THE CHRISTMAS SEASON OFFERS NO REPRIEVE FROM THE 
VIOLENCE TEARING AT THE FABRIC OF AMERICAN CIVIL SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin E. Marty, Martin E. Marty, who teaches the history of religion at the 
University of Chicago, is senior editor of the Christian Century and author of 
The Noise of Conflict (University of Chicago Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about Christmas. Forget the song about the angels bending near the 
Earth to touch their harps of gold. Forget the angelic words: "Peace on Earth, 
goodwill to all, from heaven's all-gracious king." Forget the efforts to locate 
the world that "in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing." 
</P>
<P>
 The cynic who counsels such forgetting knows Christmas peace is only a dream. 
Violence rules the real world. Skip Christmas. Three days after it comes Holy 
Innocents Day. Many Christians then read a story in the Gospel of Matthew. When 
the Wise Men told King Herod that a new king had been born, Herod was 
"exceeding wroth" and "slew all the children that were in Bethlehem," in the 
hope of killing the child Christians call the Prince of Peace. Believers pray, 
"We remember today, O God, the slaughter of the holy innocents of Bethlehem." 
</P>
<P>
 Innocents today are close to home, not only far off in Bosnia or Haiti. They 
come in all sizes and ages. Bearing Christmas gifts just purchased, or just 
going home weary, New Yorkers on a subway find their day disrupted by an 
explosion. In horror, hundreds run; 45 victims, in flames, suffer burns and 
will bear physical and psychic scars. It took no Herod to blast their world 
apart. An extortionist, a deranged and angry citizen, took out his violent 
instincts on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence in big New York makes daily news. But the journalistic year-end 
reckonings show there is no place to hide from the terror. Small city Fort 
Wayne, Ind., counted 38 murders, up from 18 two years ago. Small town Geneseo, 
Ill., needs new police patrols to counter gang attacks and violence against 
property -- vandalism being a new fashion there. 
</P>
<P>
 Church parking lots need to be well-lighted and churches must provide police 
protection as believers crowd sanctuaries to pray at Christmas, as if it were 
Holy Innocents Day: "Receive, we pray, into the arms of your mercy all innocent 
victims." Their Lord's arms had to be extra large in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of the holiday week to ponder innocent victims would be an appropriate 
way to promote "goodwill to all." High and low are the intended or actual 
victims in this "no place is safe" year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the newspaper caption "Violence at White House" makes the point with map 
marks "A, B, C, D" -- indicating sites of "recent violent incidents at the 
White House" up to Dec. 20. The White House, "America's House," a symbolic 
place for all citizens, turns into a fortress. Many violent Americans want its 
chief occupant dead. Deranged Americans seek attention by attacking the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Near where I write, in quiet, suburban Chicago, a front-page Christmas-week 
story tells of the murder of a 4-year old. He was at a temple that Sikhs here 
call "Gurudwara" -- meaning a place of generosity and openness. No Sikh who 
needs help, food or shelter is turned away. So a Michigan trucker, Satpal Singh 
Sanghera, accepted hospitality and is alleged to be the stabber of the child, 
the innocent one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mystery to us. How could anything like this happen at the temple 
and to such a loving child?" asked his aunt. Non-Sikh Chicago could only ponder 
with her, as her nephew was counted "the 62nd child under age 14 to be murdered 
in the six-county Chicago area in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mystery to us," this violence, so a benumbed nation mourns. It 
takes lessons from Jeremiah, quoted by Matthew in the Bethlehem massacre story. 
There was "a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping and great mourning. Rachel 
weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mystery to us," this violence. Social scientists, psychologists and 
theologians are busy offering never-quite-satisfying explanations of this 
close-to-home violence. Counselors deal full time with cases of wife abuse and 
child abuse, while in the national-culture wars, all sides debate "family 
values." Commentators editorialize against violence but advertise its 
glorification in the entertainment media. Talk-show hosts stimulate verbal 
violence of citizen against citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 They show no awareness of how thin is the fabric of civility, how gossamer the 
web of nonviolence, how shattering words can be. Politicians and their 
well-paid advisers boast about the way they devastate opponents through TV ads. 
The public says it does not want attack politics. But voters, when polled, say 
such macho destructiveness influenced them against the defeated candidates, now 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that verbal violence connects with physical violence is a difficult 
and unsure art. Confirming that being obsessed with violence in rap music, 
television and movie imagery, or that brutal art legitimizes or even causes 
actual violence against others, has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. 
Preferring mean politics to reason and gentility in public debate, as many see 
us doing this year, is not established as an element in the creation of a cruel 
climate in which physical violence becomes natural. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not hurt, however, if citizens experimented with showing concern for 
the other, the different one, the stranger and the enemy, instead of trying to 
destroy them with words. It would be worth exploring to see what rejecting the 
media that glamorize violence might do. And it might be an act of courage to 
treat the political foe as a human being of worth, even if he or she appears 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "In your face" -- the culture now needs that phrase to describe approved 
postures and gestures. But one cannot engage in in-your-face expressions and 
also pay attention to the value in the visage and presence of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery of civility and the advance of nonviolence cannot wait for a time 
when the religions and the philosophies come to agreement about all the causes 
and cures of violence. Americans are a practical people, however, and they 
could begin with a pragmatic philosophy in which they decide on creative ways 
of preserving life and honoring those who pursue them. Religious faiths can 
then go deeper than pragmatic philosophy -- providing more profound motivations 
for turning against violence and saving innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of frustrated or angry subway bombers, deranged wielders of knives 
or crashing airplanes at the White House, stabbers of children in temples, is 
not going to turn into the fabled Peaceable Kingdom through any single 
strategy. Violence will never disappear from the human story. To suggest that 
the recovery of civility and responsible regard for others might help produce a 
less violent society will seem to the "forget Christmas" cynic to be a futile 
strategy -- an offer of plum pudding to the soldiers of Herod long ago or 
vandals now. 
</P>
<P>
 The places of worship -- be they Christian in Christmas week, Jewish, where 
Rachel still weeps, or whenever shalom is sought, Sikh at various Gurudwaras or 
whatever else -- all offer prayers to match the one for Holy Innocents Day. It 
asks, and they also ask, for divine help against those who would frustrate the 
"rule of justice, love and peace" and against the "designs of evil tyrants." 
Saying a prayer is like holding up a mirror to the self -- where it can be seen 
that the tyranny of evil may be as close as one's own heart, where the purging 
has to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who find moments for "solemn stillness" can help create the spiritual 
and moral space where resolves can grow, where civility can return and where 
some dreams of peace begin to be realized.

TIME FOR L.A. NOT TO GET MAD BUT EVEN WITH FEDS

 This holiday season, it was not a Gingrich who stole Los Angeles' Christmas, 
but the federal system so beloved by many urban politicians. Losing out in its 
bid to be designated an "empowerment zone," Los Angeles received yet another 
lesson in why turning to Washington is almost never the best policy. And this 
time around, the lesson should be especially poignant. Having inspired the idea 
of empowerment zones, and having been assured throughout the application 
process that the city's bid was a good one, Los Angeles was, in the end, jilted 
by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the 1992 riots, a spate of natural disasters and defense cutbacks 
sent the regional economy into a tailspin, California's politicians have looked 
for new ways to feed at the Washington trough, whether through fanciful 
"defense conversion," traditional disaster relief or federal aid for distressed 
urban areas. Yet, as the empowerment-zone setback reveals, this strategy can be 
frustrating and counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, among those who most need to heed this message is the ostensibly 
Republican-led administration at City Hall. Denied the economically potent 
empowerment-zone package after months of seeking to win it, and left holding 
$350 million in urban aid, to be disbursed over 10 years -- if the GOP Congress 
appropriates the money -- the Riordan Administration now finds itself without a 
fully developed and comprehensive economic-development strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Riordan has barely begun the transformation of the city's 
bureaucracy, which, though more responsive to business needs, hardly encourages 
economic growth. Annual city water charges, for example, remain nearly twice 
those of other cities in Los Angeles County. (One disturbing statistic: the 
vast majority of new tenants in Orange County industrial real estate come from 
Los Angeles.) In addition, many of Riordan's proposals -- privatization of 
public services and reductions in business fees -- languish, in part because of 
City Council opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, this failure stems from the Riordan Administration's 
miscalculation about who should run the city's economic-development efforts. 
Instead of tapping people with strong business-community connections -- someone 
like Mayor Richard Riordan himself -- the Administration has mostly turned to 
political people to make economic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Deputy Mayor Mary Leslie nor Assistant Mayor Doug Boxer, Riordan's 
principal economic-development aides, came into office with any great 
understanding of, or influence in, the city's entrepreneurial and corporate 
world. Leslie has superb Washington connections as a result of her previous job 
with the Clinton Administration, while Boxer's mother is the senator and the 
Boxer family enjoys a direct tie to the Clinton family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leslie was in the SBA (Small Business Administration), which has a lot of 
money for economic development, and her value is still there," says Deputy 
Mayor Michael F. Keeley. "You could get a CEO who knows the business community 
but couldn't find the bathroom in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, apparently, having a key to the washroom was not enough to make Los 
Angeles an empowerment zone. Part of the problem, acknowledges RLA's Linda 
Griego, who participated in the process, lay with the city's weak and vague 
application, but more of it stems from the "one size fits all" nature of the 
empowerment-zone concept. Los Angeles, with its large immigrant and 
working-poor population, "did not fit the mold" of the traditional inner city 
-- welfare driven, highly concentrated -- at the heart of the proposal. The 
cities that won the empowerment-zone designation, all in the Northeast or 
South, satisfied these criteria easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's demographics and economic structure are not its only 
negatives in the federal sweepstakes. Keeley points out that Eastern cities, 
such as Chicago and New York, boast far larger lobbying staffs, as well as 
advantages that come with being an hour or two from the imperial seat. To 
Eastern-oriented federal officials, California, whatever its riches in 
electoral votes, is a distant province. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than grouse about Washington's fickle ways, both the city and state 
should redouble their efforts closer to home that would make the region more 
attractive to growing businesses. These would include reviewing utility rates, 
business taxes and rationalizing a host of confusing and often conflicting 
regulatory regimes. Dealing with these local impediments to growth, as well as 
declining schools and aging infrastructure, would be more economically 
important than any conceivable federal handout. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, the new Republican Congress, led by Rep. Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia, could prove more helpful in the longer term than many now may think. 
Although an overwhelmingly white, anti-urban, Southern-dominated Congress can 
hardly be expected to keep the region's best interests uppermost in mind, its 
passionate desire to truncate Washington's reach could serve California's 
future far better than has the traditional "Washington knows best" approach 
plied by the city's political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 For this to work, Californians in Congress, Sacramento and in the cities must 
press for enactment of those parts of the GOP agenda that tend to favor 
sophisticated, urban economies: devolution of federal oversight responsibility, 
regulatory relief and a gradual shift of taxing authority to the local level, 
which would help reverse the state's multibillion-dollar negative cash flow to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On tax policy, the across-the-board cuts proposed by some Republicans would be 
better for Californians than the more limited slashes, tied to income levels, 
advocated by President Bill Clinton and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the 
soon-to-be House minority leader. Since California is home to 17% of the 
nation's affluent income earners, it loses billions to other states with lower 
living costs every time Washington seeks to define the middle class in terms 
more suitable to Little Rock than Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But California Republicans should spurn the temptation to embrace 
budget-busting defense spending as a potential economic spur to the state. With 
Southerners controlling key congressional military committees, any increase in 
Pentagon expenditures will likely only accelerate the flight of defense-related 
industries from California to the South and intermountain West. 
</P>
<P>
 On these issues, Californians of both political parties should find some 
common ground. If differences remain on how to then divide the state's 
resources, and on the best economic strategy, let those debates unwind among 
people who have a direct stake in the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
 A "California first" approach is the surest course toward developing a broad 
consensus that the state so desperately needs. If it helps us drop our habit of 
looking to Washington, the loss of the empowerment-zone designation -- bitter 
as it was for a city that deserved it -- may be a Christmas gift in disguise. 
Only then can the state attain a "global regionalist" perspective that holds 
out the best promise for California's economic growth.

THE FALLING PESO SHOWS LIMITS OF TECHNOCRATS

 Was there in Mexico anything more foreign for the American tourist than the 
marketplace? The lovely piece of pottery had a price tag of 500 pesos. But the 
price was negotiable -- that, as the guide book told us, was the distinguishing 
thing about Mexico for the American tourist. With a wink or a shrug, quien 
sabe? "For you, senor, 400 pesos." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo shocked the international 
financial markets, astonished especially his trading partners in Ottawa and 
Washington, by allowing the Mexican peso to float against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is a country of secrets and shadows. Rumors in Mexico City at week's 
end were that the devaluation crisis was the result of conflicts within 
Zedillo's own ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Others in 
the capital claimed that the government has been under pressure from the south 
-- the continuing Indian rebellion in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Zapatista rebels were on the move last week. But if Mexico has 
lately been the scene of insurrections and political assassinations, Mexico 
also is a country of new shopping malls. Since the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was signed last year, millions of Mexicans have been charging their 
way into the First World, buying everything they saw at Wal-Mart, transforming 
Mexico's trade surplus with the United States into a huge trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had been counting on a new postwar generation of Mexican 
politicians, the Ivy League-trained "technocrats," to hold Mexico together. 
Yes, America recognized that there were baroque aspects of Mexico that we knew 
nothing about. Yes, we knew there were political intrigues and layers of 
corruption that were hidden by shadows. But we trusted the technocrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-educated Carlos Salinas de Gortari was the first of the new 
generation. His successor, Zedillo, is a Yale-trained economist. We Americans 
thought that because we educated these Mexicans, we could count on them to play 
by our rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavio Paz, the eminent poet-philosopher of Mexico, has for a longer time 
been writing about the masks behind which Mexicans hide and the corridors of 
her ancient labyrinth. Mexico, along with Russia, never had an 18th Century, 
Paz wrote prophetically a few years ago. Last week, Mexicans told me that what 
the devaluation proved was that Zedillo was more concerned with national 
politics than with his reputation in the international financial markets. There 
were forces at play in the Mexican capital that outsiders did not understand. 
Finally, Zedillo belongs to Mexico City more than to Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, American optimism was fed by the spectacular performance of 
stocks like Telefonos de Mexico. At week's end, Telefonos had fallen sharply. 
Critics of NAFTA in the United States are now quick to say that Mexico is an 
unreliable trading partner. Pro-NAFTA forces feel betrayed. Clearly, what is 
needed is a moderate course between the I-told-you-so negativity of the NAFTA 
opponents and the boom-years optimism of those Americans who thought they could 
make a killing in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico and Russia are essential economic partners of the United States. And it 
is in our interest to want their experiment in free-market democracy to 
succeed. But Mexico, like Russia, is lurching toward the 21st Century absent an 
18th Century -- the great age of democracy and capitalism. Both countries are 
more medieval than the professors at the Harvard Business School, with their 
case-study methods, care to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dusty mercado , you did business over time. You got to know your 
trading partner. You got to understand the way his body communicated. You 
understood his smile. You understood his handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 What was clear last week is that it will take time for us to understand our 
Mexican trading partner. But for the United States, as for Mexico, there is no 
turning back. We find ourselves in the same labyrinth -- in the same dusty 
marketplace, haggling over the piece of pottery with a price tag of 500 pesos.

 Just as the recent nuclear accord with Pyongyang was raising hopes that an 
easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula might be on the horizon, a U.S. 
military helicopter that had un wittingly strayed into North Korea was downed 
and an American airman killed. Republicans were quick to renew their criticism 
of the accord. But the incident also serves as a grim reminder of the still 
ominous North Korean conventional-military threat. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea claims it shot down the Army helicopter, which was on a training 
mission, after its pilot ignored warning shots. The remains of the dead pilot 
have been returned, but a surviving airman is still in North Korean custody, 
though Pyongyang has promised his release. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korean's initial truculence -- first ignoring requests for information, 
then delaying the return of the captured soldier and Army helicopter -- 
exasperated U.S. officials. Secretary of State Warren Christopher went so far 
as to admonish Pyongyang that failure to resolve the matter swiftly could 
imperil nascent efforts to open formal U.S.-North Korea relations. For its 
part, North Korea says it is "investigating" the incident, but its 
procrastination may have more to do with tensions within the still uncertain 
Pyongyang leadership, perhaps between the military and civilian elites, than 
with its determination to uncover facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Clinton Administration's early response to the crisis left 
much to be desired. Even as Pyongyang was releasing the body of the dead 
airman, Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said, "I don't think we're at the 
apology stage yet." Excuse me. Does being the sole superpower mean never having 
to say you're sorry? 
</P>
<P>
 While some details of the incident remain murky, there is no doubt that the 
copter intruded into North Korean territory. For that, we owe Pyongyang an 
apology. Indeed, given the stakes, the United States should have dispatched a 
senior official to Pyongyang to offer one and resolve the affair. But fearful 
of being perceived by congressional Republicans as "soft," the Administration 
diplomatically mistepped. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of arrogance is virtually guaranteed to evoke the worst in the 
always contentious and paranoid North Koreans. Giving North Korea face is 
important in the always difficult task of eliciting their cooperation; 
humiliating them will usually ensure the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton's overall policy toward North Korea has 
one of lurching from crisis to crisis without a clear sense of strategy. Then, 
a combination of U.S. generosity, North Korean desperation and luck resulted in 
the Pyongyang's promise to dismantle its nuclear-weapons program in exchange 
for a basket of goodies, including shipments of heavy oil and two light-water 
reactors to replace its dismantled facilities. At a projected cost of some $4 
billion, the nuclear project will be chiefly financed by South Korea and Japan, 
through a new international consortium known as KEDO (Korean Energy development 
Organization). 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter imbroglio, however, points up the dangers of the 
Administration's preoccupation with the nuclear issue: It is ignoring North 
Korea's conventional-military threat. The country maintains a million-man army, 
on which it spends 25% of its gross domestic product; some 70% of it is 
deployed within 60 miles of the DMZ, along with about 11,000 artillery tubes 
and Scud missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 It may thus be said that the nuclear issue is the easy part of the problem. 
The hard part is the question of North-South reconciliation, a process that is 
now stalemated. Indeed, conceptualizing the nuclear problem as a U.S.-North 
Korea matter served only to increase North-South tensions, while deepening 
resentment in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sign yet that the Administration has a policy to deal with this 
larger issue. When questioned, senior U.S. officials say only that we have 
"other concerns" -- ranging from human rights and Pyongyang's missile sales to 
the conventional-force issue -- that will "be addressed in the context of 
normalization." 
</P>
<P>
 But the helicopter episode offers an opportunity to build on the nuclear 
accord and begin to discuss revising the 41-year armistice. For starters, the 
truce village at Panmunjom is ill-equipped to handle the growing volume of 
North-South traffic. Now, it is mostly congressmen. When the United States 
opens a liaison office in Pyongyang next year, it will be U.S. officials. Then, 
it will be growing numbers of South Korean businessmen who will be planning, 
designing and building the light-water reactors. The United States and South 
Korea would be wise to sit down with Pyongyang and negotiate a "Checkpoint 
Charlie" crossing point at Panmunjom to facilitate this traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, along with China, a signatory to the armistice) and the two Koreas, 
we should begin to discuss a peace treaty. Those negotiations should include a 
schedule for a pullback of North Korean forces from the DMZ. And if North Korea 
really wants South Korean, Japanese and Western investment, U.S. and Japanese 
embassies and membership in international financial institutions, these 
objectives should provide leverage for the West to foster North-South 
reconciliation. A major goal should be deep conventional-force reductions of 
North and South Korean forces similar in scope to those embodied in the 
Conventional Forces in Europe arms-reduction accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the helicopter episode illustrates, we are a long way from easing 
achieving such goals. In the meantime, the Korean Peninsula remains perhaps the 
world's most dangerous tinderbox.

WILL CHECHNYA BECOME YELTSIN'S AFGHANISTAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maryann Parker, Maryann Parker, project associate for Russian and Eurasian 
programs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has just returned 
from Moscow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin's decision to invade Chechnya, the breakaway North 
Caucasian republic, inevitably invites comparisons to previous Russian 
adventures along the fring es of its empire. Like the ill-starred interventions 
of the past, the incursion is more politics than security threat. But if 
Yeltsin has truly disregarded the military disadvantages in Chechnya in search 
of political gains to be won from a short and "glorious" war in the Caucasus, 
he may have made a tragically naive decision that ignores history and promises 
grim consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious Chechen parallel is the war in Afghanistan. Deputy Defense 
Minister Boris V. Gromov and Gen. Alexander I. Lebed, two prominent veterans of 
the Afghan War, have stressed those similarities in their public opposition to 
the invasion of Chechnya. The Soviet army stayed nine years in Afghanistan 
seeking to fulfill the political goal of supporting communist regimes abroad. 
For that vague goal, the Soviets paid dearly in lives and resources, brutalized 
and fractionalized the Afghan people, and eventually left the country less 
stable than they found it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the comparison between Afghanistan and Chechnya may be strained because 
Moscow considers the Chechen conflict an internal affair, a claim that has 
withstood international scrutiny. Closer to point is Mikhail S. Gorbachev's use 
of force against nationalistic crowds in Tbilisi, Baku and Vilnius during the 
twilight of the Soviet Union. Although Chechnya has been characterized by 
Yeltsin as a nest of bandits, its chief crime -- like that of the Georgians, 
Azerbaijanis and Lithuanians -- is refusing to remain peacefully under Moscow's 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the specter of a wider Caucasian war that is most chilling to Russians, 
since such conflict has great historical resonance. Yeltsin himself hinted at 
the risks last August: "If we were to apply pressure by force against Chechnya, 
it would arouse the whole Caucasus; there would be such a commotion, there 
would be so much blood that nobody would ever forgive us." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian rulers have long sought dominion over the resource-rich, strategically 
located region, and have always encountered stiff resistance from its 
inhabitants. In the 19th Century, for example, Russia used 300,000 soldiers and 
took nearly 30 years to crush Shamil, the great Muslim leader of Daghestan and 
Chechnya. Today, some Chechens believe that if Shamil had been born Chechen, 
the czarist armies would never have subdued the Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian writers Tolstoy and Pushkin portrayed the Chechens as hospitable 
and chivalrous, but also stressed their ferocity in war and vindictive 
character. Chechnya's predominantly Muslim, clan-based society, regulated by a 
ruthless system of blood feud, has never adapted well to colonization. Regular 
revolts continued even under Soviet rule. In 1944, Josef Stalin deported the 
entire Chechen population to Central Asia on trumped-up charges of Nazi 
collaboration. Rehabilitated in 1956, this experience of exile remains fresh in 
Chechen memory, fueling their continued resistance to Russian hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
 Common hatred of Moscow is a potentially strong unifying force in the 
typically fragmented region. Indeed, the loosely defined Confederation of 
Caucasian Peoples has warned Moscow that war against Chechnya means war against 
the entire Caucasus, and rumors of recruiting efforts throughout the North 
Caucasus abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfavorable military conditions in Chechnya also reduce the chances of a 
"clean" military victory for the Russians. Cold, short and foggy days are not 
an ideal environment for an invasion. Furthermore, the military forces are 
composed of an untested combination of interior ministry and regular army 
troops. Worse, the refusal of Maj. Gen. Ivan Babichev to turn his column's guns 
on protesting Chechen civilians suggests insubordination and confusion at high 
levels. Taken together, the ruthless occupation of Chechnya may usher in a 
prolonged period of guerrilla warfare in the Caucasus, not to mention terrorist 
retribution in Russian cities and massive refugee flows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechen capital of Grozny -- the Russian word for "terrible, fearful" -- 
takes its name from a fort Russian occupiers established there. Faced with a 
tenacious resistance, the Russians discovered they could only maintain dominion 
over the North Caucasus through the use of terrible, fearful force.  
</P>
<P>
 The current crisis in Chechnya, eerily reminiscent of the Afghanistan and the 
Caucasian wars, suggests that the authorities in Moscow have failed to learn 
the lessons of that past. Yeltsin's reckless adventure on the restless fringe 
can only shake faith in the Russian Federation, not hold it together.

'THE GIFT OF THE MAGI' -- UPDATED FOR HIGH-TECH ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Grey, Lawrence Grey is a judge on the Fourth District Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know if high students still read O. Henry short stories. Probably not. 
It's too bad because O. Henry is one of the better writers and his Christmas 
story, "The Gift of the Magi," one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a simple tale, about a young married couple deeply in love, but dirt 
poor. Between them, they have only two things they treasure. He has a beautiful 
pocket watch, and her pride and joy is her lovely blonde hair. With Christmas 
coming and no money to buy a gift for her husband, the woman cuts her hair and 
sells it to buy a fob for her husband's watch, only to find -- in an ironic 
twist that O. Henry was famous for -- that he had sold the watch to buy a set 
of combs and brushes for her lovely hair. 
</P>
<P>
 That story is almost a hundred years old now, but I was reminded of it 
recently when I was doing some research on the law related to death and dying. 
A doctor told me a story about a man, a patient of his, that was almost as 
poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 This man grew up in the Depression, and when he was 14, his father died, 
leaving the family destitute. He dropped out of high school at 15 to help 
support his mother and younger siblings. He worked hard all his life and always 
had a second part-time job. Often he worked two full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He married, had three children and was able to buy a small house. He put all 
three children through college, and even paid for one to go to graduate school. 
Considering his lack of education and the fact that he never held a really good 
paying job, this was a remarkable life of sacrifice and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man grew old, he saw the doctor more frequently and the two became 
close. Life being what it is, the day came when the doctor had to have that 
terrible conversation with him -- telling him that he had a terminal illness 
and he did not have much time left. 
</P>
<P>
 The man took the news with equanimity. He told the doctor he suspected as 
much; that his life had not been so good since his wife had died three years 
before, and that he was proud of his children and of what he had accomplished 
by his life of hard work. He could face death because he had accomplished most 
of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he told the doctor of one very important achievement. His father's death 
and the resulting poverty convinced him that one of the most important things a 
man could do was to leave some money to his children. He confided in the doctor 
and said that, by saving and investing over the years, he had built a nest egg 
of almost $160,000 in CD's and conservative mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor was in awe of the patience and discipline it would take for a 
working man like him to accumulate that much money. He had scrimped and saved, 
denied himself much, but was proud of being able to make this gift to his 
children. This was his final life's goal -- and he had met that. 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis was correct and not too long after he succumbed to the ravages 
of his disease and was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. His children 
rushed to his side. They insisted on everything that could be done for their 
father. And it was. He had all the tubes, the wires, the machines -- the entire 
panoply of medical technology. Though the old man lapsed into a coma, one of 
them was always at his bedside. They loved that old man, and they knew how hard 
he had worked, how much he had done for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor suggested there really was no hope and perhaps less invasive 
procedures should be followed. As gently as he could, he said they should 
consider having a "do not resuscitate" order put on his chart. They would not 
hear of it, would not consider anything that even hinted that this fight 
against death was futile. 
</P>
<P>
 After several weeks, in spite of everything that was done for him and to him, 
the man died. The hospital bill for his final illness came to just over 
$157,000. The man had sacrificed for a lifetime so he would be able to leave 
his children some money, because he loved them. They spent almost all of it in 
a few weeks in a vain attempt to avoid the inevitable -- because they loved 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "The Gift of the Magi" done in high tech.

DESPITE ESTABLISHMENT'S DISMAY, CARTER DISPLAYS DIPLOMATIC PROWESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles William Maynes, Charles William Maynes is editor of Foreign Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why does the Washington Establishment have such a distaste for Jimmy Carter, 
our most prominent living ex-president? After all, here is a man who builds 
housing for the poor, writes poetry, stays with the same wife and actually 
cares about peace -- making a major personal effort to bring it about in 
several difficult situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Clinton Administration, he has been responsible for major diplomatic 
breakthroughs in North Korea and Haiti. In Bosnia, he may actually have nudged 
the Bosnian Serbs closer to the negotiation table, though the results will not 
be known for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of official Washington could not be more apoplectic. The 
Washington Post editors denounced Carter in two successive lead editorials. 
Former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger suggested that the former 
President might ruin a policy that had been almost irreparably ruined during 
Eagleburger's own tenure in office. The Clinton White House tried to have it 
both ways. Publicly, it wished Carter well. Privately, White House officials 
informed journalists, of course anonymously, of their dissatisfaction with 
Carter's trip, suggesting that he was naive and being used. 
</P>
<P>
 One facile explanation for official Washington's intense hostility to Carter 
might be that since so many officials in the capital city do little to help the 
poor, are incapable of rhyming one word with another, acquire a trophy wife 
with the next highest office and do little for peace except raise the defense 
budget, they have little time for someone who displays the other virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 But there appear to be two serious reasons for the hostility. One is that the 
former President's activity exposes the erosion of the imperial presidency, to 
which the Carter critics from both parties, and even many members of the press, 
are deeply devoted. The other is that any success he has only reveals the utter 
bankruptcy of the policies followed by the Bush and Clinton Administrations in 
such places as North Korea, Haiti and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The imperial presidency really began Dec. 7, 1941 and continued until the fall 
of the Berlin Wall. During that time, the U.S. government operated in a state 
of national emergency. Fear of another bolt out of the blue, this time perhaps 
with nuclear weapons, caused the American political class to concentrate 
enormous power in the hands of the presidency. Unlike most other world leaders, 
the President alone has the power to make the decision to go to war. Because of 
what was regarded as imminent danger, the President was also permitted to 
surround decision-making with elaborate secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 In this system, the U.S. government operated like a monarchy in the field of 
foreign affairs. The President became all-powerful and, because of secrecy, 
all-knowledgeable. His counselors, in turn, became the king's privileged 
advisers, quick to denounce any opposition to the President's policies as 
verging on disloyalty given the danger the country faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Press pundits cooperated in the game. Their authority depended on their access 
to the monarch and his privileged advisers with knowledge of state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 But do we still need such an arrangement? In a post-Cold War world, with 
economics replacing politics as the core subject of foreign policy, such 
attitudes may be out of date. The imminent danger is gone. So is the rationale 
for the concentration of power in the hands of the presidency. So is the 
justification for extreme secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 In these new circumstances, the old American tradition of citizen diplomacy is 
beginning to reassert itself -- and no one has exploited the new opportunities 
more brilliantly than Carter. U.S. history, in fact, is replete with the 
efforts of citizens to "improve" on the policy of their government. The 
practice began in 1798, when George Logan, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, went 
on his own authority to France to secure its accord with the United States. He 
had some success, but reaped criticism from Jefferson's friends. The U.S. 
Congress then passed the Logan Act, which provided punishment for any citizen 
who, without authorization, tried to influence the conduct of a foreign 
government toward the United States in periods of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 That act, still on the books, has never been enforced and probably could not 
be without infringing upon the constitutional rights of Americans. Indeed, the 
very role of the press in American society makes implementation of the act 
almost implausible; for a free press daily influences the conduct of U.S. 
foreign policy without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of an exit strategy for the Cuban missile crisis began over a 
lunch between ABC correspondent John Scali and a Russian KGB agent. During the 
Vietnam War, Administration officials were livid when U.S. journalists visited 
Hanoi, but there was little they could do about it without provoking a 
constitutional crisis. Senators denounced CNN's Peter Arnett for remaining in 
Baghdad during the Gulf War but, in the end, accepted his "unauthorized" 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there any way to bar U.S. political figures who force their way into 
the process. Members of Congress travel the world interfering in policy, often 
uninvited. During the Carter Administration, aides of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
showed up uninvited at the London talks on Rhodesia and attempted to influence 
the negotiations, to the consternation of the Carter White House. The effort 
failed and the talks succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Jackson flew to Syria in January, 1984, to persuade the government there 
to release Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr., who had been shot down on a bombing 
mission over central Lebanon. Jackson was roundly denounced until he came home 
with Goodman, and Ronald Reagan had the good sense to schedule a ceremony on 
the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than 1,000 U.S. state and local governments are conducting their 
own foreign policy according to research carried out by Michael Shumann of the 
Institute of Policy Studies. Their efforts forced the Reagan Administration to 
shift its policy toward South Africa, provided sanctuary to illegal aliens 
fleeing the civil wars of Central America and pressed the cause of human rights 
in various dictatorial governments. This movement toward "local foreign 
policies" is so large it cannot be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, then, is only the most prominent of a growing number of Americans 
participating in the policy process. He has attracted more attention both 
because he is a former President and because he has chosen the most difficult 
cases. He has moved where the U.S. government has pursued such an inept 
diplomatic course that it left the country with few options other than force 
when the country was unwilling to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Bush and Clinton Administrations demonized the North Korean, Haitian 
and Bosnian Serb leadership, to the point that we had no effective diplomatic 
contact. Yet, we were left with a strategy that assumed diplomatic contact -- 
because our allies in Seoul and Tokyo were unwilling to wage war against North 
Korea; the U.S. Senate was unwilling to support an invasion of Haiti, and the 
American people were unwilling to occupy Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has brilliantly exploited these contradictions to create a unique 
diplomatic role for himself. Those who criticize him should ask whether there 
was an alternative. Was the U.S. government, in each case, not in a position 
where it wanted to shift course but for domestic political reasons found it 
difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when governments demonize one another, there are limited diplomatic 
opportunities, unless some impartial third party -- like Carter -- takes the 
initiative. Thus, the diplomatic breakthrough between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization was due to two Norwegian sociologists rather than to 
the U.S. secretary of state, who could not take an impartial position between 
Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrations must learn to exploit these private efforts rather than resist 
them. If Carter comes up with proposals in Bosnia that trouble Washington, any 
Administration should be strong enough to say no. But it should also be wise 
enough to accept a diplomatic opening if one develops that it did not expect 
and that a former President helped create.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; LIZ CARPENTER; AFTER A BUSY PUBLIC LIFE PARENTING, 
AGAIN, IN HER 70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
producer for Fox News and a contributor to National Public Radio's All Things 
Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke with Liz Carpenter from her home in 
Houston, Texas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If charity truly begins at home, then set a place at the head of the table for 
Liz Carpenter. At age 70, when most folks are content to rock and contemplate 
years past, she took on the stand-up task of raising three teen-age kids. Her 
brother had produced the brood, the result of a late and failed second 
marriage. Upon his death, no one, it seemed, was willing to take in the kids. 
No one except Liz Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carpenter was 6, she was bitten by a mad dog. She survived, intact. At 
the ripe age of 22, Carpenter set out from her native Texas for Washington. 
There, she established a news bureau with her husband, Leslie, and, during the 
postwar years, was one of a handful of women covering Capitol Hill. In 1960, 
she answered her fellow Texan's call, and traded in her press pass to work in 
the White House for Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. It was Carpenter who 
wrote the words Johnson spoke to a stunned nation when he, the new President, 
landed at Andrews Air Force base on Nov. 22, 1963. "I will do my best," said 
Johnson. "That is all that I can do. I ask for your help -- and for God's." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter may have repeated those words three years ago when Mary, 13, Tommy, 
16, and Liz, 17, moved into her Austin, Texas, home. Almost two decades a 
widow, with her own son and daughter grown, Carpenter had become accustomed to 
her freedom -- to baying at the moon in the company of friends her age. 
Suddenly, she was confronted by dirty jeans and T-shirts, loud and strange 
sounds made by musical groups with even stranger names, and the physical, 
psychological and fiscal demands of tending after three typical teens. Perhaps 
to preserve her sanity, she decided to write about the experience. The result 
is her third book, "Unplanned Parenthood: The Confessions of a Seventysomething 
Surrogate Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson once said Carpenter would "storm hell with a bucket of water." Yet, 
it's clear it was not without trepidation that she took on this late-in-life 
parenting challenge. Carpenter, now 74, was a pre-feminism feminist, and today 
has become an advocate for the elderly. She insists if we are going to make a 
society that functions in the new millennium, we must all be more willing to 
open our hearts, and homes, to generations younger and older. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How are kids today different from when you grew up, and how are they 
the same?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I was born in 1920, and grew up in the country until I was 7 or 8, 
when we moved to the big city of Austin, Texas -- then a town of 50,000. It was 
an enchanted childhood, unhampered and at ease. There were no worries. I grew 
up in a house with lots of pictures of ancestors who had come to Texas in the 
1830s, and so I knew what my roots were. I had a mother who would constantly 
say, "Remember who you are." I may not have always known who that was, but I 
knew I was supposed to behave myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's kids are mostly urban dwellers. Many are children of divorce. They 
live in a very contentious world. They are smart, and we should never 
underestimate them, but many do not know or understand their roots. I think the 
mixing of generations can offer kids that -- an understanding of where they 
come from. 
</P>
<P>
 I try to do that with mine, because there really isn't anyone else to tell 
them that they had a teen-age ancestor, William Sutherland, who died at the 
Alamo when he was 17. That kind of knowledge is important, because it gives 
kids a stability and sense of continuity that's not present in other aspects of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There's quite a gulf between your generation and the kids you were suddenly 
raising. What about these children most surprised you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The high divorce rate has created what my nephew, Tommy, calls the "Orphan 
Generation." He says he has only one friend who lives with both his natural 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 One impact of that is to make kids very diplomatic, because they have to deal 
with a mother on one side of town and a father on the other. I hear these kids 
talking on the phone in my house, and I think they may be born diplomats in the 
way they juggle two angry people. Maybe it's hoping for too much, but perhaps 
this generation will be the peacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that pleased me was to find that English teachers today are 
encouraging kids to keep journals. And sometimes a journal is the only thing 
that's listening to these kids. 
</P>
<P>
 I've also seen that this young generation is colorblind and gender-blind. When 
we used to have friends who were boys, we always saw them as potential 
husbands. Today, kids have friends of the opposite sex who they never, ever 
think of romantically, and race doesn't seem to enter the picture. I think that 
gives these kids a real head start on our generation in seeking justice, 
without all the inhibitions that we inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do these disparate generations have to give to each other?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The thing that my generation can give is a sense of history. Because we are 
storytellers, we can make these young people feel that they have roots. I was 
very fortunate to be a reporter with a front-row seat in Washington for such a 
long time. And so I'm shocked when kids' memories don't go back before Ronald 
Reagan. As my kids have come to appreciate their aging, gray-haired aunt, I've 
become more of a resource for them when they are studying history. 
</P>
<P>
 They were thrilled, for instance, to learn that I had interviewed Gore Vidal, 
that I had known Sam Rayburn, and that I had been there in that room when 
Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss confronted one another. These are things I 
try to tell them about. They don't always listen, but sometimes what I'm saying 
comes floating back. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The operative word in this experience with you and these kids seems to be 
adaptation. Does youth have a lock on resilience, or are older people actually 
more able to adapt?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's harder for children. But it's hard for old folks, too. What 
helped me the most was that I began to think of it as a running story -- as 
though I was covering it. And when I started writing the book, it was very 
therapeutic, because I could back off a little and take a less personal look. 
But it was hard for me to have these kids come into my house. I had a free life 
-- for 17 years, I could just pick up and go any time I wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to let these kids go, and do what they wanted, was hardest for me. 
Even though I might disagree with what they want to do -- say, go off somewhere 
on their spring-break vacation and you can just picture all the disasters 
happening -- you have to recognize that these kids have being reading Jack 
Kerouac and they want to roam around and see the world. You have to remember 
that, way back when, you did, too. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been more elastic than they have been in a lot of ways. I've tried to 
use humor. And I've tried not to worry -- but I always do. The thing that's 
important to older people who are set in their ways is to realize there's a 
great satisfaction in being needed. The biggest factor in making one old is 
feeling no one needs you. God knows I feel needed. And I know that I have to 
keep my health and keep on living, because three people are depending on me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Wall Street Journal recently ran an article about people who've waited 
until their late 30s or 40s to have children, and it focused on how their 
bodies were no longer flexible enough for all the demands of lifting and moving 
around toddlers. Do you think that the wisdom and patience that come with age 
outweigh any physical infirmities?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. But I don't think that 40-year-olds should have any trouble 
lifting babies and moving car seats. I think the real danger of the baby-boomer 
parent is that they try to be pals with their teen-agers. Teen-agers don't want 
a 40-something-year-old pal. They want guidance -- though they'll never say 
that. But they are testing, testing, testing all the time. What are the limits? 
And when you are reluctant to give them some limits, I think you are inviting 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: These kids got dealt a pretty bad hand, losing their father, and then you 
write a book, with a lot of personal things about the traumas of growing up. 
Did you worry that you might be betraying a trust by writing about them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I did worry. But I made the manuscript available to them the whole 
time I was writing, and I would talk to them about the book and ask them for 
ideas. And they were helpful. The biggest thing that worried them was that I 
would list an outmoded rock group as an example of the music they liked. You 
know, they wanted to be right up to date with Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch 
Nails. So we were editing the rock groups right up to deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is it about you that made you volunteer for this task, to raise these 
kids?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I know exactly -- my mother. I could not be my mother's daughter and not 
open the door. Nobody else was stepping forward, and my house is in a part of 
Austin that has a wonderful school district. There was no reason I couldn't 
accept these kids and live with my own conscience. But it has not been easy, 
and I don't know how it will all turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 And now we need each other. Each generation has something to give to each 
other. I look back at my grandmothers, who always wrapped the prettiest 
packages for Christmas, even though they were modest gifts, and took such pride 
in the way things looked. I know that's had some influence on me. I hope I have 
some influence on these children. I think they will know more about their 
country, because my house is full of books and pictures that are from the pages 
of my life, from Franklin Roosevelt on. I think conversation is a lost art, and 
I really try to get everybody talking around the dinner table. When I grew up 
in the Depression, you were talking about the country, and the fact that it was 
hurting. You did not turn away the man knocking at the back door for a plate of 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 The house I grew up in, in Austin, was right on the fringes of the University 
of Texas, and it was almost like an informal think tank. We always had lots of 
people around, and they talked about problems with the country, and how we 
could solve them. We listened to the radio, and we were conscious of national 
and world events, living in the state capital, next to a great university. A 
love of learning was part of the scene. I hope I've given some of that to these 
children, and think I have. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We hear politicians on both sides of the aisle talking about family values. 
What do those two words mean to you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They mean love, and love expressed, and spoken and practiced. It doesn't 
mean a whole lot of inflexible rules to me -- which is what I think it means to 
the religious right. We have to say "I love you" to children -- especially to 
children who tend to feel some neglect. And I think you have to say it, whether 
you mean it or not, because there are days when you may love the child but you 
don't much like them that day because of some conflict. I think it's a need in 
everyone to be told they are loved, and that's what family values means to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So do you see older people like yourself raising children for the second, 
or even third time?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I already see more grandparents raising their children's children, and the 
biggest reason has to do with divorce. Sitting and signing my book at store 
after store, I hear the human story that backs up the statistics. Somebody's 
daughter has just gotten a divorce and she's going to have to go back to 
school, and the grandparent absorbs the kids for a while. Sometimes that 
"while" stretches out to a pretty long while. And I also hear from young people 
who have been raised by grandparents, and they often talk about it with a lot 
of pride. And so I hope that these children whom I've raised for a while will 
talk about me with pride, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has being involved with three kids, who seem pretty typical of children 
today, left you feeling about the future of their generation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a quote in my book from Mary White's "The Quilter," which is 
written in the words of an illiterate woman. She says: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometime you don't have no control over the way things go. Hail ruins the 
crops or fire burns you out. And then you're just given so much to work with in 
a life and you have to do the best you can with what you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 That's taught me a lot. And I do think that this piece of life, these children 
who I didn't expect and who landed on my doorstep at age 70, has given me a 
glimpse at the future, and more than a glimmer of hope. It's made me feel more 
alive and needed, and -- tough as it is sometimes -- I'm grateful for it.

FUNDS FOR TELECASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All five members of the Board of Supervisors support telecasting its meetings 
("Eye That Sees All," editorial, Dec. 12). However, the question is whether the 
taxpayers should spend $300,000 annually to subsidize the telecasts.Even before 
the recent board vote, any cable or broadcast outlet in the county could bring 
its cameras to the board room for live or taped coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is a mistake to spend the $300,000 on these telecasts. The money 
would be better spent on the popular Music Center Christmas Program, which has 
been reduced from 12 hours to three because of budget cuts. Alternatively, the 
libraries, parks, museums and animal shelters, which have all had to sustain 
cuts or been in constant jeopardy in recent years, would also have been far 
more worthy sources.

WORLD POPULATION: WILL THIS RUNAWAY TRAIN CRUSH US ALL?; ONLY FAR-SEEING 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP CAN FRAME A DEFENSE AGAINST A GROWTH THAT THREATENS 
NATIONS RICH AND POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The human species may be more than 100,000 years old but the bulk of its 
numerical growth has come in just the last few decades: 2.6 billion of today's 
5.6 billion people have been born since 1960. Demographer and writer Paul 
Ehrlich has long called this growth the "population bomb"; speaking of its 
political effects, fellow demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum has rightly called 
it a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate question posed by runaway population growth is: Can planet Earth 
sustain a human population that is growing this fast or will growth destroy the 
very conditions that support human existence? If unchecked growth indeed 
promises doomsday, then the human race will survive only by framing, in time, a 
political defense against itself. ANSWERS CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE U.S. ALONE 
</P>
<P>
 The habitat question becomes more concrete amid the warnings raised by many 
scientists about global damage caused by industrialization. They say 
industrialization is depleting the Earth's protective ozone layer and fostering 
a warming that could bring devastating climate change. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview conducted for The Times, Ehrlich noted that even if China over 
the years only doubles its fossil fuel consumption (a grossly optimistic 
estimate), it will pump more carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) into 
the air than could be compensated for if the United States cut its own 
consumption by 25%. If India at its present size (leaving further growth aside) 
matches even China's current energy use, then an amount of carbon dioxide will 
be added to the environment that could not be compensated for even by a total 
halt to U.S. coal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing U.S. consumption habits alone, however desirable, evidently cannot be 
the political answer. More important, Ehrlich suggests, could be a dramatic 
U.S. shift away from fossil fuels, proving to China, India and the rest of the 
world that there are environment-preserving energy alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 En route to the ultimate, survivability question, a number of more immediate 
problems like these -- precursor problems, if you will -- present themselves. 
TRYING TO GET AHEAD CAN LEAVE YOU FAR BEHIND 
</P>
<P>
 One of them might be called anti-development, or the often documented collapse 
of prosperity built on non-renewable (or unrenewed) natural resources. Lester 
Brown, president of the MIT-based Worldwatch Institute, notes that the Ivory 
Coast was briefly a model for Third World development, earning huge sums from 
the sale of tropical hardwoods. Unfortunately, when the last trees were gone 
from the West African nation -- in a dizzying and ultimately self-defeating 
process of wood export encouraged by none other than the World Bank -- the 
economy collapsed: Per capita income is now half what it was in 1980. 
Obviously, if fewer people had been making a living from the sale of the wood, 
this resource would have lasted longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost anywhere, production can be overwhelmed by consumption. In 
high-fertility countries, children often constitute nearly half the population. 
Although the Islamic Revolution deserves blame for failing to bring wise 
economic stewardship to Iran, in good part that country's collapsing prosperity 
must be attributed to the fact that its population has doubled since the shah 
was overthrown in the 1970s. Worldwatch's Brown blames some of the recent 
violence in Rwanda on poverty induced by a tripling of the population since 
1950. Haiti, to name a third example, already grossly overpopulated, is 
expected to double in population in the next 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In more prosperous countries, the growth of the world's population tends to 
manifest itself in the relatively bearable form of rising prices. In the 
poorest, most crowded countries, the same phenomenon can mean starvation. In 
interviews conducted for this series of editorials with many experts around the 
United States, global food shortages were repeatedly mentioned as future crisis 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes even the successes of industrialization contribute to those 
shortages. Thus, China's galloping industrialization is steadily shrinking its 
stock of arable land. But China's industrialization is also increasing its 
supply of hard currency. "The bottom line," Brown wrote earlier this year in 
The Times, "is that when China turns to world markets on an ongoing basis, its 
food scarcity will become the world's scarcity; its shortages of cropland and 
water will become the world's shortages."  
</P>
<P>
 The interconnectedness of various population-driven problems is coming into 
steadily sharper focus. Rural population growth combined with the 
industrialization of agriculture sends the rural population streaming toward 
the cities, creating in high-fertility countries megalopolises like Mexico 
City, which has grown from 1.6 million in 1940 to 18 million today. Secondary 
displacement then often sends these internal refugees across international 
borders. Just as China's food shortages become the world's shortages, so the 
Third World's population surplus threatens to become, by migration, the world's 
population surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major industrialized countries, their own populations now stable, have 
sought by strict immigration laws to prevent Third World overpopulation from 
becoming their overpopulation. "Must It Be the West Against the Rest?" asks a 
headline for Matthew Connelly and Paul Kennedy's cover story in the December 
issue of Atlantic Monthly. Yes, these countries unapologetically reply, 
correlating immigration with labor needs and social stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is the great exception in this regard, with extremely high 
levels of legal immigration, virtually all of it from the Third World, and with 
a unique family reunification policy that makes immigration quotas virtually 
unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing the trend of the other developed countries, U.S. population is 
expected to grow 22% by 2025, with immigration accounting for most of the 
increase. U.S. immigration law makes the world population crisis, to a unique 
extent, a factor in Washington's national as well as its international 
population policy.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States tried hard to place the problem of 
runaway population growth on the world agenda. Perhaps the most important 
vehicle for this effort was the U.N. Fund for Population Activities, begun at 
the instigation of President Richard Nixon and for years largely U.S.-funded. 
The Reagan Administration, however, brought U.S. participation in the fund to a 
halt and otherwise terminated U.S. support for world population control in 
deference to domestic reproductive politics. The Bush Administration continued 
this disengagement. CHALLENGES TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ON POPULATION 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, in its first two years, returned the United States 
to a semblance of its earlier leadership role. Former Sen. Tim Wirth, in the 
newly created State Department post of undersecretary for global affairs, 
played a leading role at last September's U.N. Conference on Population and 
Development. During the next two years, however, the Clinton Administration 
will find its return to leadership challenged in two important regards. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it will face -- in the form of the suddenly explosive immigration 
question -- a national population question matching the world population 
question. As U.S. voters gradually recognize that the two are linked, the 
Immigration Act of 1965, America's basic law on the matter, will come into 
sharp question; and it may fall to President Clinton to propose a revision. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the new Republican majorities in Congress may take their cue from 
Ronald Reagan rather than from Nixon. In that case, they may force the Clinton 
Administration to withdraw from the forums where the world population crisis is 
addressed. But overpopulation cannot be addressed without discussing birth 
control, family size, women's reproductive rights and kindred domestically 
sensitive "family values" matters. U.S. abortion politics and other 
reproductive politics did not deter Nixon -- they did deter Reagan -- from 
seeking a leadership role for the United States. So far, the new Republican 
majorities seem more Reaganite than Nixonian, but essentially they have yet to 
weigh in on either population question. A DREADFUL CORRECTION MAY STAND ON THE 
HORIZON 
</P>
<P>
 There is a brutal simplicity about population growth. Birthrates are 
accelerating, death rates decelerating. With political leadership that takes 
the long view, there is a chance that a recent, slight but historically 
significant slowing of the world birthrate may be fostered and intensified. 
Without such leadership, alas, the correction surely will come in another form: 
mass death. To a point, we have been there before. Famine reduced the Irish 
population from 8.5 million to 4.5 million between 1840 and 1900. The Black 
Death reduced Europe's by 25% during the 14th Century. If AIDS is not the Black 
Death of our era, environmentally induced devastation may be. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice, in the end, is all too clear. We can only hope that our political 
leaders and those of the rest of the world will recognize in time that they 
must make a choice.

SANTA MONICA BAY RESTORATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We were surprised to read state Sen. Tom Hayden's assertion in "Sacrificing 
the Bay for Little Gain" (Commentary, Dec. 13) that there is dissension among 
environmental groups over the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project's action 
plan. While different environmental groups may have different strategies, we 
stand united in the pursuit of our ultimate goal: a cleaner and healthier Santa 
Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the plan alone will not clean up our ocean. Under the National 
Estuary Program, the process required consensus among dischargers, regulators, 
agencies and environmentalists in the development of a plan to restore our bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we want to strengthen the plan and to make sure that all its voluntary 
measures are implemented. But we also acknowledge the plan's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 But we must do more. We must strengthen the permits issued to dischargers into 
the bay, including the upcoming municipal storm-water permit. We must 
strengthen enforcement by the regional board, which has totally neglected this 
key responsibility. We must continue to bring citizen actions to enforce the 
law.

 The Santa Monica BayKeeper

</P>
<P>
 The restoration plan is an ambitious blueprint to guide the cleanup of Santa 
Monica Bay. Jointly funded by the State of California and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, the plan was drafted over the last five years 
by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project -- a coalition of 
environmentalists, scientists, government, business and the public committed to 
restoring and protecting Santa Monica Bay. The plan takes on some of the most 
critical problems now facing the bay, including storm water and urban runoff 
pollution and public-health risks associated with swimming near storm drain 
outlets and eating bay seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as state Sen. Tom Hayden, would argue that inviting polluters to 
the table is wrong. But experience has taught us that including all players in 
the decision-making process makes everyone part of the solution. No one party 
had "veto power," as Hayden claims. Rather, the goal was to educate and to 
build consensus. Over and above meeting very specific federal Clean Water Act 
requirements regarding project membership, the project members believe that 
involving all stakeholders in a cooperative effort is the most effective way to 
restore and protect the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The bay restoration plan is exceedingly good public policy for the 1990s. It 
is not the program of any one group. It was endorsed by city councils 
throughout the Santa Monica Bay area, and most recently received broad 
bipartisan support from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the state Senate Committee on Natural Resources, Hayden (who is 
a member of the project and whose staff assisted in developing the plan) is in 
a position to help fund and implement this landmark cleanup effort.

</P>
<P>
 Hayden criticizes the restoration plan principally on the basis of 
administrative considerations as inadequate and unenforceable. There is also a 
technical basis for criticism of this plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is nominally based upon a purported technical report, "The Status of 
the Bay, 1993." This report is laden with errors, inflated with redundancies 
and flawed by omissions. It cannot stand as a reliable foundation for a 
restoration plan. Restoration suggests that something is to be restored to some 
level of abundance. There is no determination of what is missing from the Santa 
Monica Bay even though many species once found here are now absent. There is no 
mention of those species of marine organisms, e.g., abalone, which are now so 
reduced in local abundance that they can no longer sustain themselves as local 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no plan for the restoration of the fisheries potential of the Ballona 
Wetlands, contrary to reports in this paper nor any discussion of the vital 
importance of restoration of this habitat as a part of the Pacific Flyway along 
which millions of birds fly on an annual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal laws require the "maintenance, enhancement and restoration 
of coastal resources" to ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem of the 
Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan is a document in political science, not a technical document 
appropriate to deal with the problems of the Santa Monica Bay.

PACE OF POLICE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take exception to your Dec. 5 editorial criticizing the pace of reform in 
the Los Angeles Police Department. I have been a Los Angeles police officer for 
22 years and am currently assigned to the West Valley Area Community Relations 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 I can speak from personal experience of the changes that are taking place. 
When I began my career, citizen involvement was minimal and frankly was not 
wanted or solicited. Today, however, the department actively pursues citizen 
involvement. I personally oversee a group of 60 dedicated citizen volunteers 
who work in and around the West Valley Police Station. They work hand in hand 
with our officers in the daily function of our station. They do so for no pay 
but solely because of their concerns about their community. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley Station has also developed a proactive Community Police 
Advisory Board. This board includes 35 citizens from the community who meet 
monthly with our commanding officer. They express their concerns about the 
state of the community and present solutions and ideas to our captain. He in 
turn takes their input seriously and develops solutions to deal with their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Our office in conjunction with L.A. City Councilwoman Laura Chick have 
instituted an outreach program for senior citizens. The "Gray Squad" program is 
meant to assist senior citizens with issues of crime that affect them and also 
to provide a wide array of referral services to help them cope with the many 
bureaucracies they face in their daily lives. This program will be a positive 
force in the lives of our senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Future plans include a citizen police academy. This academy will train a group 
of our citizens so that they will understand the role of a modern police force 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Our station also oversees the activities of hundreds of Neighborhood Watch 
block captains. The lines of communication are always open and are a valuable 
source of information to our patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs and philosophies are light-years ahead of what the department 
represented 22 years ago and for that matter even two years ago. Your editorial 
staff needs to stop looking solely at high-level commissions and politically 
appointed committees and instead look at what is currently happening at the 
grass-root level. If you did so, I am sure you would temper your criticism.

R. SAMUEL PAZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stalled confirmation of R. Samuel Paz to be a U.S. District judge proves 
once and for all that the difference between Republicans and Democrats is 
biological: The former are vertebrates and the latter are invertebrates. There 
can be no other explanation. The chutzpah of U.S. senators who voted to confirm 
Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court now blocking theconfirmation of Paz, 
who has spent his entire professional career suing police to enforce the U.S. 
Constitution, is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's detractors in law enforcement, who complain that his many lawsuits 
against police show that he is not qualified to be a federal judge, fail to 
recognize that his success in winning those cases is evidence that the police 
whom he sues have violated the Constitution. That very fact is what qualifies 
Paz for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few enforcers of our Constitution have been put on the federal bench, and 
that is a sad fact that now needs to be addressed.

<P>
 Having been in law enforcement for the past 15 years, I am well aware of Paz's 
reputation within the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz is known to have an agenda of both political and financial import. He has 
made his fortune on the backs of cops. His own actions clearly illustrate his 
contempt for law enforcement. He is proud of his reputation and is not likely 
to change his views. Do we want someone sitting on the federal bench who puts 
his own political and personal biases above the best interests of all people 
(including cops)? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 I nearly laughed out loud when I read the quote from Paz, wherein he opined 
that Sen. Barbara Boxer had considered his nomination because "She sees it 
necessary to have some balance on the court." Since when is "cop-bashing" and 
"cop-busting" an indication of balance?

COLUMN LEFT: GINGRICH PUTS A PRICE ON HIS FAMILY VALUES; HE SHELTERED HIS 
$4-MILLION BOOK BONANZA FROM HIS STRUGGLING, NON-TROPHY EX-WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news that Newt Gingrich will receive $4 million from Rupert Murdoch's 
publishing house must have been greeted with dismay by his former wife, 
Jacqueline, down in Carroll County, Ga. Newt had pulled a fast one. It was only 
nine months ago that she consented to the congressman's request for an 
amendment to their divorce decree that bars her from claiming additional funds 
due to an increase in his earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be too harsh on Newt, it must be terribly difficult balancing 
pro-family values with a commitment to a Darwinian survival of the fittest in 
the marketplace. Newt the congressman-author is a winner in life's sweepstakes, 
Jacqueline the schoolteacher-mother is a loser, and that must be the way God 
and/or Adam Smith intended it. 
</P>
<P>
 She had free will. Nobody forced her to marry someone eight years younger. The 
man is supposed to marry someone younger, and Newt corrected that the second 
time around after divorcing Jacqueline in 1980 for "irreconcilable 
differences," which he said had been the case through the 1970s, despite 
counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 But did he have to be so mean about it? As reported by L.H. Carter, his 
campaign treasurer, Newt said of Jacqueline: "She's not young enough or pretty 
enough to be the wife of the President. And besides, she has cancer." Hard to 
believe, although according to the New Yorker, his wife did tell the 
congregation of her Baptist church: "The devil has taken his heart." Maybe she 
was referring to his being so miserly in the matter of child support and 
alimony, but as Newt points out, we do have a safety net of private charity, 
and the congregants chipped in to help pay the utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The man has chutzpah. In his 1974 campaign, he ran on the slogan, "Newt's 
family is like your family." A sad but perhaps accurate commentary on life in 
suburban Georgia. In 1978, he ran an ad blasting his opponent, Virginia 
Shapard, saying, "If elected, Virginia will move to Washington, but her husband 
and her children will remain in Griffin." Under Gingrich's photo, it said: 
"When elected, Newt will keep his family together." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did, until he filed for divorce 16 months later. His wife told the 
court she wanted to stay married although she had "ample grounds" for divorce 
herself. But she complained bitterly that he failed to support the family. As 
her petition stated: 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite repeated notices . . . plaintiff has failed and refused to 
voluntarily provide reasonable support sufficient to include payment of usual 
and normal living expenses, including drugs, water, sewage, garbage, gas, 
electric and telephone service for defendant and the minor children. As a 
result, many of such accounts are two or three months past due with notices of 
intent to cut off service . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Picky, picky. True, Newt was not broke, he was a sitting congressman with a 
substantial salary, but he had to maintain another residence in Washington and 
was about to remarry. How many garbage bills could he be expected to pay? 
</P>
<P>
 Newt argued that the mother of his two children could always go back to 
teaching, demonstrating his respect for women in the workforce. But the judge 
disagreed and ordered Newt to pay the utility bills, as well as $400 a month in 
child support and $1,300 in alimony. He also ordered that if Newt's income ever 
rose over $100,000 a year, the court could modify payment.  
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward 12 years to 1993 and back to court, where Jacqueline Gingrich 
pleaded that Newt had failed to obey the divorce decree from the day it was 
issued. She asked that "this court issue an order directing the sheriff of 
Carroll County, state of Georgia, to arrest and seize the defendant and 
incarcerate him in the common jail until said individual complies fully and 
completely with this court's final judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 That got the congressman's attention. Accounts were quickly brought to order. 
But then Newt made a move that, in light of the $4 million book deal, would put 
Donald Trump to shame. He negotiated a new settlement last March in which he 
conceded that his income had increased and offered to pay his ex-wife an 
additional $350 a month. But there was a big catch. She had to give up her 
right to ask for an increase in alimony no matter what happened to his income. 
She naively accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Newt now has a chance to make amends. The Democrats are beating him up 
for accepting all that money from Murdoch at a time when the Australian magnate 
has controversial matters before Congress. Why not silence those carping 
critics by turning over the $4 million to the long-suffering ex-wife and 
children or, if that's a sore point, just give it to some charities that 
support abandoned mothers.

 As rams go, Wally was a real gentleman. Rams defend their territory by backing 
up to get a good run going, putting their thick necks down and charging at 
anything they regard as a threat. Once, before we had Wally, I was walking 
heedlessly across the pasture and suddenly found myself flying through the air, 
both sneakers knocked off my feet and flying in front of me. That day, I 
learned a cardinal lesson of sheep-keeping: Never turn your back on a ram.  
</P>
<P>
 But Wally never charged anyone. He could have done a lot of damage if he'd 
wanted to. He was a solid white Romney, more than 250 pounds, slung low. He 
stood like a granite block, square and immovable. But he had mild eyes, a sweet 
face, an air of placid contentment. Wally would lie happily on the grass while 
the lambs used him for a rock, jumping on and off his back. 
</P>
<P>
 He did have a mind of his own though -- in fact he was one of the few sheep to 
which the word mind actually seemed to apply. When Wally wanted to do 
something, he was unstoppable. Shortly after we brought him to our farm, he 
decided one night to strike out, maybe for his old home. He left the ewes and 
trotted away. We found him a mile down the road, loping along, undaunted by 
oncoming headlights. We herded him home with the farm truck.  
</P>
<P>
 We would have been happy to keep Wally forever, but shepherds have to change 
rams to avoid inbreeding. So this fall we found a tall, black 
Lincoln-Corriedale ram named Satchmo and advertised Wally for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 No one called. It was time to start the lambs. We herded the ladies up to the 
barnyard where Satchmo was waiting and left Wally alone in the pasture. He 
seemed satisfied there as long as we brought down grain once a day. But one day 
he ignored the grain bucket and took off through the gate, up the hill to the 
barnyard.  
</P>
<P>
 Wally and Satchmo met at the barnyard fence and glared. The two rams stayed 
fixated on each other, separated by the wire fence, for weeks. They lost eye 
contact only when it was time to eat or for Satchmo to breed.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally the ewes were all pregnant and the tension waned. Satchmo began to 
laze around in the barn and Wally waited calmly for hay in the orchard, still 
just a fence away from the flock. We got calls from prospective buyers, but the 
deals fell through. Wally was well past ram middle-age, and by early December, 
with the breeding season over, the ram market was glutted. I was resisting the 
thought of hauling Wally to an undignified end at the Thetford auction when he 
chose his own fate.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in the middle of a sunny afternoon, he stuck his big nose under the 
gate and pushed up. He lifted the gate right off its hinges. In no time, he was 
in among the ewes, and Satchmo was coming at him. Wally backed off, charged, 
and the crack of their colliding skulls alerted my farm-mate Scot, who was 
working in the yard. The rams backed up for another charge. Scot ran to the 
house to yell for help. In the minute it took us to pile outside, it was all 
over. Wally was down, bright arterial blood running from his nose and mouth 
onto the snow. Within another minute he was dead.  
</P>
<P>
 Chrissie, who is new to farming, stood speechless, horrified. "Testosterone," 
I said to her glibly. "It does a lot of damage in the world." I was shocked, 
but somehow not sad. If there was an appropriate way for Wally to go, this was 
it, by his choice, in the course of ramly duty. Testosterone leads to tragedy, 
but it's a glorious, age-old tragedy. Rams have been going at each other for 
millions of years -- and roosters and bulls and all the male animals you see 
fighting on TV nature shows. And men.  
</P>
<P>
 We have it too, that testosterone. It leads us to our bravest, most foolish, 
grandest and cruelest moments. We tap into it to sell video games and movies. 
The gun industry thrives on it and the sports industry and the industry that 
makes the weapons that are causing bright blood to flow onto the snow in Bihac 
and Sarajevo and Chechnya. There are always leaders somewhere in the world 
stirring up the blood-lust of young men. It's there to be stirred up, not just 
in young men, but in all of us, in every country, all the time.  
</P>
<P>
 But I watched the life ebb from Wally's broken body with a mixture of 
resignation and admiration, not hopelessness. I acknowledge the million-year 
evolution of powerful hormones. I know that war and mayhem run in our blood. I 
refuse to believe that they must dominate our lives. We humans are animals too, 
but animals with amazing powers of rationality, morality, society. We can use 
our strength and courage not to savage each other, but to defend our highest 
purposes. We know how to restrain ourselves, if we choose to do so. We know how 
to build fences and bridges and churches and peace -- if we choose to do so.

A SIGN HAS BEEN GIVEN; GOD IS WITH US; HOMELESSNESS: RECALL THE WORDS OF MICAH 
ABOUT THE OUTDOOR PEOPLE OF BETHLEHEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It has turned cold again. Cardboard boxes, abandoned by importers of toys from 
mainland China and Taiwan, provide makeshift shelter for hundreds of homeless. 
Foreign aid of an odd but crucial sort. Hunched backs lean in toward late night 
fires and hands shove deep into empty pockets. December on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Bluest Eye," Toni Morrison wrote that, in Lorain, Ohio, in the early 
1940s, outdoors was the real terror of life. "Outdoors was the end of 
something, an irrevocable, physical fact, defining and complementing our 
metaphysical condition." Outdoors was concrete, like being dead. "Dead doesn't 
change and outdoors is here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the people who live outdoors are considered dangerous, not 
unfortunate. They seem never to work, preferring instead to panhandle our 
hard-earned and closely guarded paychecks. We distance our hearts by describing 
them as mentally ill, drug- or alcohol-addicted, service resistant or criminal. 
They threaten the very order of our city. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the prophet Micah, contemporary of Isaiah, who announced that Immanuel 
("God with us") would be born, not in the royal courts of Jerusalem as Isaiah 
believed, but in Bethlehem among the poor -- outdoors. This sign was not given 
to comfort the poor, but to appeal to the king of Judah to remain faithful in a 
tough political situation. With armies advancing on all sides, the king went 
for the politically expedient choice. He threw in his lot with the rich and 
powerful Assyrians rather than relying upon Yahweh, who called for "justice, 
loving kindness and a humble walk with your God." (Micah 6:8) 
</P>
<P>
 Over on Fifth Street, Lucy sleeps in a cardboard box. Up at City Hall, plans 
are proceeding to expeditiously rid city sidewalks of the homeless. Yet a sign 
has been given even to this distant generation. Sit tight. Cast your lot with 
those outdoors who are of special concern to Yahweh. A sign has been given. God 
is with us. Merry Christmas.

FESTIVE HOLIDAY SPIRIT RETURNS TO BETHLEHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of pilgrims converged here Saturday to celebrate Christmas at the 
birthplace of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood reflected changes brought about by Middle East peace talks as 
tourists from Jordan, which ended a 46-year formal state of war with Israel 
with an October peace treaty, arrived under once-outlawed Palestinian flags and 
pictures of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the atmosphere in Bethlehem's Manger Square was the most 
festive since the Palestinian uprising launched in 1987 cast gloom over the 
town's Christmas celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thronging the town was a crowd estimated at more than 10,000, a sharp increase 
from past years. Marching bands played Christmas carols, and fireworks lit the 
cold, clear night sky, illuminating a skyline of church spires and festive 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of tourists from Hong Kong huddled in a corner of the packed 
square, singing "Silent Night" in Chinese. Near them, Scotsmen milled about in 
kilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors grilled meat over open coals and sold hot pudding from brass 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more beautiful than last year. It's more beautiful every year and, God 
willing, it will be even more beautiful next year," a 30-year-old Palestinian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sobering note was cast by the hundreds of Israeli soldiers armed with 
assault rifles watching from rooftops and street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Israeli-PLO peace deal, the Israeli army should have pulled out of 
Palestinian centers in the West Bank by last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal, the planned prelude to Palestinian elections, has been delayed 
by Israeli security concerns amid a surge of attacks by Muslim guerrillas 
opposed to the peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have said Bethlehem is likely to be one of the first towns 
handed over to the PLO if a phased pullout is agreed on. The army withdrew from 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho in May.

 THAT BAD? What do other countries think of Orange County's bankruptcy? Der 
Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, says in its latest issue that "in Orange 
County, nothing is in order. . . the fiscal collapse is astonishing." The 
magazine saves its harshest judgment for former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron, who resigned after his risky handling of the county's finances was 
revealed. . . . Der Spiegel calls the debacle "Citron's poker game" and adds 
about him: "He's become the most hated man in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 CELEBRATE WHAT? One of Sears' hottest selling Christmas gifts this year: 
"Orange County, an Economic Celebration." It's a picture-loaded, $34.95 coffee 
table book written in 1988 by local author Janet E. Graebner, for the county's 
Chamber of Commerce -- now selling for $2.98. . . . A clerk at Sears at South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, which has more than 200 copies left, says sales have 
been brisk: "Most people are buying it as kind of a joke, with all that's going 
on. But one businesswoman bought 100 of them to give to clients." 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL JUNGLE BOY: If seeing "Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book" is on your 
list of Christmas things to do -- it's playing on 21 screens in the county 
today -- you might not know that its young star, Jason Scott Lee, first got 
into acting here. . . . Lee was a drama student at Fullerton College in the 
late '80s. "Very, very hard-working, but always with a twinkle in his eye," 
says one of his Fullerton College instructors, Bob Jensen. "It's no surprise he 
is doing so well. It's nice to see his hard work pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 DUCK POWER: It's college bowl season. Of all the county's former high school 
quarterbacks tearing up the Pac-10, Oregon's Danny O'Neil is probably the least 
well-known. But he's the one playing in the Rose Bowl. . . . O'Neil, from Santa 
Ana's Mater Dei High, leads the Ducks (9-3) against Penn State (11-0) on Jan. 2 
at Pasadena. . . . He was sidelined early in the season after undergoing finger 
surgery on his passing hand but came back strong. O'Neil led the Ducks to six 
consecutive wins -- plus their first Rose Bowl bid since 1957.

 Rick Dickson, Washington State's athletic director, knew who was on the phone 
and why. 
</P>
<P>
 But he refused to take the recent calls from Angelo M. Mazzone III, a UCLA 
booster and ticket broker who was involved in the 1994 Rose Bowl controversy 
that left about 1,000 Wisconsin fans stranded in Pasadena without seats to the 
New Year's Day game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm new to the Pac-10, but when I heard about that controversy, I didn't want 
to be involved (with Mazzone)," Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other Pacific 10 Conference officials also chose not to do ticket 
business with the one-time UCLA associate athletic director this year. Mazzone 
was turned down by USC and California. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mazzone, who often was on the Bruin sideline at games this season, did not 
buy tickets from UCLA. Athletic Director Peter Dalis said Mazzone did not even 
ask about tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Pac-10 school that sold Mazzone tickets to the Jan. 2 game between 
No. 2 Penn State and No. 12 Oregon was Freedom Bowl-bound Arizona, which made 
70 available to the Wildcat donor. Most Pac-10 schools offer their tickets to 
donors, season-ticket holders, students and faculty. Leftovers often go to 
ticket brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business in a sense," said John Kasser, Cal's athletic director. 
"So we try to cover ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other ticket brokers, Mazzone annually solicits Pac-10 schools to acquire 
Rose Bowl tickets at face value. He then resells them as part of tour packages 
or for inflated prices, depending on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 That practice was heavily criticized this year when it was learned that 
Mazzone and his partner had reaped a $400,000 profit as the middlemen for a 
large block of tickets to last season's Rose Bowl game between Wisconsin and 
UCLA. They bought 4,000 tickets from UCLA at face value of $46 each, a 
controversial sale linked to a $100,000 donation Mazzone made to the school for 
athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone also purchased 733 tickets from Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon 
State and California. 
</P>
<P>
 That infuriated Wisconsin fans, some of whom paid up to 10 times face value to 
see their Badgers play in the Rose Bowl for the first time in 31 years. Some 
UCLA fans also were upset because they did not have a chance to buy those 4,000 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mazzone's actions were neither illegal nor unusual, the negative 
publicity left schools leery about Rose Bowl ticket distribution this time. 
Mazzone has had to scour classified advertisements in newspapers to find 
available tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin incident also brought public condemnation of ticket practices in 
general. From the state houses in Harrisburg, Pa., and Salem, Ore., to a 
federal building in downtown Washington, came this recent consumer warning for 
'95 Rose Bowl-bound fans: Caveat emptor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials issued advisories telling fans to buy from reputable ticket agencies 
and to pay with credit cards so they will have a record of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a rude awakening for many people," said Jack Lewis of the 
Pennsylvania attorney general's office. "Up until last year, people didn't have 
any concerns at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Badgers fail to return to the Rose Bowl for another 31 years, 
their legacy was firmly established after the ticket scandal resulted in 
class-action lawsuits, a change in federal policy, state legislation and 
outrage from Wauwatosa to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Badger faithful, the '94 Rose Bowl game drew some of the most 
intense fan interest in recent memory. Ticket prices escalated as some 
Midwesterners came to California without assured seats. Some of them paid 
thousands of dollars for tour packages that they assumed included tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 When they discovered the tours did not always guarantee game tickets, they 
complained to the Wisconsin attorney general's office, which launched an 
investigation of state ticket brokers. The consumer protection divisions of the 
L.A. County district attorney's office and the California attorney general's 
office also investigated local brokers, and recently filed suit against two 
firms, which agreed to pay more than $36,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena issued a revised policy covering 
tour operators for bowl games. In essence, operators cannot sell packages 
without guaranteeing tickets to the games. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, a Madison, Wis., judge dismissed a class-action suit against 
UCLA, ruling that the school could not be held responsible for the fans' losses 
because the fans and UCLA were not parties to a contract. UCLA had been 
targeted because of the Mazzone ticket deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Judge P. Charles Jones said, "I firmly believe that the conduct of UCLA 
should not go unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 agreed to reduce its ticket allotment for the Jan. 2 game so that 
Penn State could sell more to its fans, and thus avoid another Wisconsin 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their first time here (as a Big Ten representative) and they have a 
large alumni (group)," said Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon received 39,000 tickets, Penn State 23,000. Last year, UCLA got 41,000, 
Wisconsin 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of USC, UCLA and Oregon State, the allotments of 
non-participating Pac-10 schools were cut from 500 to 400. USC and UCLA each 
normally receive 1,500 as host schools when not participating. This year, USC 
got 1,100, UCLA 1,200. Oregon State got more tickets than other Pac-10 schools 
outside Los Angeles because of its proximity to bowl-bound Oregon. The Pac-10 
cut itself by 600 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Penn State's needs were not met. Although the Nittany Lions regularly 
play in major bowl games, there is increased interest this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact it is the Rose Bowl and we haven't been there since 1923 has made a 
difference," Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curly said.  
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters is the school's massive alumni base. It has the 
country's largest dues-paying group with 126,000. Many of them want the chance 
to see their team perhaps win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have been reminded of the Wisconsin debacle as officials try to get 
the word out. Despite the precautions, consumer investigators say it will be 
impossible to stop fraudulent activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not picked up on any outright scams, but we are certainly expecting 
to," said Jan Margosian of the financial fraud division of the Oregon attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many offers (for tickets) coming in, especially from California. 
So many of our scams come from California." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steven Tick of Murray's Tickets, one of Los Angeles' oldest and largest 
ticket agencies: "The potential is always there to be ripped off because people 
want the ticket so badly they will do almost anything for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to this year's game, however, when Wisconsin fans occupied at least 
three-quarters of the stadium, fan interest in the 1995 Rose Bowl is more 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 This, even though Oregon has not been to Pasadena for a New Year's game in 37 
years and Penn State, a new Big Ten member, in 72 years. The game seems to have 
piqued more general interest because it offers two fresh faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasser, Cal's athletic director, said he had so many ticket requests that he 
cut off sales three weeks ago. Last year, Cal sold only two-thirds of its 
allotment to interested donors. Mazzone was able to buy 51 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, Stanford, USC, Washington and Washington State also sold out 
quickly this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson said 70% of Washington State's allotment was sold to boosters and 
season-ticket holders, the rest to Oregon's faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 And, from a public relations perspective, that is better than dealing with 
ticket brokers and the potential for controversy.

COMMENTARY; AND SO THEY LEAVE, WITH A WHIMPER, NOT A BANG

<P>
 Last play in Los Angeles Ram history, barring divine or NFL-sanctioned 
intervention: Heath Shuler, rookie quarterback for the 3-13 Washington 
Redskins, drops his knee to the Anaheim Stadium turf, pinning the Rams for the 
final count, 24-21.  
</P>
<P>
 One more trip through the north tunnel, bastion of the Melonheads and the 
staunchest die-hards, awaited them on the road to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fans held aloft large blue-and-gold satin banners adorned with the Rams 
crest, the drooping flags of a beaten army. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen others wore T-shirts that declared: 
</P>
<P>
 WIN OR LOSE 
</P>
<P>
 STAY OR MOVE 
</P>
<P>
 RAM FANS FOREVER 
</P>
<P>
 A man dressed in a Santa suit draped a banner over the railing in the end 
zone, a Christmas list that requested a Ram victory, a Ram game ball, a Ram 
jersey and the "Rams To Stay In L.A. -- Please! (signed) A True Rams Fan." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the chanting began. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Rams!" "L.A. Rams!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then the chanting turned mean: 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 This was followed by varieties on the theme: 
</P>
<P>
 "John Shaw (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 And, over and over, for more than five ear-splitting minutes: 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody cares if the Rams stay or go, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Those fans are always great," safety Anthony Newman said. "They are the 
all-time greatest fans. They're always there, they're always there for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't trade them for the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Last song played by the Los Angeles Rams' band: "Auld Lang Syne," 3 1/2 
minutes after running through a few verses of "St. Louis Woman."  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Slater, the veteran offensive tackle who has spent 19 seasons with the 
Rams, long enough to remember when Chuck Knox coached Ram teams into the 
playoffs instead of the first five in the NFL draft, weaved slowly through the 
tunnel, slapping hands with fans who called him over on a first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My emotions right now are just kind of out-of-kilter, I guess," Slater said 
as he pulled off his blue jersey for possibly the final time, be it here or 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke proudly of the Rams' 15 years in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the greatest football ever played was played by the men who sat here 
in this locker room," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke fondly of the fans who "gave me as much respect and support as any 
football player could have. . . . I'm committed to the fact that there are 
people in Southern California who love the Rams and are completely devoted to 
the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke ominously of any decision to ship the franchise to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California without the Rams is something you really have to give a 
lot of thought to before you actually do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last touchdown scored by a Los Angeles Ram: Thirty-six yard pass from Chris 
Miller to Jermaine Ross, a rookie free-agent wide receiver making his first NFL 
catch four seconds before halftime, giving the Rams a 21-17 lead, which they 
would squander like so many others.  
</P>
<P>
 If this is truly it, the Los Angeles-Anaheim era of Ram football will end with 
seven consecutive losses (the franchise record is 12) and five consecutive 
losing seasons (the franchise record is seven). 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Ram victory totals have dropped from six to five to four, dragging 
Ram home attendance figures down with them. Saturday's in-house crowd count -- 
25,705 -- was not only the smallest since the team moved to Orange County in 
1980, it was 4,500 less than the Mater Dei-Los Alamitos high school playoff 
game held earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't blame the fans," said tailback Jerome Bettis, who rushed for 48 
yards, giving him 1,025 for the season. "What are they supposed to do, keep 
coming to watch the same thing over and over? 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to put a quality product on the field. I don't fault the fans. I 
fault us for not winning enough ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
 Last postgame cliche uttered by Chuck Knox: "We didn't get it done. That says 
it all. I say 'we' in terms of my coaches, players, everybody."  
</P>
<P>
 Never expansive even in the best of times, Knox ran through his final postgame 
press briefing in less than three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 What was there to say? Hired in 1992 to turn the franchise around, or at the 
very least, keep it put in Anaheim, Knox watched the victories and the 
turnstiles melt away at a similar pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In three years of Knox II, the Rams went from 6-10 to 5-11 to 4-12 and the 
beds of a fleet of moving vans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix a 10-6, or even a 9-7, in there and do those vans ever get out of the 
garage? 
</P>
<P>
 Last homemade banner unfurled at a Los Angeles Ram home game: "GEORGIA IS THE 
GRINCH," making its appearance with 2:41 to go, coming on the heels of "BITTER 
TO THE END" and "LEIGH SAVE OUR RAMS."  
</P>
<P>
 Rubbing salt in fresh wounds, a television crew from St. Louis made the rounds 
in the Ram locker room, baiting the players with questions about how much fun 
it's going to be playing inside a state-of-the-art $258-million grid dome, in 
front of 70,000 screaming fans "ready to embrace you." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman told the St. Louis man with the microphone, "It's nice, it's nice. We 
don't have that here. But I like grass. And I like Southern California. 
Everybody wants to play in the sunshine in December on grass -- and not having 
to think about leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis shrugged and said, "We're players, we have to go where we're paid. It's 
just so sad. There's nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Not on the field the last four months, and certainly not now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to leave some place with a sour taste in your mouth," Bettis 
said as he watched trunks of equipment being wheeled out of the room, headed 
for who knows where. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go out with a bang. I'm so sorry we couldn't do that."

MIKE DOWNEY: RAIDERS EARN SPOT IN LAYOFFS; COLISEUM BECOMES A WASTELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the Coliseum, not a Raider 
was stirring in the whole mausoleum. Eliminated and humiliated, this shell of a 
team coached by Art Shell could brag about leading the league in nothing but 
penalties and fan arrests, because the Raiders crumbled in their final game 
precisely the way a Kansas City player said they would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Szott accused us of self-destructing, and he was absolutely right," 
Raider lineman Greg Skrepenak said after Saturday's 19-9 surrender. "Merry 
Christmas, Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 A total loss, this Raider season was, not unlike the quake-struck crib in 
which they play. With one of the great wastes of talent in NFL history, the 
Raiders -- projected by Jimmy Johnson, Mike Ditka and experts coast to coast as 
a Super Bowl team -- lost five times by 10 points or more, without a major 
injury except to Napoleon McCallum, and missed the playoffs. Humbug on this 
whole team. 
</P>
<P>
 Weird might not be the word to use to describe what happened to this team. 
With Jeff Hostetler at quarterback and no fewer than four of football's fastest 
receivers, the Raiders topped 24 points twice . Their fifth-leading scorer for 
the season was Terry McDaniel, who plays defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it has been a weird year," said Vince Evans, whose instant-offense 
touchdown pass to Alexander Wright was as good as Saturday's game got. "And I 
think everyone in this locker room is kind of scratching their heads right now, 
wondering what happened. Weird is a correct word to use, I would say." 
</P>
<P>
 We can think of others, but it's Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom, though, have we been exposed to a football team that failed so 
miserably to get out of its own way. Whether it was calling a terrible play 
near the Kansas City goal line or tripping someone in their own end zone for a 
safety, the Raiders were their usual uncoordinated selves, right to the end. 
And if Al Davis doesn't do something drastic, then he doesn't want to win as 
much as we always thought he did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders can scream and complain all they want about the non-call that cost 
them seven points, seconds before halftime. Yes, Hostetler did take a Neil 
Smith paw to the helmet, and no, Hostetler doesn't draw a roughing-the-passer 
penalty as frequently as other NFL quarterbacks do. But poor officiating didn't 
make the Raiders 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "No flag!" Coach Marty Schottenheimer could be seen shouting on the Chiefs' 
sideline after that back-breaking interception runback, and even more amazing 
was that there was no flag thrown against the Raiders. Beyond their nine 
infractions that broke the NFL's record for penalties in a season, the Raiders 
were even offside on Joe Montana's first touchdown pass. Doesn't anybody on 
this team know the rules? 
</P>
<P>
 Not a thing went smoothly Saturday, unless you want to count Kelsey Grammer's 
national anthem. Montana put the Chiefs in the end zone before the cheerleaders 
had time to straighten out their little red Santa caps. No one from the Raider 
defense was even in the picture on a 19-inch TV screen. Montana had so much 
time, he lobbed the ball about as high as a Goodyear blimp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things looked bleak from the get-go," said the Raiders' Max Montoya, who 
announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "K.C. came to play ball," teammate Derrick Hoskins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven knows what L.A. came to do, except false-start its way into oblivion. 
When a team rushes for 53 yards, what can it expect? Only this time there was 
no passing game to make up the difference, and once again Hostetler ignored 
most of his wide receivers other than Tim Brown, who seems to be the only one 
he trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because wasn't it interesting that the instant Evans reported into action, he 
propelled a 65-yard touchdown pass to Alexander Wright? We say interesting 
because afterward, Evans acknowledged that the primary receiver on the play -- 
which was sent in from the sideline -- was Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety was sleeping a little bit, and Alexander with his awesome speed 
just ran by everybody," Evans said. "We felt this season with the kind of guys 
we had, guys with world-class speed, that if you'd throw it long six or seven 
times a game, they might come up with three of them. This one was called for 
Timmy to run an 'out' route, but Alexander just blew by everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. And caught his 16th pass in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste, waste, waste. Where did all the Raider raw speed go? How could James 
Jett catch only 15 passes all season? How could Rocket Ismail catch 32, fewer 
than six Chief receivers caught? Hey, it's not as if the Raiders had the 
world's greatest rushing attack and didn't go to their receivers much. They 
went to their receivers constantly -- well, one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 And so ends 1994, a low point in Los Angeles sports history. The eagerly 
awaited Raider season turned out to be a bust, and, as with the Rams, Lakers, 
Clippers, Kings and our unemployed baseball players, anyone waiting for the 
playoffs to begin can keep right on waiting. We went from tinsel town to death 
valley, practically overnight. Merry Christmas, Kansas City.

RAMS ARE ALL BUT RUN OUT OF TOWN BY REDSKINS, 24-21; PRO FOOTBALL: SMALLEST 
CROWD EVER TO SEE TEAM AT ANAHEIM STADIUM WATCHES WASHINGTON WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was 1:54 remaining, very possibly the final 1:54 in the history of the 
Los Angeles Rams. The scoreboard, favoring the Redskins, 24-21, suggested the 
hometown team was going to end its run with a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute and fifty-four seconds to go in a meaningless game, and yet the 
moment meant everything to Chuck Knox Jr., who stepped beside his father, put 
an arm around his shoulder and patted him on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 1:54 left, and if rumors are true, this was going to be it for Chuck 
Knox, who had walked tall for 21 years on the sideline while becoming the NFL's 
sixth-winningest coach. "I just wanted to let him know, 'Hey, hang in there,' " 
said the younger Knox, who coaches Ram running backs. "It's a definite 
possibility, but I wasn't thinking about whether this was the end. I just 
wanted to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things didn't go as we would have liked, but he hasn't lost hope. Hell no, 
and you can quote me. I know my father, he's tough and he won't give up until 
that last breath. I don't know what the future holds, but there's still a lot 
of fight in him." 
</P>
<P>
 There would be one more chance to rally, to feel satisfied, to walk from the 
field a winner, but the 1994 Rams continued to maintain form to the very end 
Saturday in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A final drive for a tying field goal or a winning touchdown ended with Chris 
Miller gaining a yard on fourth and 11 from the Washington 42-yard line, and 
the Redskins (3-13) were winners, 24-21, before 25,705, the smallest crowd to 
ever watch the Rams (4-12) play in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the worst season in Knox's impressive career and, in the final 
seconds, he jogged across the field to shake hands with Norv Turner, one of the 
game's youngest coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The cameras were pointed in tackle Jackie Slater's direction because there has 
been speculation that his 19-year career is about to end, and so Knox walked 
from the field almost unnoticed. The fans in the end-zone seats were yelling 
something nasty about St. Louis, and a Ram baseball cap landed at Knox's feet 
as he walked through the tunnel to get to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't get it done," he said. "The same mistakes that have plagued us 
all year, plagued us once again. Special teams gave up a big touchdown -- I 
think that's five for the year on returns against us. It's tough to win when 
those things happen. It kind of went like it's been going all year." 
</P>
<P>
 What did he say to the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "All I said was, 'We didn't get it done,' " Knox said, his eyes watering. 
"That says it all. I say 'we' in terms of my coaches, players, everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 How much did talk of the move affect the team's performance? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about that because I don't want to make excuses," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no more questions, and he was gone, moving into the locker room to 
shake hands with his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has one more year remaining on a four-year pact, but if his 15-33 record 
results in his dismissal, "It would be criminal," said Joe Vitt, the team's 
assistant head coach. "No one said life is fair, but it would be criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Players circulated a petition and submitted it to management on Knox's behalf 
this weekend, but on the field their play provided no support. 
</P>
<P>
 "A petition is a cop-out to me," said Ram defensive captain Anthony Newman. 
"If you want to keep anybody here, you go play like it. There's no need to sign 
papers. You can make a coach look like the best coach in the world by playing 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have not played well for weeks, but they had every opportunity to do 
so against the Redskins, who had lost their previous seven games. And, after 
three offensive plays for the Redskins, the Rams had a 7-0 lead after Newman 
had returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a 14-7 lead after Miller (27 of 40 for 304 yards) threw a 34-yard 
touchdown pass to Todd Kinchen in the second quarter, and a 21-17 advantage 
with four seconds remaining in the half after Miller's 36-yard scoring pass to 
Jermaine Ross, Ross' first NFL reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words can't describe how discouraging it is," said Ram tight end Troy 
Drayton. "It's like, I don't know . . . I'm all choked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory could have been theirs, but Brian Mitchell returned a punt 78 yards 
for a touchdown, the third punt returned for a touchdown against the Rams this 
season. Throw in a pair of kickoff returns for scores in New Orleans, and the 
Rams have faltered badly in an area that had received extra attention during 
the off-season, training camp and in daily practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a miserable end to a miserable year," linebacker Shane Conlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath Shuler's one-yard touchdown pass to James Jenkins put the Redskins ahead 
to stay in the third quarter, but Tony Zendejas had the chance to tie from 33 
yards with little more than four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just missed it," Zendejas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams got one more chance to score and then ran out of downs. The season 
was over, farewells and petitions presented and then the locker room was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched Coach Knox leaving," Henley said. "He's hurting. Chuck is hurting. 
He knows how to put teams together, and it just hasn't happened."

WITH KANSAS STATE IN HONOLULU FOR CHRISTMAS, IT'S STILL . . . ; MAY IN 
DECEMBER; FORMER CAL STATE FULLERTON QUARTERBACK'S STRONG-ARM TACTICS HAVE 
BROUGHT KANSAS STATE INTO ALOHA BOWL TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Several moments had passed since Chad May heard the words that would change 
his life, and his only thought was, "Why now?" 
</P>
<P>
 A few days removed from his best football game for Cal State Fullerton in 
1991, May, then a redshirt freshman quarterback, no longer had a job -- or a 
team. Shortly after the season, Titan coaches told May they were scrapping 
their one-back offense in favor of a run-oriented option. And May wasn't part 
of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, lucky him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton no longer plays football, but May does -- well. 
</P>
<P>
 He has rebounded in a big way, and will lead Kansas State (9-2) against Boston 
College (6-4-1) today in the Aloha Bowl at Honolulu.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally, what happened back (at Fullerton) has really helped me," said May, 
a senior. "I found out I have some type of will in me to win . . . to keep 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 That and May's powerful right arm are two reasons Kansas State's football 
program has emerged from decades of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting out 1992 under NCAA transfer guidelines, May has produced the 
best football show in long-suffering Manhattan, Kan. His two seasons have been 
the most successful in school history, producing an 18-4-1 record and 
consecutive bowl appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 With a victory today, the Wildcats will match the 1910 team's record total. 
Kansas State, which was 22-86-1 in the 1980s, finished the regular season 
ranked No. 8 in the CNN/USA Today poll and No. 11 in the Associated Press poll, 
its highest rankings in both. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like a dream," offensive coordinator Del Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, May has completed 59% of his passes for 2,571 yards, 18 
touchdowns and only six interceptions. He was selected first-team All-Big Eight 
for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has improved in almost every category from his junior season, in which he 
completed 53% of his passes and set a school record with 2,682 yards. The 
Wildcats routed Wyoming, 52-17, in last season's Copper Bowl. Although he has 
played in only 23 games, May has set 10 Big Eight passing records. 
</P>
<P>
 "May is the real deal," Missouri Coach Larry Smith said. "From a pure 
arm-strength standpoint, he's one of the best I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 May, 23, was a finalist this season for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm and Davey 
O'Brien awards, which recognize the nation's top quarterback. He finished 11th 
in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people might be surprised at what I've accomplished," May said. "But I 
knew I had this in me." 
</P>
<P>
 How did May go from the depths of the Big West to the top of the Big Eight? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a matter of economics, according to former Titan coach Gene Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's financially strapped athletic department considered cutting 
football for several seasons before 1992, when the ax finally fell. The Titans 
were 1-11 in 1990, May's redshirt season, and 2-9 when May started in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1991, Murphy knew time was running out. So he implemented 
sweeping changes he hoped might save the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had the equivalent of about 33 1/2 scholarships, so our plan that 
last year was to put the majority of the scholarship kids on the defensive side 
of the ball, go with a conservative offense and hope to win some games that 
way," said Murphy, now the coach at Fullerton College. "We just didn't have 
enough (talent) to stay with our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan offensive line was horrible, Murphy said, and defenses battered May 
relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 games, May completed 42% of his passes for 1,066 yards. He passed for 
four touchdowns and nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But May impressed in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Phil Nevin, the top pick in baseball's 1992 amateur draft by Houston, 
was a football teammate of May's at Fullerton. He marveled at the quarterback's 
pain threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the toughest people I've ever been around on an athletic field," 
said Nevin, a third baseman in the Astros' organization. "When you're the 
quarterback at Fullerton, you're going to take some licks, but Chad kept coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Titan offensive lineman Brian Johnson agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chad got his nose broken (in a 27-14 loss at Georgia) and came right back," 
Johnson said. "He didn't complain or anything. He never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 May's best game at Fullerton was his last -- a 37-36 victory over Long Beach 
State. He completed 16 of 23 passes for 213 yards and two touchdowns and guided 
the Titans 86 yards for the winning touchdown with 38 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone on our team knew that he was definitely a cut above Big West 
quarterbacks," Nevin said. "If they had kept the program and Chad stayed all 
four years, he would have dominated that conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, May needed a new home less than a week after the high point of his 
career at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," May said of his meeting with Murphy and offensive coordinator 
Jim Chaney. "I just had a good game. I didn't know what they were calling me in 
for, and then I get hit with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset for a while, but I knew I wasn't going to change their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 May said he didn't think he would play football again. He had come to 
Fullerton from Damien High in La Verne because he thought he would stand out in 
the Big West. Then Fullerton changed its offense to get rid of him, he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was depressed," said May's father, Jim. "I was really down too, but I 
tried not to show it." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy promised the May family he and his assistants would do all they could 
to help him find another school. Fullerton flooded programs from coast to coast 
with tapes of May in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have to thank Gene Murphy and his staff for going to bat throughout 
the country for us," Jim May said. "They backed up what they said they would 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 May said he had trips scheduled to a few schools. After arriving in Manhattan 
on his first, though, he quickly canceled the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Coach (Bill) Snyder and they threw the ball," May said. "Also, 
Manhattan seemed real laid back. It just felt like a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney, now the recruiting coordinator at Wyoming, expected his former pupil 
to make it big. 
</P>
<P>
 "I predicted this," Chaney said. "We knew he was a physically gifted kid. Us 
changing our offense was the best thing that ever happened to Chad." 
</P>
<P>
 May hopes his next career move will work out as well. He's dreaming of a 
career in the NFL, but not everyone is convinced he can play in that league. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a little under 6 feet 2, 220 pounds and not especially swift. He is 
recognized for his arm strength, toughness and ability to read defenses, which 
he did lots of in the Wildcats' pro-style offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably a second-rounder," said Joel Buchsbaum, draft analyst for Pro 
Football Weekly. "He's short and he has a low release point, and his passes get 
batted down. He also tends to be a little streaky." 
</P>
<P>
 May said it would be a mistake to bet against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard all that stuff before," May said. "I proved myself when I came in 
here and I can prove myself again."

JUST AN OLD DUDE? HARDLY; FORMER ROSE BOWL MVP JIM HARDY FINDS NEW FRIENDS AND 
YOUNG FANS AT LA QUINTA HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty football seasons after he was the most valuable player in the Rose Bowl 
game, Jim Hardy, at 71, decided to go into coaching.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to think it over first," a winking Hardy explained recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The former USC and seven-year NFL quarterback became a volunteer quarterback 
coach last summer at the new La Quinta High, about a mile from his desert home. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy led USC to consecutive victories in the 1944 and 1945 Rose Bowls. The 
Trojans beat Washington in the 1944 game, 29-0, and Tennessee in 1945, 25-0. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Rose Bowl MVP in 1945.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, Hardy was big news. 
</P>
<P>
 So big he nearly put World War II below the fold.  
</P>
<P>
 The framed L.A. Times front page of Jan. 2, 1945, hanging on his den wall, 
bears this monster headline, across the top:  
</P>
<P>
 "SC BEATS VOLS, 25-0" 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath is a much smaller headline, near the fold: 
</P>
<P>
 "Patton Hammers Germans in Belgium as Nazis Open New Smashes at 7th Army" 
</P>
<P>
 After spending the last months of the war in the Pacific in a Navy uniform, 
Hardy played for the Rams, Chicago Cardinals and Detroit Lions in a pro career 
that ended in 1953.  
</P>
<P>
 In August, retired and living in La Quinta, he lingered over a local newspaper 
story about the new high school opening in his neighborhood that was having 
tryouts for its freshman and junior varsity football teams.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always wanted to write a story about the development of a new football 
program, from genesis to a championship, so I thought this might be my chance," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When the school's coach, Dan Armstrong, called his first meeting last August, 
Hardy showed up and introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name Jim Hardy kind of rang a bell, but I really didn't know who he was," 
said Armstrong, 41.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know me from a load of hay," Hardy said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect any of the coaches to know me. None of them were even born 
when I quit playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy attended the first practices, took notes, then began studying two young 
quarterback candidates, Pancho Munoz and Jeremiah Anderson.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he couldn't resist.  
</P>
<P>
 He approached Armstrong and said, "Do you mind if I work with your 
quarterbacks now and then? I've got a little football background." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Armstrong: "He started working on technique stuff with the 
quarterbacks, and they seemed to like him. He was connecting with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Hardy's fame fell out of the sky on the astonished La Quinta High 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last August, he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame, an event 
covered on television. Mouth agape, Armstrong saw it on TV that night, as did 
several of his players.  
</P>
<P>
 "The next day at practice, I asked Jim how come he never told us he'd played 
in the Rose Bowl and the NFL, and he just said, 'It wasn't important.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Two players had rushed into my office that morning and said, 'Coach! Coach 
Hardy is famous! We saw him on TV last night!' 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have known. I remember the first day he passed a football at 
practice, I said to someone, 'That guy may be 70, but he can still throw a 
great ball.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, this guy isn't some old know-it-all. Suddenly, what he told 
the kids became gospel. He became a very effective coach after that. When he 
cleared his throat, everyone turned to look at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wore his Detroit Lions world championship ring (from 1952) to a couple of 
practices, and that was a big hit too." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Hardy made every practice, every game, and every bus ride. He even 
put the game program in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed money for equipment, and I mentioned a problem to him once that we 
couldn't seem to get any ads in the program. He took over that job and filled 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, one of the La Quinta quarterbacks, said he at first thought Hardy 
was "just an old dude." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then one day he passed the ball about 50 yards and I thought, whoa! Who is 
this guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when we learned who he really was, we had a sense of pride that he'd 
picked us to work with. And I really learned a lot from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was great at showing me how not to think of defensive pressure around me, 
to blot that out and to concentrate on finding receivers. It's hard to do, but 
he makes it easy to learn because he never criticizes you, never says you did 
something badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at USC, many wondered what had happened to Jim Hardy.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most loyal of all former Trojans, Hardy had attended more USC 
practices in 1993 than any other former player. But suddenly he was into 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled his wife, Henrietta: "Jim can be a very stubborn guy. If (the La 
Quinta coaches) had knocked on our door and asked him to help them out, he'd 
have said no. But he saw that story in the paper and made a decision to help 
out on his own terms."  
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta had a 6-3-1 season, and Hardy talks with friends about his adopted 
team as often as he talks about his beloved Trojans.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a 14-year-old running back at La Quinta, Neal DeMario, who's star 
material," Hardy said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's six feet, 180 pounds and has moves you can't coach. And there's also a 
14-year-old freshman lineman, Brian Heslin, who's 6-2 and 220 already.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy working with these kids, showing them all the little things a 
quarterback needs to know -- like making sure the handoff goes to the back's 
belt buckle. Any higher and he has to straighten up, he slows down, gets 
creamed and maybe fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "And above all, I really enjoy helping Dan, because he's really an outstanding 
young coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Having "Old Dude" Hardy around has meant more benefits to the coach than 
record program sales too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows everyone in football," Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He got me a golf game with John McKay. The coaching staff loves just sitting 
around with him and hearing his stories about going out on the town with Bobby 
Layne and Norm Van Brocklin." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At their home, Jim and Henrietta Hardy, who on June 1 will have been married 
50 years, talked of cheap dates in the late 1930s and '40s.  
</P>
<P>
 Life is good. There's a home in the desert, golf, old friends. But there's one 
problem: No place to dance anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We danced at the Palladium in Hollywood the first night it was open to the 
public, for 90 cents each," Jim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had food there, but all we had was the 90 cents. So we just kept dancing 
until they blinked the lights at us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also used to dance at the Palomar, at Second and Vermont, until it burned 
down in 1939. And we danced to Stan Kenton's music at the Rendezvous in 
Balboa." 
</P>
<P>
 When Henrietta left for a shopping expedition, Hardy said, "There goes the 
greatest swing dancer who ever lived."

PRO FOOTBALL: KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 19, RAIDERS 9; CHIEFS GO WITH THEIR PAIR OF 
ACES TO GET WILD CARD; AFC: MONTANA PASSES FOR 214 YARDS AND ALLEN RUSHES FOR 
132 IN VICTORY OVER RAIDERS.

<P>
 Having Marcus Allen and Joe Montana in the same lineup for a must-win game is 
like being dealt blackjack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough hand to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the Kansas City Chiefs were so confident going into Saturday's 
playoff-berth showdown with the Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have two great leaders like that on offense, you can't help but be 
confident," Kansas City offensive lineman Joe Valerio said. "It's easy to see 
their performances on the field, but what sets them apart are the other things 
they bring to the huddle. When the bullets start flying, you know that you can 
count on those two." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Allen's 132 yards rushing and Montana's 214 yards and one touchdown 
passing, the Chiefs defeated the Raiders, 19-9, to sweep their division rivals 
for the second consecutive year and clinch a wild-card playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought we were done, but look around, we're still alive," Kansas City 
linebacker Derrick Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason the Chiefs became the only team to qualify for the playoffs every 
season in the 1990s is the decision by Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer 
to run the ball against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In practices and meetings leading up to the game, Schottenheimer repeatedly 
told the Chiefs that they would turn to Allen to get things going on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan was to run the ball," said Allen, who surpassed the 10,000-yard 
rushing mark for his career with 10,018. "The plan was to wear them down. I 
think -- and not giving any disrespect to (the Raiders) -- that the Chiefs have 
always felt superior in terms of their conditioning and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen carried the ball 33 times and spearheaded a ground attack that rushed 
for 204 yards against a Raider defense that was ranked among the league's best 
in stopping the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a team guy and wanted to win," Allen said. "Obviously, 
that's the foremost thing for me. I'll carry it as many times as they give it 
to me. Actually, it's kind of weird, but you get better after you're tired and 
fatigued a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 In being able to move the ball on the ground, Kansas City held a 17-minute 
advantage in time of possession over the Raiders. One reason for this was the 
use of Valerio as a second tight end to bolster the Chiefs' running game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really had a good day running the ball and I think the key was that we 
kept doing it throughout the game," Valerio said. "We kept the pressure on them 
and we kept getting better as the game went on." 
</P>
<P>
 With Allen averaging four yards a carry, Montana was able to keep the Raiders 
off-balance with a variety of play-action plays and rollouts. He completed 15 
of 24 passes without an interception and was not pressured for most of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to mix the run in with the pass," Montana said. "I'm not saying 
that we controlled the line of scrimmage, but we were able to get a fair share 
of yards on a majority of our run plays. Our offensive line allowed us to run 
the ball and have the opportunity to make some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The first big play came on Kansas City's opening drive when Montana completed 
a 47-yard touchdown pass play to Willie Davis, who was all alone behind the 
Raiders' zone defense down the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Chiefs wore the Raiders' defense down in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we felt that they can't beat us," said Davis, who caught three 
passes for 83 yards, all in the first half. "But if a team can stay with the 
Raiders into the fourth quarter, they'll give you a chance to win because 
they'll make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks ago, Kansas City looked as if it was out of the playoff 
hunt with a 7-7 record, but now the Chiefs have a two-game winning streak and 
confidence that they can make it to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some adversities this year, but throughout all of that we 
continued to work hard," said Schottenheimer, whose team lost to Buffalo in the 
AFC championship game last season. "We have not played, quite frankly, as well 
as we would have liked to have played. But in the final analysis, we are in the 
tournament and that is the only thing that matters." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Chiefs can thank Allen and Montana for that.

PRO FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON REDSKINS 24, RAMS 21; SMALL CROWD LEAVES USHERS ALONE

<P>
 It's Saturday, and we're standing in Southern California's loneliest spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Aisle 269, Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, the Rams and Washington Redskins are putting the finishing touches on 
such memorable, not to mention pitiful, seasons before a cozy Christmas Eve 
afternoon audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Up here, usher Miguel Martinez's only companion is the voice on his 
walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad feeling," Martinez said. "They have to get a winning team in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear the Raiders might move here," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He shivers. Is it the wind whipping through the empty tunnel or the thought of 
plenty of warm, silver-and-black-and-blue bodies, liquored up and ready for 
fun? 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez looks at the seats above him. He had plenty of company Nov. 13. 
People were rolling in the aisle that day, when the Rams played the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Raiders come here," he said, "I heard some of the guys say they'll 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand an usher's concern. Raider games have been few and far 
between at Anaheim Stadium. Most ushers would prefer they be fewer and farther 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of eight, eight Raider games here a year -- not counting the 
exhibition season -- doesn't sit too well with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Their experiences with Raider fans haven't been pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders can stay in Los Angeles," usher Thayle Denney said. "Whenever 
they come here, it's a zoo. I just don't like their fans. It's like a zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, but better a zoo than a mausoleum? 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, like the Rams, have been making noise about moving. While the 
Rams have looked east, to St. Louis, the Raiders have looked north, to Oakland, 
and now south, to Inglewood and, yes, to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 And Anaheim may be looking their way as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stadium needs a football team," said Debbie Engel, who worked her way 
from usher to lobby receptionist. "A good team. A winning team." 
</P>
<P>
 Engel was working the turnstiles the first game the Rams played in Anaheim 
Stadium in 1980. A 20-year stadium veteran, she had never seen anything like 
it, before or since. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers the buzz that has become snores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fans were running to the gate to get inside," Engel said. "They wanted to see 
the new stadium design. They wanted to see the team. It was so exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But the thrill is gone, and so may be the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If they leave, ushers will take a financial hit. Engel said she and others 
probably will be cut back to six months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, better an empty wallet and an empty stadium on Sundays than an 
ungrateful team, according to Engel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Rams started crowing that the fans didn't support them, I got 
offended," Engel said. "They offended their fans. This is my stadium, and they 
can go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get a winning team in here and the fans will come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Raiders are winners instead of whiners. At least they beat the Rams 
this season -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, anybody but the Raiders," Engel said. "Their fans are so . . . so . . . 
so difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Raiders have worn out their welcome with ushers. There were 
problems during the exhibition game in August and they escalated on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez vividly remembers that unpleasant afternoon. He was working section 
269, where the worst of the fights occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "This girl got punched right in the face," Martinez said. "But she was hitting 
people too. People were rolling down four or five rows. The police couldn't 
stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the Raiders will move here, but not their fans. They have this macho 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 For ushers, that's bad. This is a second job for most of them, one that 
provides a little walking-around money. Others are retired and want to keep 
busy. 
</P>
<P>
 None want the headaches of fan free-for-alls each week. Most do the job 
because they enjoy the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kehoe, an usher supervisor, has been a Ram fan since the 1950s. He has 
worked at Anaheim Stadium since it opened in 1966, starting as an usher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin when I was a kid," he 
said. "I felt like a kid again when the Rams moved here." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's seeing them leave, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehoe, who is also a music teacher in the Garden Grove Unified School 
District, already lost about $900 because of the baseball strike. If the Rams 
leave, it will hurt his wallet a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 He, like others, hopes the football void will be filled by another team if the 
Rams leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a team," usher Jim Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, not the Raiders," Bennett answered. "Maybe the Cleveland Browns. The Rams 
did pretty good when they moved from Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, another team isn't the answer for some. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams should stay," usher Denney said. "They have L.A. tradition and 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, he wants a team with L.A. tradition and heritage. Is there another one 
like that out there? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not the Raiders," Denney said. "Let them go back to Oakland."

 First Quarter: Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the stadium, 
not a creature was stirring, not even a Melonhead. . . . The uniforms were hung 
by the lockers with care, in hopes that everyone but Wymon Henderson soon would 
be there. . . . Last game, first play, and for the 12th time this season, Rams 
open with a Jerome Bettis running play. Redskins are fooled -- Bettis gains a 
yard. . . . Anthony Newman intercepts, returns for TD, proving you can't keep a 
good man on the bench. . . . Free agent Roman Phifer shuts down 'Skins on 
fourth and one at Ram 16. Henry Ellard, Kevin Greene, Duval Love and Jim 
Everett figure to have competition for ex-Ram of the year honors in 1995. Rams 
7, Redskins 0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second Quarter: Wayne Gandy replaces Jackie Slater, and Brad Ottis replaces 
Sean Gilbert. Talk about finding coal in your stocking. . . . Desmond Howard 
pulls a Heisman on Darryl Henley; at least it wasn't a badge. . . . Reggie 
Brooks scores, and apparently the end zone isn't off limits to all former Notre 
Dame backs. . . . Troy Drayton runs for four yards, now has better average than 
Bettis. . . . Todd Kinchen makes TD catch, gets so excited, shakes hand of 
everyone in attendance. It takes 15 seconds. . . . Bettis tops the 1,000-yard 
mark. Finding the cure for cancer should be easier. . . . Brian Mitchell 
returns punt 78 yards for TD. He could have gone further if necessary. . . . 
Martin Bayless intercepts Chris Miller pass. Miller blames Bayless for being in 
wrong spot. . . . Halftime show is to feature America's Finest Frisbee Dogs. 
Inspired Jermaine Ross leaps into air and snatches Miller pass for TD with four 
seconds left. . . . Rams 21, Redskins 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third Quarter: Miller scrambles for first down without getting a concussion. . 
. . Ken Harvey clobbers Miller, forces fumble, but ref rules Miller was trying 
to pass. Ref also indicates Rams will stay in Anaheim, and Georgia Frontiere 
will donate money to bail out Orange County. . . . Refs penalize Miller for 
intentional grounding. Odd, it didn't look any different than his other passes. 
. . . Holding called on Gandy, and Gandy throws helmet at bench. Press box was 
too far away. . . . Todd Lyght interferes with Howard in end zone. Redskins 
need three tries to go in from one-yard line. Rams are improving. . . . 
Redskins 24, Rams 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Quarter: Miller gets sacked. Others will follow in next few weeks. . . 
. Rams adjust strategy, have 12 men on field to keep Redskins from returning 
punt for TD. Refs take exception, award Redskins first down. Rams consider 
themselves lucky. . . . Ineligible receiver downfield called on Rams. No name 
mentioned, but based on the way the coaches regard him, it could have been 
Drayton. . . . Robert Bailey has apparent interception at Redskin 25, but drops 
the ball. Playoff hopes dim. . . . Bettis gains eight; 2,000 yards or bust. . . 
. Tony Zendejas misses tying 33-yard field-goal attempt. Santa has work to do 
at home; there will be no overtime on Christmas Eve. . . . Redskins 24, Rams 
21.

Christmas to all, and to Ram Review, good riddance. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON REDSKINS 24, RAMS 21; RAM NOTEBOOK; PLAYERS WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE KNOX FINISH THE JOB HE STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Rams may or may not be back next season, but will Coach Chuck Knox and his 
staff? If the decision belongs to his players, the answer would be yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram players circulated a petition this week in support of Knox and the 
coaching staff, but some of them wondered after a 24-21 loss to the Washington 
Redskins Saturday if their signatures were any more than a goodwill gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sign no papers," free safety Anthony Newman said. "If you play like 
a man, go out and play your football, you'll keep anybody here. You don't have 
to sign no papers to have somebody stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Fred Stokes said there was no pressure on anyone to sign the 
petition. Wide receiver Todd Kinchen said the document "got in the right hands" 
but doubted it would have much impact on management's decision on the coaching 
staff's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis, who ran for 1,025 yards this season in Knox's 
ground-oriented offense, said he would "hate to see the coaching staff go." 
</P>
<P>
 "The team's at a low point, but it's not because the coaches didn't prepare 
us," Bettis said. "We killed ourselves out there with turnovers, and that's not 
the coaches' fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Said cornerback Todd Lyght: "It's out of my control, and it's out of my mind. 
I'm going to go spend some time with my family, sit back and watch the 49ers do 
their thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right tackle Jackie Slater, who might have played his last game in a 19-season 
Ram career, was stopped by Washington linebacker Monte Coleman as he left the 
field Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman wanted to swap helmets, and Slater obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Slater returned to the Ram locker room, he remembered that he had 
promised the helmet to his wife. Slater went over to the Redskin locker room, 
and asked for the helmet back. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman gave it to him, and insisted that Slater keep the Redskin helmet. 
Slater promised Coleman he would send him another Ram helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the Rams' 1995 schedule, which probably won't mean much to you unless 
you live in St. Louis: 
</P>
<P>
 Home games -- San Francisco, Atlanta, New Orleans, Carolina, Chicago, 
Washington, Buffalo and either Miami or New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Road games -- San Francisco, Atlanta, New Orleans, Carolina, Philadelphia, 
Indianapolis, New York Jets and either Detroit, Minnesota or Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 25,705 for Saturday's game was the smallest to see a Ram game 
since the team moved to Anaheim Stadium in 1980 and 4,360 fewer than Mater Dei 
High and Los Alamitos drew for the Southern Section Division I semifinal played 
here earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials announced 35,066 tickets were distributed for the game, but 
9,361 were unused. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're die-hard fans," Bettis said. "They come out and support us in times 
when we're down, out there yelling their hearts out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been helping us. It's just hard to get things going when you're 
killing yourself on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ended a disappointing second season with 404 fewer less than he gained 
his rookie season. He became the first Ram to rush for 1,000 yards in 
back-to-back seasons since Greg Bell in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for only 48 yards on 15 carries Saturday against the 27th-ranked 
rush defense in the league, making it 11 consecutive weeks that he hasn't 
broken the 100-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suicide mission: The Rams' special teams have given up five punt and kickoff 
returns for touchdowns this season, and that's after the team hired Wayne 
Sevier, a former Redskin special teams coach who is considered one of the best 
in the league at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty amazing that it has come down to this," said Kinchen, the team's 
punt returner. "Coach Sevier is one of the best special teams coaches around. 
He taught special teams better than I had ever seen. We just didn't make the 
plays. He's not the one who made the mistakes, it was us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington wide receiver Henry Ellard, who played 11 seasons with the Rams, 
said he nearly ran into the wrong locker room before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of special memories about the place, and it was nice to be a 
part of the last game," Ellard said. "It was strange to be here and walk into 
the visiting locker room instead of the Rams' locker room. When we broke to 
leave the field, I started running to the Ram locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, 33, caught a team-high five passes for 81 yards. He finished the 
season with 74 receptions for 1,397 yards, falling three yards shy of becoming 
the oldest receiver in league history to reach 1,400 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young, when asked what went wrong in the Rams' 4-12 
season in which they lost their final seven games, including three by four 
points or less: "We just never got it together. It's like Murphy's Law with 
this team. It's been a crazy year, and I'm glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and tailback Johnny Bailey left 
in the second half with bruised ribs. Right guard Leo Goeas (knee) and safety 
Anthony Newman (shoulder) both returned. Ram notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Hester's 13-yard reception in the second quarter extended his streak of 
games with at least one reception to 78. . . . Rookie Jermaine Ross' 36-yard 
touchdown reception from Chris Miller was his first NFL catch. . . . Linebacker 
Shane Conlan's eight tackles gave him 101 for the season, the third time in his 
career that he has recorded 100 or more tackles in a season.

SCHOLL CANYON CHARTING A NEW COURSE; GOLF: AFTER FOUR YEARS IN MOTHBALLS AND A 
$4-MILLION FACE LIFT, GLENDALE FACILITY HAS REOPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, Scholl Canyon Golf Course was dying. The body was decaying and 
it was hardly a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers could smell Scholl Canyon before they reached the facility's parking 
lot. The stench from the course, built on a landfill site in the foothills 
overlooking Los Angeles, was indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes watered. Nasal passages burned. The foul air spawned bad jokes. Eau my 
gosh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air was so rank, so foul, so thick, that you had to use an extra club to 
reach the green," said Kelly Magee of Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about mulligans. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years in mothballs and a $4-million face lift, Scholl Canyon 
reopened in November. Replete with state-of-the-art technology to handle the 
decomposition problem, Scholl's makeover is startling to golfers like Magee who 
played the old course way back when. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Old Scholl) was flat and boring," said Magee, who has played the new layout 
a half-dozen times. "It didn't have any trees. It was uninteresting." 
</P>
<P>
 The new version definitely has its entertainment value, particularly on the 
back nine, which includes a 20-acre mountaintop parcel that was annexed when 
the layout was expanded to 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Any way you slice it, any course at all is good news around Glendale, if not 
elsewhere. In fact, Scholl is the first course to open in the Valley region 
since Camarillo's private Spanish Hills Country Club was unveiled in June, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's an asterisk attached to the former. Scholl, the sequel, 
technically isn't new -- the old course is down there somewhere, buried along 
with the garbage and who knows what. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholl I was a 40-acre, nine-hole course built on a city dump. Like a field of 
fruit gone rotten, it was plowed under. Now this, from fallow to fertile, in 
all of a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months ago, the City of Glendale signed a developmental agreement with 
the American Golf Corp., which agreed to rebuild the site in exchange for a 
40-year operational lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a great deal? There was considerable work to be done. After all, it 
isn't every day that a course is condemned.  
</P>
<P>
 The place has always had potential. The views from Scholl are spectacular and 
on a clear day golfers can see Santa Catalina Island, the Griffith Park 
Observatory and the L.A. skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 But at old Scholl, clear days -- not to mention every other day -- were 
hazardous to your health. In 1990, four years after the facility opened its 
doors, the Air Quality Management District shut down Scholl because of methane 
gas leakage. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane, caused by the decomposition of the landfill matter, is a nearly 
odorless, colorless gas of high flammability. At Scholl, what you didn't know 
could hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was that John Q. Public Links was left high and dry in Glendale for 
years. The community's other courses, Chevy Chase and Oakmont country clubs, 
are private and pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, interest in the resuscitation project was high, said Brian 
Bode, the head PGA pro at Scholl Canyon. Despite four years in limbo, the 
Scholl Canyon men's and women's clubs never folded. On Nov. 13, reopening day, 
300 golfers showed up to play, Bode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players found that the course had been completely overhauled. Scholl II is an 
18-hole, 60-acre executive course with a par of 60. It also features a 
34-stall, lighted driving range. While it has its quirks, Scholl has an 
understated charm that should attract plenty of beginners and intermediate 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholl didn't exactly break new ground, if you will. Erecting golf courses on 
landfills is fast becoming commonplace. In California, where urban land is 
increasingly rare and expensive, cities can save a fortune by recycling acreage 
they already own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a definite trend," said Bode. "Places don't always have a 
lot of better options." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southland courses built on landfill sites include Industry Hills 
Sheraton Resort in the City of Industry, MountainGate Country Club at the crest 
of the Sepulveda Pass and River Ridge Golf Course in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry Hills, which is 15 years old, is the Southland's biggest landfill 
success story. The public facility has two top-flight 18-hole courses and 
tennis and equestrian facilities spread over 750 acres. Methane heats and cools 
its buildings. Recycled water irrigates the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane leakage wasn't the only problem at Scholl I. Numerous structural 
defects developed. Subsidence was a problem on the greens. Fissures and 
sinkholes appeared in many places, not to mention the occasional . . . flash 
fire? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have fissures open and somebody would flip a lighted cigarette in it and 
a little fire would break out," said Bob Mezak, who supervised the project for 
the Glendale Parks, Recreation and Community Services Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no such problems at Scholl II, Mezak said. And they've 
actively sought them out. The AQMD requires the course to take daily methane 
readings with a portable probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeover wasn't limited to above-ground features. The city installed a 
pipeline system to collect the methane, which is channeled to the Grayson Power 
Plant and used to generate electricity for Glendale townsfolk. Water used at 
Scholl is recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in methane collection should all but eliminate the possibility of 
future shutdowns, Mezak said. As insurance, layers of plastic have been placed 
beneath Scholl's greens to ensure that nobody spontaneously ignites. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction began last November. More than 300,000 cubic yards of dirt were 
redistributed. After the methane pipelines were installed, the old course was 
covered with another 6-10 feet of topsoil. In several areas, a layer of clay 
was added below the topsoil to help seal the landfill. Some of the dirt came 
from Metrolink tunneling projects. 
</P>
<P>
 By next summer, the place should be bustling and in full bloom, Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bentgrass greens and Bermuda fairways will have matured. By then, an 
elevator will be available to help golfers with the daunting hike to the 12th 
tee, situated atop a crest. The snack bar will have its beer license. New 
electric carts, with centrifugal clutches, will have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if feedback can be measured in terms of turnout, Scholl is a runaway 
winner. Bode said play has steadily increased, despite the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been surprising," Bode said. "They never forgot (we were here)."

RECREATION / STEVE HENSON: FOR TEAMS, FUNDING IS FIRST HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In order to finish anything, one must begin. In order to begin the 
Eco-Challenge, one must have about $8,000 to spend on preparation and 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the case of Bill and Louise Lovelace, a couple from West Hills, double 
the cash necessary to reach Utah, site of the April, 1995, expedition 
competition that will require the use of canoes, mountain bikes, white-water 
rafts, horses and climbing ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "With both of us on the team, it's quite a financial drain on our family," 
Bill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eco-Challenge does not stand for Economic Challenge, but it might as well for 
the Lovelaces and three teammates. They have tried various fund-raising 
strategies for several months without much success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People applaud what we are doing; they wish us luck but no one will sponsor 
us," said Louise, a special education teacher. "We've tried with large 
companies and smaller community-related companies. I don't know if it's a sign 
of the times or if it's just that people are not familiar with (the 
Eco-Challenge), but our attempts have been futile." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a garage sale that netted $400 and two companies that will provide 
equipment at cost, the Lovelaces are on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 They might as well get used to it, because there will be no one to lean on 
during the inaugural Eco-Challenge, an ambitious, arduous endeavor patterned 
after the European event Raid Gauloises.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the 50 five-member teams -- each team must have a female member -- 
will know details of the course until 24 hours before the race begins. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they do know all too well the equipment required to complete the 
300-mile journey, which will take 7-10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The list is endless," said Bill Lovelace, an insurance company executive. 
</P>
<P>
 A helmet and a harness, a stove and a shovel, boots and blades, four different 
kinds of packs, three kinds of gloves, two kinds of jackets, and one of about 
50 other items. Try and ask Santa for that.  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to fund-raising, training is a breeze for the Lovelaces. At least 
they are on familiar ground during their weekly regimen of running 60 miles and 
bicycling 150 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lovelace, 47, is the team leader for rafting and Louise, 41, is the team 
leader for first aid. Both have completed the Ironman triathlon eight times. 
Bill has run in 118 marathons and Louise has run in 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Their teammates have expertise in a variety of areas. Doug Wilde, 40, is an 
expert in canyoneering and horseback riding. Kirk Boylsteon, 37, specializes in 
mountaineering, rappelling and canoeing. Duane McDowell, 35, is best at 
bicycling and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has been canoeing at Marina Del Rey, mountain climbing in the Angeles 
National Forest and horseback riding at Hughes Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Less predictable is the psychological toll the race will take. Race organizers 
like it that way. "We're trying to make this equally brains and brawn," said 
Mark Burnett, a Topanga resident who founded the Eco-Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of intelligence needed, a lot of cryptic stuff, 
misleading clues and things you've got to think through. Things will not always 
be as they seem, just like real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cryptic comments to be sure. Certain things are spelled out, however. The race 
will be divided into five segments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ride and run. Each team will have three horses. Two riders on one horse is 
prohibited, so two competitors will take turns running alongside the three 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mountaineering. Utah's breathtaking sheer cliffs must be crossed with 
rappel, ropes, Tyrolean bridges and harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canoeing and white-water rafting. Two canoes and one raft are provided for 
each team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mountain biking. Each team member must ride -- and at times carry -- a bike 
across rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyoneering. Teams must travel through deep, wet canyons, often swimming 
while pushing their packs ahead. Watch out for those flash floods! 
</P>
<P>
 There will be frequent checkpoints. If one member of a team quits, the entire 
team is disqualified. First prize is $10,000 and free entry for the competition 
in 1996, which will be held in a different state. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett, along with a small group of colleagues, plans to expand the 
Eco-Challenge at a rapid rate, holding at least one every year. The top team 
from each of six national regions in the Utah competition will compete two 
months later in a week-long Eco-Challenge in the woods of Maine and the coast 
of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah race will be featured in an MTV special and on NBC Dateline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will create a new type of star," Burnett said. "The top competitors will 
be well-known and Eco-Challenge will become a word as recognizable as 
triathlon." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in the trenches, the Lovelaces just want someone to pony up 
cash for the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting sponsorship is part of the experience, part of the challenge," 
Burnett said. "Get to the starting line with all five people, and you have 
completed the first part of the Eco-Challenge."

SCHOLL CANYON CHARTING A NEW COURSE; ANALYSIS: NEW LAYOUT CAN BE INTIMIDATING, 
BUT IT IS A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT OVER OLD CONFIGURATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No doubt about it, Scholl Canyon Golf Course is to golf what Picasso was to 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclectic, weird, an acquired taste. Strange angles, wondrous sight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring extra balls, a sense of humor and a seat belt to the first tee. Quirky 
Scholl, situated atop a panoramic bluff overlooking Los Angeles, Griffith Park 
and the Santa Monica Bay, is a wild ride, but may not be for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers managed to squeeze 18 executive holes into approximately 60 acres. 
In some places, they used a shoehorn. In others, a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholl is only 3,039 yards long from the men's tees and none of the six 
par-four holes measure more than 324 yards. In short, because it's so short, 
Scholl is great for the ego. But for some, it's bound to be tough on the 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's carved out of a former landfill site and packs more peccadilloes 
per hole than most public courses in the area, Scholl will be difficult for 
many beginners. Novices and high-handicappers, though, are destined to be 
Scholl's primary clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the beginner, it's pretty challenging -- maybe too challenging in a 
couple of places," said Brian Bode, the head pro. "But this will give them a 
taste of what to expect (on a regulation course)." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow down, folks, before word gets out and it's overrun by hordes of hacks. 
With weekday green fees of $14, it's a pretty good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after the course reopened, a foursome of Valley guys teed off at 7:24 
on an idyllic Sunday morning. Best news of all: There was nobody in front of or 
behind the group and the round took a scant 3 hours 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quick, but not necessarily painless. Some assert that the place is 
named after Dr. Scholl. Any golfer who drags a bag up the mountain from the 
11th green to the 12th tee will need a podiatrist, not to mention an oxygen 
tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a smoker and it damn near killed me," said Kelly Magee of Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 While the front nine has its entertaining holes, it's relatively 
non-threatening. The fun and topography really begin at No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The hill to the 12th tee is so steep that the cart path includes a series of 
switchbacks. For those on foot, plans call for an elevator to be installed in 
February, Bode said. The setting at the top is spectacular, which means some 
players will be afforded a great view of their ball as it falls off the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th hole marks the beginning of Scholl's Amen Corner, whittled from a 
20-acre parcel that was added to the previous site. Amen isn't what some folks 
will be muttering, though. Far from it. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 13th is a 289-yard par-four, a slight dogleg-right to an elevated green 
carved from the side of a cliff. Because of the severe slope of the fairway, 
dozens of players spent time retrieving tee shots that rolled sideways into the 
15th fairway, which parallels the 13th. Kind of dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-inch figurine of an owl sits atop a wooden post behind the green. Who 
designed this thing? Who? 
</P>
<P>
 v "You can reach (the green off the tee), but you have to fly the ball about 
270 yards," Bode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 14th is an obnoxious little par three of 108 yards. The rock-hard green, 
approximately the size of a spilled Budweiser, again is sculpted from a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 The green, in fact, is a virtual island surrounded by thick, twisted 
shrubbery, rocks and relocated topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss the green and you're dead," Bode said. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. A sign posted by the green warns that rappelling down the hill in 
search of lost balls may carry the ultimate penalty -- rattlesnakes inhabit the 
area. How steep is the cliff around the green? A wooden railing had been placed 
behind the green to keep anybody from taking an involuntary header. This hole 
has everything but calliope music. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 15th hole, a 252-yard par four, is almost as funky. The fairway slopes 
steeply to the right, where a precipice again awaits the wayward banana ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The course finishes with three easy -- if mundane -- par threes, none longer 
than 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing startling there. In all, there are nine holes of 127 yards or fewer, 
which means anybody who can hit a wedge and make a putt will leave a trail of 
scorched earth in his or her wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorched earth, of course, is pretty much what Scholl was in its landfill 
incarnation. The course, demented or not, is a definite improvement.

NO HANDICAP FOR HER; KAREN NORRIS, NATION'S TOP FEMALE DISABLED SWIMMER, 
DISDAINS HEROICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karen Norris describes herself to someone scheduled to meet her for the first 
time at a swimming workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have strawberry blonde hair and I'll be wearing a Team USA jacket," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't occur to her that she may be easily identifiable because her left 
leg is amputated below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, 29, is the nation's best female disabled swimmer by several strokes, 
and in several strokes: breaststroke, backstroke, freestyle, individual medley 
-- all of them basically. The Van Nuys resident has won a gold medal at the 
Paralympics and last month won a gold at the World Amputee Games in Malta. 
</P>
<P>
 She cherishes her records, but spare her a medal for "courageously overcoming 
a handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do takes no courage in my book," she says, "other than overcoming the 
fact that people might stare at me because I have one leg. Getting out there 
doing the activity takes no courage." 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of Karen Norris is crystal clear in her mind. She is an athlete, 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days a week, she leaves work at a research and development company in Van 
Nuys and puts in two hours of training at Pierce College, often joining a youth 
club team called the Stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
 "She motivates my kids, tells them they haven't really worked out until they 
throw up," says Lloyd (Chooch) Petoscia, the Stingrays' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norris wants no mistake made about what motivates her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aggressive and competitive because I need to prove something," she 
says. "I happen to really enjoy being active, having my body work for me." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses, watching the Stingrays shiver and gingerly test the pool before 
diving in on a cold, windy December evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also enjoy knowing I can inspire people," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She might not agree, but Norris is inspirational in great part because of 
courage. Fortitude and determination also come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Few other words adequately describe an 11-year-old who lifts the sheet while 
being wheeled into the operating room and says, almost cheerily, "Goodby leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Few other words adequately describe a 15-year-old who removes a cosmetically 
pleasing prosthesis and prefers to maneuver around Calabasas High on crutches 
because "with crutches I can fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Few other words adequately describe a 27-year-old who takes up competitive 
swimming for the first time in 17 years and in six months finds herself in 
Barcelona for the 1992 Paralympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris had Olympic dreams as a child growing up in Mountain View, Calif. She 
was a top swimmer until contracting a rare form of nerve cancer in her leg that 
required the amputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried for one day, then I was fine," she says. "That's how I face any 
difficulty. I can't dwell on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors attached a prosthesis but said she would need to walk with one crutch 
for a year and with a cane for several years. Norris told her parents, "This is 
really absurd," and discarded the crutch after a day, the cane after a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemotherapy treatments lasted more than a year to ensure that all cancer 
cells were destroyed. Norris lost her hair, dropped 20 pounds and became 
extremely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13 she was well enough to try swimming again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was swimming against a ghost, comparing my times against the ones from when 
I had two legs," she says. "I got very discouraged and quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Her family moved to Agoura Hills and in high school she filled her need to 
compete athletically by taking up a new sport: skiing. She quickly became the 
best teen-ager on the Far West Disabled Ski Team, competing against adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that dampened her drive was marriage. After earning a degree at 
UCLA in mathematics, Norris married and "became a slug." She divorced four 
years ago and began skiing competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, she learned of the Paralympics from her skiing coach. After 
only 10 swimming workouts she won five gold medals at the Far West Regional 
Games in Cupertino, Calif., qualifying her for the National Summer Amputee 
Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she won eight gold medals, becoming the nation's top female disabled 
swimmer and qualifying for the Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
 At Barcelona, Norris won a gold medal in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay and a 
bronze in the 50 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Her improvement, at first dramatic, has continued in nearly every event. 
Norris dropped 15 seconds off her time in the 200 individual medley in the 
three months before the 1992 nationals and swam a personal best of 3:02.4. 
</P>
<P>
 That time has been whittled another 15 seconds to 2:47.4 over the past two 
years. At the World Games in Malta, she won a gold in the 100 backstroke, 
defeating the world-record holder, 17-year-old Sarah Bailey of Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's disability is the loss of fingers from one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously mine is a more severe disability, but I don't expect fairness when 
it comes to equating disabilities," Norris says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Athletic Paralympic Organizing Committee categorizes all disabilities into 
10 functional classifications. Missing a leg below the knee puts Norris in the 
least-disabled class along with people with relatively minor disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing a leg affects Norris' swimming in several fundamental ways. In 
freestyle and backstroke races, it is difficult for her to maintain her 
position in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think I'd just swim in circles," Norris says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides lacking the stability and balance of a two-legged swimmer, she also 
generates less propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to use more upper body in all my strokes (than an able-bodied 
swimmer)," she says. "I'm closest to able-bodied swimmers in longer distances 
because there is less kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest handicap Norris may face in her quest to win gold medals in the 
1996 Paralympics has nothing to do with her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 It is her age. Most swimmers peak in their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids I swim with don't ask, 'What's wrong with your leg?' They say, 'How 
old are you?' " she says. "But I am better now than ever. I am finally beating 
the times I had when I was 10 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement does not surprise Fred Shaw, the Pierce College swimming 
coach. He has watched Norris work out in his pool for two years, and he 
designed her workouts for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain or shine, middle of winter, 30 degrees, she's always here," he says. 
"When you see that, you know she's going places." 
</P>
<P>
 One destination looms large: Atlanta, site of the 1996 Paralympic Games, which 
will be held a few weeks after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 A short-term goal is to shave half a second off her time and become the 
world-record holder in the 100 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris spends leisure time rock climbing and in-line skating. But swimming, 
her first love, is also her latest. All those years spent out of the water have 
kept her desire to swim from drying up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love swimming so much now, I love being in the water," she says.

HARDY'S PLAN FOR COLISEUM WOULD HAVE CHANGED HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From 1973 to 1986, Jim Hardy was general manager of the Los Angeles Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 He talked recently of the current plight of the 71-year-old facility, still 
undergoing repairs from last January's earthquake.Recently, one estimate pegged 
the repair bill at $92.7 million and climbing.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to me, what's happening to the Coliseum," he said. "It's a classic 
case of throwing good money after bad.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 20 years ago, I drew up a plan for taking the Coliseum private and 
turning it into a state-of-the-art facility. Carroll Rosenbloom (the Rams' 
owner, who died in 1979) loved it. He was willing to finance it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have done the Coliseum over, retained the peristyle, put in suites, 
for around $50 million. But it never got past the Coliseum commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had happened, the Rams never would have gone to Anaheim and UCLA never 
would have gone to the Rose Bowl. The Coliseum would be an up-to-date stadium 
today, and the Raiders never would have come to L.A."

KANSAS STATE, BOSTON COLLEGE SAY ALOHA ON CHRISTMAS DAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a week of adjusting to the time change and humidity, 11th-ranked Kansas 
State (9-2) and Boston College (6-4-1) are ready for the Aloha Bowl today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, we have to be prepared to protect the quarterback (Chad May) 
against Boston College's blitz and pressure package and we'll have to establish 
a balance between running and throwing," Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "On defense, we'll have to be well-prepared for the run and watch for 
play-action passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dan Henning said Boston College initially had difficulty adjusting to 
the humidity. He also noted that the players set up a time-management program 
that kept their focus on the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to deal with the humidity because we hadn't had to deal with it for 2 
1/2 months," he said. "They've made the adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
 All-American tight end Pete Mitchell acknowledge that the Eagles weren't 
concentrating properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first practice wasn't one of our better ones," he said. "But that was to 
be expected. As far as the game goes, we're well-prepared."

ISRAELIS KILL 1 LEBANESE, HURT 4 OTHERS, SOURCES SAY

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Lebanese bird hunter and wounded four 
others in Israeli-held southern Lebanon on Saturday, apparently mistaking them 
for guerrillas, security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli spotted the five men armed with hunting rifles in woods near the 
southeastern town of Hasbayya and opened fire with automatic weapons, the 
sources said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources in Marjayoun said the Israelis must have mistook the hunters for 
Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that a Lebanese civilian was killed 
and three injured. It said soldiers fired on "suspicious figures in a 
prohibited area." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army frequently shoot at 
civilians who wander in the fields of southern Lebanon without clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis and their Lebanese allies have been particularly edgy following 
heavy clashes with Muslim guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack 
that touched off daylong battles. Sporadic exchanges were reported Saturday.

COLUMN ONE; TIDE TURNS ON MIGHTY TOKYO ELITE; JAPAN'S ONCE-REVERED ARMY OF 
BUREAUCRATS HELPED MAKE THE NATION RICH. BUT NOW, CRITICS SAY, THE GRAY SUITS 
MUST STEP ASIDE AND LET THE ELECTED OFFICIALS BRING BADLY NEEDED REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He holds the hands of Japan's top leaders, manages conflict among warring 
bureaucrats and, in a pinch, delivers decisions on major policies: Nobuo 
Ishihara is little known abroad. But here he is called the shadow prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 A quintessential government blueblood, Ishihara is a Tokyo University graduate 
who excelled in finance, made powerful friends and scaled the ministry ranks. 
Now, having served as top aide to seven prime ministers, the deputy chief 
Cabinet secretary has quietly played critical roles in everything from the Gulf 
War crisis to U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1993, officials here were deadlocked over American demands that 
Japan open its construction market. With time running out, Ishihara called the 
top construction bureaucrat into his office and told him flatly of the proposed 
solution: "You have to accept this." 
</P>
<P>
 In such ways, Ishihara -- and the unelected, ultimately unaccountable 
bureaucrats he represents -- make vital decisions for Japan behind closed 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 These civil servants make up what may be the world's mightiest bureaucracy: 
838,000 people in 19 national agencies, some of Japan's most brilliant minds 
and powerful ambitions cloaked in the gray suits and bland speech of government 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureaucrats have steadied Japan through 18 months of uproar -- four prime 
ministers, the shattering of the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year rule and a 
perplexing number of new party alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a century, they have largely decided Japan's direction, 
scripting policies as feudal lords once did for puppet emperors. Indeed, in a 
nod to their elite training and lofty tradition, they once were called okami , 
"the honorable above." 
</P>
<P>
 But now the fabled okami are falling from grace. The mandarins of Japan's 
economic miracle are under fire for sabotaging the nation's future. In a debate 
that cuts to the core of just who will steer Japan, more and more critics 
insist that the bureaucrats must loosen their grip and let elected officials 
usher in badly needed change. 
</P>
<P>
 In a startling outbreak of bureaucrat-bashing, bookstores are filled with 
works such as "The Finance Ministry Dictatorship" and "The Island of 
Bureaucratic Control: Japan in Danger." The respected financial journal Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun, the NHK television network and other media have devoted 
extensive series to the evils of bureaucratic rule, while the issue has become 
a leading target for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The chorus of voices carry a singular message: The bureaucratic blueprint that 
has driven Japan for 50 years -- the relentless expansion of its industrial, 
productive strength -- risks impoverishing the Japanese people and inviting the 
enmity of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureaucrats' work is credited with helping to make Japan rich. But, 
critics say, the focus on economic expansion has also led to a stubborn trade 
surplus that is alienating other nations and boosting the yen to stratospheric 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to compete under a pricey currency, more firms are fleeing to 
lower-cost countries, taking jobs and critical manufacturing capacity with 
them. That, in turn, is fueling fears that Japan is "hollowing out," retaining 
weak industries at home and losing its competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureaucrats' power base -- a bewildering maze of 11,000 official 
regulations -- also has helped make prices here the highest in the world. Their 
turf battles are thwarting development of leading technologies. Japan's 
information highway is still a dirt road, for instance, because ministry wars 
are impeding the nation's progress in wiring itself with the fiber-optic cables 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a world that until now tolerated Japan's system is making 
noisy demands for change. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States put up with Japan's export juggernaut and its sheltered 
markets in consideration of its Cold War alliance. But Americans are more 
vigorously defending their economic interests. Japan is also being pressed to 
leave the comfort of its political cocoon and to tackle world problems more 
actively. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet rapidly changing circumstances, nothing short of a radical reordering 
in how Japan governs itself is needed, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we tried to achieve economic success putting ideology aside, and 
under those circumstances, I think bureaucrats were much more important than 
politicians," said Koichi Kato, head of the Liberal Democrats' policy research 
council, who has coordinated issues with the Socialists and the New Party 
Harbinger since they jointly took power in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, we need a new vision of what to cultivate for society, and that, by 
definition, cannot come from bureaucrats," Kato said. "So it is time for 
politicians, not bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Many bureaucrats -- most of whom would only speak anonymously -- agree that 
Japan desperately needs a new direction. But they say most politicians are 
incapable of providing it because they are too ill-informed on the issues, 
consumed with reelection and busy taking care of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why bureaucrats end up writing most legislation and why some of 
Japan's intelligentsia shudder at the thought of entrusting the nation's 
direction to elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politicians don't have the know-how -- the information and experience -- 
to govern Japan as a whole," said Kojiro Shiraishi, a Yomiuri Shimbun editorial 
writer. "I know bureaucrat-bashing is rampant in Japan. But the question is, 
Who should take the initiative in changing the system dominated by bureaucrats? 
The politicians should, but they are not able to." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite widespread public complaints -- one newspaper poll this year 
showed more people view bureaucrats as snooty, irresponsible and cunning than 
as excellent -- requests for protectionist red tape come from the public 
itself: Officials tell endless tales of local pleas for help with everything 
from cheap Chinese lacquerware to discount beer to new propane gas dealers.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the interlocking interests of bureaucrats, politicians and business 
are so entrenched that the relationship is known as the "Iron Triangle." 
Business implores bureaucrats to use their regulatory power to protect markets 
and rewards them with cushy post-retirement jobs. Politicians serve as 
mediators between bureaucrats and their business constituents, usually 
receiving political contributions for their trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the entangled interests, merely disarming bureaucrats won't in 
itself open Japan's markets or nudge it down a new national path. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire system must begin to change -- a process that will take at least 10 
years and heavy foreign pressure, says Tomoaki Iwai, a Tokiwa University 
political science professor. And, he says, "No one wants to give up their 
vested interests -- not the politicians, bureaucrats or people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of Japan's political culture -- and how difficult it will be to 
reorder the institutional roles played -- was aptly illustrated by the 
phenomenon of Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and handsome, Hosokawa boasted an aristocratic bloodline and talked of 
bringing politics back to the people. He electrified the apathetic public and 
was anointed prime minister last year to lead the first government not headed 
by the Liberal Democratic Party in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed then to end corruption, break open Japan's markets, slash red tape, 
face the nation's war history and bring greater benefits to a people still 
saddled with cramped homes, high prices and hellish commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, Hosokawa is history -- beaten down by the status quo he pledged to 
smash, dominated by the bureaucrats he declared he would tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese media reports portray a man out of his league who lacked the policy 
knowledge and personal connections within government to push a coherent agenda. 
He could barely keep up with the blizzard of briefings on everything from North 
Korea to U.S. trade talks. His most common response to bureaucrats was a 
plaintive "So what shall I do?" according to stories leaked by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even politicians with policy knowledge say they too buckled under the 
bureaucracy's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshio Terasawa, a financial expert, left the World Bank to join Hosokawa's 
now-defunct Japan New Party and was elected to the upper house of Parliament 
last year. In April, he was tapped to head the Economic Planning Agency under 
the second coalition government of then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 Terasawa came in hoping to invigorate Japan's moribund economy. But meetings 
from 8 a.m. until past midnight left him with no time to think on his own.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he says, he had to swallow information fed him in daily briefings by 
a team of bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 His own assertions were dismissed. Agency apparatchiks had projected a 2.4% 
economic growth rate; Terasawa found that ridiculous. But when he protested 
that every private estimate projected less than 1% growth, he was told never to 
say that in public because it would force the government to recalculate the 
entire national budget, which was based on the higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 He complied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very much like a puppet," he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such experiences illustrate some of the bureaucracy's greatest advantages -- 
its access to information and sheer intellectual talent. 
</P>
<P>
 It has long been so. Japan's modern bureaucracy traces its roots to the 
samurai who went to serve the emperor after the Meiji Revolution ended the 
shogunate in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
 When Japan ended three centuries of isolation in the late 19th Century, the 
bureaucrats rapidly introduced Western modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 And after World War II, when they dreamed up the policies that led the 
shattered nation to economic supremacy, the legend of their invincibility grew. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps still draws Japan's elite: graduates from the most prestigious 
universities who have out-competed thousands of others in civil service exams. 
The top-ranked recruits are overwhelmingly male and dominated by Tokyo 
University; 11 of the nation's top 12 ministry chiefs are Tokyo graduates, 
forming an academic clique akin to Harvard alumni running every top department 
of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 287 people who passed the highest of three civil service exam levels in 
1994, 90% were male. Tokyo University graduates made up 90.5% of new recruits 
for the powerful Finance Ministry, 78% for the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry, and 51% overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureaucrats often work until early morning in voluntary overtime, squeezed 
cheek by jowl with colleagues in cluttered offices. Their desks overflow with 
paper; cigarette smoke often hangs in the air. The setting is surprisingly 
low-tech; there are few computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucrats pledge lifelong loyalty to one ministry. Although sometimes lent 
to other agencies, they never make a permanent jump. Only when they are 
bypassed for promotion do they find jobs in private industry -- often one they 
regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 This practice is known as amakudari , or "descent from heaven." It is 
routinely criticized as a conflict of interest, but little has been done to 
stop it, since it serves as a practical way to cycle out aging bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Amakudari , though, also provides a way to spread bureaucrats' influence 
throughout Japanese society. Top officials of many private firms and nearly 
half the executives of special public corporations are retired bureaucrats; so 
are an estimated one-third of Liberal Democratic Party politicians. Wherever 
they land, they continue to nurture ties to their former ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such loyalty provides the foundation for Japan's vaunted institutional 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 After 35 years of service, Yuji Tanahashi reached the position of vice 
minister of international trade before retiring in 1993. He can rattle off a 
history of negotiations with the United States from firsthand experience: 
tensions over cameras and watches in the 1960s, color TVs in the 1970s and 
semiconductors and cars in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 He also boasts extensive knowledge of the Japanese economy, having helped 
execute the plan that rebuilt the nation, first with steel and other heavy 
industries, then with consumer electronics and now with information processing. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of experience is often cited to explain why Japanese trade officials 
arguably out-negotiate their American counterparts, who often change with each 
new Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 To complete their elite course, Japan's career-track bureaucrats rotate posts 
every few years to gain exposure to different fields -- and to prevent such 
overly cozy ties with industry as those that produced scandals involving 
construction and telecommunications officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Midori Tani, for instance, is a fast-track career officer in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. One of only two female directors in MITI, she 
has worked in divisions covering energy, technology and small and medium-sized 
business; she labored 30 hours straight analyzing the oil market during the 
Gulf War crisis and last year was tapped to author MITI's annual policy paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Her paper was widely picked up in the media for its emphasis on Japan's need 
to deregulate and improve its investment climate -- a conclusion she reached 
after months of research, interviews with business executives and trips to 
factories both in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with fluent English and an aggressive intellect, Tani, 39, says she 
enjoys sharp policy debate "to stir up my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say that bureaucrats fight each other thinking only of their own 
interests, but I disagree," she said. "In order to foster critical thinking, 
you need someone to disagree with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all bureaucrats, of course, exhibit such high energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Masao Miyamoto, a Health Ministry official, says many bureaucrats while away 
the day reading newspapers, writing vague answers to parliamentary committee 
questions and "free-talking" in meetings that lead nowhere. He describes petty 
office politics in which colleagues pick on those who question the status quo 
or who refuse to sacrifice their personal lives for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureaucracy's overall talent, however, enables it to function as the 
nation's brain -- and the role is unchallenged because Japan lacks competing 
institutions such as strong academic think tanks or policy-making staff in the 
Parliament or the prime minister's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not only politicians but also journalists and the public advisory councils all 
depend on ministries for information. The Finance Ministry is Japan's most 
dominant, in part, because of its budget authority, which makes it the nation's 
sole repository of information from every other agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And bureaucrats hoard their information like jewels and surrender it sparingly 
and strategically. One trade official said they accommodate requests from 
ruling party leaders with reams of information personally delivered by top 
bureaucrats; Communist Party requests, in contrast, are handled with a page or 
two of notes sent by messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bureaucrats are hardly all-powerful. Analysts say that Liberal 
Democratic leaders, boasting more experience and connections than the Hosokawa 
government, are gaining greater political control. 
</P>
<P>
 And politicians still hold the trump card -- the right to pass laws that 
bureaucrats propose -- which they use to haggle for such benefits as new public 
works projects or increased farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bureaucratic genius, analysts say, lies in the bureaucrats' consummate 
skill in knowing whom to approach and how to win support. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiro Saito is said to be the most powerful person in the most powerful 
ministry in Japan: vice minister of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of the nation's polished top bureaucrats, Saito, 58, is neither 
articulate nor particularly social -- he is said to decline most party 
invitations and buries himself in work and the game of go. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is regarded as the Finance Ministry's budget brain extraordinaire, and 
defending the integrity of the national spending plan is said to be his single, 
overriding goal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to media reports, Saito and his ministry allies hatched February's 
notorious proposal to increase the 3% consumption tax to 7%. To push the plan 
through, he targeted Ichiro Ozawa, the Hosokawa government's strategic 
mastermind, as a key ally. The two secretly persuaded Hosokawa to announce the 
plan at a 1 a.m. news conference -- a disastrous move that sparked a public 
outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saito did not give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Socialists and New Party Harbinger, which opposed the tax hike, 
formed the present government with the Liberal Democrats in June, Saito simply 
plotted around his critics. He bypassed Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, 
who advocated cutting government fat first. Instead, he appealed directly to 
Noboru Takeshita, the influential Liberal Democratic lawmaker who, as prime 
minister, pushed through the original consumption tax in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme worked. A 5% tax increase was approved last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "You Finance Ministry guys are skillful, aren't you?" a defeated Takemura was 
quoted as saying to Saito. (Saito declined an interview request.) 
</P>
<P>
 Critics point to the consumption-tax coup as evidence of how bureaucrats 
dominate Japan, arguably at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
 They have, for instance, basically thumbed their nose at orders to streamline 
the government under Prime Minister Tomoiichi Murayama's administrative reform. 
Asked to cut the 92 special public corporations -- basically employment havens 
for retired bureaucrats whose tasks range from stabilizing silk prices to 
promoting bicycles -- the ministries gave their response last month: Not one 
was dispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to cut red tape is also lagging. Among more than 1,100 
regulations proposed for elimination by business leaders and others, ministries 
have already rescued 91 as necessary or needing "further study"; bureaucrats 
are likely to defend more. 
</P>
<P>
 While deregulation may benefit the bold, it shakes up the interests that keep 
prices uniformly high. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most damaging examples of how bureaucrats protect their own 
interests at public expense, critics say, is multimedia development. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has barely begun to lay the network of fiber-optic cables needed to 
carry the huge volume of data used in information processing. The reasons: turf 
wars among ministries and a 30-year-old law that does not explicitly allow such 
cables in the underground tunnels that carry water, telephone, electricity and 
gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than simply changing the law to accommodate cable, the ministries are 
thinking about burrowing a vast new network of tunnels. That plan is enormously 
more expensive and will take years to complete. But engineering a budget 
increase -- which amounts to expanded power -- is the name of the bureaucratic 
game, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, MITI is warring with the Telecommunications Ministry over the 
overall strategy, arguing that software development -- its turf -- should take 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics fear that such bureaucratic battles are sabotaging Japan's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing the gathering crisis, some MITI officials have begun trying to take 
the lead in opening markets and cutting through the regulatory jungle. But each 
attempt to deregulate runs afoul of other ministry fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to get beyond this wall, we need political leadership," one MITI 
official said in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are questions as to whether Japan's politicians can provide it. 
</P>

MEXICO OKS KEY REBEL DEMAND; LATIN AMERICA: PRESIDENT ZEDILLO AGREES TO ACCEPT 
THE PANEL HEADED BY CONTROVERSIAL BISHOP AS MEDIATOR. FASTING CLERIC HAILS MOVE 
AS A 'STAR OF PEACE' ON CHIAPAS HORIZON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a Christmas Eve announcement that analysts called a potential breakthrough 
toward a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Chiapas, President Ernesto 
Zedillo's government made a major concession Saturday to the rebels in Mexico's 
southernmost state, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's Cabinet said it would accept a commission headed by a controversial 
Roman Catholic bishop, Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas, to be the 
official mediator between the government and the rebels.  
</P>
<P>
 Designating the National Intermediation Commission as chief negotiator was 
among the key demands of Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos when he launched 
a renewed insurrection against the government last week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mexican army and the armed Indian insurgents at a standoff in the 
jungles of Chiapas, the uprising has wreaked havoc on the Mexican economy and 
spread uncertainty nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction to the announcement from Marcos, who remains 
in the rebels' remote stronghold within a rain forest near the Guatemalan 
border. But Ruiz, a rebel sympathizer who has been on a hunger strike since the 
Zapatistas' second major mobilization began seven days ago, underscored the 
importance of the government's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The star of peace has appeared on the horizon in Chiapas," the tired and 
weakened 70-year-old declared as he met with a key deputy of Zedillo's interior 
secretariat at his cathedral Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting with Deputy Secretary Beatriz Peredes was Chiapas 
opposition leader Amado Avendano, a former gubernatorial candidate who heads a 
parallel, self-declared "Government in Rebellion" in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear after the meeting whether Ruiz himself would be permitted 
to negotiate or whether his ecumenical commission would designate another 
member to attempt to renew contacts with the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to reporters before the Saturday meeting, though, the bishop seemed to 
indicate that recognizing his commission as mediator was breakthrough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot hide the happiness that we have for this news of the day," he said. 
"I assume we would be able to re-establish contact immediately with both 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial decision by Interior Secretary Esteban Moctezuma Barragan late 
Friday night to accept Ruiz's commission as chief negotiator with the 
Zapatistas was not likely to have been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishop is seen by many as a Zapatista partisan. He has expressed support 
for the rebels' demands but condemned their use of violence after they launched 
a New Year's Day shooting war with the Mexican army to support their demand for 
equal treatment for indigenous Mexicans, constitutional and democratic reforms, 
and an end to rule by the rich. At least 145 people died in 12 days of fighting 
nearly a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Zapatista fighters remobilized during a one-day insurrection in the 
northern part of the state last Monday, they rekindled fears of more violence 
to come. Those fears triggered an economic panic that ultimately led the 
government to take the drastic measure of devaluing the peso by more than 20% 
in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly conceding for the first time that the Mexican nation is in political 
and economic crisis, Zedillo indicated to reporters Friday that all sectors of 
Mexican society need to make deep concessions to defuse the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day, the state interior secretary of Chiapas, Eraclio Zepeda Ramos, 
conceded, "The danger of war is present (in the state)." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living through a crisis, and we must accept it as such," the president 
said during a brief chat with the press in Mexico City just 23 days into his 
six-year term. "The year 1995 will be a very complicated one. We must aim to 
try to overcome this economic and political crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the president has stood fast behind a unilateral cease-fire with the 
rebels and a commitment to negotiate with them, he had proposed a seven-member 
legislative peace commission to resolve the conflict. The commission included 
five opposition members, but not Ruiz or his commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to federal legislators Thursday night, Zedillo appeared to back off 
from his original proposal. He told a congressional committee that either 
Interior Secretary Moctezuma, one of his most trusted aides and a young, 
progressive member of his Cabinet, or one of Moctezuma's deputies, would 
represent the government in any peace talks with the rebel leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos, who declared an end to the 11-month truce with the army after Chiapas' 
ruling party governor, Eduardo Robledo Rincon, was inaugurated amid allegations 
of election fraud on Dec. 1, flatly rejected Zedillo's proposed commission a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a jungle press conference called to announce the Zapatista mobilization 
early Monday morning, Marcos issued two key demands for reopening peace talks. 
The first was that Bishop Ruiz mediate in the talks. The second was that 
Robledo resign, which the governor has promised to do if the Zapatistas lay 
down their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 There was widespread speculation in Chiapas on Saturday after Deputy Secretary 
Peredes met with Ruiz and Avendano, Robledo's chief opponent in last August's 
gubernatorial election, that the government was considering addressing the 
rebels' second demand as well. But Peredes, who emerged from the meeting with a 
broad smile, gave no other indication of the meeting's outcome.

U.S. APOLOGIZES TO N. KOREA FOR COPTER INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The United States has sent a letter to North Korea expressing regret for 
violating its airspace eight days ago when a U.S. Army helicopter mistakenly 
crossed into the Communist nation's territory and was shot down, U.S. officials 
here and in Washington said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials were optimistic that the letter would ease the way for 
North Korea to release the helicopter's surviving pilot, Chief Warrant Officer 
Bobby Hall. Pyongyang had demanded an apology, and U.S. officials said the 
letter would help the nation save face and make it politically easier to 
release the soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sitting on our hands. We're hopeful he'll be back during daylight time 
tomorrow," a Pentagon official said Saturday. But Hall remained in the hands of 
the North Korean People's Army as Christmas morning arrived in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter uses the word regret , the official said. It "attributed the flight 
(over North Korean territory) to navigation error." 
</P>
<P>
 "It does convey assurances the U.N. command is taking steps to prevent a 
recurrence," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops in South Korea are officially under the command of the United 
Nations, as they have been since the start of the Korean War more than 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was written by Gen. Gary E. Luck, supreme commander of the 37,000 
U.S. troops in South Korea, and was reviewed by Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry and other senior Clinton Administration officials, a senior Pentagon 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, meanwhile, said Saturday in his weekly radio address that 
he was "hopeful" that Hall "will soon be back with his family." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has said that Hall is in good condition, but there has been no 
outside contact with him. He and his co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David 
Hilemon, were shot down when their unarmed OH-58 helicopter, on a rainy flight, 
strayed over North Korean territory Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilemon died in the crash. After several days of negotiations by Rep. Bill 
Richardson (D-N.M.), who happened to be visiting Pyongyang, his body was turned 
over to U.S. soldiers Thursday in a brief ceremony at the truce village of 
Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our thoughts -- Hillary's and mine, and I know all of America's -- are with 
the family of Chief Warrant Officer Hilemon. . . . We are pleased that his 
remains have been returned to his family," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President expressed hope that Hall, 28, would be returned quickly, 
and other aides said they had what one said was "a pretty good idea" of what 
North Korea wanted, one senior Pentagon official indicated that the U.S. 
government was uncertain whether the North Korean military and other government 
officials there were acting in concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't know is if everybody in North Korea wants the same thing, and 
if a letter for one constituency serves another constituency," said the 
Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the first time in 17 years that a U.S. aircraft has been 
shot down over North Korea, and U.S. officials have anxiously tried to make 
contact with their counterparts from Pyongyang "wherever we can find them," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government officials have apparently been stymied not only by the 
secretive manner in which the North Koreans operate but by their failure to 
make clear just what steps could have resolved the dispute quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 Expressing this frustration, the official said: "If we knew exactly what was 
required, we'd have done it some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the three-paragraph letter was prepared for delivery to the 
supreme command of the North Korean army and that he was "99% sure it was 
delivered." A White House official said he believed the letter was to have been 
delivered Saturday, at a meeting between U.S. and North Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said the United States was giving information to North Korea that 
would allow the North Koreans "to save face, say they have all the information 
relating to the accident, be convinced that it was not an intelligence 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said the letter attributed the helicopter's route to a map-reading 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the letter prompted considerable confusion, both here and 
in Washington, where offices generally were empty as Christmas approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials pointed out that the letter says no more than Perry had said twice 
in the previous week, once when he expressed regrets and again when he said the 
intrusion over North Korea had been a "mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials were uncertain what steps would follow and when the two 
sides would meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with negotiations over Hall's fate said to be at a critical and delicate 
stage, officials here adopted a low-key tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the most optimistic scenario, and one that was not being ruled out, it 
was possible that U.S. and North Korean generals might schedule a meeting early 
today at Panmunjom and agree on releasing Hall in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That would bring an end to a week of tension that has threatened to jeopardize 
the new, more cordial relationship taking hold between Washington and Pyongyang 
and, in particular, to derail a recently concluded nuclear pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement reached in October, North Korea pledged eventually to 
dismantle its nuclear weapons program, while the United States promised to 
arrange for two alternative nuclear reactors that will provide energy and to 
begin the process of normalizing relations.

DELAYS, LACK OF FOCUS DOGGED L.A.'S GRANT BID; AID: PLAN FOR FEDERAL FUNDS WAS 
LONG ON PHILOSOPHY, SHORT ON SPECIFICS, MEMOS SHOW. COMPLACENCY IS ALSO CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The signs of trouble were there from the very start as the first drafts of Los 
Angeles' bid for the largest federal urban renewal program in decades began 
circulating around City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 One internal memo written by a project consultant complained about a lack of 
clarity and an abundance of "buzz words." 
</P>
<P>
 Another unsigned critique in the city files warned: "Plan has no focus. . . . 
There is still no real strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Months and many revisions later, Clinton Administration officials said they 
reached much the same conclusion about the two-inch-thick tome, dubbed 
"Building Together From the Ground Up," seeking the empowerment zone 
designation, which would have been worth $300 million to $600 million per year. 
It was simply too vague and failed to explain how private businesses, the state 
and local agencies would work together to produce tangible improvements in 
impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, federal officials insisted last week, they had little choice but 
to pass over Los Angeles in an intense competition for six so-called 
empowerment zones -- coveted programs designed to pump millions of dollars in 
federal aid and business tax breaks into designated communities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a particularly stunning loss for Los Angeles, because the empowerment 
zones were approved by Washington largely as a response to the city's 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had everything going for us," said a perplexed Zev Yaroslavsky, the former 
Los Angeles councilman recently elected to the County Board of Supervisors. 
"Somewhere, we gave up the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton sought to soften the blow with a sizable concession prize of 
federal aid -- and a promise to ask Congress to extend full empowerment zone 
benefits to Los Angeles. And Mayor Richard Riordan fumed that Washington's bias 
for Eastern cities sabotaged the city's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But through the public relations posturing, the harsh fact remained: Los 
Angeles, widely viewed as a sure bet, had failed to win a sorely needed 
infusion of business development incentives and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Los Angeles) really has to take responsibility for its own ineptness," said 
one federal official knowledgeable about the decision to exclude the city. 
"L.A. was the sentimental favorite, (but) they didn't put together a good 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 As the critical internal City Hall memos suggest, Los Angeles' pursuit of an 
empowerment zone was more troubled than most officials imagined, or at least 
publicly acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, records and interviews indicate that Los Angeles' effort was hobbled 
by a number of problems: overconfidence among officials here and in Washington; 
time-consuming turf battles over the program's spoils; scattered and shifting 
City Hall leadership on the project and just plain terrible timing -- the 
Northridge earthquake hit just as the application period opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who heads a committee that worked on the city's 
bid, complained that federal officials had assured Los Angeles it was virtually 
a certain winner. "They said that as long as our name was on a paper we would 
get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, several officials said privately, Los Angeles erred in believing 
that it was a shoo-in, and that heavy lobbying and the bid document were not 
crucial. "We thought we were in the arms of everybody," said one city 
representative involved in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The complacency extended to Washington, congressional sources said. 
California's delegation failed to mount a coordinated effort in support of the 
city's application, according to representatives and staffers on Capitol Hill. 
"Everybody thought it was a slam-dunk," said a top aide to a veteran California 
lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a key tactical error because the city was at a disadvantage in several 
critical ways, congressional sources said. Limitations in the empowerment zone 
law made it virtually impossible to grant all three of the nation's largest 
cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- the full program benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And two of the leading champions of empowerment zones in Congress were key 
Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee -- Chicago Rep. Dan Rostenkowski and 
New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nobody who stood out on the right committees," said a Washington 
source familiar with Los Angeles' effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Others speculated that the Clinton Administration, in the aftermath of massive 
earthquake aid, may have felt that it had already given Los Angeles enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much politics may have influenced the selections is difficult to 
judge, at least based on the Clinton Administration summaries of the competing 
proposals that won zone programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many showed similar philosophies. Like Los Angeles, Chicago said its two most 
important goals were "alleviating poverty" and "reinventing government." Greg 
Longhini, a Chicago spokesman, said his city's bid -- very much like Los 
Angeles' -- avoided commitments to specific revitalization projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the proposal included letters from businesses indicating that 1,500 
new employees could be hired in the zones quickly under the federal tax 
credits, Longhini acknowledged that the jobs were far from assured. "They're 
basically letters of good intent (from) businesses that hopefully would take 
advantage" of the program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some winners -- notably Detroit, Baltimore and Atlanta -- appeared to offer 
more specific plans. And both Chicago and New York -- Los Angeles' principal 
competitors -- said they could tap more private sector money than Los Angeles. 
Chicago said private industry -- mostly banks -- had pledged to make a 
$1-billion investment in the zone, mainly to finance affordable housing. New 
York pegged its private sector commitment at $550 million, compared to Los 
Angeles' $110 million, much of it outlined in a hastily assembled postscript to 
the application. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities chosen as empowerment zones will receive as much as $375 million in 
social services grants and tax breaks for businesses over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials insist that the decisions were made on the merits, and on 
clear evidence of private sector and state and local government support. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing and Urban Development spokeswoman Janice Cump said the winners showed 
"an extraordinary ability to bring together people who would normally not sit a 
the table together" to revitalize a neighborhood. She said HUD Secretary Henry 
G. Cisneros was most impressed with Detroit's application and the commitment by 
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors to create jobs for residents within the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was truly extraordinary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials said Los Angeles' proposal lacked these kinds of commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Hernandez do not agree that Los Angeles' bid was inadequate. But 
the proposal clearly was delayed and plagued by problems from its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the application period opened in January, and 77 other cities were 
assembling teams to write their bids, Los Angeles City Hall was plunged into 
chaos by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake -- the most costly natural disaster 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at where we were last spring," said Noelia Rodriguez, the 
mayor's press secretary. "Our plate was very full." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period, Riordan's economic development unit was navigating a 
difficult period of transition, noted one Community Development Department 
official close to the project. Former Deputy Mayor Al Villalobos had resigned 
in late 1993 amid questions about his private business practices. Mayoral 
adviser Bill Ouchi, who was juggling major budget and police reform 
initiatives, oversaw the office for several months until a replacement for 
Villalobos, Mary Leslie, was hired in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating the confusion was the city's Byzantine economic development 
apparatus, which spans several agencies. Robin Kramer, the mayor's community 
relations chief, said the city's proposal was handicapped because other large 
cities "have long-standing economic development departments, and we're still 
trying to create one." 
</P>
<P>
 When attention finally turned to the empowerment zone project, political 
infighting flared over which neighborhoods, community groups and council 
districts would be included in the targeted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 10 times as much of the city was eligible for the aid as could be 
included in the 20-square-mile zone limit. Community leaders from some of the 
city's neediest neighborhoods jockeyed for inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, a battle erupted over a proposal to include a section of Pacoima, in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley. Some city officials wanted the zone to 
extend into more of the Eastside and toward San Pedro. "Our initial perspective 
was it didn't include enough of the South-Central area that was impacted by the 
last 20 years (of poverty). Why wasn't that a bigger part of this?" said Howard 
Gantman, an aide to South-Central Los Angeles Councilwoman Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima, rallied support from 
fellow Valley representatives, Councilman Joel Wachs and then-Councilman 
Yaroslavsky, as well as Rep. U.S. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). The battle 
continued right up to days before the application deadline, as a final few 
census tracts were added to the zone in the Pico Union area of Hernandez's 
district, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, city officials devoted far more time to setting the boundaries of 
the zone -- covering segments of Pacoima, South-Central Los Angeles and the 
Eastside -- than to deciding how to use the federal dollars to improve the 
areas included. The City Council approved the zone map April 13, and a private 
consulting firm -- Hamilton, Rabinovitz and Alschuler Inc., hired at a cost of 
$220,000 -- went to work preparing the complex document with just 2 1/2 months 
to the submission deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The application, consisting of several hundred pages, was compiled by a 
committee including the consulting firm, a subcontractor, a group of 60 
nonprofit groups called the Coalition of Neighborhood Developers, and 
representatives of various municipal and county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting document was long on philosophy and short on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, there was no indication of how the $100 million in federal social 
services money would be spent. Rather, the application seemed to say to the 
Clinton Administration: Trust us. We know what we're doing. We have a lot of 
community people working with us. With more federal money, we can do a better 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say it was an honest effort, recognizing that effective 
anti-poverty programs take time to develop. They also hoped to sidestep more 
potentially divisive political clashes over where the federal dollars would go. 
"A lot of people didn't want to be specific because they wanted to fight over 
the money later," said Gantman. 
</P>
<P>
 But that appeared to be precisely the wrong message. When Clinton announced 
the empowerment zone program, he stressed that many previous programs have not 
worked and he wanted to "focus the limited amount of money we have (to) get a 
tremendous amount of concentrated effort." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration source said Los Angeles' approach was simply too uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is our last chance to show people that you can revitalize an urban 
area," the official said. "People do not believe that any of these programs . . 
. actually work. If you don't know what the city intends to do with money, it's 
very difficult to evaluate how it's going to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the final days before the June 30 application deadline, after being 
prodded by HUD officials, did the city offer more details. Officials pledged 
that $10 million would be spent in the first year and a half to build at least 
three unspecified community facilities and two unidentified social programs for 
youth. They also pledged to spend $15 million to create jobs and to use $5 
million to expand programs to eradicate eyesores such as crack houses and 
abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The application said the funds would be doubled by tapping into other public 
and private sources, though it left unclear how that could be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials said they were still not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this month, as they reduced the field of competing cities to a few 
finalists, they notified Los Angeles officials that their application was not 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call with city officials, HUD executive Roy Priest stressed 
that other cities had secured large matching grants from their states. 
California not only had pledged no funds, but was threatening to levy a 5% fee 
for its role in the program. Priest warned that this was a "deal killer," 
records show.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials scrambled through the weekend to get the state to waive the fee 
and to shore up details about how social funds would be spent and how private 
firms would support the project. So intense and chaotic was the after-hours 
effort that some city staffers later had to hunt down their cars, which had 
been towed away for being illegally parked. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just days before the empowerment zones selection would be made, Los 
Angeles officials were filing pages of last-ditch memos and supplements 
outlining for the first time how they would use $15 million of the social 
services money, and clearly itemizing commitments from public and private 
sector sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the city's documentation about the private sector concerned the 
still-budding efforts of RLA, the private, nonprofit riot recovery agency 
formerly known as Rebuild L.A., to stimulate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised that was a weakness, given that we are not lacking 
in private sector commitments. It's just a matter of putting it together," said 
RLA President Linda Griego, who was drafted into the last-minute effort to beef 
up evidence of business support. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also cited about $45 million in commitments from various banks to 
loan money to entrepreneurs, mainly in South-Central Los Angeles, a $60-million 
commitment from the AFL-CIO pension fund to invest in riot-torn areas, and 
plans of 23 businesses to invest or expand in the empowerment zone. The city 
said these businesses would create about 3,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to HUD's summary of the Los Angeles application, the city also said 
it had committed $460 million for capital improvements such as police stations, 
libraries and recreational facilities in the zone; the Community Redevelopment 
Agency had pledged $91 million; the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had 
pledged $2 million for a cultural "academy" at a future subway stop, and the 
city and county had promised nearly $2 billion for health services, housing and 
other social services.  
</P>
<P>
 The President's offer of a $350-million consolation package falls short of the 
original empowerment zone designation, which would have been worth $300 million 
to $600 million per year to Los Angeles, according to Riordan, who said the 
loss "cannot be shrugged off as a minor setback." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego suspects that some of the crucial information may have simply landed 
too late to change the Clinton Administration's thinking. "People thought L.A. 
was going to get it. If you start with that, I think your work product is going 
to be kind of geared to a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 But she, like many others, doubts that the paperwork alone sank the city 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we didn't look hungry enough," she said. "We should have fought this 
thing all the way through."

 He doesn't seem like a prophet of doom, especially not when he's wearing his

 In fact, John M. W. Moorlach seems almost giddy as he steps to the podium to 
remind his appreciative audience that he warned them during the spring that 
Orange County's treasurer was taking enormous risks with the public's money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe how right I was," Moorlach says, hunching toward the 
microphone and reflecting on an interview he gave just before the county 
declared bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he said, after rereading an eight-page, doomsday letter he sent 
to County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley on May 31, he realized 
that his dire prediction about the county's future "wasn't just kind of close. 
It looked like I wrote it yesterday!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three weeks after Orange County's extraordinary plunge into bankruptcy, 
Moorlach's personal and political stock is soaring on the strength of how right 
he was. He is pondering his suddenly bright future as a candidate for office 
and fielding nearly nonstop phone calls from reporters, friends and admirers 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Moorlach run for the state Senate seat being vacated next month by 
Marian Bergeson? Or should he hope that the Board of Supervisors will decide 
next spring to replace disgraced former Treasurer Robert L. Citron with 
Moorlach, who predicted Orange County's financial collapse? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thomas L. Daxon, a former Oklahoma finance director, was appointed 
last week to an interim, four-month term as treasurer, Moorlach, 39, makes no 
secret that he still wants the job -- but with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be part of the rehabilitation plan, but I want to play a key role," 
he said. "If it's just a little role, I've got a better life. I don't need 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heady times, indeed, for a certified public accountant and Republican Party 
activist who was so little known in February that almost no one showed up when 
he announced his challenge to longtime incumbent Citron -- and who lost the 
June election to Citron by a 61%-39% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Moorlach was first dismissed by Citron and his allies, 
then accused of sparking baseless fears among the county's investors. Prominent 
Republicans such as Bergeson withdrew their support. Finally, Moorlach was 
ridiculed by Citron as Chicken Little, witlessly foretelling disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 To be proved right so quickly after such a resounding defeat feels pretty good 
now, even as Moorlach expresses sadness about the impact of the financial 
debacle on the citizens of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a God," he told his fellow Rotarians during his nearly hourlong 
speech last week. "To be vindicated within six months is pretty amazing to me. 
But this is not the way I wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Republican politicos are almost gushing about the opportunity that 
awaits him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Moorlach) is the most sparkling star in the Orange County Republican 
galaxy at the moment," said Tom Fuentes, the local Republican chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who have occasionally opposed Moorlach before concede that the 
biggest municipal bankruptcy in history has jump-started his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being right on something like this has a tendency to put you in a good 
political position," said Costa Mesa City Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle, who 
supported Moorlach's campaign but has often quarreled with him on issues 
affecting the city where they both live. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson and Jim Silva, the two supervisors-elect who will take their seats 
next month, have joined Supervisor William G. Steiner in saying they would 
support Moorlach's appointment to the treasurer's job. Riley, who is retiring 
from the board next week, declined to comment on the issue Saturday, noting 
that he was unlikely to be in office when the decision is made. Other 
supervisors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crisis has so burnished Moorlach's reputation that many who once 
opposed him decline to criticize him, at least publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent Moorlach critic Peer Swan, the Irvine Ranch Water District chairman 
credited with forcing revelations about the fund's $2-billion loss, declined to 
be quoted. In May, Swan castigated Moorlach's campaign tactics, comparing his 
behavior to "a guy who runs into a theater and yells 'Fire!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hornbuckle also begged off, pleading the Christmas spirit. Moorlach, she said, 
is "thoughtful, he studies the issues, and he's an honest man. I won't say that 
he's humble, but I won't get more critical at the moment, not over the 
Christmas holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Another critic said Moorlach's problem in the election was not his message, 
but his method. If Moorlach had taken his careful research of Citron's 
portfolio, marshaled his political support and quietly approached each 
supervisor with his concerns, they might have listened, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, the thrust of the campaign was to go to New York and cause concern 
among some of the financial press to lower the credit rating of the county and 
try to force a change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that the political attacks might cost the county money, its Republican 
leadership closed ranks around the veteran treasurer, who was then the county's 
only Democratic elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Moorlach's friends and political allies are easier to find, 
and more open, than his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably one of the most honest, well-grounded people I know," said Jeff 
Thomas, a Tustin City Councilman and close friend. "He has a real good sense of 
himself. He's a very spiritual kind of guy. . . . I'd walk over nails for the 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has done just an outstanding job for the whole community," said Karl Kemp, 
general manager of the Mesa Consolidated Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, whose full name is Johannes Meindert Willem Moorlach, was born Dec. 
21, 1955, in Groningen, the Netherlands. When he was 4, his family moved to the 
United States, living first in Cypress and then in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he graduated from Cal State Long Beach in 1977, where he earned a 
degree in business administration, Moorlach began working for an accounting 
firm. He joined his current firm -- Balser, Horowitz, Frank & Wakeling -- in 
1978, and is now a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a workaholic, according to his wife, Trina, whom he met at a Bible study 
when they were both 23. Although Moorlach's days since the crisis began have 
sometimes stretched to 20 hours, it does not seem much different than usual, 
Trina Moorlach says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always come home for dinner and gone back to the office or to meetings," 
she said. "For me, this is like a regular routine still." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In what little spare time he has, Moorlach, a history buff, enjoys 
photographing bronze historical markers, camping, hiking and tinkering with his 
beloved, pumpkin-colored Bricklin, whose license plate reads "DULL CPA." 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, he has also been active in local politics. A conservative 
Republican, Moorlach holds two posts with the Orange County GOP: assistant 
treasurer and chairman of the party's precinct advisory committee, a job that 
makes him head of its volunteer effort. 
</P>
<P>
 For all Moorlach's current political cachet, at least one political consultant 
says it may be difficult for him to move into any job but county treasurer -- 
the post Moorlach says he really wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Moorlach has said he does not relish a move to Sacramento or 
Washington, and he lives in Costa Mesa, which has a new county supervisor in 
Silva, consultant Harvey Englander believes Moorlach has fewer immediate 
political choices than his backers claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorlach is in a position where he's got a golden opportunity, but really no 
opportunity other than becoming the treasurer," Englander said. "It's sort of 
like playing Monopoly and he's got a get out of jail card, but he never lands 
in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it might be difficult to discount the prescience of Moorlach's 
warnings, particularly those laid out in the clear, forthright letter he wrote 
to Riley six months before the bond crisis erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 His major concern, Moorlach wrote, was "interest rate risk," the likelihood 
that rates would continue to rise, at odds with Citron's investment strategy of 
using the county's U.S. Treasury bills and bonds as collateral for short-term 
borrowing at low interest. The borrowed money, in turn, was reinvested in 
securities that paid a higher rate of return.

CHRISTMAS STORY FINDS A PLACE ON THE BORDER; IMMIGRATION: ACTIVISTS IN BOTH 
COUNTRIES POINT UP MIGRANTS' PLIGHT WITH A MEXICAN POSADA.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Christmas procession approaches the border, lines of candles advancing 
through taco stand smoke, cantina neon and a fading rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gliding motorcycle cops in yellow slickers lead the migrant families and 
priests with guitars past smugglers in baseball caps and tourists in serapes, 
past crouched Indian vendors and swarming taxi drivers. The northbound pilgrims 
carry statuettes of the Holy Family, which bob above the waves of traffic near 
the international border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the muddy hills of Colonia Libertad, people emerge from a bedraggled blue 
tenement to watch. Jose Hernandez joins a group of neighborhood toughs atop a 
dirt mound next to the international line. "Who has the paper with the verses?" 
rasps Hernandez, a 19-year-old smuggler of illegal immigrants. "I want to 
sing." 
</P>
<P>
 The procession from Tijuana meets up with a San Diego procession that has come 
south to the other side of the steel border fence. 
</P>
<P>
 On this damp December night, a crowd of about 150 has turned out for a border 
posada -- a non-traditional version of the traditional musical re-enactment of 
Mary and Joseph's search for shelter in Bethlehem. The fence has brought them 
together and the fence keeps them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The border serves as more than the stage for the drama of illegal immigration; 
this magical and menacing turf has been an irresistible backdrop for protests, 
political speeches and performance art. Combining aspects of all three, a 
coalition of religious, political and human rights groups has decided to 
reinvent the holiday ritual on a dark landscape of crucifix-like telephone 
poles, broken glass and railroad tracks. The dirt arena is bisected by a rusted 
gate that opens to international freight trains -- but not to people. 
</P>
<P>
 As tends to be the case here, the message is not subtle: In response to 
anti-immigrant politics, the organizers from Tijuana and San Diego want to 
transform the physical symbol of confrontation between nations into a symbol of 
brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pray that the day will come when we can have a posada without borders," 
said Auxiliary Bishop Gilbert Chavez of San Diego, addressing the crowd from 
the bed of a white pickup truck north of the fence. "If Jesus was to be born 
today, perhaps he would have chosen to be born in a very poor country. Perhaps 
he would choose Africa or Guatemala. . . . If we reject the poor, we are 
rejecting Christ himself." 
</P>
<P>
 A critic might point out that these clergymen and human rights advocates have 
ventured onto dubious ground by politicizing the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, wrapping politics into religion is a time-honored tradition 
that knows no frontiers of nationality or ideology. Jose Luis Perez Canchola, a 
former Baja California human rights prosecutor, argues that there is no better 
time and place to commemorate the wandering plight of migrants who are wanted 
neither at home nor abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas has to do with human charity," said Perez Canchola, who in a dogged 
rumble denounces both U.S. immigration policy and the indifference of his own 
government. "That the community comes together like this to call the attention 
of the authorities, demanding justice and human rights for migrants, does not 
clash with the spirit of humanity and solidarity of Christmas. What's more, in 
the Bible Joseph and Mary emigrated: They emigrated in search of shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 In the border version of the posada , the Mexican participants sing the roles 
of the carpenter from Nazareth and his wife asking for shelter at a house: 
"Don't be inhuman/Show charity/That God in heaven/Will reward you ." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the house, sung by those on the U.S. side, responds: " Better get 
going/And don't bother us/Because if I get angry/I'm going to beat you up. " 
</P>
<P>
 Three small boys sing lustily, pressed against the fence, enraptured by the 
music and the hubbub of lights and cameras on the other side. All the camera 
crews have chosen to work on the north side and shoot the Mexican participants 
as if they were in a cage. The three boys chortle when a U.S. photographer 
squats to take their picture through the fence and, in laborious Spanish, gets 
them to spell their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're famous, we're famous," says Francisco Chavez, 13, adding in English, 
"Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 David Villaruel, 9, says he has been to California and he likes it. 
Eleven-year-old Raul Martinez says with a trace of melancholy that he has never 
crossed the border: "I don't have a passport." They are all enjoying 
themselves, even though it is not clear to them why they have been brought to 
this stark spot for a posada.  
</P>
<P>
 Atop the mound of dirt nearby, smuggler Jose Hernandez and his cronies add a 
raucous note to the festivities. They are baleful, staggering choirboys in 
straw hats, baggy pants and dark hooded jackets. They punctuate the songs with 
howls of "Viva Mexico!" and "Down with Wilson!" 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Gov. Pete) Wilson keeps trying to kick out the Mexicans, there's going to 
be trouble," declares Hernandez, a free-lance smuggler who specializes in 
running illegal immigrants down the hill to the trolley stop in the 
southernmost U.S. neighborhood of San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's business is likely to improve next year. The devaluation of the 
peso has suddenly made Christmas in Mexico bleak, and Perez Canchola predicts 
that the gathering economic crisis will worsen the multiple pressures that 
drive illegal border-crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today on the radio programs the people were talking," Perez Canchola said. 
"They were saying: 'There is no alternative but to go work in the United States 
and earn dollars.' People here at the border spend in dollars. And they can no 
longer survive on Mexican salaries."  
</P>
<P>
 The posada song has a happy ending. The owner relents and opens his home to 
the Holy Family. Joseph sings: " Fortunate this house/That gives us shelter/May 
God always grant it/Sacred happiness ." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the border, the outcome is appropriately ambiguous. To culminate the 
ritual, the people on both sides simultaneously release doves symbolizing peace 
on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The dove on the Mexican side flies straight up and straight down, failing to 
cross over the fence. A man catches the bird and tries once more. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the dove soars higher. But then it veers back and down into Mexico 
again, becoming pinned against the barred window of a freight depot, wings 
fluttering.

LOTT EAGER TO RALLY SENATE BEHIND HOUSE GOP AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the ornate Senate Caucus Room, members of the Mississippi Farm Bureau 
Federation listened politely as Thad Cochran, Mississippi's senior senator, 
plodded through the details of the pending farm bill, praised the benefits to 
farmers of free-trade agreements and enumerated the technological advantages 
that make American agribusiness so effective. 
</P>
<P>
 As the courtly Cochran returned to his seat, junior senator Trent Lott grinned 
at him wickedly. Nice speech, Lott said, "but now I'm going to throw them a 
little red meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott took the podium, Cochran recalls, and punched "every hot button" those 
home-state farmers had. He embraced school prayer. He excoriated the federal 
welfare system and its effect on poor mothers and their children. He exhorted 
Congress to lock up criminals after their third conviction and throw away the 
key. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cheered!" said Cochran, describing the February hearing scene with a 
kind of detached amazement. "Oh, they applauded! He entertained them, and he 
brought them right along." The two Republicans, Cochran concedes, "have a 
different tone, a different approach, a different style." 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other factor in the Senate, the tone, approach and style of 
Trent Lott could determine the success of the GOP's legislative agenda next 
year and redefine the public perception of the gentleperson's club that is the 
United States Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new Republican-controlled Congress is called to order on Jan. 4, Lott 
will occupy the Senate's second-highest leadership position, ranking only 
behind GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas. Even more important in the eyes of his 
GOP colleagues, Lott is regarded as the one senator with perhaps the closest 
ties to incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the spiritual leader of the 
conservative crusaders who wrested control of Congress away from the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Lott who could unite ideologically diverse Senate Republicans behind a 
Gingrich-style agenda to cut taxes, slash social spending and shrink the 
government. It is Lott who could dash the hopes of Democrats, as well as some 
Republican moderates, who would like to see Senate Republicans tone down or 
bottle up some of the more provocative measures passed by the House. It is Lott 
who could increase pressure on Dole to forge a legislative alliance with 
Gingrich that moves the congressional center of gravity even further to the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 As majority leader, Dole will be dictating the Senate's schedule and 
dominating its external relations. But Lott, who won the GOP race for Senate 
majority whip by defeating a candidate preferred by Dole, is likely to be the 
internal force that moves the Senate. And by his own admission, he intends to 
make it move in unaccustomed ways.  
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, Lott said in a recent interview, needs to "enter the 20th Century" 
and leave behind some of the go-it-alone traditions that have made each senator 
an island unto him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the Senate ought to act a little more like the House.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will require stronger leadership and greater discipline, but it also will 
require a little followership ," Lott said. "More than anything else, it's 
generational and stylistic. This is not 1949, it's 1994. Can we acknowledge 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such directness is vintage Lott, present and former colleagues say. His 
persona is a subtle mix of polish, calculation and feistiness -- a combination 
that makes him unusually adept at reading his audiences, rousing them to action 
and recruiting them to serve as foot soldiers in the GOP's political army. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott will need all of those skills if he is to clear the way for passage of 
the ambitious Republican agenda crafted by Gingrich, his friend and political 
comrade-in-arms. Only by motivating and disciplining the Senate's GOP forces -- 
and by transplanting some of the House's energetic partisanship to the Senate 
-- can Lott ensure that the upper chamber does not become the graveyard for the 
House GOP's "contract with America."  
</P>
<P>
 If Lott can accomplish that feat, it would mark a historic turnabout. The 
Senate, after all, is an institution long dominated by gracious and studious 
men like Cochran, a 14-year veteran whose seniority would have won him, in past 
years, the job of majority whip that went to the younger, more aggressive Lott. 
It is an institution in which partisanship -- and party discipline -- generally 
take a back seat to a tradition of mannered mutual respect among the chamber's 
100 barons. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is changing, said Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.). And the combative 
Lott, who served for 16 years in the House before moving to the Senate in 1988, 
appears to be both a symptom and an agent of that change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate is not like the House, although it's becoming more like the House 
all the time," said Cohen, a moderate Republican who served briefly with Lott 
in the House. "Things are starting to get a little more polarized in the 
Senate, and that's been brought about by animosities smoldering in the House 
for years. . . . I suppose (Lott) being a newer member is part of that."  
</P>
<P>
 Lott offers no denials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The House needs to learn to be a little less aggressive and partisan," he 
said. "And the Senate would do well to be a little more considerate of the 
institution as a whole and a little more aggressive. I'm not for a minute 
trying to make the Senate in the image of the House. I left the House. . . . 
But I do believe we can do better in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott's admirers believe that the 53-year-old Southerner, a perennial 
list-keeper who plainly revels in the inner workings of Washington politics, is 
just the man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a deep and penetrating understanding of the motivations that members 
have . . . including ambition," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a fellow 
conservative who joined the Senate two years before Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott clearly has ambitions of his own, although colleagues say they appear to 
be confined to the Senate. Some say the job he really wants is the one about to 
be occupied by Dole, who, by many accounts, does not fully trust his new 
lieutenant. And after edging out Dole's preferred candidate, Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), by just one vote, colleagues say they think Lott would like 
to win the majority leader's job one day by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the limits of Lott's ambitions are to be a leader in Senate who will 
go down in history with people like Lyndon Johnson as a man who has really 
affected the institution for good," McCain said. "He wants to be remembered in 
history as one of the giants of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If he achieves that kind of stature, colleagues say, it will not be for his 
vision. And it will not come from the kind of naked exercise of power that 
distinguished Johnson. Instead, it will reflect Lott's effectiveness at 
coaxing, cajoling, herding and wheedling his Republican colleagues to support a 
common GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt Gingrich is the grand thinker and strategist for the Republican Party," 
said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "He 
provides the grand strategy. Lott is the facilitator. He's the one who buys 
into the vision, but is trying to build the majorities to get the votes, to 
nudge his colleagues into doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, for Lott, a familiar role. Back in the 1970s, Gingrich's Conservative 
Opportunity Society was an isolated rump group of hyper-conservative misfits 
and outcasts within the House of Representatives. It was Lott -- by then a 
member of the House GOP Establishment -- who quietly attended many of their 
meetings and pleaded their case to the chamber's minority leaders. At a time 
when Gingrich's group was openly shunned by fellow Republicans, Lott's subtle 
intercession won Gingrich and his causes increasing access and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in rural Grenada County, Miss., where his father farmed and his mother 
taught school, Lott worked his way through law school at the University of 
Mississippi by running the Ole Miss alumni organization. It was a position in 
which he made contacts that would serve him well in future campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lott's most important friends was his first employer after law school: 
U.S. Rep. William Colmer, a Democrat. Colmer encouraged Lott to run for his 
seat after he retired, and continued to support him strongly even when Lott 
decided to run as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's been making friends his whole life," said Michael Boland, a former 
staff assistant to Lott in the mid-1980s, when he was serving alongside 
Gingrich as House minority whip. "He has among his friends people who, if he 
ever shared a political view in common, it was an accident. He's genuine, and 
that's a political skill with a small p. Moreover, no one will ever outwork 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues offer less flattering assessments. A few say they find Lott's 
chosen role as loyal lieutenant and Washington insider difficult to square with 
his arch-conservative, anti-Washington convictions and evident ambition.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even among a group of ambitious people -- a group of people among whom there 
are few shrinking violets -- Lott's overarching ambition has been apparent from 
the beginning," said a Republican senator who supported Simpson for the 
minority whip job. "Some are attracted by it. Some are turned off by it. 
Sometimes blatant, aggressive ambition succeeds, sometimes it bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others are even more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's slick. . . . " said Bill Minor, for 40 years a syndicated columnist 
covering Mississippi politics in Jackson. "He sort of blithes over any real 
issues, looking for hot-button issues, things he knows are going to be very 
popular. He's not going to be caught taking positions that are unpopular. He's 
always been a smoothie." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Lott's embrace of two hot-button issues -- health care 
reform and tougher criminal sentencing -- have made the Mississippian a highly 
visible player in Washington politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the Clinton Administration's massive health care measure had run 
into serious political trouble, and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) was struggling to cobble together a compromise plan that would stand 
some chance of passage. Sensing an opportunity, Lott reached over to the House, 
plucked up a middle-of-the-road proposal authored by House Minority Leader 
Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) and introduced it in the Senate. The so-called 
Michel-Lott bill garnered substantial interest and is expected to be one of the 
centerpieces of Republican health care reform efforts in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lott became a major proponent of the "three-strikes-and-you're-out" 
amendment that was attached to the Administration's crime bill. The amendment 
sets federal sentencing rules requiring violent felons convicted for the third 
time to be locked up for life without possibility of parole. The proposal 
resonated with voters' fears of violent crime and frustrations with a 
criminal-justice system perceived as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott has not always chosen so well. In 1974, as the youngest member of the 
House Judiciary Committee, he ardently defended then-President Richard Nixon 
and voted against his impeachment in connection with the Watergate scandal. 
More recently, when he became the Senate GOP point man on Clinton 
Administration nominations, he concluded that Atty. Gen.-designate Zoe Baird's 
hiring of an illegal nanny was not a "killer issue." He was dead wrong, and 
Baird's nomination was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 10-point "contract with America," Lott appears to have found a whole 
slate of issues he can use to rally the Republican troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a nod to Senate tradition, Lott says he hopes to follow a practice of 
"keeping them together by letting them stray." But his actions suggest less 
tolerance than his words: Lott plans to create a team of assistant whips who 
will roam the Senate floor and make sure members don't stray too far from the 
party line. The system, not coincidentally, is much like the one used to 
enforce party discipline in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "In contrast to longtime senators, he may appear more forceful," said incoming 
Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), an eight-year House veteran who has been a friend of 
Lott's since 1986. But Lott's penchant for tossing out red meat now and then is 
not expected to limit his ability to indoctrinate independent-minded 
Republicans with the finer points of "followership." 
</P>
<P>
 "From a tactical point of view," Kyl said, "it's awful difficult to beat Trent 
Lott."

UNDERLYING ILLS PUSH COUNTIES TO EDGE OF FISCAL CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leaders of rural Merced County never gambled the treasury on Wall Street, 
loaded up on slick investments or fretted about the erratic path of interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But this dairy farming region in the San Joaquin Valley shares an 
uncomfortable link to its counterpart of Orange County, 300 miles south: Merced 
teeters on the edge of its own financial cliff, and awaits a $5.9-million 
relief deal with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Band-Aid," said Clark G. Channing, Merced County administrator, 
referring to the deal being negotiated with the governor's office. "I call the 
system that we've got 'structural anarchy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although public attention has been riveted on the investment strategies of 
Orange County and a handful of other counties, an underlying financial malaise 
-- unrelated to wheeling and dealing on Wall Street -- has bedeviled them for 
years. The fiscal crunch has sparked a range of responses, with only some 
counties dabbling in tricky financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are faced with a common set of culprits: Deep recession, a shrinking 
base of defense factories and an out-of-whack system of taxation and spending 
that have combined to threaten their health in the 1990s, according to experts 
on public finance.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight counties, including Merced, sought relief this year in a bill that Gov. 
Pete Wilson vetoed in September. "We call it death by attrition," said Dan 
Wall, a tax lobbyist for the California State Assn. of Counties.  
</P>
<P>
 The ailment quietly spread in the 1980s, as counties confronted rising costs 
for health, welfare, courts and prisons. At first, though, a booming economy 
concealed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Helter-skelter development brought a rainfall of money to many regions. New 
residential communities, shopping malls and office buildings meant a windfall 
of property tax revenues. Confident consumers bought lots of cars, enhancing 
the counties' take from motor vehicle license fees. Sales taxes and other cash 
sources pushed ever higher. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the boom times, county governments were quietly losing control of 
their financial destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 13 had capped property taxes rates, the counties' key source of 
income, in 1978. Social changes were reflected in costly new demands on county 
programs -- demands that the counties legally had to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our welfare and health caseloads have continued to grow," Wall said. "The 
work of the courts has continued to grow. The population in our jails has 
continued to grow. And the revenue is not keeping up." 
</P>
<P>
 The squeeze hit different counties in different ways. As rents skyrocketed in 
the 1980s, many low-income Californians emigrated from cities in search of 
cheaper living costs, saddling rural regions with unprecedented -- and 
unplanned -- social costs.  
</P>
<P>
 The first warning came from Butte County, a rice-growing region north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare load skyrocketed 136% as a new population of the poor moved in. 
Desperate to make ends meet, Butte officials cut the county work force to a 
four-day week. Emergency service vehicles that had gone 350,000 miles were kept 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1989, Butte was on the verge of bankruptcy. Gov. George Deukmejian agreed 
to an $11.1-million bailout. And to this day, the financial situation is shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fiscal relationship between rural counties and the state of California is 
broken," said Dick Puelicher, county treasurer. "It can't continue." 
</P>
<P>
 One year after Butte's brush with disaster, the entire state began to suffer 
from recession, and financial fallout landed on counties big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 Once-reliable income sources began to plunge. Property values -- and taxes -- 
sank, and development screeched to a halt. In order to balance the state's 
beleaguered books in the early 1990s, the Legislature began shifting increasing 
amounts of property tax payments from counties to the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The annual amount has reached $2.5 billion, with slightly more than that 
offset by added sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts maintain that in effect, tough times called for tough remedies 
and the counties should have aggressively cut their own costs. Clearly, such 
efforts were not always undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 County government job rolls rose from 14,800 to 17,600, while most other 
gauges of the local economy were sinking, according to Esmael Adibi, director 
of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "They continued business as usual in spite of the recession and the shrinking 
of their tax base," Adibi said. "How were they able to finance it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the promise of sky-high returns from exotic investments can be 
alluring to local officials who are aware of the public's distaste for higher 
taxes or service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it an excuse?" asked Jeffrey I. Chapman, an economist at USC's Sacramento 
Center, referring to risky investments of public money. "No -- but the pressure 
is still there." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, smaller counties with smaller economies have had fewer 
opportunities to generate savings than their bigger counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Merced County was staggered by the property tax shifts in 1992 and 1993, in 
which its local haul was cut in half -- to $11 million. Consequently, the 
financing of basic services has taken on a crisis atmosphere. These days, 
community volunteers help staff the libraries, sheriff's office and parks 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of county government jobs have been eliminated, salaries were 
trimmed and the retirement program was scaled back. At the same time, welfare 
costs have soared, driven in part by the unexpected arrival of a 10,000-member 
community of Southeast Asian refugees.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken things down to what we can achieve," said Channing, who expects a 
relief deal with the state to be reached relatively soon. "If we couldn't get 
the $6 million restructured, we'd be a basket case." 
</P>
<P>
 The Byzantine nature of public finance in California only exacerbates such 
problems, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the state has attached more strings and provisos to county 
revenues, increasingly dictating what the money must be spent on and leaving 
local officials with control over an ever-dwindling share of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, counties typically have sole discretion over 5% or 10% of their total 
spending, with state and federal mandates prescribing the remaining priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 One example: When the state reimbursed counties for more than $1 billion of 
the property taxes taken away in the early 1990s, the money came with a proviso 
-- it had to be used on public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The incredibly complex system of rules often leads to confusion. "Nobody 
understands what's going on. I don't understand it -- and I'm supposed to 
understand it," Chapman said. "It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, few would blame the state's curious budget system for the Orange 
County bankruptcy. Nor would they suggest that fiscal pressures justify plowing 
tax money into unwise investments. Orange County, by virtue of its large and 
growing economy, was better able to withstand the ongoing pressures than many 
of its counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't blame the tax structure" for Orange County's woes, said Larry McCarthy, 
president of the California Taxpayers Assn., a pro-business group that resists 
tax increases. "It's not a tax structure problem. It's not a revenue-flow 
problem. The problem is financial mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts believe it is important to recognize that a climate of 
financial shortage lasting for years has placed pressure on government 
officials to scramble for ways to enhance income. Slashing government costs, 
although popular with many people in the abstract, is inevitably controversial 
when the subject boils down to specific programs.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON'S BID FOR LEGAL AID NEAR REJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAI; REBECCA TROUNSON, NZANG, ; JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As investigators trace how Orange County's financial crisis unfolded and 
explore the possibility of wrongdoing by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron, officials are questioning whether they are obligated to pay for 
Citron's legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a statutory deadline, county officials said Saturday that they are 
close to rejecting Citron's appeal for help in paying his mounting legal costs 
because of a growing "pattern of deception and misrepresentation" in the former 
treasurer's investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 After a flurry of intensive meetings and telephone conversations late Friday, 
attorneys for Citron and the county worked out a last-minute agreement to 
extend for 12 days the legal time frame for responding to Citron's request that 
his fees be covered, according to high-ranking county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry Andrus said Saturday that the county has until Jan. 5 to 
reach a decision, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that the county has any legal discretion, a decision will be 
based solely on what is in the best interest of the county and not anyone or 
anything else," Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a public agency is required to defend and indemnify an 
employee for non-fraudulent acts or omissions that occur within the scope of 
employment, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county's Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing may shield it from 
Citron's request that his legal fees be paid, according to a source close to 
the case. Because the Chapter 9 filing protects the county from virtually all 
lawsuits, Citron might have to line up with the county's numerous other 
creditors to recoup legal fees, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home Saturday, Citron declined to comment. His attorney, David 
Wiechert, did not return telephone calls to his home and office seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said he had not yet decided whether he believes 
the county should pay legal expenses for Citron, whose risky investment 
practices pushed the county into bankruptcy three weeks ago and endangered the 
savings of more than 180 cities, school districts and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's financial dealings are under investigation by the Orange County 
district attorney, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the state 
Department of Corporations, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigations proceed, "things seem to be evolving from a question of 
poor judgment to more serious considerations," Steiner said in reference to 
Citron. "I'd sure like to hear a more comprehensive explanation from his view, 
but maybe that won't come out until the SEC and D.A. finish their 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, weary county supervisors and supervisors-elect grappled Christmas 
Eve with the challenge of drumming up holiday spirit after days of dealing with 
the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the weirdest Christmas I think I've ever been through," incoming 
Supervisor Marian Bergeson said as she fixed a Christmas Eve dinner for 
relatives. "It's supposed to be such a happy time, and instead all of this is 
going on. It's tough on families." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, spent the day working at his 
Los Angeles office. He spent about three hours sorting reams of mail he has 
ignored during the last week and communicated via fax with other lawyers 
working on the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county administration complex in Santa Ana, most offices were locked 
and dark for the first weekend since the crisis began Dec. 1. Parking lots were 
empty. Homeless people replaced the crowds of county officials, lawyers and 
anxious employees who had traversed the plaza near the buildings throughout the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the entrance to the treasurer-tax collector's office, charity workers 
distributed clothing to several dozen needy people. 
</P>
<P>
 When Citron resigned Dec. 4, two days before the county's unprecedented 
bankruptcy filing, he verbally requested help with any legal expenses he might 
incur, several county officials said. Two weeks later, on Dec. 16, Wiechert 
made the same request in a letter to Andrus, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, the county has 20 days to rule on an employee's request. But because 
Citron made two requests, officials were uncertain which one started the 
statutory time clock. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 20-day period began with Citron's verbal notification, the deadline 
would have been Friday and top county officials said Andrus was prepared to 
deny the former treasurer's request.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; TRAIL OF MONEY BETWEEN COUNTY, BROKERS PROBED; 
INQUIRY: OFFICIALS PAID MILLIONS TO INVESTMENT BANKERS, WHILE WALL STREET MADE 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. SEC, PROSECUTORS SEEK LINKS BETWEEN THE TWO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Orange County plunged deeper into debt, public agencies in the county paid 
out at least $50 million this year -- and possibly up to twice that much -- to 
investment bankers, lawyers and other consultants involved in the world of 
municipal finance. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall Street bankers, bond lawyers and financial advisers gave tens of 
thousands of dollars in campaign money to supervisors, city council members and 
the elected trustees of obscure special districts that paid their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Orange County district 
attorney's office are investigating the possibility that campaign 
contributions, or even kickbacks, were provided to county officials in exchange 
for the county's lucrative bond business. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orange County and its cities, schools and special districts have 
emerged as by far the heaviest per capita user of bond debt in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Orange County and its political subdivisions sold $9.2 billion in 
bonds in 1993 and the first three quarters of 1994 -- an amount about equal to 
the bond debt issued by New York City, and exceeded in California only by state 
government and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Orange County governments sold $4.9 billion in bonds. That works out 
to $1,887 in bond debt for each man, woman and child in the county. Contra 
Costa County was a distant second with $1,381 in bond debt per capita, 
according to a Times analysis of statistics compiled by the California Debt 
Advisory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've simply responded to what's happening all around us," Supervisor Thomas 
F. Riley said, explaining that Orange County's status as a haven of bond sales 
was driven by the need to accommodate population growth. "We've got growth with 
55,000 births a year, and certainly business and industry have continued to 
expand." 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before a government oversight commission, Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg (D-Sacramento) charged that officials resort to such financing because 
"politicians fear the consequences of attempting to live within their means." 
</P>
<P>
 "This fear is bipartisan," Isenberg said. "It includes the governor, the 
Legislature and, of course, the Board of Supervisors and chief administrative 
officer of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money raised by the bond sales was earmarked for traditional 
government undertakings, such as building schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some instances, Orange County -- led by then-Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron -- sold bonds to generate money to invest in speculative Wall 
Street securities. By investing in those securities, Orange County generated 
interest income, helping officials avoid imposing higher taxes or cutting 
popular government services. 
</P>
<P>
 After those fixed-rate securities plummeted in value with this year's interest 
rate increases, the county filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of borrowing had accelerated in 1994. In the first nine months of 
1994, Orange County and its political subdivisions arranged for more than 100 
separate bond sales totaling $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 With each sale, bond brokers from Wall Street to Newport Beach took their 
cuts. Investment banking firms such as Merrill Lynch, Bear Sterns and others 
reported receiving more than $20 million in underwriting fees for marketing the 
bonds, a review of official statements filed with the Debt Advisory Board 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the official statements, which resemble the prospectuses issued with 
commercial stock offerings, omit details about the fees. But based on what 
information is available, lawyers hired by the government agencies issuing 
bonds reported being paid $1.5 million. Firms that insured some bonds, 
financial advisers and others involved in the bond sales received at least 
another $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One major beneficiary this year was the investment banking firm Lehman Bros., 
which reported receiving more than $6 million in underwriting fees on $560 
million in bonds. PaineWebber reported collecting $2.5 million in fees. Smith 
Barney Shearson reported $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based Public Securities Assn. estimates that underwriters' fees 
average $7 for every $1,000 in bonds, or $700,000 on a $100-million bond issue. 
Using that estimate, Orange County's sale of $9.2 billion in bonds since the 
beginning of 1993 would have generated $64.4 million in underwriting fees for 
investment banking firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Adviser, said fees 
for underwriters and others involved in putting together deals often amount to 
3%, or $3 million on a $100-million issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mann's figure is accurate, the underwriters, lawyers and financial advisers 
involved in Orange County bond sales were paid more than $275 million over the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is getting a piece of the action these days," Mann said, referring 
to bond attorneys, financial consultants and firms that print the documents 
describing the bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms involved in many Orange County sales -- such as LeBoeuf, Lamb, Green 
& MacRae -- generally do not specify their fees. But one law firm, Stradling, 
Yocca, Carlson & Rauth, reported receiving $650,000 for handling more than half 
a dozen bond issues in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high-flying days before the bankruptcy, the underwriting fees were only 
a fraction of what the brokerages made from Orange County securities deals. 
Wall Street firms also made money by selling securities to the county, with the 
county sometimes raising money to purchase the securities by issuing bonds 
through the same brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's called, 'getting paid on both sides.' It's a salesman's dream," said a 
money manager for a firm that does business with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of transactions shows that Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street firm most 
closely linked to the Orange County financial debacle, took $1.8 million in 
fees by serving as the underwriter on $600 million in notes issued last summer 
by the Student Loan Marketing Assn., or Sallie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Sallie Mae notes were issued, Merrill Lynch sold $600 
million worth of Sallie Maes to Orange County, apparently taking a commission 
on the sale, because the county paid $3.8 million more than face value in the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks earlier, Merrill Lynch also arranged for the county to raise 
$600 million in cash -- the same amount it needed to buy the Sallie Maes -- by 
underwriting a $600-million offering of county notes, for which the county paid 
Merrill Lynch $780,000 in underwriting fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Underwriters') revenues can be multiplied by doing a series of extra deals 
with the same client, and sometimes with the same funds," said Robert B. Lamb, 
a professor at New York University and debt adviser to municipalities, 
including New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how much money Merrill Lynch has made from Orange County over the 
years is not available. Merrill Lynch spokesmen refuse to discuss the firm's 
fees. But because Merrill Lynch handled so much of the county's business, 
relations between the Wall Street firm and some of its brokers on one side and 
county officials on the other have become the prime focus of at least two 
criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Denizens of municipal finance are notorious for being a highly competitive 
bunch. One investment banker, describing the cutthroat nature of the business, 
recalled a line attributed to Wall Street takeover artist Carl Icahn: If you 
want a friend on Wall Street, get a dog. "Well," said the banker, "in public 
finance, we shoot each others' dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Wall Street bankers would seek to gain an edge by hiring 
local lobbyists, and by handing out political campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment bankers' political donations ranged from as high as $5,000 to as 
little as $70. From its Manhattan office, Merrill Lynch reached out beyond the 
Board of Supervisors, where most of its money went, to smaller agencies such as 
the Irvine Ranch Water District, giving $99 checks to candidates for the board, 
where low-key campaigns cost a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made a token contribution as a manner of business etiquette," said 
John Withers of the Irvine Ranch Water District, one of those who received a 
check for $99.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Withers said he has never spoken to a Merrill Lynch banker, he noted 
that the firm "has done a significant amount of business with the district and 
I suppose they want to show support." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch and its employees gave $15,000 from 1991 to 1993 to local 
officials in Orange County, making it the most generous contributor to local 
officials in the county among investment firms during that period, campaign 
finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wiggins, director of corporate communications at Merrill Lynch, said the 
donations were "legal, proper and appropriate in every way," adding that the 
money "had nothing to do with any quid pro quo."  
</P>
<P>
 "Merrill was certainly not the only municipal securities firm that was asked 
to contribute, and that made contributions. It was just the way it worked," 
Wiggins said. "We were seen by political candidates as a source of funding for 
political campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch stopped giving corporate donations to politicians last year, and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a ruling this year barring 
contributions by brokerage houses to elected officials who are in a position to 
award bond contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule was aimed at stopping what came to be viewed as a "pay to play" 
system in which bond firms donated to political officials who gave them bond 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state treasurers were the biggest recipients of Wall Street 
donations, receiving tens of thousands of dollars from individual firms for 
their campaigns. At the local level, donations in Orange County rivaled what 
bankers gave to officials in Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Alameda and San 
Francisco counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the official who received the most campaign money from firms 
and individuals in the bond business appears to have been Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton. Stanton, who did not return calls seeking comment, received $14,500 
since 1991 from Wall Street firms and their employees, and bond attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, council members and candidates received more than $22,000 since 
1991 from Wall Street brokerages, law firms specializing in securities issues 
and their employees. Mayor Tom Daley received more than $13,000. In Santa aAna, 
various players in bond deals have given more than $4,000 to Councilman Robert 
Richardson. They also donated at least $10,500 to a measure put before voters 
to use bond proceeds to build a jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment bankers who are familiar with Orange County say supervisors 
sometimes took a direct hand in selecting the underwriters, interviewing them 
in their chambers about the deals they were offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner acknowledged that supervisors sometimes were 
involved in the selection when deals directly affected their districts, but 
said he never participated in such a process. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner, who received $7,600 from bond merchants, downplayed connections 
between contributions and the underwriters who received business, saying he 
knew some investment bankers who gave to his campaigns before he joined the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was so much business in Orange County that no one had the 
exclusive purview (over who was) to be selected or not selected," he said.

IN DANGER DOWN UNDER; DESTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIA'S EUCALYPTUS GROVES LEAVES 
KOALAS OUT ON A LIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's probably best that Dinki Di, Bami, Gidgee, Mary Quinn and the other 
koalas at the San Diego Zoo won't be making any phone calls to their ancestral 
home in Australia: The family news would not be good. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the cuddly looking koala, whose charisma among animal lovers ranks 
second only to pandas, may be on the verge of becoming an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Zoo, which is involved in habitat preservation for numerous 
species around the globe, recently sent a team of koala experts into the bush 
of New South Wales to evaluate the eucalyptus groves that are home to the 
koala. The zoo has more experience and expertise with koalas than any zoo 
outside Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 What the team found shocked them. The eucalyptus groves -- koalas eat nothing 
but eucalyptus leaves -- are disappearing faster than you can say shopping mall 
and subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Australian Koala Foundation estimates that 80% of the koala's 
natural habitat has been destroyed and that in the last decade the number of 
koalas has declined 50%.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of endangered species, you think of burning rain forests in 
Brazil, poachers in Africa, or the panda in China," foundation Executive 
Director Deborah Tabart said in an interview from Brisbane, Australia. "But 
with the koala, it's urbanization, hotels and beachfront resorts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brush fires that burned 1.2 million acres in Australia in January added to the 
koala's worsening plight. For 10 days, 150 fires raged out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires prompted the San Diegans to go to Australia as part of the most 
extensive koala habitat inspection ever undertaken. The koala is native only to 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found was pretty amazing," said Valerie Thompson, an assistant 
curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo, which, with 42 of the furry 
marsupials, has the largest collection of koalas outside Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there were not as many koala carcasses in the burned-out regions as 
expected, a sign that the koala population had not been as high as thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the rapid development in the koala area shows no signs of letting up. 
It has been illegal to kill a koala in Australia since 1936 -- after pelt 
hunters slaughtered 3 million koalas in the 1920s -- but 80% of koala territory 
is owned privately and subject to development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they come down from their trees, the koalas are getting hit by cars and 
killed by dogs and have even been drowned in swimming pools," Thompson said. 
"These are hazards the animals just cannot adapt to." 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservation measures have been taken: koala crossing signs on roads, a 
koala tunnel under a major new freeway, and a Save the Bush program that 
encourages the conservation of eucalyptus groves. The Brisbane Sheraton Hotel 
puts a $1 surcharge on all bills to aid koala preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is studying whether to list the koala as an 
endangered species. By throwing the agency's international prestige behind the 
koala conservation effort, it could pressure the Australians to be more 
vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency sometimes lists non-native animals on its endangered list to give 
the U.S. government greater authority to block the importation of the animals 
into this country, on the theory that the international swapping of animals can 
hasten a species' demise. 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia, the koala is listed as vulnerable but not yet endangered in the 
state of New South Wales -- and as plentiful in the states of Queensland and 
Victoria -- under that country's endangered species act, which took effect only 
last year. (The koala has been extinct in the state of South Australia since 
the slaughter of the 1920s). 
</P>
<P>
 Tabart says that the Australian government has been negligent in not moving 
quicker to protect the koala habitat from urban sprawl, and says that by the 
time the koala is listed as an endangered species it may be too late to save 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time there has been a collision between development and the koala, the 
koala has lost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Crennan, director of the endangered species division of the Australian 
Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian government's equivalent to the Fish 
& Wildlife Service, shares Tabart's zeal to save the koala but thinks she is 
not giving the government enough credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Crennan said, the Australian and New Zealand Environmental and 
Conservation Council, a gathering of local, territory and commonwealth 
officials, decided to form a save-the-koala task force to find national 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are political problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the federal government of the United States, the commonwealth 
government in Australia cannot order industry to stop chopping down trees on 
private property. The koala is protected, but the eucalyptus tree is fair game. 
</P>
<P>
 The contingent from the San Diego Zoo went to Australia to assist with the 
Australian Koala Foundation's project to not only assess the koala's habitat 
but also to produce a definitive map of where the koalas live. The mapping 
effort is being assisted by satellite tracking. 
</P>
<P>
 The view that the koalas' existence may be threatened by the destruction of 
its habitat signals a change of thinking among conservationists. Only a few 
years ago biologists thought the biggest danger to the koala was the venereal 
disease chlamydia, which infects up to 40% of the koala population and renders 
many females infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks the San Diegans tromped the thick eucalyptus forest near Port 
Stephens, two hours north of Sydney in New South Wales, in search of the koala, 
a slow-moving animal that sleeps 20 hours a day and usually weighs between 10 
and 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding koalas in the trees is "a lot like the 'Where's Waldo' game," Thompson 
said, because of the animal's solitary ways and camouflage coloring. The 
researchers often were forced to deduce the koala's presence from scratchings 
on tree trunks and droppings on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of an agreed-upon count for the koala population has made it 
difficult to rally public support for its plight. The foundation estimates the 
koala population at 40,000 to 80,000 but the figure is open to debate. "No one 
has yet found a reliable way of counting koalas," Crennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with an emotional attachment, the Australians also have a financial 
stake in the koala's survival. The koala is a marketing symbol for the 
country's tourism industry and is an advertising symbol for Qantas airline, 
which is underwriting the mapping project. "I think the whole world would 
lament if the koala died," Tabart said.

QUESTIONS LINGER IN '93 SHOOTING DEATH OF DEPUTY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: AFTER AN 
ORANGE COUNTY OFFICER WAS KILLED BY A COLLEAGUE, A GRAND JURY DID NOT RETURN AN 
INDICTMENT. NOW, SOME JURORS ARE TALKING AND THE FAMILY IS SEEKING ANSWERS. 
</P>

<P>
 One year after a deputy sheriff shot and killed a fellow deputy during an 
impromptu training session on Christmas Day, 1993, questions raised by the 
shooting incident have not waned, and in some instances have grown more 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a year has passed, the deputy who fired the fatal shot has not 
returned to work, and a decision on any disciplinary action he might face is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Brian P. Scanlan was placed on paid leave after shooting Deputy Darryn 
Leroy Robins in the face on Dec. 25, 1993, behind a Lake Forest theater, where 
Robins -- apparently trying to demonstrate how bad guys can get the drop on 
officers -- pulled a concealed weapon and pointed it at Scanlan during a mock 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, Scanlan "jerked back," and fired a single shot into the 30-year-old 
deputy's face, according to a statement Scanlan made to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a county grand jury could put to rest the lengthy controversy over 
the killing, which was made all the more sensitive because Scanlan is white and 
Robins was black. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, minority leaders tried unsuccessfully to get state or federal 
authorities to take over the formal investigation into the slaying, voicing 
concerns that the Orange County district attorney's investigation might be 
tainted by its need to preserve good working relations with the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office concluded that Scanlan had been "grossly 
negligent" and says it wanted Scanlan charged with involuntary manslaughter. 
But county prosecutors left the final decision in the hands of the Orange 
County Grand Jury that was sitting at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 That grand jury -- which was then under fire for not having enough minority 
panel members -- declined to issue an indictment, and that decision effectively 
sealed for all time the transcripts of what transpired behind closed doors in 
the grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 For minority leaders who raised questions about the pace and thoroughness of 
the investigation, the secrecy enshrouding the case has only caused open wounds 
to fester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deputy Scanlan will forever have this hanging over his head (and) we will 
forever have questions about what really happened that day. Nothing has really 
been solved in that way," said Eugene Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men of 
Orange County, a group that found itself leading efforts to get answers about 
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although suggestions that race influenced the handling of the case were 
disputed by law enforcement, investigative records and Robins' widow, it 
nonetheless remains a sore point for Wheeler and others. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time, grand jurors who listened to testimony in the case are 
joining some of the critics -- although they do not agree that race played a 
role in the killing or the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim retiree John Jeffers Baird, one of the panel's members, said he 
remains surprised by the grand jury's decision not to indict. But he refused to 
say how he voted, noting that grand jurors who reveal details of the secret 
proceedings can be charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is it was a very painful episode, and I can assure you I will 
never forget it," Baird said. "I can say I was very surprised at the way it 
turned out, after the information we were given." 
</P>
<P>
 But another grand juror who spoke on the condition that his identity not be 
revealed went further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. decided to come to us because they knew what the outcome would be 
when you bring a case like this before a bunch of older retirees, with only a 
few minorities" among the jurors, the grand juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone deserved to be indicted, he deserved to be indicted," the juror 
said of Scanlan. "I'm not saying he deserves to spend the rest of his life in 
jail. But this was grossly, grossly negligent. I will be troubled by this until 
the day I die." 
</P>
<P>
 But Guy Ormes, a prosecutor who oversees special assignments at the Orange 
County district attorney's office, strongly disagreed with the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went down there asking for an indictment. No one disagrees with that, so I 
don't think anyone can say otherwise," Ormes said. Noting that the case was an 
emotional one, Ormes said a public consensus would never be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there were people who criticized the grand jury and our office. . . . 
But had the grand jury voted for an indictment, people would have been upset 
about that," Ormes said. "No one has ever been happy about this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors who spoke about the case agreed that prosecutors presented 
the case in a professional and unbiased manner. But missing from the 
information presented in March were the results of a coroner's review, which 
was not completed until later that spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The review included a re-enactment of the incident using lifelike dummies and 
sheriff's vehicles. As a result of the review, the coroner's office concluded 
that the cause of Robin's death was homicide -- as opposed to an accidental 
death -- as reflected on the June 15 death certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that re-enactment, that review, could have made a difference, but 
maybe not," the juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department policy now restricts all training with loaded weapons to 
the sheriff's academy, and bars the use of any firearm in field training 
sessions. Even a clearly marked toy -- such as a red plastic gun -- is now off 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can use your finger (to simulate a gun during training), but that's it," 
said Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Tom Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Many deputies say Robins' killing has heightened their awareness about safety, 
making the deputy a positive force even after his death. "I know they reflect 
on this a lot. It's been a difficult year," said Robert MacLeod, general 
manager of the Assn. of Orange County Sheriff's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The case remains under review by the U. S. Department of Justice to determine 
whether federal civil rights charges might be warranted against Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins' widow and his mother have claims against the county -- often a 
precursor to a lawsuit. The county did not reject the claims in writing, but 
has allowed the 45-day response period to expire, opening the way to possible 
court action. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Robins is suing the county for $15 million, claiming that the 
department knew officers routinely trained with loaded weapons in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Fisher, the slain deputy's mother, alleges that Scanlan violated her 
son's civil rights and that Scanlan had a history of reckless conduct and 
racial discrimination -- allegations that have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach Scanlan and his attorney were not successful, and Robins' 
survivors have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Christmas. This is all a reminder to them," said Anne Yeager Higgins, 
who is representing Fisher.

RUSSIA PLANES CONTINUE ATTACKS ON GROZNY; CHECHNYA: THE FIFTH STRAIGHT DAY OF 
BOMBING COINCIDES WITH THE ANNIVERSARY OF MOSCOW'S AFGHAN INVASION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moscow's warplanes struck the devastated capital of Chechnya on Saturday as 
Russians marked the 15th anniversary of another invasion that scarred and 
divided the nation -- the war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the shadow of the Afghan War in Chechnya," Izvestia columnist 
Teimuraz Mamaladze wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russian warplanes bombed Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Chechen 
republic, for the fifth straight day, Russian ground forces appeared to be 
tightening their noose around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine miles east of Grozny, Russian artillery pounded the town of Argun as 
terrified residents tried to salvage belongings from their devastated homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As his capital lay in ruins, Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev told 
Associated Press Television that "no army in the world, no military force, 
could carry out the Russian government's objective to break the spirit and 
freedom of the Chechen people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our genetic trait given by God," he said. "It is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev sat at a desk in a basement office in the presidential palace in 
Grozny illuminated by a single candle. Above were empty corridors, empty rooms 
and shattered glass. The palace was deserted except for guards outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government continued to insist it was hitting military targets. 
The media continued to defy its efforts at spin control. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers were both angry and elegiac as they compared the invasion of 
Chechnya, a small, mostly Muslim region of southern Russia, to the 1979 Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan, which Moscow occupied for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newspapers started writing the truth about the Afghan War 10 years after it 
started," the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said. "As for Chechnya, there is a 
chance to write the truth right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Izvestia disagreed: "We didn't know the truth then. We don't know the truth 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 But, it added, "in 1979 people kept silent, hiding their tears. Today nobody 
hides their feelings about the events in Chechnya." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin says it is fighting to keep the Russian Federation together. But 
the invasion is fiercely unpopular. Even President Boris N. Yeltsin's staunch 
allies bitterly criticize the brutal attempt to crush Chechnya's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen officials say hundreds of people have died since Russia invaded Dec. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's pre-dawn air strikes destroyed several buildings in Grozny, 
television crews returning from the battered city said. Among the buildings 
reduced to burning rubble was the city's main toy store, Children's World. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no information on casualties. But at midday, bodies still lay on the 
streets. An old woman sat weeping outside the ruins of her home, the bodies of 
her son and his wife still trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops have been moving toward the rebel capital from the west and 
south, but Chechen resistance remained stubborn. Russia's Independent 
Television reported Saturday that more troops were heading for Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide said Yeltsin, who underwent nose surgery Dec. 10, plans to spend 
several more days recuperating at his dacha outside Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin was, however, planning to confer Monday with his Security Council, a 
driving force behind the Chechen war.

FIGHTING SLOWS IN BOSNIA, U.N. OFFICIALS SAY; BALKANS: SITUATION AFTER 
CEASE-FIRE CALLED 'GOOD' EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN BIHAC POCKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. officials said Saturday that a cease-fire had slowed fighting across 
Bosnia except in the northwest enclave of Bihac, where Croatian Serbs and rebel 
Muslims were attacking government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations hoped to build a peace settlement around the cease-fire, 
which went into effect at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Croatian Serbs and the rebel Muslim troops, who did not sign the 
cease-fire pact, pressed ahead with attacks on Bosnian government troops around 
the town of Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac enclave, a U.N. spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Gary Coward, military spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force, told 
reporters, "The situation throughout Bosnia, including Sarajevo, is good with 
one exception, which is Velika Kladusa." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Croatian Serbs and Muslim rebels "continued with warring activities 
south of Kladusa. There were a few shells and significant small arms and heavy 
machine-gun fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Joseph, a U.N. spokesman in the Bihac pocket, said by telephone 
Saturday evening that the organized assault on Velika Kladusa had come from 
rebel Krajina Serb-held territory in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a concerted attack from the territory controlled by the RSK," 
the self-declared Republic of Serb Krajina, Joseph said, adding that it was 
unclear whether the forces involved were purely rebel Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting had hampered the movement of a U.N. refugee agency aid convoy for 
the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb radio, quoting rebel Muslim radio, said the rebels were pressing 
south to "liberate the whole of western Bosnia" from the government army's 5th 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo was peaceful despite three shots that rang out on the city's 
notorious "sniper alley" seven minutes after the truce deadline but caused no 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic 
signed the seven-day cease-fire with the United Nations on Friday and agreed to 
negotiate a four-month "cessation of hostilities" by next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cease-fire succeeds in halting almost 33 months of war, talks will 
resume on an international peace plan to divide the country between Serbs and a 
federation of Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 A trail of broken cease-fires in the past prompted caution among the Contact 
Group of nations -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- 
promoting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said in a statement that talks would start only when the United 
Nations verified that the cease-fire was working and the Serbs accepted the 
peace plan as a starting point for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations always knew the Bihac pocket was a weak link in the 
cease-fire based on mediation by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who was 
invited to Bosnia-Herzegovina by Karadzic last week in an effort to break 
months of deadlock in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim enclave of Bihac has been the scene of heavy fighting since 
October. Although Bosnian Serb army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic signed the 
cease-fire, the Croatian Serbs and rebel Muslim forces loyal to local 
businessman Fikret Abdic were not even invited to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bihac is essentially a sideshow compared with the broader war and 
diplomatic struggle between Bosnian Serbs and Sarajevo's Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic ordered his forces to stop fighting Friday, and U.N. spokesman Thant 
Myint-U said there was "a dramatic drop in military activity throughout Bosnia 
(on Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire agreement was boiled down to its essentials to remove issues 
over which the Serbs and Muslims have been wrangling for months. 
</P>
<P>
 These will be tackled as negotiators aim for a cessation of hostilities -- 
under which U.N. peacekeepers will be deployed between the warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues include a Muslim withdrawal from the demilitarized zone on Mt. 
Igman west of Sarajevo, the demilitarization of Muslim enclaves in Bosnian Serb 
territory and the exchange of prisoners of war and information about missing 
people.

GUNMEN SEIZE PARIS-BOUND JET IN ALGERIA; NORTH AFRICA: HIJACKERS ARE BELIEVED 
TO BE MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. SOME OF 283 ABOARD FLIGHT ARE RELEASED. TWO ARE 
REPORTED KILLED.

<P>
 Four gunmen be lieved to be Muslim extremists seized a Paris-bound French jet 
filled with holiday travelers Saturday and killed two of them, Algeria's 
Interior minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the hijackers was identified as Abdul Abdallah Yahia of the 
Armed Islamic Group, Algeria's most violent and radical fundamentalist group. 
</P>
<P>
 France Info Radio said the hijackers demanded the release of Abassi Madani and 
Ali Belhadj, the two top leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front, a 
more moderate fundamentalist group. 
</P>
<P>
 Madani and Belhadj are being held by Algerian authorities under house arrest 
after being released earlier this year from Blida prison where they were 
serving 12-year sentences for activities against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking of the plane and its 283 occupants came nearly three years after 
Muslim fundamentalists began their revolt against the nation's military-backed 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers had freed at least 57 hostages by Saturday evening, officials 
said. One freed hostage said the gunmen had handed out veils for women to cover 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen demanded that the plane take off for an undisclosed destination, 
said Interior Minister Abderrahmane Meziane-Cherif. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those killed were an Algerian policeman who was a passenger on the plane and 
another person, Cherif said. Their bodies were dumped out of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Six gunshots were heard late Saturday night, but it was not clear who did the 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport sources said negotiations were under way. In two hijackings that ended 
peacefully in Spain earlier this year, the release of jailed fundamentalist 
leaders was demanded but rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers were being released in small groups. Most of them were women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crossed two bodies while leaving the plane," said a young woman who had 
been freed. She said the men "are armed, they are holding Muslim prayers and 
handed out veils for the women to cover their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 There were conflicting reports about how the men commandeered the plane. An 
Air France spokesman in Paris said the group, dressed as ground personnel, 
first blocked the Airbus jetliner at Algiers' Houari Boumedienne Airport 
shortly before it was to leave, then boarded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the men got on the 
plane while passengers were boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight had 271 passengers and 12 crew members aboard as it prepared to 
depart at 11:15 a.m., Air France said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces and firefighters took up positions around the airliner, and 
the airport was shut down and evacuated, officials said. The plane was parked 
about 300 yards from the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the passengers were Algerian. About 20 were French nationals, one was 
Tunisian, one Chinese and one Vietnamese, Cherif said. Two French diplomats 
also were said to be aboard, but a French Foreign Ministry spokesman declined 
to confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, worried friends and family members of the passengers gathered at 
Orly Airport late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim insurgency against the government in the former French colony has 
claimed more than 11,000 lives. It began in January, 1992, when the army 
canceled elections that a Muslim party was expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 foreigners have been killed since insurgents began targeting them 
in September, 1993, in an attempt to drive out the foreign capital and 
expertise that support Algeria's oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadly clashes between militants and security forces have increased in recent 
months, and blackouts have hit the capital in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces said they killed 40 more militants between Tuesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department issued an advisory Friday urging Americans to stay 
out of the North African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Air France has stepped up its security in recent months, leaving only two 
foreign employees and no planes in Algeria overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Air France canceled its flights to Algeria scheduled for today.

 Fire fanned by stiff wind engulfed a house early Saturday and killed five 
children and two adults in their sleep, officials said. The cause of the blaze 
was under investigation, but neighbors said there was a power outage and 
several surges during the night as a storm struck New England.

SUICIDE REPORTED UNLIKELY IN CRASH AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The wreckage of the small plane that crashed on the White House lawn in 
September indicates the pilot was trying to land and not commit suicide, a 
newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found the wing flaps and throttle in a position that would 
indicate the craft was landing, the Baltimore Sun reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen Cessna cleared a fence before careening about 50 feet across the 
South Lawn. The 38-year-old pilot, Frank Corder, was killed. He was the plane's 
only occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service spokesman Carl Meyer said investigators "were looking for 
indicators of a landing versus a crash. That is part of the $64,000 question." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's owners, Joseph Mancusi and Joseph Kesser, said federal 
investigators told them about the flap and throttle settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those settings show Corder was "trying to land as slowly as he could," Mancusi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, told his brother the 
night before the Sept. 12 crash he was "checking out." But John Corder said his 
brother also had expressed admiration for Mathias Rust, the German teen-ager 
who landed a plane in Moscow's Red Square in 1987.

CHRISTMAS EVE STORM BATTERS EAST

<P>
 A storm that blustered up the length of the East Coast on Saturday left 
thousands without power and littered highways and railroad tracks with tree 
limbs on one of the year's busiest travel days. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm was blamed for at least two deaths.The South Carolina Highway Patrol 
said a 25-year-old woman was killed when her car skidded through water and 
struck a tree, and another woman drowned after she was struck by a vehicle 
during the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 High wind knocked over the 50-foot Christmas tree outside the Prudential 
Center in Boston. Crews waited for the wind to die down before trying to put it 
back up. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds gusted above 80 m.p.h. during the night on Massachusetts' Nantucket 
Island, where some commuter flights were canceled. Winds up to 70 m.p.h. 
thrashed trees in Connecticut, where about 110,000 homes were without power. 
Outages also affected thousands of homes in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amtrak Night Owl from Washington to Boston was delayed Saturday morning 
near New London, Conn., because of trees on the tracks, a railroad spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm slowed traffic at East Coast airports, causing delays for many 
holiday travelers.

WHO REALLY RUNS JAPAN?; ON LEADERSHIP, NAKASONE RANKS HISTORICAL INSIGHT THE 
NO. 1 QUALITY; EX-PREMIER: IN HIS FIVE-YEAR REIGN, HE BOOSTED DEFENSE SPENDING, 
STRENGTHENED SECURITY, HELPED REVIVE U.S. RELATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1983. Then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was determined to 
privatize Japan National Railways, a bureaucratic behemoth awash in red ink. 
There was one problem. The railway's president was resisting. So Nakasone did 
what no politician had done before to one of Japan's powerful bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 He fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a giant earthquake to the bureaucrats," Nakasone recounted with relish 
in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics screamed that the tactic was brute and bullish. 
</P>
<P>
 But it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakasone privatized the railway, telephone and tobacco monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable five-year reign, he also boosted defense spending, 
strengthened security ties with the West and helped revive U.S.-Japan relations 
through his "Ron-Yasu" friendship with then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially feared as a dangerous nationalist bent on rearming Japan, Nakasone 
turned out to be one of the nation's supreme statesmen, analysts say. And amid 
the growing cries here for stronger politicians, Nakasone's experience provides 
a lesson in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nakasone was as decisive a leader as any who had come to Washington in a long 
time," George P. Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state, wrote in his memoirs. 
"Unlike other Japanese leaders who waited for consensus to form, he was ready 
to move out front." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakasone was born in 1918, the son of a lumber merchant. He graduated from 
prestigious Tokyo University and, campaigning on a white bicycle to symbolize 
the emperor's horse, won election to the House of Representatives in 1947 at 
age 29. Always outspoken, he wrote a paper saying the Allied Occupation was 
crippling Japan's democratic development. Gen. Douglas MacArthur reportedly 
tore it up in fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakasone's direct, showy style also handicapped him in Japan's political world 
of consensus and ambiguity. In his 47 years in politics, the Liberal Democrat 
headed ministries such as transportation, international trade and defense. But 
he was so unpopular that party kingmakers promoted even the bungling Zenko 
Suzuki over him for premier. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakasone finally won the top post in 1982 in a deal with the Liberal 
Democratic Party's then-godfather, Kakuei Tanaka. "I had always intended to be 
prime minister," he said. "So by the time I finally (was), I had had 20 years 
of preparation." 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong student of history who still reads voraciously, he had enough 
policy ideas to fill 20 notebooks. But he also had a grand vision of leadership 
-- to be Japan's first "presidential prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
 In short order, Nakasone made his mark with a surprise 1982 visit to South 
Korea to improve relations. In January, 1983, he triumphantly visited 
Washington bearing political gifts such as a Japanese defense-spending 
increase, pledges to exchange military technology and a plan to liberalize 
import duties on 75 items. He established an instant rapport with Reagan, 
telling him: "You be the pitcher. I'll be the catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 To push his domestic policies through a reluctant bureaucracy and political 
world, analysts say, Nakasone relied on two crucial elements: shrewd staff 
selection and direct public appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say his masterstroke was appointing fellow Liberal Democratic 
legislator Masaharu Gotoda as his chief Cabinet secretary and point man to 
bring the bureaucrats to heel. Gotoda invoked fear and respect among 
bureaucrats because of his own long experience as one -- particularly his post 
heading the national police apparatus. To handle the Liberal Democratic Party, 
Nakasone appointed Susumu Nikaido, Tanaka's chief lieutenant, as secretary 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was envisioned that if the three of us teamed up, it would be the most 
invincible combination ever," Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also bypassed the bureaucracy by forming his own brain trust of 30 advisory 
councils on everything from deregulation to education reform and using them to 
appeal to the media. Nakasone said he got the idea from President John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His effectiveness was enhanced by his tenure -- the longest of any prime 
minister since 1972. His record public approval ratings helped him fight off 
his political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he failed in introducing a consumption tax -- a failure he blames on 
his own impatience. Many of his council recommendations, such as more 
educational flexibility, were ignored. "Nakasone's government raised a variety 
of issues, but none of them flowered or bore fruit," Gotoda was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakasone, who handpicked his successor after he had served an extended, 
maximum term as prime minister, does not hesitate when asked the most important 
quality for a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historical insight," says Nakasone, who still serves in Parliament, "is the 
most important foundation for good decision-making."

VIETNAM PRAISES ITS 6 MILLION CATHOLICS, ASKS THEIR HELP IN IMPROVING NATION 
</P>

<P>
 Vietnam's Communist leaders have made a Christmas gesture to the country's 6 
million Roman Catholics, praising their contribution to national development, 
official media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Premier Vo Van Kiet met the new Vietnamese cardinal, Pham Dinh Tung, on 
Friday, after the cleric returned from his investiture in the Vatican by Pope 
John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiet conveyed the best regards of the Communist Party's executive Central 
Committee and of the government to Catholics nationwide, the official Vietnam 
News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiet spoke highly of the contributions made by the Vietnamese Catholics, 
including bishops and priests, to the entire people's cause. . . ," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he hoped the Vietnamese Catholics would integrate into the community 
more closely, contributing to help the country get out of backwardness and 
narrow the gap between Vietnam and countries in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Tung, the Archbishop of Hanoi, thanked the government for its concern and said 
Catholics are ready to share the tasks of renovation, the agency reported. 
Tung, 75, is Vietnam's third cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Christianity was introduced in Vietnam in the 16th Century and flourished 
under French colonial rule. Catholics form about 8% of the population of 72 
million, most of whom are Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's Communist Party oversees church activities and insists on 
reviewing candidates for appointment as bishops.

U.S., CUBA SAID TO BE IN ACCORD ON NEWS BUREAUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and Cuba are planning to allow news organizations 
to exchange bureaus in an agreement that would break 25 years of difficult 
access for journalists, the Miami Herald reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the plan is expected early next year, the Herald reported, 
quoting unnamed State Department and White House sources. 
</P>
<P>
 After Havana expelled the last U.S. correspondent based in Cuba in 1969, the 
United States shut down all Cuban news bureaus except the one at U.N. 
headquarters. Reporters from both countries have since had to apply for visas 
on a temporary, case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The visa requests of American journalists are often turned down or ignored by 
Cuban officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration plan calls for setting up reciprocal news bureaus in each 
country and for the approval of licenses that would allow U.S. news 
organizations to spend money in Cuba to establish operations there. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban officials declined to say publicly how they would respond to the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration took a step toward opening news links with Cuba by granting 
visas to nearly a dozen Cuban journalists to cover the Summit of the Americas 
earlier this month in Miami. One of the reporters defected.

MOST HAITIANS HAVE LEAN CHRISTMAS; CARIBBEAN: POLICE MONITORS THROW PARTY FOR 
450 CHILDREN. GIS TO HAVE TURKEY, TRIMMINGS; SOME STILL GRUMBLE.

<P>
 Some U.S. soldiers grumbled Saturday about being stuck here for Christmas, 
despite free concerts and tons of turkey and pumpkin pie for Christmas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The American troops at Camp Democracy, their main base near the airport, 
entertained themselves on Christmas Eve with talent shows, a barbecue, a 
10-kilometer run and two concerts by rhythm-and-blues singer Kissie Darnell. As 
they played volleyball, hungry Haitians gawked at them through their base 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army's Christmas activities focused on its own. It planned no formal 
handouts of food or toys to Haitians, whose country is the hemisphere's 
poorest. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the capital, police monitors from 20 nations, here to retrain and 
observe Haitian police, threw a party for needy kids at Christ-Roi Roman 
Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
 They handed out sneakers, watches, toys and candy to about 450 squealing, 
wide-eyed youngsters. Raymond Kelly, the former New York City police 
commissioner and chief of the monitors, paid for the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contacted this church, got the names and shoe sizes of the kids, then 
Santa called out each of their names with a gift," Kelly said. "We gotta do 
what we gotta do." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of youngsters outside pressed against barred windows screaming "Papa 
Noel!" at monitors spokesman Paul Browne, dressed up as Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas is a big event in Haiti. Throughout the crowded capital, poor people 
emerged from slums dressed in their best clothes -- small girls with crisp pink 
dresses and hair ribbons and men and boys in suits and ties -- for church. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio stations played French and Haitian Christmas music nonstop. Peasants 
sold scrawny Christmas trees to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 A French military transport plane brought 10 tons of donated food, medicine, 
clothes and toys for needy Haitians on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were up to us, we would bring in 10 planeloads, when you see all the 
misery they have here," said Joachim Palladino, a French gendarme who is part 
of the multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 yards from the U.S. base, alongside the choked airport road, Lise 
Josephat, 28, sat by her wheelbarrow full of sugar cane sticks, chewed here as 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she makes between $2 and $5 a day, barely enough to feed her two 
young daughters, who sat barefoot in the dust at her feet. Their father fled by 
boat with other refugees about 18 months ago, at the height of army terror 
under the former regime, and she hasn't heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what she planned for Christmas, Josephat chuckled, then said, 
"Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some rice and beans at home. Maybe the church people will give my kids 
something else to eat," said Josephat, who lives in the Cite Soleil slum. 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. base, the holiday ambience didn't comfort some soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Somalia last Christmas and in Germany for two years before that," 
said Spec. Carl Savoy, 24, of Washington, D.C. He'll be on guard duty all day 
today. "I could think of funner places to be now." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 5,800 U.S. troops in Haiti were to have Christmas Day off. 
</P>
<P>
 For their Christmas dinner, U.S. military planes flew in 3,000 pounds of 
turkey, 2,000 pounds of roast beef, 1,000 pounds of shrimp, more than 12,000 
pounds of fruits and vegetables, 4,000 pounds of hard candy and enough pumpkin 
pie and fruitcake for all the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers a lot of us," Staff Sgt. Dennis Johnson, 25, said of the poverty 
that surrounds him. "We're not supposed to give them food because that draws 
huge crowds around the vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, from Tallahassee, Fla., has a wife and 2-year-old daughter at his 
base in Ft. Bragg, N.C. He's been in Haiti since U.S. troops arrived to remove 
army rulers in September and restore populist President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
whom the army ousted in 1991.

COALITION SPLITS IN BURUNDI; VIOLENCE FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The main Tutsi party quit the coalition government here Saturday, pushing this 
Central African state one step closer to the abyss of a Rwanda-style blood 
bath. 
</P>
<P>
 State radio quoted Charles Mukasi, president of the Union for National 
Progress (Uprona), as saying the withdrawal from the government and National 
Assembly coalition set up Sept. 10 was immediately in force. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in Nairobi, Kenya, 
quoted Mukasi as urging his supporters to "avoid chaos" -- but Uprona's move 
could increase tensions after a week in which 30 people were killed in clashes 
in the capital between the minority Tutsi and majority Hutu ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, President Sylvestre Ntibantuganya, a Hutu, and his Burundi Front 
for Democracy (Frodebu) party urged Uprona to come to the negotiating table to 
discuss the political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council, France and Belgium have also urged Burundi's 
political leaders to avoid plunging the country into the kind of tribal chaos 
that killed hundreds of thousands in neighboring Rwanda earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crisis began when Jean Minani, a Hutu disliked by Uprona, was 
elected parliamentary Speaker on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence, meanwhile, continued in parts of the capital, Bujumbura, despite a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew in force since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi first spiraled into chaos in October, 1993, when renegade Tutsi 
soldiers murdered popularly elected President Melchior Ndadaye of Frodebu, the 
country's first Hutu president. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup failed, but tens of thousands of Hutus and Tutsis died in retaliatory 
killings.

 "Zero inches of snow -- that's what I'm forecasting for Los Angeles on 
Christmas Day," meteorologist Kris Farnsworth said."That's a ballpark figure. 
Don't hold me to it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Christmas Eve storms caused scattered power outages and may have been a 
factor in a 10-car pile-up on the San Bernardino Freeway in Alhambra, 
forecasters say there is a chance that skies will clear this afternoon. But 
don't hold them to that, either. 
</P>
<P>
 WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times, estimates the chance of 
morning showers at less than 50%, while the National Weather Service predicts a 
20% chance of rain today. The last time it rained on Christmas in Los Angeles 
was 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 An afternoon high of 61 to 63 was forecast.

BABY FIGHTS ODDS, SURVIVES SCORPION STING; MEDICINE: THE 13-MONTH-OLD BOY GOES 
HOME FROM HOSPITAL LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER BEING BITTEN IN PUERTO VALLARTA, 
MEXICO. DOCTORS SAY FEW INFANTS SURVIVE.

 In what his family says is nothing short of a miracle, Anders Bjella came home 
from the hospital Saturday, just in time for his second Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-month-old son of Ross and Diane Bjella of Costa Mesa was near death 
after being stung repeatedly by a scorpion at a Mexican resort Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very happy Christmas," his mother, Diane Bjella, said soon after 
arriving at the family's home, which friends had decorated. "He has his spirit 
back. He looks like himself again." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders is expected to make a full recovery, she said, and doesn't even have 
marks on his foot, where he was stung by a scorpion that had crawled into his 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened as the Bjellas were getting ready to walk to a 
restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, where they were vacationing. Anders' parents put 
his shoes on him, and he yelped after taking a couple of steps. His parents 
said they thought he had hit his mouth, which had been sore because new teeth 
were coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the walk into town, Anders started crying uncontrollably and began 
frothing at the mouth. His parents rushed him back to their villa and 
discovered the scorpion when they took off his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bjellas took their son to two hospitals and heard the same bad news at 
each. There was little that anyone thought could be done for the boy, who had a 
temperature of 104 and had stopped breathing at times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of an emergency room doctor, they called a San Diego-based 
air ambulance and, 17 hours after he was stung, Anders was flown early Monday 
to San Diego Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Anders remained on life support until Wednesday, his parents constantly at his 
side. "He was a very, very sick youngster," hospital spokesman Mark Morelli 
said. "It took about 24 hours to even determine if he was going to live through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 people, mostly children under 3 years old, die in Mexico each year 
from scorpion stings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Bjella describes her son's recovery as a miracle. "The doctor at the 
first hospital said, 'We don't see scorpion babies because they all die.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, however, doctors said tests showed that Anders' heart was beating 
normally and that he was well enough to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Anders will be checked regularly by his doctors but is not expected to suffer 
any long-term health problems from the sting, Morelli said.

WAVE BREAKS BOARD, KILLING PRO SURFER 
</P>

<P>
 Mark Foo, a well-known pro surfer and television personality from Hawaii, 
crashed while riding a large wave Friday and was killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that Foo was riding a large wave when he lost 
control and the wave crashed onto him, breaking his board in three pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the pieces apparently struck him in the head and he went 
under, said Dave Cammock, chief investigator for the San Mateo County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred off Half Moon Bay, where surfers had flocked to ride 
swells that in recent days have been reaching 20 feet. The waves are the 
product of slow-moving storms and high winds that start in the open ocean and 
build in size and power as they roll toward shore. Foo, 36, of Haleiwa, Hawaii, 
heard about the conditions earlier this week and flew to California. After Foo 
went under, friends alerted the Pillar Point Harbor Patrol and a search began. 
His body was found about two hours later and retrieved from the mouth of Pillar 
Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-respected big-wave surfer, Foo was born in Singapore and raised in 
Hawaii. Foo and Mike Latronic, both former professional surfers, produced 
"H3O," a magazine format surfing TV show on cable television.

ROUGH WEATHER BUFFETS QE2 EVEN MORE; TRANSPORTATION: VIOLATIONS CORRECTED, THE 
SUPERLINER FINALLY LEAVES NEW YORK FOR CARIBBEAN CRUISE. THE SHIP THEN HITS 
25-FOOT WAVES, HIGH WINDS.

<P>
 The trouble-plagued Queen Elizabeth 2 luxury liner was braving high winds and 
25-foot waves Saturday as its star-crossed Caribbean Christmas cruise finally 
got underway. 
</P>
<P>
 The QE2 left New York Harbor about 1 a.m. EST after being delayed for 37 hours 
for a number of safety violations that had to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by telephone as the vessel was in the open Atlantic Ocean, the ship's 
radio operator said: "All I can tell you is that we're on our way to St. Lucia 
and we're on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there had been "no problems" so far. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Jim Tabor said the ship could continue to sail through 
rough weather as a storm system makes its way along the Eastern Seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's pretty rough seas out there, but it would depend on exactly 
where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabor said there were wind gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. and seas of up to 25 feet 
in different parts of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a low-pressure system out there, and it's slowly moving 
north-northeast and will be for the next 24 hours," Tabor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the winds were gale force, but so far they were coming in gusts 
and were not sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard had barred the QE2, the second ship named for Britain's Queen 
Elizabeth, from leaving New York after inspectors found numerous fire and 
safety violations aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard inspectors boarded the liner Thursday evening near Ambrose 
Lighthouse in New York Harbor and began what they called a "routine 
inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspectors said they noted several "safety-of-life-at-sea deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said the majority of the violations were fire and safety 
hazards in the aft part of the ship, including openings in the main 
vertical-zone bulkheads and other areas. The main vertical zones are 
fire-resistant continuous bulkheads that serve to contain a fire within a zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other violations were improperly working fire doors in the main 
vertical-zone bulkheads and obstructions in passageways. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said the ship's crew had to repair holes, fix the fire 
doors and remove obstacles from the passageways before being allowed to leave 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The QE2 was scheduled to sail at noon Thursday on a 15-day Caribbean cruise 
via Florida to St. Lucia, St. Martin, Barbados and Aruba. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 1,000 passengers booked for the Caribbean cruise had boarded 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 They took the place of other passengers who had arrived in New York earlier 
that day after a disaster-filled Atlantic crossing from Southampton, England. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those passengers said they had a nightmarish voyage, during which toilets 
flooded, running water turned brown and debris spilled into the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 The superliner had just undergone a $45-million renovation with most of the 
refurbishing done in Hamburg, Germany, according to a spokeswoman for Cunard 
Steamship Co., the liner's owner.

 An explosion and fire Saturday in an eight-story building in downtown Tokyo 
killed four people and injured 21 others. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion apparently occurred in a ventilation system on the second floor 
and was so strong it shattered windows in passing cars. The fire quickly spread 
to upper floors.

FESTIVE HOLIDAY SPIRIT RETURNS TO BETHLEHEM

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of pilgrims converged here Saturday to celebrate Christmas at the 
birthplace of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood reflected changes brought about by Middle East peace talks as 
tourists from Jordan, which ended a 46-year formal state of war with Israel 
with an October peace treaty, arrived under once-outlawed Palestinian flags and 
pictures of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the atmosphere in Bethlehem's Manger Square was the most 
festive since the Palestinian uprising launched in 1987 cast gloom over the 
town's Christmas celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thronging the town was a crowd estimated at more than 10,000, a sharp increase 
from past years. Marching bands played Christmas carols, and fireworks lit the 
cold, clear night sky, illuminating a skyline of church spires and festive 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors grilled meat over open coals and sold hot pudding from brass 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more beautiful than last year. It's more beautiful every year and, God 
willing, it will be even more beautiful next year," a 30-year-old Palestinian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sobering note was cast by the hundreds of Israeli soldiers armed with 
assault rifles watching from rooftops and street corners.

GOSPEL FRAGMENTS IN BRITAIN MAY BE CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNT OF LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bits of papyrus in an Oxford University library may be the oldest fragments of 
the New Testament Gospels and may even be a contemporary account of the life of 
Jesus Christ, the London Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Biblical scholars have traditionally believed that three scraps of text of the 
Gospel according to St. Matthew, inscribed in Greek, were written in the late 
2nd Century, or considerably after Christ's death, which is usually given as AD 
33. But German papyrus expert Carsten Thiede will publish a scholarly paper 
next month arguing that the fragments, kept at Oxford's Magdalen College, could 
be an eyewitness account of Jesus' life, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said the evidence on an early form of writing paper was a 
potentially important breakthrough in biblical scholarship, on a level with the 
discovery of the first Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scholars have questioned the accuracy of the New Testament as historical 
accounts because, they say, the texts were written long after the events 
described. But if Thiede has correctly dated the fragments, it would be 
evidence that the Matthew Gospel was written only a generation after the 
Crucifixion, or even earlier. Parts of the New Testament may have been written 
by men who actually knew Christ, rather than authors recounting a 2nd-Century 
version of an oral tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, the Magdalen fragments have been at the Oxford 
college since 1901. Little work was done on them after 1953 when they were last 
edited by biblical scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Thiede visited Oxford and inspected the papyrus. A close 
study of the script led to his conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Magdalen fragment now appears to belong to a style of handwriting that 
was current in the 1st Century AD, and that slowly petered out around the 
mid-1st Century," the paper quoted him as saying. "Even a hesitant approach to 
questions of dating would therefore seem to justify a date in the 1st Century, 
about 100 years earlier than previously thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The lines on the fragments are from the 26th chapter of the Matthew Gospel and 
include the oldest written reference to Mary Magdalene and the betrayal of 
Christ by Judas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiede's theory is expected to provoke controversy among scholars, who may 
question his reliance on the style of script to support his argument that the 
text was written earlier than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Peter Parsons, a papyrus expert at Oxford who believes that the 
fragments date from the 2nd Century or later, said Thiede's theory was "sloppy" 
and based on the wrong assumption that all scribes of the Jewish Diaspora wrote 
in the same script.

SUICIDE BOMBER AT ISRAEL BUS STATION HURTS 9; MIDEAST: THE EXPLOSION OCCURS AT 
RUSH HOUR ON A HIGHWAY NEAR JERUSALEM. MOST INJURIES ARE REPORTED TO BE LIGHT.

 A suicide bomber with explosives strapped to his body set off the charge at a 
busy bus station at the western entrance to Jerusalem today, killing himself 
and wounding a number of people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio reported that the explosion took place at 6:20 a.m. near the 
Binyanei Haooma convention center on the highway to Tel Aviv. The radio report 
said the explosion occurred at the start of rush hour and that nine people were 
wounded. The report said most of the injured appeared to be lightly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat at the bus stop and five meters (5 1/2 yards) away I hear a boom and 
glass all over the place and food and stuff flying all over the place. The guy 
was in the street, everyone's crying and everyone's going nuts. It's crazy," a 
young male witness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a man without legs and arms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness said: "I had just found a seat in the little bus stop and I 
just walked away, five feet away, and all of a sudden I hear a massive 
explosion and I turned around and I see glass everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The station I had just been sitting in two minutes ago was blown up. I see a 
guy lying on the floor, on the road, he had no legs," the second witness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the bomber was wearing a belt filled with explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses are a main mode of transportation in Israel, and every day large numbers 
of commuters gather at the bus station in front of the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of attacks carried out by Islamic militants in October and November 
claimed the lives of more than 30 Israelis and threatened to stall negotiations 
between the Palestinians and Israel over the expansion of Palestinian autonomy 
in the West Bank.

BIOGRAPHER OF BASEBALL LEGEND GIVES DEVIL HIS DUE; SPORTS: SCRIBE AL STUMP, A 
HUNTINGTON BEACH RESIDENT, SAW THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY OF EARLY CENTURY DIAMOND 
STAR TY COBB. THEIR ENIGMATIC RELATIONSHIP IS THE FOCUS OF FILM OPENING TODAY 
IN O.C.

<P>
 As a chilling dusk settled over a snowy Georgia graveyard on Christmas Eve, 
1960, sportswriter Al Stump knelt in a marble mausoleum and watched as an aging 
Ty Cobb, probably the most acclaimed and despised baseball player of all time, 
confronted the ghosts of his past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put his hand on his father's crypt, began to weep and said, 'Do you want 
to pray?' " Stump, a Huntington Beach resident, remembered. "Well what could I 
do? So I got down on my knees and prayed. That was the closest I ever got to 
him. Afterward he became all business again." 
</P>
<P>
 Few people saw anything resembling tenderness or vulnerability in Cobb, who 
was notorious for his hyper-aggressive ball-playing and abusive personality. 
Stump's rare vantage point gave him the insight to pen two books about the 
legendary "Georgia Peach." 
</P>
<P>
 The second book, a harrowing account of Cobb's final year, is the basis of a 
new motion picture titled "Cobb," which opens today in Orange County and stars 
Tommy Lee Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalism career of the 70-something Stump (he only gives his age, with a 
wink, as "2 over par") has seen him interview the likes of Hemingway and 
Bogart, Bugsy Siegel, Jim Thorpe and John Wayne, but Cobb remains the subject 
with which he is most closely associated. Stump lived with the raging, 
unpredictable Cobb for 14 months while he ghost-wrote Cobb's 1961 
autobiography, and their relationship is the subject of the new film. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrus Raymond Cobb, the first man inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame, 
dominated his sport as few athletes have. His lifetime batting average of .367 
still stands as the best mark, and three times he hit better than .400. More 
than that, Cobb brought new strategies and an intensity to the diamond that 
altered the way the previously pastoral game was played. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked obsessively during his 23-year career to master bunting. Cobb took 
base-stealing to a higher level, setting a mark that would last decades. Stump 
points to Cobb's famous cleats-high slides, his sharpened spikes used as tools 
of intimidation, as a perfect example of Cobb's take-no-prisoners attitude. One 
season that approach put a dozen opponents in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I wanted to call the second book 'Blood on His Spikes,' " Stump 
said, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wouldn't have been the great star if he hadn't had that extra 
something," Stump said recently while sipping coffee at the Shark Island Yacht 
Club in Newport Beach. "That extra something was an absolute need to win. He 
was inhabited by devils. He did things that were just about impossible for 
anyone else because he was obsessed with winning, more so than anybody you 
could think of." 
</P>
<P>
 The devils did not leave Cobb when he walked off the diamond. He was known as 
a gun-toting drunk, a bigot and a misogynist. He once allegedly pistol-whipped 
a man to death in a street fight, and another time he knocked out a disabled 
fan who dared heckle him. Two marriages ended in divorce, his wives driven away 
by his extreme cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Stump entered Cobb's life in 1960, when the irascible Southerner, dying from 
cancer, began looking for a chronicler to tell his story. Several writers had 
taken on the project only to be driven away by the acerbic Cobb, who was by 
then gobbling pills and chugging whiskey to keep his various aches and pains at 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stump, already a noted sportswriter and a feature writer published in Esquire, 
the Saturday Evening Post and Sports Illustrated, accepted the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The two became uneasy friends. Stump endured the 74-year-old Cobb's tantrums 
and excesses. The writer, who more than once had to duck a whiskey bottle 
thrown by Cobb, quit several times and was fired once, but returned again and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Holed up in the millionaire Cobb's mountain retreat -- the wily ballplayer had 
made a fortune in the stock market -- the duo cobbled together a sanitized 
version of Cobb's life that was published as "My Life in Baseball" in 1961 
shortly after Cobb's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was the end of it for me," Stump recalled. "I thought I had seen the 
last of Cobb's story. I didn't attend his funeral, and few other people did. I 
was fed up with him, I thought he was a monster who had no love for his fellow 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stump found it difficult to walk away. The book he had written, at Cobb's 
command, was a whitewash. There was no mention of the brawling or the 
rattlesnake personality, and no allusion to a dark chapter in Cobb's youth that 
soured his world view: A few weeks before a teen-age Cobb would first join the 
Detroit Tigers, his father was accidentally killed by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cobb's father was the most important thing in his life," Stump said. "Cobb's 
mother had done it, she had blown off his head with a double-barreled shotgun. 
She thought there was a prowler trying to get in her second-story window, and 
she shot him with the gun she kept next to her bed." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth about Cobb gnawed at the journalist, who felt he had shortchanged 
history by allowing his story to be only half-told. He eased his mind in late 
1961 when he wrote a revealing first-person account of the cabin months for 
True magazine. Thirty-three years later, he used that same piece as the first 
chapter of a second book on the ballplayer, this one titled "Cobb: A 
Biography." 
</P>
<P>
 The first printing of the unflinching biography, published by Algonquin Books, 
has sold out and, while early reviews of the new film are mixed, Stump is 
delighted with the wider audience that is learning about the underbelly of 
Cobb's towering legend. "And parts of the film," he said slyly, "are even 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Robert Wuhl ("Bull Durham," "Batman") portrays Stump in the film, while 
Academy Award-winner Jones portrays the aging, dying Cobb. Flashbacks show Cobb 
in his baseball heyday, but the lion's share of the film focuses on the writer 
and his ailing subject as they wrestle over the biography. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's director and screenwriter, Ron Shelton ("Bull Durham," "White Men 
Can't Jump"), said Stump's character gives the movie its humanistic, 
sympathetic platform, while Cobb is the "dramatic, operatic, mythic monster." 
</P>
<P>
 The film also allowed Shelton to work with Stump, a man the director viewed as 
a role model while growing up in Santa Barbara. "Growing up, I had only heard 
of one sportswriter, there was only one I could name on the planet, and it was 
Al Stump," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stump's recognizable byline was well-known across the country by the time he 
collaborated with Cobb. His eclectic career included a stint as a Navy 
correspondent during World War II and scores of features published throughout 
the '40s, '50s and '60s in publications as varied as TV Guide, American 
Heritage and Esquire. Twice he won the Best American Sports Story Award, and he 
has written seven books. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stump is recovering from a variety of health problems and has had 
recent open-heart surgery, the father of five is hard at work on another book, 
this one about horse racing. Most days, though, he enjoys his semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit a golf ball around the neighborhood a lot," he said. "Got all kinds of 
hazards built in. A lot of trees and dogs attack you and things like that. Then 
I go out on the course and I can't hit anything." 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, he and his wife, former Los Angeles journalist Jo Mosher, stop by 
the American Legion Hall to watch sports on television, although Stump says he 
has little love for the modern-day athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I told you what I really think, you couldn't print it," he said in a 
reference to a sports scene full of strikes and court cases. "I'm completely 
disgusted with the American athlete today. Oh, as far as ability, there's no 
comparison with the old boys. I think Ty Cobb would be one of the few 
old-timers who could compete with the great ones today on even terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that joke about Cobb?" the crusty sportswriter said, cocking his 
trademark hat to one side. "What would he hit if he was batting today? He'd hit 
about .320. How could that be? Well, you got to remember he'd be about 100 
years old."

LITTLE BOY GETS GIFT OF LIFE; CHILD'S SURVIVAL CALLED A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE AFTER 
HE IS STUNG BY A SCORPION IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what his family says is nothing short of a miracle, little Anders Bjella 
came home from the hospital Saturday, just in time for his second Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-month-old son of Ross and Diane Bjella of Costa Mesa was near death 
after being stung repeatedly by a scorpion at a Mexican resort Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very happy Christmas," his mother said soon after arriving at the 
family's home, which friends had decked with balloons and a large Christmas 
tree. "He has his spirit back. He looks like himself again." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders is expected to make a full recovery, she said, and doesn't even have 
marks on his foot, where he was stung by a scorpion that had crawled into his 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened as the Bjellas were getting ready to walk to a 
restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, where they were vacationing. Anders' parents put 
his shoes on him, and he yelped after taking a couple steps. His parents said 
they thought he had hit his mouth, which had been sore because new teeth were 
coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the walk into town, Anders started crying uncontrollably and began 
frothing at the mouth. His parents rushed him back to their villa and 
discovered the scorpion when they took off his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bjellas took their son to two hospitals and heard the same bad news at 
each. There was little that anyone thought they could do for the boy, who had a 
temperature of 104 degrees and had stopped breathing at times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of an emergency room doctor, they called a San Diego-based 
air ambulance and, 17 hours after he was stung, Anders was flown early Monday 
to San Diego Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Anders remained on life support until Wednesday, his parents constantly at his 
side. Every organ in his body had been affected by the toxic venom of the 
creature, which turned out to be among the most lethal types of scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very, very sick youngster," hospital spokesman Mark Morelli said. 
"It took about 24 hours to even determine if he was going to live through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 people, mostly children under 3 years old, die in Mexico each year 
from scorpion stings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Bjella describes her son's recovery as a miracle. "The doctor at the 
first hospital said, 'We don't see scorpion babies because they all die.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, however, doctors said tests showed that Anders' heart was beating 
normally and that he was well enough to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was running around the hospital ward, opening drawers," said his mother, 
who is four months' pregnant with her second child. "We just feel so grateful 
for the care we got." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders will be checked regularly by his doctors in the next year but is not 
expected to suffer any long-term health problems from the sting, Morelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a close call," he said. "We're just happy he's going to be fine. . . 
. We're happy this story has a happy ending."

2 MEN KILLED, 2 WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS; CRIME: POLICE SUSPECT GANG MEMBERS WERE 
THE ASSAILANTS IN THE UNRELATED INCIDENTS, ONE EARLY SATURDAY MORNING, THE 
OTHER LATE FRIDAY NIGHT.

 A 19-year-old college student was killed and two of his friends were injured 
in a Christmas Eve shooting in a residential neighborhood, police said. A 
separate shooting in front of a convenience store late Friday left another 
young man dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Fernandez, 19, was gunned down shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday by unknown 
assailants who chased him and his friends in a car and on foot, police said. 
Santa Ana Sgt. Ken Ice said Fernandez and his friends were shot at as they 
drove to a home in the 1700 block of Carlton Place and that one of the 
assailants followed them, firing a semiautomatic handgun, as they pulled into a 
driveway and tried to run inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe the suspects are gang members, but the victim was 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members spent Christmas Eve making funeral plans and grieving at their 
Santa Ana home, said the victim's father, Victor Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a big family. We were planning to stay here in my house with my 
family. Now what's going to happen? Nothing," Victor Fernandez sighed. 
"Everybody's here crying. Nobody can believe it. We are devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Fernandez was hit in the upper torso and died at the scene, Ice said. His 
friend Robert Molina, 19, was wounded in the arm, while Jose Martinez, 18, was 
shot in the chest. Both were treated at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated shooting, 20-year-old Alejandro Montes of Garden Grove was 
shot several times in the chest shortly before 11 p.m. Friday night as he sat 
in a car parked outside a convenience store at 3312 W. 1st St. Montes was 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police they heard several shots at about 10:40 p.m., but no 
assailants were seen, Ice said. The driver of the car Montes was sitting in was 
inside the store at the time, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect gang members were also involved in the Montes slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was arrested in either incident, and both are being investigated by 
detectives in the city's gang unit, Ice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Santa Ana, Rene Fernandez was the oldest of four children. He 
graduated from Valley High School in 1993 and was attending classes at Orange 
Coast College while working part time at South Coast Plaza, family members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Fernandez said his son has never before been in trouble and did not 
belong to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a perfect boy, but he was 90% good, no trouble at all," Victor 
Fernandez said. "He was for everybody . . . but sometimes nobody was for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Fernandez said he and his wife saw Rene late Friday night and knew he 
was going back out with some friends at about 1 a.m. They were sleeping when a 
friend came running into their home about 2:30 a.m. screaming that Rene had 
been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sleeping in my home," Victor Fernandez said. "A friend of Rene's came 
to tell me that Rene was lying somewhere, but I never thought . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a brutal assassination," he added. "There's no motive for the 
shooting. It's like a coldblooded murder. These guys, they don't know him, he 
doesn't know them. This guy, he doesn't have no soul. . . . Maybe God can help 
him and change his life."

CHILDREN'S TALES OF AIDS; STORIES ARE TOLD BY 8 YOUNGSTERS WHO HAVE HIV AND HAD 
TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE WAY TOO EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Once there was a tree who wondered if the weed next to it had a virus. The 
weed didn't say anything, but the tree told the other weeds. Finally, the tree 
made the weed really upset. The weed said, "You know, I may have a virus, but 
it's not right for you to take all my friends away. Who cares if I have a 
virus? It's not right!"  
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Tree and the Weed Virus," by Angela, 11 
</P>
<P>
 Many children infected with the virus that causes AIDS keep their condition 
secret, fearful of being ostracized by their classmates or losing their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But a small group of youngsters who have HIV, and in some cases full-blown 
AIDS, is speaking out through a book of short fables and fairy tales, "Friends 
for Life."  
</P>
<P>
 The book, recently published by the nonprofit Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS 
Network, is written and illustrated by eight members of a juvenile support 
group sponsored by the network, which provides social and medical case 
management aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody at school knows," said one of the writers, 12-year-old Geena Goldman, 
who became infected through a blood transfusion as an infant. Like the others 
interviewed for this story, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because 
of the stigma attached to the condition: "I'm afraid they won't want to be my 
friends anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In Geena's story, one of five in the book, a princess and a prince fall in 
love, but the princess -- and her newborn baby -- contract AIDS from the 
prince, who dies. A family member eventually cures the baby and princess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another piece, "The Special Princess," a little princess with the virus 
takes her medicine diligently and goes on living: 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia had to take medicines, but she didn't mind because she was alive and 
well and healthy. She believed with all her heart that there would one day be a 
cure.  
</P>
<P>
 "Friends for Life" began as a therapeutic writing exercise more than a year 
ago, when Pediatric AIDS Network staff purchased make-a-book kits for the 
support group, which meets at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. The emotional 
depth of the stories by the children, ages 8 to 14, stunned the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a look at them and just said 'Wow!' " recalled Marcy Kaplan, who 
directs the network. "We had to turn them into a collection." 
</P>
<P>
 The stories reflect the feelings of anger, frustration and rejection felt by 
children with HIV and AIDS, but they also reflect hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, a ghost who died from AIDS unleashes his anger by haunting a house. A 
brave chemist cat moves into the house with a family and comes up with a cure 
for the ghost. In another, animals infected with HIV are picked on by a mean 
classmate until the school principal, a troll, makes peace among them and they 
become friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Strained from living with secrets, the parents of the young authors and 
artists see the book as a tremendous emotional release for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being involved with AIDS, they know a lot of things they shouldn't know about 
at this age," said Robin Goldman, Geena's mother. "They know all about how AIDS 
is passed on, like sex and drugs, things you normally wouldn't tell a child 
except in vague terms. But it's just part of the world, and they know about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tina Smith, whose 9-year-old daughter, Nina, provided several drawings: 
"I think it's been a way of her releasing some of her anger and some of the 
fear and anxiety she has." Both mother and daughter have been diagnosed with 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The book includes a section on what HIV is and how it is transmitted, 
illustrated by the children and annotated by Mary Whalen, the former 
facilitator for the support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can learn about it, and learn that they can't catch it from hugging 
someone or kissing someone," said 11-year-old Nicole Lucas, who was born with 
HIV. "You can't catch it just from drinking out of a cup or something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pediatric AIDS Network has distributed 100 copies of the book to local 
hospitals with pediatric AIDS programs and social service agencies nationwide 
that serve children infected with the virus. A second printing of 250 should be 
out by the beginning of January for distribution to hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's goal is to get enough grant funding to distribute free books to 
all the families who come through the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies will be available to the public through the network for $20. All 
proceeds will go into printing more books, said Marcy Kaplan, director of the 
Pediatric AIDS Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot written about kids and AIDS, but nothing written by kids," she 
said. "Maybe it will cause someone to have second thoughts." 
</P>
<P>

cure, public-health issues and the global spread of the disease is available on

ALL'S NOT LOST IF SANTA FALLS SHORT; MEMORIES: DISAPPOINTMENT CAN LINGER OVER

 It's a Christmas wish that Mickey Aubain wishes she could forget. Even nearly 
80 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd asked for a doll," she remembers. "My sister and I had both asked for 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the 3-year-old and her 5-year-old sister excitedly tumbled out of bed 
and raced to the Christmas tree in search of the dolls they had asked Santa 
Claus to bring, they weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Aubain regrets that Santa stiffed her. And she's not the only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the season of good tidings and great cheer doesn't always live up to 
the expectations of tiny imaginations. Santa may forget a child's Christmas 
list. But kids don't -- even after they grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so very disappointed," said Aubain, now an 82-year-old retired Lockheed 
worker who lives in Chatsworth. "I've never forgotten it -- I was so very 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 There had been every reason to believe that Santa would deliver. She had been 
a good little girl that year on the Eastside, where the family lived, Aubain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she and her sister, Ethel, had even met Santa in person -- posing as 
sleeping tykes with him for a 1915 Christmas cover photograph for the Los 
Angeles Times magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Canada Flintridge, nuclear engineering consultant James Owens vividly 
remembers the Christmas in the late 1920s when he asked for a pony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 7 and living in Middlesboro, Ky., and I wrote Santa and told him what I 
wanted," Owens said. "We were poor folks, so it wasn't surprising I didn't get 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Koch-Weser, an advertising executive from Cheviot Hills, was 11 when 
Santa brought him a bicycle. Unfortunately, it was about four years too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of Christmases when I was 7, 8 and 9 that I was really 
wishing for a bike," Koch-Weser said. "Problem was, my parents were intent on 
me saving some of my money for one and then they'd pitch in the remainder." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Santa finally came through, "the excitement about getting a bike 
was kind of over," Koch-Weser said. "My parents had worked the 
earning-your-own-bike thing to the bone. Each year I'd think, 'My gosh, when is 
this going to end?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Bradley, a mother of four who lives in Valencia, was 8 when she asked for 
play equipment for the back yard of the Canoga Park home where she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted one of those big poles that have a circle of rings on them that you 
swing on like a carousel," Bradley said. "I was convinced I'd wake up on 
Christmas and there it would be. It didn't seem unreasonable at all to ask for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers being shocked when she didn't receive it that year. In fact, she 
never got it. "I was devastated. I can't even remember what I got that year -- 
it didn't make an impact." Some Christmas wishes are clearly out of the reach 
of Santa Claus and all his elves put together. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 5, my mom took me to a big department store and I asked Santa to 
bring my father back for Christmas," said Gloria Sander, a Silver Lake resident 
who is a curator at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1963 and my dad was working in Saudi Arabia. I remember wishing for 
him to come back and wanting it very deeply." Her father finally returned home 
the following Easter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babette Wilk, a Studio City interior decorator, said unfulfilled Christmas 
wishes are routine for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean all those years I wished for world peace?" she asked. "I haven't 
given up." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has her daughter, Wilk said. "She's still wishing for a pony. And 
she's 29." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there's no reason for parents to feel guilty if their child's 
Christmas wishes didn't come true today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have to understand what's realistic," said Deborah Stipek, a 
developmental psychologist and professor of education at UCLA, who runs an 
on-campus elementary school that serves as a university laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should tell the child right away that something's not a possibility. 
You increase their expectations if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Stipek said parents can handle children's disappointment over Christmas gifts 
by apologizing and saying, "You've given me some good ideas for your birthday 
or next Christmas." The child's attention should be then directed toward the 
toys that he or she did receive, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Most children get over their disappointment on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lewis, a marketing consultant from Bel-Air, said she had wished for a 
doll from Hong Kong when she was 5. "I was anticipating it so much. A friend of 
my parents was going there and was supposed to get it but she came back without 
it. I was so disappointed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Lewis traveled to Hong Kong and briefly considered buying the 
doll she never got. "I decided to buy clothes instead," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Aubain, she eventually got her Christmas wish. Her mother and an older 
sister teamed up two years later to get her a Christmas doll. And that launched 
a doll collection that Aubain maintains to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have happiness now," said Aubain -- who with her husband, John, has 
decorated their mobile home with 9,000 Christmas lights this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year my wish is for good health."

NO ONE IGNORES BILLY PRICER THESE DAYS; EDUCATION: AS THE HIGH SCHOOL BOARD 
PRESIDENT IN THE HIGH DESERT, HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUSH HIS AGENDA. TO SOME, HE 
IS A FAMILY VALUES HERO, TO OTHERS A BOMBASTIC IDEOLOGUE.

 The first time Billy A. Pricer went before the local school board to propose 
an idea he thought would strengthen the moral fiber of students, he was 
summarily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired deputy sheriff turned minister and anti-gang activist told the 
board that students should be given random, voluntary urine tests for drugs. If 
the results came back clean, students would be rewarded with discounts at movie 
theaters, bowling alleys and music stores. Those who tested positive would be 
offered drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stinging 4-1 vote, the Antelope Valley Union High School District board 
shot down Pricer's plan, citing concerns about the accuracy of drug tests and 
the impact on students who chose not to undergo testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was made to feel like an imbecile for even coming up there," Pricer recalls 
bitterly. "It was embarrassing and humiliating to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pricer, now 52, did not just get angry -- he got himself elected to the 
school board, where he has just finished a productive year as president of the 
very panel that once rebuffed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his leadership, the board was the first in the state to refuse to 
administer the California Learning Assessment System test -- better known as 
CLAS -- because Pricer and other board members believed that it promoted 
anti-family values. The action kicked off months of bitter statewide debate 
before the board was vindicated -- funding for the test has now been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer also advocated the use of truancy sweeps in which deputies rounded up 
students who ditched class, then brought them to a counseling center that pays 
Pricer a salary. Most recently, he made it into the national news when he 
promoted a program that pays a $25 reward to any student who turns in a 
classmate for possessing drugs or weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 To many in this High Desert community, all this has made Pricer a 
clear-thinking hero. To others, he is a bombastic ideologue. But one thing is 
certain: No one is dismissing Billy Pricer anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent this community," said Pricer, who has a year left on his term. "I 
believe in family values, moral values. They've been made to be dirty words. 
But what in the world is wrong with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, a native Californian who serves as a pastor at a Lancaster church that 
came to national attention for producing anti-gay videos, sees his policies as 
just common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call you a right wing fundamentalist," said Pricer of his critics. "I 
didn't know I was a fundamentalist. I'd rather believe the decisions I make on 
the board come from a common sense perspective. I've seen the basics work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his harshest critics are local teachers who say Pricer is trying to 
shape what is taught in classrooms instead of just making district policy 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he overstepped the bounds of his role as president of the board of 
trustees," said Kathleen Parks, an English teacher at Quartz Hill High School. 
"He is dictating issues of curriculum and administration of the school district 
and not allowing professional educators to do the job they were hired to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster elementary school teacher Joanne Opdahl is critical of Pricer's 
student tipster plan. "I think there's an absurdity that a student is going to 
do this for $25," Opdahl said. She said his policies are "intellectually 
shallow," simple solutions to complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pricer was the leading vote-getter in the 1991 school board election and 
his support in this politically conservative area seems solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Burch, an Antelope Valley businessman and Republican Party activist, 
considers Pricer his closest friend. "I like his policies, and I'm behind him 
100%," said Burch, who serves on the executive board of Pricer's nonprofit 
counseling center. "He's worked with youths. He's worked with gangs. I don't 
think I have an adequate vocabulary to express how much I appreciate and love 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of his political opponents say they admire his administrative 
abilities. Shortly after Pricer was elected to the school board, an audit 
revealed that the district's budget deficit was $12 million, far more than had 
been estimated. The board laid off more than 100 employees and made other 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Pricer announced that the district had returned to solvency. 
Charles Whiteside, who served on the school board from 1991 through 1993 and 
has opposed Pricer on the CLAS issue, says Pricer played a key role in the 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked a lot of critical, probing questions regarding the district's 
financial situation," Whiteside said. "He provided critical leadership and 
support in implementing that fiscal recovery plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominently displayed in Pricer's counseling center office is a picture of him 
with Oliver L. North, who came to the Antelope Valley on a speaking appearance 
a couple of years ago. On the bookshelf is a volume called "Christian 
Counseling" and a book by Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer's conservative outlook may spring in part from his traditional 
upbringing in Blythe, Banning and later Anaheim, where his father was a 
telephone company supervisor and his mother was a real estate broker. He was 
not always a model student, particularly in elementary school where he was 
paddled occasionally for misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helped keep me in line," he said. "If my mother or dad heard I got 
whacked in school, I'd get whacked again at home. If some of my teachers knew I 
was a school board president, they'd probably roll over in their graves." 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint in the Navy, Pricer worked briefly for the phone company before 
becoming a sheriff's deputy, first in Orange County, then in Los Angeles 
County. A 1975 ambush by gang members sent him to the hospital for three weeks 
with a fractured skull, broken ribs and an eye injury. He later retired from 
the department because of continuing eye problems and still receives disability 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next decade, he worked at camping resorts, ran restaurants and 
earned a master's degree in psychology and counseling. In 1984, Pricer and his 
wife, Deborah, took jobs with the American Adventures Forest Lakes Resort, a 
recreational vehicle and tent camping center in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to the High Desert, Pricer began attending church at Antelope 
Valley Springs of Life in Lancaster and eventually became an associate pastor. 
The small church came to national attention as the producer of "The Gay 
Agenda," a widely distributed video that Pentagon officials and members of 
Congress used in opposing a move to allow openly gay men and lesbians to serve 
in the military. Pricer says he was not involved in "The Gay Agenda" project 
but does not disagree with its message. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after the gang-related shooting death of an 18-year-old Antelope 
Valley High School athlete, Pricer set up a gang information hot line in his 
home. He later founded the nonprofit United Community Action Network to offer 
counseling for troubled teen-agers and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to take a gang away from a kid," said Pricer, who earns a 
$42,000 annual salary as executive director, "you have to provide an 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is funded by state, county and local grants, along with corporate 
and private donations. It has four paid employees, including Pricer and his 
wife. During fiscal 1992-93 its budget peaked at about $250,000. This year, 
Pricer said, the budget dropped to $180,000 because of a falloff in government 
and private aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was particularly hard hit during the summer when the city of 
Palmdale, which had been providing $25,000 annually, cut its grant to $5,000. 
Council members said it was part of a citywide belt-tightening. But Mayor Jim 
Ledford also said he was concerned about how the group was spending its money, 
with more than 50% of the budget going to staff salaries. Also, some teachers 
and community leaders expressed concern about the close relationship between 
the high school district and the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've been watching real closely is the issue of the 
schools' truancy program, and the Sheriff's Department doing sweeps and then 
turning in all the students to UCAN," said George Salas, president of Latinos 
for Social Justice. "I don't know whether there's any kind of a conflict or 
not, but it sure gives the appearance of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer flatly denies that any of UCAN's funding is tied to the number of 
truants the group assists. "If I never took in another truant, it wouldn't 
affect my budget at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pricer's stint as school board president ending, some local leaders 
believe he has set his sights on running for the Palmdale City Council or the 
state Assembly. Pricer declines to comment on his future. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does say that he did not put forth his controversial programs for 
personal political gain. Fame, he says, is just a byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about the limelight," Pricer said, "but I enjoy the challenge."

QUESTIONS LINGER A YEAR AFTER DEPUTY KILLED HIS COLLEAGUE; INVESTIGATION: SOME 
ON COUNTY GRAND JURY THAT HEARD RELATED TESTIMONY ARE JOINING IN CRITICISM OF 
THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after a deputy sheriff shot and killed a fellow deputy during an 
impromptu training session on Christmas Day, 1993, questions raised by the 
shooting incident have not waned, and in some instances have only grown more 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a full year has passed, the deputy who fired the fatal shot has not 
returned to work, and a decision on any disciplinary action he might face is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Brian P. Scanlan was placed on paid leave after shooting Deputy Darryn 
Leroy Robins in the face on Dec. 25, 1993, behind a Lake Forest theater, where 
Robins -- apparently trying to demonstrate how bad guys can get the drop on 
officers -- pulled a concealed weapon and pointed it at Scanlan during a mock 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, Scanlan "jerked back," and fired a single shot into the 30-year-old 
deputy's face, according to a subsequently released statement Scanlan made to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing triggered a lengthy controversy that was not put to rest even by a 
county grand jury ruling in the matter, not the least because Scanlan is white 
and Robins was black. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, minority leaders tried unsuccessfully to get state or federal 
authorities to take over the formal investigation into the slaying, voicing 
concerns that the investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office 
might be tainted by its need to preserve good working relations with the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office concluded that Scanlan had been "grossly 
negligent" and says it wanted Scanlan charged with involuntary manslaughter. 
But county prosecutors left the final decision in the hands of the Orange 
County Grand Jury that was sitting at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 That grand jury -- which was then under fire for not having enough minority 
panel members -- declined to issue an indictment, and that decision effectively 
sealed for all time the transcripts of what transpired behind closed doors in 
the grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 For minority leaders who raised questions about the pace and thoroughness of 
the investigation, the secrecy enshrouding the case has only left wounds to 
fester.  
</P>
<P>
 "Deputy Scanlan will forever have this hanging over his head, (and) we will 
forever have questions about what really happened that day. Nothing has really 
been solved in that way," said Eugene Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men of 
Orange County, a group that found itself leading efforts to get answers about 
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although suggestions that race influenced the handling of the case were 
disputed by law enforcement, investigative records, and even Robins' widow, it 
nonetheless remains a sore point for Wheeler and others. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time, grand jurors who listened to testimony in the case are 
joining some of the critics -- although they do not agree that race played a 
role in the killing or the subsequent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim retiree John Jeffers Baird, one of the panel's members, said he 
remains "surprised" by the grand jury's decision not to indict. But he refused 
to say how he voted on the case, noting that grand jurors who reveal details of 
the secret proceedings can be charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is it was a very painful episode, and I can assure you I will 
never forget it," Baird said. "I can say I was very surprised at the way it 
turned out, after the information we were given." 
</P>
<P>
 But another grand juror who spoke on the condition that his identity not be 
revealed went further. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (prosecutors) didn't have to do the dirty work, because we did it for 
them," said the juror. "The DA decided to come to us because they knew what the 
outcome would be when you bring a case like this before a bunch of older 
retirees, with only a few minorities" among the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone deserved to be indicted, he deserved to be indicted," the juror 
said. "I'm not saying he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail. But 
this was grossly, grossly negligent. I will be troubled by this until the day I 
die. I can't think of Christmas without thinking of this." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Guy Ormes, who oversees special assignments at the Orange 
County district attorney's office, strongly disagreed with the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went down there asking for an indictment. No one disagrees with that, so I 
don't think anyone can say otherwise," Ormes said. Noting that the case was an 
emotional one, Ormes said a public consensus would never be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there were people who criticized the grand jury and our office. . . . 
But had the grand jury voted for an indictment, people would have been upset 
about that," Ormes said. "No one has ever been happy about this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors who spoke about the case agreed that prosecutors presented it 
in a professional and unbiased manner. But missing from the information 
presented to them in March, 1994, were the results of a coroner's review, which 
was not completed until later that spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The review included a re-enactment of the incident, and lifelike dummies and 
sheriff's vehicles were used to re-create the event. As a result of the review, 
the coroner's office concluded that the cause of Robin's death was homicide -- 
as opposed to an accidental death -- as reflected on the June 15, 1994, death 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that re-enactment, that review, could have made a difference, but 
maybe not," the juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things have changed since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department policy now restricts all training with 
loaded weapons to the sheriff's academy, and bars the use of any firearm in 
field training sessions. Even a clearly marked toy -- such as a red plastic gun 
-- is now off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can use your finger (to simulate a gun during training) but that's it," 
said Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Tom Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many deputies say Robins' killing has given them a heightened sense of safety, 
making the slain deputy a positive force even after his death. "I know they 
reflect on this a lot, it's been a difficult year," said Robert MacLeod, 
general manager of the Assn. of Orange County Sheriff's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The case remains under review by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has 
been looking to determine whether federal civil rights charges might be 
warranted against Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins' widow and his mother have not filed suit against the county, although 
they have filed claims -- often a precursor to a lawsuit. The county did not 
reject the claims in writing, but has allowed the 45-day response period to 
expire, opening the way to possible court action. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of the two claims also illustrates the divisions people feel 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Robins, the widow, has indicated she will seek $15 million from the 
county, claiming that the department knew officers routinely trained with 
loaded weapons in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Fisher, his mother, alleges that Scanlan violated her son's civil 
rights and that Scanlan had a history of reckless conduct and racial 
discrimination -- allegations that have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach Scanlan and his attorney were not successful, and Robins' 
survivors have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Christmas. This is all a reminder to them," said Anne Yeager Higgins, 
who is representing Fisher.

OFFICIALS WEIGH PROPRIETY OF PAYING CITRON'S LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As investigators trace how Orange County's financial crisis unfolded and 
explore the possibility of wrongdoing by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron, officials are questioning whether they are obligated to foot the 
bill for Citron's legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a statutory deadline, county officials said Saturday they are close to 
rejecting Citron's appeal for help in paying his mounting legal costs, because 
of a growing "pattern of deception and misrepresentation" in the former 
treasurer's investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 After a flurry of meetings and telephone conversations late Friday, attorneys 
for Citron and the county worked out a last-minute agreement to extend for 12 
days the legal time frame for responding to Citron's request that his fees be 
covered, according to high-ranking county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry C. Andrus said Saturday the county now has until Jan. 5 
to reach a decision on whether to pay Citron's legal expenses, but declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that the county has any legal discretion, a decision will be 
based solely on what is in the best interest of the county and not anyone or 
anything else," Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a public agency is required to defend and indemnify an 
employee for non-fraudulent acts or omissions that occur within the scope of 
employment, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county's Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing may shield it from 
Citron's request that his legal fees be paid, according to a source close to 
the case. Because the Chapter 9 filing protects the county from virtually all 
lawsuits, Citron might have to line up with the county's numerous other 
creditors in order to recoup legal fees, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home Saturday, Citron declined to comment. His attorney, David 
Wiechert, did not return numerous telephone calls to his home and office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said he had not yet decided whether he believes 
the county should pay legal expenses for Citron, whose risky investment 
practices pushed the county into bankruptcy three weeks ago and imperiled the 
savings of 185 cities, school districts and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's financial dealings are under investigation by the Orange County 
district attorney, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the state 
Department of Corporations, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigations progress, "things seem to be evolving from a question of 
poor judgment to more serious considerations," Steiner said in reference to 
Citron. "I'd sure like to hear a more comprehensive explanation from his view, 
but maybe that won't come out until the SEC and DA finish their 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, weary county officials grappled Christmas Eve with the challenge of 
drumming up holiday spirit after days of dealing with the financial crisis. 
"It's the weirdest Christmas I think I've ever been through," incoming 
Supervisor Marian Bergeson said as she fixed a Christmas Eve feast for 
relatives. "It's supposed to be such a happy time, and instead all of this is 
going on. It's tough on families." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, spent the day working at his 
Los Angeles office. He spent about three hours sorting piles of mail that he 
has ignored during the past week and communicated via fax with other lawyers 
working on the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county administration complex in Santa Ana, most offices were locked 
and dark for the first weekend since the crisis began Dec. 1. Parking lots were 
empty. Homeless people replaced the crowds of county officials, lawyers and 
anxious employees, who had traversed the plaza near the buildings throughout a 
week during which officials announced that hundreds of county workers may be 
laid off as a result of sweeping budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the entrance to the treasurer-tax collector's office, a group of charity 
workers distributed clothing to several dozen needy people. 
</P>
<P>
 When Citron announced his resignation in a letter Dec. 4, two days before the 
county's unprecedented bankruptcy filing, he orally requested help with any 
legal expenses he might incur, several county officials said. Nearly two weeks 
later, on Dec. 16, Wiechert made the same request in a letter to Andrus, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, the county has 20 days after receiving a notification to rule on an 
employee's request. But because Citron made two requests, county officials were 
uncertain which one had started the statutory time clock. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 20-day period began with Citron's oral notification, the deadline would 
have been Friday and top county officials said Andrus was prepared to deny the 
former treasurer's request. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a draft of a letter addressed to Citron's attorney that was not sent, 
Andrus cited a growing "pattern of deception and misrepresentation" involving 
the former treasurer's investment practices, sources said. Andrus has the 
authority to send the letter on his own, but the action would ultimately come 
before the Board of Supervisors for formal approval, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after eleventh-hour discussions with Wiechert, Andrus struck an agreement 
that made the Dec. 16 letter the official notification, giving him and other 
county officials until Jan. 5 to mull the issue over, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, county officials will ask Wiechert to share aspects of his 
defense strategy and explain why the county should not reject Citron's request 
for indemnification. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi's probe focuses on whether Citron warned 
investors that the county's portfolio was losing value and how he planned to 
guard against losses. Investigators have also asked for information on any 
contingency plans the county had to "extricate" itself from potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, meanwhile, has subpoenaed many documents, including appointment 
calendars, phone logs and campaign contribution material from Citron, all five 
county supervisors, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and top 
brokers for Merrill Lynch -- the county's top bond underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency is seeking to determine whether the brokerage gave campaign 
contributions or provided kickbacks to county officials in exchange for 
business, sources close to the investigation have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC and the Department of Corporations also are trying to determine 
whether Citron plunged the county an additional $600 million into debt during 
the summer to cover mounting losses in the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some city and school district officials have claimed that Citron misled them 
and gave them false assurances that their money was invested in a safe bond 
pool. Those officials said Citron never disclosed the ailing health and risks 
of the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who steps down from his post 
next month, said he was not aware of an effort by the county to avoid paying 
the former treasurer's legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who was preparing to attend Christmas Eve services with his family 
Saturday, said he could not comment on how he would vote on the legal fees 
issue. "I don't want to answer that. I would want to hear what the reasons, 
challenges and rules are on this before making a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors and Supervisor-elect Jim Silva could not be reached for 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, the Republican state senator from Newport Beach who was elected to 
Riley's seat on the board, said she, too, needs more concrete information about 
Citron's activities as treasurer before making a determination on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get a clearer understanding of the role he actually played," 
Bergeson said. "From what I've heard to this point, I think there were illegal 
activities involved, by virtue of the state laws that were not being followed" 
in Citron's investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really incredible to think that the hostility has gotten to this point," 
Bergeson said. "I just hope the healing of this county starts pretty soon."

IT WAS SAD DAY AT THE BIG A FOR RAMS FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The normally rambunctious fans in the north end zone of Anaheim Stadium had 
been relatively quiet for most of Saturday's game between the Los Angeles Rams 
and the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 But something set them off with about three minutes left, and it wasn't just 
the Ram jazz band's morbid decision to break into its rendition of "St. Louis 
Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that this could be the last time they cheer for their beloved 
Rams, who are expected to announce any day that they're moving to St. Louis, 
had finally set in. 
</P>
<P>
 All the frustration of a fifth consecutive losing season, a year's worth of 
rumors that the team was leaving, and their disdain for the team's front office 
seemed to come to a head in a spontaneous display of loathing directed at Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere's luxury suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Out came the giant banner: "Georgia is the Grinch!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the chants: "Georgia (expletive)! Georgia (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis (expletive)! St. Louis (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Rams! L.A. Rams!" 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, after the Rams had lost, 24-21, and the band had finished 
playing "Auld Lang Syne" and the crowd of 25,705 -- smallest in the team's 
15-season Anaheim history and smaller than those for two recent high school 
games at the Big A -- had filed out, a few hundred of the most loyal fans 
gathered outside Gate 7 for a short pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Megaphone-wielding Rob Julian of La Habra urged the team to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Monson of Upland cracked open a bottle of champagne to toast to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hunter of Huntington Beach drove off in his beat-up, 1974 Volkswagen 
van, hoping the slogans he painted all over the vehicle -- "Keep the Sheep! The 
Blue and Gold Should Be Sold! -- would not fall on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Sowers of Anaheim walked out wearing his Ram jacket, Ram sweater, Ram 
hat, Ram socks, Ram shoelaces, Ram water bottle and, yes, Ram boxer shorts 
under his jeans, wondering if he'd ever have reason to wear such paraphernalia 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozens of ushers, concession-stand and souvenir-shop workers and parking 
lot attendants went home, wondering if they would ever again work at a 
professional football game. 
</P>
<P>
 And Frontiere, who had watched the game from the second level of her two-story 
suite -- never coming down to mingle with her guests during the game -- quietly 
slipped out of the stadium, followed by a cargo load of boxes with her name on 
them, being moved from her suite to who knows where? 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day, a very traumatic experience," said Don Hewitt, who was 
finishing his 28th season as the Rams' equipment manager. "I hate to think this 
is our last game in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem right to call us anything but the L.A. Rams. Heck, I 
still call the (L.A.) Raiders the Oakland Raiders, the (Indianapolis) Colts the 
Baltimore Colts. It's a tough day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Frontiere's box, Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, who is heading 
the effort to keep the Rams in Orange County, waited for the owner to emerge, 
hoping to introduce her to his 8-year-old son, Jonathan, and pull at Georgia's 
heartstrings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to ask her to explain to my son why this football team that he's put 
his heart and soul into for his short life would be moving," Steinberg said. "I 
wanted to tell her that the concept of home is critically important and that 
the Rams have had a home here (in Southern California) for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Rams moved here from Cleveland in 1946, but alas, Steinberg never 
got the chance to discuss any of that with Frontiere. Twenty minutes had passed 
after the game and she still had not appeared. Steinberg had to go, his 
questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only exasperated Ram fan Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel powerless," said John Parker, a 58-year-old season ticket-holder from 
Mission Viejo. "I think there has been plenty of fan support here, but 
management has not made an effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense among fans that we have an absentee owner, that the 
management has no football savvy. I can't help but think how often I've seen 
the Dallas owner (Jerry Jones) on the sidelines, especially during the losing 
seasons. He was taking the heat, but we don't have that kind of ownership 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere and Ram President John Shaw, who has spent much of the past year 
negotiating with groups from St. Louis and Baltimore interested in the team, 
took some heat Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans vented their anger and frustration at what they feel has been a concerted 
effort on the Rams' part to disillusion them, thus making it easier to justify 
a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as though I've been lied to," said Dave Bueche, a 20-year 
season-ticket holder from Irvine. "I don't think for a minute they had any 
intention of staying. When the city (of Anaheim) gave the Rams an escape clause 
(from their stadium lease in 1990), they were gone, end of deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Linda Comstock, 46, of Tustin: "I think Georgia not showing up for the 
team picture (Friday) tells it all. I don't care if she had bronchitis. It's 
very disappointing. I don't think she'll show up today. She's too coward to 
show her face here. She put her team in Shaw's hands, and he destroyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Comstock's husband, Don, said he was "angry, depressed and discouraged," and 
fed up with the Rams' contention that Southern California can't support two NFL 
teams, that there aren't enough fans to warrant staying here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept talking about decreasing attendance figures," he said. "We kept 
looking at the decreasing number of wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Some felt Ram fans should at least bear part of the blame for the team's 
financial woes -- the Rams are projecting a $6-million loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town is too wishy-washy," said Monson, 27. "They follow the winners but 
don't support the losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Roger Kranz of Irvine: "When a high school game can draw more than an 
NFL game, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't all gloom and doom Saturday, though. Just inside the stadium's main 
entrance, Dan Robbins of Aliso Viejo was having his biggest day of the season 
selling game programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just about done selling my third box (of 120) and I usually don't even 
sell two boxes," said Robbins, 29. "A lot of people have said the program could 
be valuable as a collector's item some day, and some season-ticket holders told 
me this is the first time they've bought a program all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, too, because we work on commission. I usually make $140 a game, 
but I'll double that today. It's going to be a Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mindy Weiss, who works in the stadium's lower-level gift shop, also said sales 
were brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's trying to get that last souvenir," she said. "We don't have much 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were a lot quieter at stadium concession stands, however. With such a 
small crowd, there were no lines throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna have my lowest take of the year," said Harry Williams, a 
69-year-old from Huntington Beach who works in the stadium deli. "A lot of my 
regular customers said goodby after the last game."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Ram locker room, several players thanked those loyal fans in the north 
end zone, such as the guys who have stuck with the team every week while 
sticking watermelons on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be the last time I go through that tunnel, " said Ram safety 
Anthony Newman, who returned an interception for a touchdown in the first 
quarter. "My hat has to go off to those fans. They've been there all year, 
whether we win or lose, and they're always screaming for us. I wouldn't trade 
them for the world. They're the true fans." 
</P>
<P>
 If only there were more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the fans here, and it's unfortunate that we haven't fielded a 
product that they could be happy about," said offensive tackle Jackie Slater, 
who finished his 19th season with the Rams Saturday. "But when you think of a 
city where there's 50,000 fans ready to embrace you, you kind of look forward 
to that."

SCHOOL BOARD'S PRICER GAINS POWER, CRITICS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: 'FAMILY VALUES' 
MOTIVATE PANEL'S EX-PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Billy A. Pricer went before the local school board to propose 
an idea he thought would strengthen the moral fiber of students, he was 
summarily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired sheriff's deputy turned minister and anti-gang activist told the 
board that students should be given random, voluntary urine tests for drugs. If 
the results came back clean, the students would be rewarded with discounts at 
movie theaters, bowling alleys and music stores. Those who tested positive 
would be offered drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stinging 4-to-1 vote, the Antelope Valley Union High School District 
board shot down Pricer's plan, citing concerns about the accuracy of drug tests 
and the impact on students who chose not to undergo testing. 
</P>
<P>
 That was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was made to feel like an imbecile for even coming up there," Pricer recalls 
bitterly. "It was embarrassing and humiliating to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, now 52, didn't just get angry, he got himself elected to the school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently finished a year as president of the very board that once rebuffed 
him. It was a year in which he made up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his leadership, the board was the first in the state to refuse to 
administer the California Learning Assessment System test -- better known as 
the CLAS test -- because Pricer and other board members felt it promoted 
anti-family values. The action kicked off months of bitter statewide debate 
before the board was finally vindicated: Funding for the test has now been 
dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 Pricer also advocated the use of truancy sweeps in which deputies round up 
students who have ditched classes, then bring them to a counseling center that 
pays Pricer a salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently he made it into the national news when he promoted a program 
that pays a $25 reward to any student who turns in a classmate who is in 
possession of drugs or weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has made Pricer for many in this high desert community a 
clear-thinking hero. To others he's a bombastic ideologue. But one thing is for 
sure: 
</P>
<P>
 No one is dismissing Billy Pricer anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent this community," says Pricer, who has another year left on his 
current school board term. "I believe in family values, moral values. They've 
been made to be dirty words. But what in the world is wrong with (those 
values)?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Pricer, a native Californian who serves as a pastor at the Lancaster 
church that came to national attention for producing anti-gay videos, his 
policies are just common sense.  
</P>
<P>
 "They call you a right-wing fundamentalist," says Pricer of his critics. "I 
didn't know I was a fundamentalist. I'd rather believe the decisions I make on 
the board come from a common-sense perspective. I've seen the basics work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't come from all of these experimental educational approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his harshest critics are local teachers who say Pricer is trying to 
shape what is taught in local classrooms instead of just making district policy 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he overstepped the bounds of his role as president of the board of 
trustees," says Kathleen Parks, an English teacher at Quartz Hill High School. 
"He is dictating issues of curriculum and administration of the school district 
and not allowing professional educators to do the job they were hired to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who is a teachers union officer, also charges that Pricer is neglecting 
campus problems that are less likely to generate headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "My classroom has not been swept for four weeks straight because they're not 
hiring custodians," Parks says. "But the board is distracted by dogmatic issues 
and political issues, and they're not taking care of business. I have never had 
a board member in my classroom, watching students being taught. I don't think 
they're interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster elementary school teacher Joanne Opdahl criticizes in particular 
Pricer's student tipster plan. "I think there's an absurdity that a student is 
going to do this for $25," Opdahl says.  
</P>
<P>
 She believes his policies, in general, to be "intellectually shallow." 
</P>
<P>
 "He provides what he sees as very simple solutions to very complex problems," 
she says. "He seems to feel he has all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pricer was the leading vote-getter in the 1991 school board election, and 
his support in this politically conservative area seems solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Burch, an Antelope Valley businessman and Republican Party activist, 
considers Pricer his closest friend. "I like his policies, and I'm behind him 
100%," says Burch, who serves on the executive board of Pricer's nonprofit 
counseling center. "He's worked with youth. He's worked with gangs. He's a 
counselor. He's a pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I have an adequate vocabulary to express how much I appreciate 
and love him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of his political opponents say they admire his administrative 
abilities. Shortly after Pricer was elected to the school board, an audit 
revealed the district's budget deficit was $12 million, far more than had been 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The board laid off more than 100 employees and made other spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Pricer announced that the district had returned to solvency. 
Charles Whiteside, who served on the school board from 1991 through 1993 and 
has opposed Pricer on the CLAS issue, says Pricer played a key role in the 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked a lot of critical, probing questions regarding the district's 
financial situation," Whiteside says. "He provided critical leadership and 
support in implementing that fiscal recovery plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Burch says that Pricer's critics have wrongly labeled him an ideologue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Christian right-winger (label) has been a media thing to bash people who 
have the ideas that we do," Burch says. "We try to stick as close to the 
Constitution as it was framed by the Founding Fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominently displayed in Pricer's office in his counseling center is a picture 
of him standing with Oliver North, who came to the Antelope Valley on a 
speaking appearance a couple of years ago. "He needed an armed escort from the 
airport because he'd received some threats on his life," Pricer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was a very articulate, interesting individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The office bookshelf includes a volume called "Christian Counseling" and a 
book by Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer's conservative outlook may spring in part from his traditional 
upbringing. He grew up in Blythe and Banning, moving to the Anaheim area as a 
teen-ager. His father was a telephone company supervisor, his mother a real 
estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, who stands about 5-foot-8 and appears to be quite fit, was not always 
a model student, particularly in elementary school, when he recalls being 
paddled occasionally for misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helped keep me in line," he says. "If my mother or dad heard I got 
whacked in school, I'd get whacked again at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If some of my teachers knew I was a school board president, they'd probably 
roll over in their graves." 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint in the Navy, he worked briefly for the phone company, then 
became a sheriff's deputy, first in Orange County, then Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer spent two years in narcotics work, getting a look at what he calls "the 
other side of the world." He was promoted to sergeant and returned to street 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, while following up on a call about two men fighting outside an 
apartment building in Pico Rivera, he and two other deputies kicked in the door 
of an apartment where they thought the men might be hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ambush, Pricer says. When the deputies entered the apartment, they 
were attacked by 15 people Pricer says were gang members. He was hit in the 
head by a flying beer bottle that shattered his sunglasses and sent a fragment 
into his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Tom Pigott, now commander of detectives at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station, was one of the deputies who arrived to aid the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I recall, it was quite a donnybrook," Pigott says. Pricer "was bleeding 
very heavily. We thought he had lost the eye. Obviously, he was injured, but he 
was responding and trying to defend himself as best he could." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer spent three weeks in the hospital with the eye injury, a fractured 
skull and broken ribs. He later retired from the department because of 
continuing problems with his eye, and he still receives disability pay. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next decade, he worked at camping resorts, ran restaurants and 
earned a master's degree in psychology and counseling. In 1984 Pricer and his 
wife, Deborah, took jobs with the American Adventures Forest Lakes Resort, a 
recreational vehicle and tent camping center near the town of Lake Hughes in 
the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to the area, Pricer began attending church at Antelope Valley 
Springs of Life in Lancaster and eventually become one of its associate 
pastors. The small church, located in an industrial area, came to national 
attention as the producer of "The Gay Agenda," a widely distributed video that 
Pentagon officials and members of Congress used in opposing a move to allow 
openly gay men and lesbians to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer says he was not involved in "The Gay Agenda" project but does not 
disagree with its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the product is accurate," he says. "They used professionals to give 
them opinion. They simply took footage of what was happening, and they 
explained it." (A Times report on the video revealed that key statistics used 
in the tape were long ago discredited by the scientific community.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, following the gang-related shooting death of an 18-year-old Antelope 
Valley High School athlete, Pricer set up a gang information hot line in his 
home. He later founded the nonprofit United Community Action Network to offer 
counseling for troubled teen-agers and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 UCAN now sponsors "Wise-Talk," a Scared Straight-type program in which 
parolees present vivid descriptions of prison life to teens who have had 
run-ins with the law. UCAN also sponsors baseball and basketball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to take a gang away from a kid," says Pricer, who earns a 
$42,000 annual salary as executive director of UCAN, "you have to provide an 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 UCAN is funded by state, county and local grants, along with corporate and 
private donations. It has four paid employees, including Pricer and his wife. 
During fiscal 1992-93, its budget peaked at about $250,000. This year, Pricer 
says, the budget dropped to $180,000 because of a falloff in government and 
private aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was particularly hard hit last summer when the city of 
Palmdale, which had been providing $25,000 annually to UCAN, cut its grant to 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said it was part of a citywide belt-tightening. But Mayor Jim 
Ledford also said he was concerned about how UCAN was spending its money, 
pointing out that more than 50% of its budget was going to staff salaries. And 
some teachers and community leaders expressed concern about the close 
relationship between the high school district and UCAN. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've been watching real closely is the issue of the 
schools' truancy program, and the Sheriff's Department doing sweeps and then 
turning in all the students to UCAN," says George Salas, president of Latinos 
for Social Justice. "I don't know whether there's any kind of a conflict or 
not, but it sure gives the appearance of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer flatly denies that any of UCAN's funding is tied to the number of 
truants the group assists. "If I never took in another truant, it wouldn't 
affect my budget at all," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pricer's stint as school board president ended, some local leaders 
believe he has his sights set on running for Palmdale City Council or the state 
Assembly. Pricer declines to speculate on that, saying he hasn't even decided 
whether he'll run again for school board next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does say that he did not put forth his controversial programs in an 
attempt to make political gains for himself. The fame and infamy that has come 
to him, he maintains, is just a byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about the limelight," Pricer says, "but I enjoy the challenge."

STORM BRINGS COUNTY A WET CHRISTMAS EVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa and his reindeer were drenched Saturday night when a south-moving storm 
dumped rain on Orange County beginning about 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A forecaster expected the showers to last through the night and into Christmas 
morning, with cloudy skies remaining all afternoon. Orange County could collect 
as much as an inch of rain by the time the storm moves out, according to James 
McCutcheon, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, "it could be some showers, mainly in the morning," McCutcheon said. 
"I'd expect those to taper off through the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific storm began Saturday afternoon in Santa Barbara and gained 
strength as it drove south, McCutcheon said. Thunder and lightning accompanied 
the rain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted high temperatures in the low 60s Christmas Day, with the mercury 
dropping to about 40 on Sunday night.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; FROM DREAM 
HOUSE TO REAL ESTATE NIGHTMARE; ECONOMY: STRUGGLING MARKET TARNISHES LIFE FOR 
GOLDEN STATE HOMEOWNERS LOOKING TO SELL. 'THERE'S A REAL BAD TASTE IN MY 
MOUTH,' SAYS ONE WHO'S MOVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, Darrel and Carol Swendener give black, rueful little laughs at the 
idea of California as the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 In their eyes, there's nothing golden about the place, its politics or its 
economy -- especially after they lost $125,000 in 1994 on a Porter Ranch house 
with a sweeping view of the San Fernando Valley, the house that was to be their 
dream castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fulfilling their dreams, the 2,730-square-foot spread turned into a 
real estate hell that hundreds of Valley homeowners came to know too well as 
they reflect on 1994 and even 1993: the house that would not sell. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a time marked by compromised privacy as endless looky-loos with white 
gloves wandered through bedroom and bathrooms, making the Swendeners feel like 
a fishbowl family, a couple whose lives were forever on display. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $340,000 for the house in 1989 and sinking more than $90,000 in 
improvements into it, the couple put it on the market for $579,000 in 1992 and 
waited for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 And waited. 
</P>
<P>
 And waited. 
</P>
<P>
 As time passed with no nibbles, like sellers all over the Valley, Darrel 
Swendener had to keep slashing the price, which dropped to $335,000 by 
midsummer 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the Swendeners finally sold the house for $308,000 -- accepting the 
only offer they had in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When that offer finally came, the couple jumped like lovesick salmon in the 
river's homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only offer we got," Swendener says. "For us, the torture continued 
right up to the very end." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has since bought a home out of state. They don't want to say where. 
They're bitter, financially damaged and hope to never see another Golden State 
sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real bad taste in my mouth," said Swendener, a 58-year-old retired 
Sears employee. " You walk out of a house and lose $125,000 and see how you 
feel. We've learned a lesson from all of this -- stay out of California. I 
don't like the smog or the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most of all, I don't like the fact that everyone in the state is either 
out to chisel you or make a fast buck at your expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors portray the Swendeners as an example of those who bought homes near 
the crest of the mid-1980s real estate boom, only to find when it ebbed that 
they could not even make back their original investment if they wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're typical," said Joe Andrews, co-owner of Century 21 All 
Properties in Chatsworth. "One side of the coin says that sales are increasing. 
Our own records show that our 1994 listings were up 6.2% over the previous 
year, and that through November our sales were up 77% over the same period in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the other side of that same coin sees prices going down. At the same 
time, interest rates are going up. In the end, it's still a declining market. 
This couple was just one of its many, many victims." 
</P>
<P>
 If the coin had a third side, it would show the face of a grinning home buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Swendeners' financial dilemma, Russ and Camden Gardner saw opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Gardner grew up in the Porter Ranch area. Years later, living in Woodland 
Hills, he was looking to come home. "We wanted to move up here real bad," said 
the 33-year-old owner of a chimney-cleaning service. "But we couldn't even find 
a house for sale in the area. It was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 So the couple circulated flyers, made endless drives through surrounding 
neighborhoods. Then, last August, they saw a newspaper advertisement for a 
Porter Ranch dream home. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Camden Gardner: "The ad started off with something like, 'View, view, 
view!' I had looked through so many ads I didn't believe it at first. But it 
was true." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the asking price was $335,000, the Gardners offered $305,000 and 
stuck to their guns. In the end, their agent lowered her commission by $3,000 
to make the deal happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realtor said there was no way they would accept our offer," Camden 
recalled. "We were afraid we might insult them. But the deal eventually stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardners recalled the sellers as a shellshocked couple who just wanted 
out. And the Gardners knew a good real estate deal when they saw one. "You 
could tell they just wanted to go, they wanted out of the house," Russ Gardner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Peplow, a realtor with Fred Sands Realty who represented both parties 
in the sale, said she offered the $3,000 to make both sides happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real estate transaction is like a divorce," she said. "Neither party really 
feels satisfied. But in reality, the Swendeners should have been real happy to 
sell their house. No one else made them an offer. In my opinion, both sides 
came out winners." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swendeners aren't buying that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just happy to be out of California," Darrel Swendener said. "At this 
point, I wish we had never come there in the first place. Those five years were 
sheer hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Swendener recalls the last time he drove away from their former dream home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I looked at each other and said, 'Thank God, we're finally 
leaving.' " he said. "It's funny in a sad sort of way, the place was supposed 
to be our castle. But the market destroyed it, and it destroyed our dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Great Depression. We feel like we've lost everything. Now we've 
got to start over."

GREAT EXPECTATIONS; SPIRIT: PARISHIONERS OF ST. JOHN EUDES DECORATE THEIR 
'TENT' SANCTUARY AND SAY THEIR CELEBRATION IS MORE SPECIAL BECAUSE IT IS 
MAKESHIFT.

 Mary Breeden has been to the Vatican. She's seen some of the great cathedrals 
of Europe, with their towering ceilings and heavenly frescoes painted by the 
masters. 
</P>
<P>
 But in her eyes this Christmas Day, the most beautiful church on the planet 
will be right here at home -- a towering white plastic dome -- where Breeden 
and other parishioners at St. John Eudes Catholic Church have been celebrating 
Mass since their stately 30-year-old church was severely damaged in January's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, while much of Los Angeles angled for a parking spot at the mall, 
jammed airports or faced the gridlock at cash register lines, about two dozen 
volunteers spent several hours transforming their makeshift church into a 
festive holiday sanctuary fit to host midnight Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This experience has taught us a lesson that we will keep this holiday 
season," said Breeden, chairman of the Liturgy committee. "A church is not a 
building. A church is the people who inhabit it. It's a sense of community. And 
we have that here in abundance." 
</P>
<P>
 The St. John Eudes Catholic Church structure at Lassen Street and Mason Avenue 
suffered severe damage during this year's Northridge quake. Even today, huge 
metallic braces prop up an entire wall that was disconnected from the rest of 
the building -- a reminder to all of the sheer power of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 After using a cramped social hall for services, the 3,000-family parish in 
March began construction of the temporary structure on church grounds -- a 
shelter that many have found too cold in the winter and like a sauna in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Christmas, they were intent on celebrating this drafty place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just call it our tent church," Breeden said Saturday as parishioners hauled 
in Christmas trees, climbed on ladders to hang wreaths and festive holiday 
lighting -- always stopping to exchange holiday greetings. "Some people call it 
the big white Hershey's kiss. Whatever you call it, it's home to us. We have to 
do something to make it look like a church." 
</P>
<P>
 By early evening, this dome, with a capacity for 850 people, was certainly 
becoming cathedral-like. Especially after parishioners hung the burgundy and 
gold drapes, framed the altar with decorated twin Christmas trees and erected a 
life-sized manger scene off to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Jim Gergen had gone in search of Christmas trees but found the 
forces of capitalism working against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the day before Christmas and so either you couldn't find a tree or they 
wanted far too much for them," Gergen said, pointing to two smallish trees that 
merchants had asked $24 and $35 for, respectively. "I got them both for $30," 
he said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 For some like Breeden, the temporary quality of St. John Eudes brings back 
what the real spirit of Christmas is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus was born in a stable," she said. "This isn't a stable. But it's 
makeshift all right." 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas Eve, there would be standing room only outside the dome. And 
parishioners say the experience has given them some new ideas to incorporate in 
their reconstructed church, which they hope will be ready by the summer of 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the way the pews are arranged in a semicircle -- not the 
theater-like configuration of the old church. And they like the spaciousness of 
the altar area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all," Breeden said, "we like the sense of community this place has 
inspired in all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. The statue of the Christ child was missing.  
</P>
<P>
 The last time somebody saw it was in the rectory of the old building. But when 
it came time to build the manger scene, it was nowhere to be found. "Lots of 
things broke in the quake, so we didn't know what to think," Breeden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing the nuns who live at the church just happened to have an extra 
statue of the baby Jesus on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the scene had been set for midnight Mass, when the statue would make 
its processional entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Breeden: "There won't be a dry eye in the house."

 Linda Victor seizes the day, one by one. Geri Spagnoli still pens light verse. 
Dr. Paul Hackmeyer is back on the job delivering babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Sylbert keeps making people laugh. My softball teammate "Hank" is 
still in jail. His wife, "Julie," meanwhile, wants everyone to know she's 
sober. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is Christmas. The holiday season has always been a time of catching up, 
of reading those family newsletters and checking in with friends. One of the 
best things about this job, apart from the fact that it pays the bills, is the 
people I get to meet. The last couple of days, I caught up with a few. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quick: Where were you at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17? What did you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Victor, a seventh-grade English teacher at San Fernando Middle School, 
was asleep in her ground-floor apartment in a complex known as Northridge 
Meadows. She doesn't know how, but a violent jolt pitched her from a bed out a 
nearby window, just as the building started to collapse. Several neighbors were 
killed. Linda was barely scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 When I met Linda, she was marveling about the richness of life. The quake 
happened to hit after a rough year in which she had endured the breakup of a 
long romance and had counseled suicidal students. Today, Linda stills seems to 
marvel. Every sunset is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing good. I really have a rejuvenated sense of life . . . but I'm kind 
of dreading coming back to the date," she said of the upcoming anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 When we met, Linda was pondering a change of careers. People who read about 
her, or saw her describe her experience on TV, wrote and called, urging her to 
continue teaching. "A lot of people sent things to school. One lady donated 
books to my classroom, which is really nice. We're reading them. That gives me 
hope, because people were so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent education seminar, Linda and fellow teachers engaged in a "quick 
write" exercise, then were asked to read their prose aloud. Linda described her 
quake experience. "To me it was just matter-of-fact," she recalled. "A few 
people were in tears when I finished, and a couple people left the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows is now gone. Since the quake, Linda has been living at her 
parents' home a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's every day I say a prayer to God," Linda says. "It's like 
every other day: Thank you for letting me be here. Thank you for everything, 
the good and the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm so much wiser. Maybe I'm not. But I feel like it." 
</P>

 Methinks there is no bigger cheater  
</P>
<P>
 Than the guy who fixed my water heater  
</P>
<P>
 Geri Spagnoli's post-quake couplet still makes people grin. Moments of levity 
have helped Los Angeles' recovery, and Geri, a "60-something" resident of 
Calabasas, provided more than a few by self-publishing a thin volume of light 
verse titled "In the Wake of the Quake." Nine hundred copies are in 
circulation. Now she's put out a quake-free collection, optimistically title "A 
Glass Half Full." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one titled "Slander," and subtitled "So what else is new?" 
</P>
<P>
 There's something happening  
</P>
<P>
 It seems like a race  
</P>
<P>
 As to whom we can slander most  
</P>
<P>
 Whom we can disgrace  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Who can come up with the best piece of dirt  
</P>
<P>
 Whom can we denigrate  
</P>
<P>
 Whom can we hurt  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Let's go for the jugular  
</P>
<P>
 Let's make them crawl  
</P>
<P>
 The higher they are  
</P>
<P>
 The harder they fall  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 How far do we go for that almighty scoop?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we all pay to read it  
</P>
<P>
 We're not out of the loop  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 A self-published poet doesn't expect big royalties. "I really don't care," 
Geri says. "I'm getting the accolades. It's just been wonderful. I have a 
little following." 
</P>

 The Sherman Oaks home of Dr. Paul Hackmeyer and his wife, Nancy, was hit so 
hard Jan. 17 that they had to move themselves and their three young children 
into a rented home in Valley Village. But for them, 1994 will not be remembered 
so much for the quake as for their encounter with evil shortly after midnight 
on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, the associate chief of obstetrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 
was arriving home after a successful delivery when he was confronted by two 
men, apparently intent on robbery. He was shot three times, and the third shot 
nearly killed him, tearing through his lungs and liver before exiting near his 
heart. To date, no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 His recovery was extraordinary. A week after the shooting, Hackmeyer was home 
from the hospital, discussing his experience amid the bonsai collection in his 
back yard. Within two months, he was bringing more babies into the world. Today 
he feels no pain. "I can probably predict when the rain's coming. But other 
than that, it's pretty well back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time we talked, he discussed the outpouring of sympathy from 
colleagues, friends, patients and total strangers -- and how he felt like Jimmy 
Stewart in "It's a Wonderful Life." When we talked last week, Hackmeyer said he 
still felt much the same, and that he has experienced "a renewal" at home and 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the shooting, I've had a fire lit under me in terms of needing to do 
better what I do." He attributes this, in part, to the support he received. "It 
was almost embarrassing, and I felt that it wasn't deserved," he says. "And I 
felt I had to make it deserved. I felt I needed to be a better doctor and 
needed to be a better surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
 He said much more, but there isn't the space today. I'll try to catch up with 
Dr. Hackmeyer again in a few months -- around March 20. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The first time I saw Christopher Sylbert, he was being helped to the stage of 
a Ventura Boulevard nightclub. He leaned against a metal walker, struggling to 
the microphone. And then he spoke: 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry Parker got me $2.1 million!" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris, a North Hollywood resident, has been certified as The Funniest Person 
in the Valley. On that October night, he won the final round of the L.A. 
Cabaret's annual contest, winning over a crowd of judges that included Milton 
Berle. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when he was announced as winner did Chris discuss his struggle with 
multiple sclerosis. Making people laugh, he said, is what he lives for. 
</P>
<P>
 He still hasn't broken into the big comedy clubs -- not yet, anyway. His 
manager, Victoria Dushoff, says: "All I want for him for Christmas is a chance 
to audition for the Improv and the Ice House." In the meantime, Chris is honing 
his craft and developing new material, working two, three or four nights a week 
at such venues as Igby's, the L.A. Cabaret and Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza near 
LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holiday Inn crowd, he says, forces him to reach beyond his tried and true 
"California stuff" -- the references to Larry Parker, Medflies and Mike 
Huffington. ("Tell you what: If I got $35 million, I'm not spending it trying 
to get work.") 
</P>
<P>
 A recovering heroin addict, Chris gets by with help from his friends in a 
rehab fellowship. They often chauffeur him to performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris tries to help others overcome their problems. When we spoke, he was 
anticipating performing on Christmas Eve for the folks at Cry Help Inc., a 
residential drug abuse recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a routine just for addicts -- a routine the rest of us won't get. One 
joke, for example, concerns heroin and one of its little-known side effects -- 
constipation. 
</P>
<P>
 You really don't want to hear it. Especially not on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Julie answered the phone this time, and what she told me was good to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie told me that, contrary to what her ex-husband's lawyer told the judge, 
she hasn't fallen off the wagon. Julie says she's still sober, and the kids -- 
12-year-old Anna and 6-year-old Mark -- "are doing fine." (These names, for the 
record, are pseudonyms.) 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks have passed since I wrote about Hank, a teammate who wound up 
with a year in jail after a traffic accident in which Mark suffered the loss of 
two baby teeth and a cut mouth. The fact that Mark's seat belt wasn't buckled 
resulted in a child endangerment charge. Hank's use of a fraudulent driver's 
license resulted in additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hank first called from jail, he wanted me to write about how he'd been 
screwed by the system. The punishment, he said, did not fit the crime -- 
especially for a single father who had full custody of his kids and was 
struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 A year in jail still seems harsh, especially since so many felonies are 
plea-bargained down to the identical sentence. At the same time, the more I 
looked into Hank's case, the more it was obvious that Hank was his own worst 
enemy. He compounded minor violations with ever larger deceptions; the bogus 
driver's license was typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's public defender asked the judge to grant a hardship release because 
he'd heard that Julie was drinking again. The column left that question 
hanging: I called Julie four times, but nobody answered. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't pleased with the article. There were no inaccuracies, "but that 
doesn't mean I have to like it," she told me. Hank hasn't volunteered his 
reaction. My guess is that he wasn't pleased either. 
</P>
<P>
 He's expected to be out in a few weeks, after having served a total of more 
than four months, thanks to good behavior and the need to make room for more 
prisoners in the overcrowded jails. He missed both Anna's and Mark's birthdays, 
and now he'll miss Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree in Julie's Canoga Park apartment is trimmed with popcorn. They're 
trying to make the best of the circumstances, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to look at it as an old-fashioned Christmas where it's not about 
expensive gifts," she said. "It's about being together." 
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas everybody. And that includes you, Hank.

VALLEY BRIEFING: SCRIPT TO SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auguste Lumiere and his brother Lois are credited as the first to project a 
film to a paying audience--on Dec. 28,1895. "It can be exploited for a certain 
time as a scientific curiosity, but apart from that, it has no commercial value 
whatsoever," said Auguste about their combination camera / printer / projector. 
He obviously underestimated their achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a century later, more than 300 films a year are produced in California, 
the average cost of making a movie is almost $30 million, and movie theater 
admissions are close to a billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the credits roll, the contributions of hundreds may appear for a single 
film--whether the work was done on a studio backlot in the Valley, on location 
on a residential street in Van Nuys, or on an editing bench at a Valley 
post-production house. 
</P>
<P>
 Job titles and number of personnel vary from film to film, but the process of 
filmmaking shown below is typical: 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Contract is negotiated with writer, and the source, such as a novel, play or 
original screenplay, is converted into a workable script. PRE-PRODUCTION 
</P>
<P>
 * Actors cast 
</P>
<P>
 * Locations scouted 
</P>
<P>
 * Background researched. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set is designed and constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Equipment, props, and costumes are rented or purchased 
</P>
<P>
 * Detailed production budget / shooting schedule worked up PRODUCTION 
</P>
<P>
 The production of a movie can involve hundreds of behind-the-scenes personnel, 
specially trained people who do everything from building and painting sets to 
"grips" who transport and set up equipment, props and scenery. Some of those on 
the scene: 
</P>
<P>
 Directing Team 
</P>
<P>
 * Director selects and stages what will be photographed in any given take, 
indicating where camera will be, deciding which takes should be used. When 
"blocking" a scene, the director tells a actor where to stand and when and 
where to move. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assistant directors keep production running smoothly and on schedule, 
breaking down script, arranging background action, managing extras. 
</P>
<P>
 * Script supervisor keeps track of what is being shot, making sure continuity 
is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Camera Crew 
</P>
<P>
 Director of photography (cinematographer) determines how set will be lit, 
works with director on how shots will be set up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camera operator operates camera, determining for sound crew where to 
position boom microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Focus puller maintains camera during shooting, changing lenses and magazines 
and following focus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clapper / loader uses clapper board, loads film into camera, labels film 
cans and prepares film for shipment to lab. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sound crew 
</P>
<P>
 * Sound mixer works with director and cinematographer to decide where 
microphones should be placed, operates a mixing console into which microphones' 
signals are fed and balanced on their way into tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boom operator handles boom microphone or fits actors with smaller mikes 
</P>
<P>
 * Cable handler ensures wires are properly run from mike to console or 
recorder 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Electrical Crew 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffer works with cinematographer to set up shot, sometimes roughing out 
lighting plan beforehand 
</P>
<P>
 Best boy is second in command and assists gaffer 
</P>
<P>
 Key grip works partly as a construction manager and back-up to the camera crew 
POST-PRODUCTION 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting is completed, special effects must be added, sound mixed and 
the film edited. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special effects cinematography usually requires a separate crew and special 
equipment to achieve techniques that provide illusions on screen. Techniques 
range from the use of miniatures to computerized effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sound mixing combines all individual soundtracks for dialogue, music and 
sound effects into a single composite master soundtrack. This is done in a 
theater or studio on a special console. 
</P>
<P>
 * Editing is done on upright or flatbed editing machines, or by using 
computerized video. Working closely with the director, the editor splices and 
cements film during the process. Several working prints are made before a final 
composite print is made. 
</P>
<P>
 * After editing, master prints are made from the original negative. Duplicate 
negatives are then made and turned into release prints, which are distributed 
for exhibition. THE VALLEY'S OWN MOVIE MAKERS

HIGH HOPES AND HAPPY FACES; CHRISTMAS: MORE THAN 7,000 EAGER BUT NEEDY CHILDREN 
LINED UP AS EARLY AS 4 A.M. FOR TOYS AND CLOTHES AT THE O.C. RESCUE MISSION.

 Youngsters lined up as early as 4 a.m. in hopes of getting a Nintendo game, a 
Barbie doll or even a sweater or a pair of pants. They left in smiles, sporting 
multicolored hats and carrying sweat shirts, blankets, toys, even turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,000 children Saturday received donated toys from the Orange County 
Rescue Mission, executive director Jim Palmer said. New socks, hats and other 
clothing were distributed by Covering Wings, a nonprofit Huntington Beach group 
that helps the poor and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucia Soto, 34, said the donations are the only way that she and her husband 
can give their six children a happy Christmas. "The children are thinking of 
toys and nothing else," said Soto, who lined up at 6 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on welfare. It just pays for rent and food. It doesn't stretch enough 
for toys," she said. "My children have been talking about this for days. 
Without this they would have been very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 The gift giveaway for Central Orange County's poorer residents is 32 years old 
-- the same age as the mission itself, Palmer said. And it is only one part of 
the program to help the needy. Today at 1 p.m., volunteers will serve a free 
hot lunch, followed by distribution of food boxes containing turkeys, potatoes, 
canned fruit and vegetables, and condensed milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the need increases, Palmer said, and donations have managed to keep 
pace. This year, the mission gave out more than 11,000 toys -- 7,400 on 
Saturday and more than 3,000 that went to Santa Ana's nearby Templo Calvario. 
That was more than double last year's tally of 4,500 gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity got the better of many youngsters Saturday. They tore into their 
presents as soon as they left the mission, leaving a trail of wrapping paper 
several blocks long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mine, it's mine!" squealed 5-year-old Sinai Martinez after opening an 
inflatable swim toy, her enthusiasm not dampened by the fact that she might 
have to wait until summer to use the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, ignoring parents' admonitions to keep their presents wrapped until 
Christmas day, unwrapped Cinderella mugs, toy cars and tiny pink purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful thing. It really helps," said Alicia Castaneda, who 
shepherded her four children past tables covered with gifts arranged by gender 
and age of the intended recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the young faces in the crowd belonged to volunteers. Zach Gibson, 11, 
of Huntington Beach stamped each little hand with red ink as the children filed 
through the gate, a way to make sure that no one went through the line twice 
and denied someone else a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandpa helps here," he said. "This was just my chance to come down and 
help people who are less fortunate than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Alfaro, 2, sat in a Food 4 Less shopping cart stuffed with gifts and 
clutched a little black sweat shirt. His mother, brothers and sisters, aunts 
and grandmother came to the mission together, bringing the cart to wheel their 
treasures to their Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
 Other families came in groups from Garden Grove, Tustin and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids who spent hours in line before the mission opened its doors let their 
imaginations run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Sega Genesis with Aladdin and the Lion King," said Jose Diaz, 11, who 
arrived with his mother at 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a Super Nintendo," said 12-year-old Elio Arteaga. "Last year I got a 
train with a lot of cars on it. But it's old already." 
</P>
<P>
 Such high-tech gifts, unfortunately, were not among those given away, said The 
Rescue Mission's pastor, James Womack. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't donate that," he said. "I would like to get Sega Genesis 
myself. I hope my wife gets me one for Christmas."

CHURCH CELEBRATES ITS REBIRTH AFTER FIRE; RELIGION: TESTED BY A DEVASTATING 
BLAZE, THE CONGREGATION OF REDEEMER LUTHERAN REBUILT ITS SANCTUARY AND ITS 
FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The crisp fragrance of pine boughs may overpower the lingering smell of fresh 
paint during today's Christmas celebration at Redeemer Lutheran Church in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Rev. Elroi Reimnitz, the gleaming whitewashed walls are just as 
important as the pungent holly-flecked wreaths. For both symbols remind him of 
miraculous births. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's service marks the first time in three years that Reimnitz has been 
able to usher Christmas in to his own "spiritual home" -- the familiar, 
friendly sanctuary at Redeemer Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, on the corner of Camino Dos Rios and Lynn Road, was burned to a 
skeletal rubble in a mysterious blaze just a week before Christmas in 1992. The 
devastating fire scorched the Christmas tree, gutted the sanctuary and buried 
the altar under a swirl of soot. 
</P>
<P>
 This Christmas, however, Redeemer Lutheran Church is whole again -- thanks to 
a $1.1-million overhaul completed in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's 140 members are overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a chance to experience the true meaning of rebirth at 
Christmastime," said Bruce McDougall, the congregation president. "It's going 
to be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Resurrecting Redeemer Lutheran required two years of hard work. Starting just 
a few weeks after the fire, congregation members began to examine blueprints, 
interview contractors, haggle with insurance agents and review construction 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the reconstruction, the congregation met in a spare, cramped Sunday 
school classroom a few yards from the sooty sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't get discouraged, impatient or upset," Reimnitz said, marveling 
at his flock's faith. "They were very supportive. They realized that a church 
is not the building, it's the people. And they stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 They even learned to joke about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's recruitment brochure, designed to woo new members to the 
congregation, features a sepia-tone photo of the church as it looked just after 
the fire -- the altar reduced to rubble, the pews scorched, and every religious 
icon either singed or cracked beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The wry caption read: "Are you burned-out, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spinning a bane into a blessing, the brochure explains that worshipers at 
Redeemer Lutheran have learned new empathy since the flames destroyed their 
church. Welcoming potential worshipers who might feel lonely, depressed or 
adrift, the brochure states consolingly, "We know how it feels to lose 
something that is very dear to us." 
</P>
<P>
 However dear, the original Redeemer Lutheran Church was definitely outdated 
when the fire swept through it. Built in 1964, the church was full of what 
Reimnitz calls "the '60s look," from the bulky yellow lanterns on the walls to 
the faded maroon carpet on the floor. The building was not accessible for 
worshipers in wheelchairs, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new church is designed to look stylish -- and remain serviceable -- 
through the year 2000 and beyond, Reimnitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's old wood doors -- heavy and forbidding -- have been 
replaced with a more welcoming entrance. Walls have been knocked down and an 
indoor balcony constructed to infuse the church with a light, airy feeling. 
Even the deep-colored, stained-glass windows were replaced with more 
translucent pastel panels that speckle the pews with colorful light. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more open, much more worshipful," Reimnitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time ever, Redeemer Lutheran has a public-address system to 
provide instructions during emergencies. Hearing-impaired worshipers can listen 
to the services on individual headsets at their pews. And congregation members 
in wheelchairs can maneuver easily through the parking lot, sanctuary and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The church also meets the latest seismic safety standards, and sprinklers have 
been installed in every building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally we can get on with doing what we're meant to do, which is praise the 
Lord and reach out to the community," congregation member Norm Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all their jubilation, congregation members still cannot put the fire 
entirely behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeemer Lutheran's insurance policy covered only $800,000 in damages, so the 
church now faces a $300,000 debt, Reimnitz said. He said the congregation plans 
to take out a 20-year loan from the Lutheran Church Extension Fund to cover the 
repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Repaying the loan will require a serious fund-raising effort. And Reimnitz 
anticipates that the new sanctuary will cost more to heat, light and insure 
than the old church. In all, he anticipates spending $177,000 to keep Redeemer 
Lutheran running next year -- a 36% increase over this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the church relies entirely on donations, Reimnitz said, "the 
congregation is being challenged" to come up with enough cash to meet the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the fire seems to have given some worshipers the confidence to 
tackle that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire has given us a stronger reliance on each other," McDougall said. 
"It's made us a family in the true sense."

MAKE HOLIDAYS SAFE FOR 4-FOOTED PALS; PETS: CHRISTMAS CAN BE A HAZARDOUS TIME 
FOR ANIMALS. EVERY YEAR, VETERINARIANS TREAT DOGS AND CATS SUFFERING FROM 
CONTACT WITH COMMON YULETIDE ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A few years ago, veterinarian Eric Van Nice received a first-hand reminder 
about how hazardous the Christmas holidays can be for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nice noticed his dog standing near the Christmas tree, shaking strangely. 
When the veterinarian reached over and touched the quivering animal's back, he 
got a rude shock. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 The pooch had chewed through a Christmas light electrical cord and had many 
volts of electricity coursing through him. He wound up with a nasty burn in his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 A time of joy and celebration for humans, Christmas can be a holiday nightmare 
for pets. Every year, veterinarians see dogs and cats brought into their 
clinics suffering from contact with common holiday items, from the Christmas 
turkey to mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deck the halls with boughs of holly, but don't let Fluffy or Spot eat it," 
said Mary Obenberger, spokeswoman for the Animal Rescue Foundation in Dana 
Point, which puts out a list of pet holiday hazards. "Holiday time presents 
some unique situations which can be hazardous to your pet's health." 
</P>
<P>
 The most common mistake made by pet owners is putting a turkey carcass into 
the garbage where Fido can dig it out, veterinarians say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a hundred dogs or more get into the turkey and they wind up with 
terrible diarrhea and abdominal pains" from the fat-laden skin, said Van Nice, 
who has an office in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey and ham bones can also split and chip, lodging in an animal's throat, 
stomach or intestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common food hazard for canine chocoholics is holiday candy. Chocolate 
contains a caffeine-like chemical known as theobromine, which can be dangerous, 
particularly for small dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen these little eight-pound poodles come in looking like they've had 
several espressos," Van Nice said. "Too much chocolate can cause liver damage 
and seizures in these little guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Other well-known Christmas icons can cause sickness or death in the family 
pet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pine needles can puncture a dog or cat's intestinal lining. A particular 
hazard for cats is tinsel, "which can be like a wire with sharp teeth" in the 
feline intestinal tract, Van Nice said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preservatives such as aspirin put in Christmas tree water can cause 
intestinal problems in cats. Pine oils that seep into the water can also harm 
felines, Van Nice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspirin isn't generally toxic for cats, but the standard prescription for 
felines is about one-eighth of a tablet every three days, Van Nice said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Household pets can easily get hurt by knocking over the Christmas tree or 
stepping onto broken ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electrical burns are a particular hazard for puppies and kittens that like 
to chew and can't tell the difference between a rope and an electrical cord. 
Keep all holiday light cords secured and out of the reach of pets. 
</P>
<P>
 One commonly held fallacy is that poinsettias can be fatal to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of overblown," Van Nice said. "Eating poinsettias just usually 
gives them an upset stomach. Mistletoe can be very toxic, and holly berries." 
</P>
<P>
 "The holidays can be a really dangerous time for pets," Obenberger said. "But 
all people need to do is use a little bit of common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Holiday Pet Hazards 
</P>
<P>
 Some common "holiday hazards" include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Table scraps: Keep away from pets; smaller bones or bone chips can lodge in 
the throat, stomach and intestinal tract. Fats, gravies and poultry skin can 
cause severe gastrointestinal upset as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Holiday plants: Holly and mistletoe are extremely poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Christmas tree: Make sure your tree is well secured. Anchor tree top to a 
wall using cord or rope. Preservatives in water can cause intestinal problems 
for animals, so put mesh around the base. Aspirin in the water is very toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pine needles: Check around holiday trees and decorative boughs frequently. 
Ingested pine needles can puncture your pet's intestines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweets: Stomachache is a mild side effect and overindulgence in chocolate 
can be fatal. Poisoning is caused by theobromine, a caffeine-like substance 
found in chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electrical cords: Have cords secured and out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ornaments: Hang breakable ornaments and tinsel high on the tree so they are 
out of reach.

OUTAGE CUTS POWER TO 1,600 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 1,600 homes lost Christmas tree lights and all their other electrical 
power in Saturday night's heavy downpour, according to officials with the 
Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 In Encino, about 800 homes lost power just after 6 p.m. In West Hills, another 
800 lost power about 7 p.m. Neither area had power restored as of 9:30 p.m., 
said DWP spokeswoman Debra Sass. 
</P>
<P>
 Sass said crews were unsure what caused the outage, although they believed the 
problem to be weather-related. Correcting the problem was expected to take 
several hours.

JAYWALKER STRUCK, KILLED BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 67-year-old man crossing the street in the middle of the block after dark 
Saturday was struck by a car and killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who hit the man in the 6900 block of Wilbur Avenue just before 
6:30 p.m., will not be cited, said Sgt. Glenn Wiggins of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was pronounced dead at Tarzana Regional Medical Center, shortly 
after the accident, Wiggins said. He would not release the victim's name 
pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins said the evening rain probably hampered the driver's visibility, as 
well as contributing to the victim's failure to use a crosswalk or follow 
traffic signals.

A MIDNIGHT MASS IS CELEBRATED 12 HOURS EARLY IN PRISON; RELIGION: CATHOLIC 
BISHOP LEADS AN UPBEAT AND REFLECTIVE SERVICE. PRISONERS AND GUARDS JOIN IN 
'SILENT NIGHT.'

 Larry Evens, known as "Moses" to his fellow inmates, has been going to church 
since he was a child. But he had to be locked behind bars before he discovered 
the true spirit of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no presents for him to open at the California State Prison facility 
here, and he doesn't expect any visitors during the holidays. But he was 
thankful to be where he was Saturday, serving as a chaplain assistant to 
Auxiliary Bishop Armando Ochoa of the San Fernando Pastoral Region, who 
celebrated an early midnight mass just after noon at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Moses' means 'drawn out of the water,' and I was drowning in sin," said the 
41-year-old Evens, who was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1988 
and became a devout Christian a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're at the bottom of the barrel, you've got to look up somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 inmates attended the hourlong Catholic Mass in a small white room 
that serves as a chapel within one of the sprawling prison's five buildings. It 
was Ochoa's first Christmas Mass at the prison, although he has said two Ash 
Wednesday Masses there. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishop -- who oversees 48 parishes primarily in the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys -- emphasized in his sermon how Jesus Christ spent 
his life among those held in low esteem by society because he believed in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to see Christ after his birth, Ochoa added, were shepherds -- people 
who had a "bad reputation" because they were often unkempt. And he compared 
himself, a Catholic clergyman, and other faithful to the ostracized inmates he 
was leading in worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I are shepherds too," he said. "Just because you're here and just 
because I wear a Roman collar, there are many people who want nothing to do 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Since about two-thirds of the inmates attending were Latino, Ochoa conducted 
parts of the service in Spanish. A steady flow of inmates also went 
individually into a room at the side of the chapel, where another priest heard 
their confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates at the service were generally upbeat or reflective, with few overtly 
mourning the loss of their freedom. Evens helped set much of the mood with 
seemingly endless enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get together and sing a song while we're all waiting," he cried out to 
the inmates as they sat quietly waiting for Ochoa to appear. He coaxed several 
into standing in a line in front of the lectern and singing "Joy to the World" 
and got those in the audience to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got any more songbooks?" asked Don Lubbers, an inmate sitting near the 
back, as Evens tried to start a second song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I got yours right here," Evens replied, waving the program he was 
sharing with Gerard Depaula, another inmate he had brought to the front. "Come 
up here and sing with us." 
</P>
<P>
 After a bit more coaxing, Lubbers finally acquiesced, singing "Silent Night" 
with his arms around the shoulders of Evens and Depaula. Even the four 
correctional officers gathered at the rear of the chapel chimed in, and Ochoa 
joked about making a permanent choir out of the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to take you as my travel squad, but I don't think they would allow 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Evens, who said he plans to continue his prison ministry when he is 
released in six months, the service was also a time of quiet reflection. He 
hopes to be reunited with his family, a wife and three children now living in 
New Orleans, after his sentence is completed. For now, he said, he has one item 
that dominates his Christmas wish list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please ask my victims for forgiveness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa delivered a similar Mass Saturday morning at the Challenger Memorial 
Youth Center in Lancaster, and another is scheduled today at Sylmar Juvenile 
Hall. He said Cardinal Roger Mahony and the seven bishops in his jurisdiction 
make it a point to include correctional facilities in their holiday schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mass at midnight Saturday at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Northridge was 
also on Ochoa's schedule, but he said the busy agenda didn't bother him. 
Besides, that gives him an opportunity to ask free Christians to pray for their 
brethren behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can have the folks I see this evening remember them in that service," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the state prison inmates said the service provided a genuine Christmas 
spirit, despite their bleak surroundings. For some, such occasions also provide 
their biggest sense of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of time is going by, I'm getting older, and more of my family seems to 
be disappearing," said Peter Bommarito, 54, a convicted murderer who has served 
20 years of a life sentence.

FILM FEES IN MALIBU RAISE INDUSTRY'S IRE; PERMITS: MOVIE MAKERS AND OTHERS 
OBJECT TO CHARGING FOR USE OF COUNTY- AND STATE-OWNED BEACHES WITHIN CITY 
BOUNDARIES. LEGALITY OF PLAN IS BEING STUDIED. 
</P>

<P>
 A move by the Malibu City Council to charge fees for filming on state- and 
county-owned beaches within the city limits has raised eyebrows among county 
officials and film industry representatives who say the fees may be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed amendments Dec. 12 on a film permit fee resolution that, 
effective Jan. 12, will create an in-house film permit office and establish a 
new fee schedule for television and film producers and commercial 
photographers. Currently, permits to film in Malibu cost $715 and are processed 
through the Department of Regional Planning's Los Angeles County Film Office, 
with $400 of the fee going to Malibu and $315 to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment approved by the City Council called for the city to collect $600 
for a standard permit to film in the city and $250 to film on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's move to charge $250 to film on state- or county-owned beaches has 
drawn fire from county film officials and industry representatives. The city 
fee must be paid in addition to a county permit fee of $315, plus a daily fee 
of $400 to the County Department of Beaches and Harbors for beach maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the industry is on city property, then I feel they do have a right to 
charge," said Stephanie Liner, director of Los Angeles County Entertainment 
Industry Affairs, a county agency that deals with entertainment matters. "But 
the city of Malibu does not have to recoup any fees to maintain the property on 
a daily or weekly basis. They should not charge a fee. It's not a rental fee, 
it's a use fee." 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel is currently exploring the possibility that Malibu's fees 
are illegal, Liner said. Malibu City Atty. Christi Hogin argued that the city's 
right to charge film permit fees to use private beaches and other property 
should extend to county-owned beaches. Hogin added that the fee is applicable 
to property within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just regulate filming anywhere in the city," Hogin said. "We are not 
trying to over-regulate film permits. We've invited the lawyers (from the 
county and the film industry) to give us some authority that preempts the city 
from imposing a film permit fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Another complaint being lodged against the city's newly amended resolution is 
the creation of a second permit, an additional hassle that industry officials 
say makes Malibu unfriendly to film and TV producers, who have a long history 
of using Malibu beaches for such popular programs as "Baywatch." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just about money, it's about double permitting," said Kathleen 
Milnes, vice president of the Public Affairs Coalition of the Alliance of 
Motion Picture and Television Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milnes added that Malibu's move is contrary to efforts among local government 
bodies to streamline the permit process. "Los Angeles city and the county are 
looking at consolidating their film permit processing," she said. "There is a 
six-region area that is working with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments and my organization toward creating a one-stop film permit 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 film permits are processed each year for Malibu area beaches, 
generating about $150,000, Liner said, not including figures for commercial 
photography permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The county dropped fees for photographers a year ago after modeling industry 
executives started using Florida beaches, where there are no fees.

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; THE TRIALS OF TV NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg, Howard Rosenberg is The Times' television critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the entertainment story of the year didn't come from Holly wood, 
Broadway or the television networks' entertainment divisions. The year's most 
gripping story began with sketchy reports of the murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson, the former wife of football great O.J. Simpson, and her friend Ronald 
Goldman. By the time Simpson was about to be charged with the murders, what 
seemed like the ultimate "tabloid TV" story had busted out of the realm of 
"Hard Copy" and "Inside Edition." When Simpson and Al Cowlings took their 
Friday evening ride across Southland freeways, virtually every broadcast and 
cable channel carried the story live. And the frenzy was just beginning. Our TV 
critic watched it all, and he thinks the media have a few things to answer for. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Good morning. I'm Big Blue Eyes, and welcome to this live telecast of the 
Trial of the Ages that I am co - anchoring with our esteemed legal analyst, 
Professor Poppycock.  
</P>
<P>
 "The charge, regarding the TV-fed spectacular of the year, is that in 1994, 
much of television did overcook, distort, falsely inflate and often report 
untruths about the homicides that resulted in former football great O.J. 
Simpson being charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. And that said action diverted public 
attention from more significant matters as TV newscasting traveled down a 
tabloidesque road from which it may not return.  
</P>
<P>
 "On a personal note, speaking as a respected professional journalist who 
categorically would never inject himself or his opinion into a news story, I 
think the charge sucks!"  
</P>
<P>
 Professor Poppycock: "Sucks" being a term with limited legal standing, of 
course.  
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: Excellent point. And we'd be remiss, Professor P., if we didn't 
also point out that the real predators in this case -- Time, Newsweek and 
mainstream newspapers -- initially faced the same charge as television, but 
cowardly pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of occasional overzealousness and 
were given probation.  
</P>
<P>
 Ah . . . but I see everyone is now in the courtroom, and the Trial of the Ages 
is about to begin with the prosecution's first witness, Penny Q. Public.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Ms. Public, please recall your activities on the afternoon of June 
17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: Well, y'know, stuff about the murders of O.J.'s ex-wife and 
that Goldman young man, and O.J. being blamed, had been all over TV, and it was 
just so crazy, who could believe it? So I was watching TV 'cause this was the 
day O.J. was supposed to give himself up, and the reporters, camera crews and 
everyone were hanging around his Brentwood mansion and all that. And the next 
thing I know, this police guy is on the tube saying they don't know where O.J. 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 And then his lawyer, Robert Shapiro, is on TV asking O.J. to give himself up. 
And I'm really interested 'cause this is O.J. Simpson. And the next thing I see 
are live pictures of that white Ford Bronco on the freeway somewhere. And 
they're saying O.J. is inside and the driver is his friend, Al Cowlings. And 
they're being chased by all these cop cars. And it's just amazing, 'cause we 
don't know where they're going or what will happen when they get there, and 
this is not one of those cops-and-robbers shows, it's live and it's real, like 
the Super Bowl. And I betcha everybody in America was watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: And then what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: After some time, the Bronco pulled up to O.J.'s house, and I 
was sorta worried 'cause the cops were there and it looked like there could be 
a shootout or something. But after awhile, Cowlings got out, and then O.J. got 
out and it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: If there had been bloodshed, would you have wanted to see it? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: No way, 'cause I had my kids there too, y'know. But there 
wouldn't have been a choice, 'cause it was live. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Thank you, Ms. Public. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney: Just one thing in cross-examination, Ms. Public. You said 
you were transfixed by what was happening on TV that day. Why? Why do you think 
TV covered it live, and why did you and your family keep watching? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: It was O.J. Simpson, that's why. O.J. was a national hero. 
I'm sure that was the reason for the live coverage, and that's why we were 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge: Redirect? 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Yes, your honor, just a couple of questions. Ms. Public, was O.J. 
Simpson your hero? Or your family's hero? Or the hero of anyone that you know? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: Well, no, now that you mention it. Except for those Hertz 
commercials he did, I hadn't thought of the guy or heard his name in years. I 
mean, he seemed like a nice guy and all that but. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Then, tell us, Ms. Public, why did you refer to him as a national 
hero? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Q. Public: Well, 'cause they were saying it all the time on TV, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Thank you. Nothing further. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: Keeping my own opinion out of this while we wait for the next 
witness, I'm betting that Penny Q. Public's middle name is Quisling.  
</P>
<P>
 Professor Poppycock: An intriguing point that I'll pretend to understand as 
the camera moves in for my close - up.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Please state your name and occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness: Sammy Sleaze, producer of the nationally syndicated hit series "We're 
Watching Your Underpants." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Mr. Sleaze, what has this case meant to your show? 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sleaze: Wow! It's not only brought us into the inner circle of so-called 
legitimate news, we are the inner circle. No more barriers, baby, we're them 
and they're us. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Please elaborate, and remember you're under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sleaze: Hey, would I lie? Just a joke. The truth is, we were already on 
the map big time. I didn't think it could get any better than Tonya Harding and 
Michael Jackson -- you know, when the fancy-pants media grabbed our coattails 
and dove into the mud right with us. But this O.J thing has been a gift, making 
it impossible for the public to separate us from the so-called legitimate 
media. We wrote the primer, they're following it. There were periods in 1994 
when all the network newsmagazines were wall to wall with O.J. stuff -- and 
most of it junk, too -- that they were using just to give the impression that 
they were on top of this story, a story that all of us inflated like hell just 
to give us an excuse to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they even use our tape or our quotes in their newscasts. And why 
not? We're malicious, they're malicious. We invade privacy, they invade 
privacy. We spread rumors and innuendo, and so do they. We occupy the same 
three-ring circus outside the courthouse, and all of us are after the same 
stuff. We interview anyone with a story to tell, even if it sounds crazy, and 
so do they. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, they grouse about us paying big bucks for interviews, and it is true 
that when you're paid money you tend to perform for your cash by embellishing. 
All right, even lying. But they're paying off people too, paying them off with 
national exposure that translates to a bunch of other opportunities and 
probably money down the line. So what's the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: This is providing the public information? 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sleaze: Get off it. We're not in the information business. We're in the 
diversion business, and so are the other guys, no matter how many Tom Brokaws 
and Connie Chungs they throw at you. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: What have you gained personally from this case? 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sleaze: Plenty. Several networks have contacted me about a job, and my 
agent is working out a deal with one now. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: As this witness leaves and another is called, Professor P., 
could you say if the testimony we just heard is significant?  
</P>
<P>
 Professor Poppycock: My, yes. Sammy appears to have a very good agent. I'd 
like his name.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Your name and occupation, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness: Earnest Ernie. I'm a local TV reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Is it fair to say that your coverage of the Simpson-Goldman case 
has been an exception to the rule? 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest Ernie: That's right. Oh, I haven't been perfect. It's not easy trying 
to be ethical when everyone else is getting a lot of attention by vamping. And 
to be fair, there were times when I did some things I shouldn't have -- you 
know, reported some unfounded rumors and shot from the hip without proper 
sources just to keep up with the competition. But I can honestly say that, in 
most cases, I had integrity and covered this story responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge: Cross-examination? 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney: When you did do a good job, Earnest, did you get credit for 
it from outside the station? 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest Ernie: No, and that steams me. That guy who writes about TV for the 
newspaper? He griped plenty about the bad coverage -- and there was plenty to 
gripe about -- but he never wrote one word about the good work that I did. And 
not having recognition from outside my station made it harder for me to justify 
what I was doing to my superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: One thing in redirect, Earnest. We'll stipulate that you didn't 
get enough credit from the paper. But do you agree that the point -- the 
crucial one -- is that people covering this story could make choices? It was 
possible to take the high road, as you did, and still survive, correct? 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest Ernie: That's right. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: Before the next witness, tell us who is winning the trial so 
far, Professor P.  
</P>
<P>
 Professor Poppycock: Rather than attempt to answer your insipid question, I 
believe it would be in my better interest to appear temporarily disabled by the 
coughing spasm that I'm now faking.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Your name and what you do for a living, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness: Marsha Malarkey, reporter for "Action Ad-Lib." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Is it fair to say your local newscast was among the most 
aggressive in covering the Simpson-Goldman case in 1994, and that you delivered 
daily and sometimes hourly live updates even when there was nothing to report? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Malarkey: So big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: You regularly reported pseudo events, isn't that correct? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Malarkey: Well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: You and your "Action Ad-Lib" colleagues broke -- and I use that 
word advisedly -- stories about DNA and other alleged blood and forensic 
evidence and articles of clothing related to the case that were tenuous at 
best, and often unsubstantiated, isn't that right, Ms. Malarkey? Did it live, 
sometimes off the top of your head, potentially swaying potential jurors and 
shaping public opinion about the case based on possibly erroneous information, 
isn't that right? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Malarkey: All right, well, sort of. But lighten up. Everyone else was 
doing it, and sometimes -- just like you lawyers -- we have to do things we 
normally wouldn't do just for competitive reasons. It's our business. We can't 
worry about consequences. Our job is to report, not keep secrets. And if we 
make a mistake now and then and hurt a few people, it's the price we pay for 
serving the people's right to know and making the news exciting and immediate. 
This is live TV. No safety nets. I'd like to see our critics try doing it 
without making errors. It's impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Exactly the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney: Just a couple of questions, Ms. Malarkey. Is it true that 
you and your "Action Ad-Lib" colleagues have been criticized by both sides in 
this case? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Malarkey: You better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney: Then you must be doing something right, wouldn't you say? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Malarkey: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Redirect, your honor. Why, Ms. Malarkey, if you're criticized by 
both sides, does it mean you're doing something right? It's just as likely, 
isn't it, that you're doing nothing right? No need to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: Even viewing it objectively with my vast experience as a widely 
worshiped, award-winning journalist, I'd say that was a low blow from the 
prosecutor, and by allowing it, the judge opened the door for an appeal. 
Wouldn't you agree, Professor P.? Professor P.? We'll get back to Professor P. 
when he stops coughing.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Your name and occupation, sir? 
</P>
<P>
 Witness: Quentin Quack, news director, "Live and in Your Face." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Mr. Quack. I was wondering, given the time and energy you and your 
staff devoted to the Simpson-Goldman case, do you think it might have behooved 
you to give just a tad more coverage to the recent financial crisis in Orange 
County? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: It's just not a TV kind of story, man. And give us some credit. 
We did show that picture of an orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Getting back to the Simpson-Goldman case, how do you defend your 
irresponsible coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: If I've been so irresponsible, then why is everybody now 
talking about the issue of spousal abuse? I'm a hero. Coverage like mine -- and 
I don't think playing Nicole's 911 calls about O.J. 30 times was that excessive 
-- is responsible for the national debate that's going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: So you believe that the end justifies the means, no matter how 
odious are those means? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Well, I wouldn't say that. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Was there also some higher purpose, other than creating the 
illusion of news, for your chopper to repeatedly shoot live footage of Mr. 
Simpson's house from the skies? Shoot live chopper footage of him in a police 
van traveling to and from the courthouse? Shoot live footage of attorneys 
coming and going? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: The titillating teases and big, screaming graphics advertising 
O.J. rumors and other undocumented nonsense in your error-filled newscast -- 
day after day after day after day -- were they justified too? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: The public wants it. That's our job -- to give the public what 
it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: So if you thought the public wanted to see you walk nude across 
the screen, you'd do that too? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Well, no, I. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Aren't you and your counterparts guilty of creating public 
appetites so that you can feed those appetites? And haven't all of you now 
plunged beyond a point of no return? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Yes, I mean no. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Have you ever heard the expression, Old Yellowstain? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Old Yellowstain? Why, no, I don't believe so. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: Come now. Surely you must remember. You were the newscast captain, 
Quack. The commander, Quack. Isn't Old Yellowstain the nickname your "Live and 
in Your Face" staff gave you because of your policy of covering the 
Simpson-Goldman story with yellow journalism? 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: That's a lie. You'll hear nothing but lies about me from the 
staff. Malicious gossip. I don't know why they ganged up on me like that. 
Except that they were disloyal. Now, I demand to set the record straight. I 
have not made a single mistake as news director of "Live and In Your Face," and 
I can prove it, and my record has been spotless, and I don't want it smirched 
by a whole lot of lies and distortions by disloyal staff. It was a constant 
battle. Always the same thing, the staff undermining my authority while I. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge: Mr. Quack, put those steel balls back into your pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Now, starting right with the mistakes made on the bloody glove 
business for which I was blamed. The interview with the psychic, the swami, the 
man who told us exclusively that he was Charles Manson's twin. Sure, blame me 
for those too, and everything that went wrong with our coverage of this story. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the victim of the biggest conglomeration of lies and distortions and 
half-truths I have ever seen, and I'm extremely glad you asked me because I 
want to get my side of it on the record. The real truth is I was betrayed and 
thrown and double-crossed by my assistant news director so that I was one man 
against the entire newsroom. Now you take the bloody cap business, and then the 
bloody golf bag business. Why, if that wasn't an outright conspiracy to protect 
a malefactor from justice and I could prove to this court geometrically. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor: That will be all, Mr. Quack. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Quack: Huh? Oh, yes. Well, naturally, I can only cover these things 
roughly from memory, but if I've left anything out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue Eyes: I see that the Trial of the Ages has concluded, and because 
this skewed account is being created by a newspaper, the preliminary verdict is 
that television is guilty as charged. A final verdict awaits in 1995. For my 
colleague, Professor Poppycock, now resting quietly in another room, this is 
Big Blue Eyes saying, "See you at the next Trial of the Ages, America."

 A Day Without O.J. Is Like a Day Without Live Team Coverage of Absolutely 
Nothing, Soon to Be a Movie of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's in the back! ... Somebody's in the back! ... I can't see who it 
is! ... Now they're pulling away! ... No ... that's a woman I can't identify!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- KTLA-TV reporter Ron Olsen, in reportage typical of that from those on 
watch outside O.J. Simpson's mansion the day he disappeared (Calendar, June 
19). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it's a reprieve. I get (more time) to cut the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Lovenheim, executive producer of Fox's made-for-TV O.J. Simpson 
movie, on the network's decision to delay its airing until the jury is 
sequestered (Calendar, Aug. 29). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't suppress 'em, join 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Times critic Howard Rosenberg on Judge Lance Ito's decision to be 
interviewed by Tritia Toyota for KCBS-TV (Calendar, Nov. 16) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The sirens of mythology pale in comparison to the lure of seeing yourself on 
CNN. The results, however, can be about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Judge Ito, in pretrial advice to fellow judges (The Times, Nov. 15). M-I-C, 
K-E-Y ... Why? Because We're Leaving You! 
</P>

the best golden retriever I ever met."" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Disney chairman Michael Eisner, on studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg 
(Calendar, July 24). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Eisner called Jeff a golden retriever in the L.A. Times. You don't use that 
term for a 43-year-old man responsible for the highest-grossing film in the 
history of the studio. His golden retriever is going to turn into a 
Rottweiler." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unnamed screenwriter (Entertainment Weekly, Sept. 9).

are, I'm more motivated by certain extremes than I am by feeling, 'Oh, I woke 
up and it's a nice day today and I feel OK, I'm gonna write a song about that.'

something in it that comes across, that's great. And it shouldn't be this big 
idea. It should be a small idea, from which everyone can get something 
different. I mean, if you're making a movie and your big idea is that war is 
bad, why do you even need to make a movie? If that's all you're trying to say,

 Perhaps there were signs in the heavens and the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 A quake registering magnitude 6.8 jolted Los Angeles in January and amid the 
widespread destruction and frayed nerves, production in the area's huge 
entertainment industry came to a virtual standstill for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A helicopter plunged out of the sky in April, killing a top executive of the 
Walt Disney Co., and one of the most stable of entertainment firms was suddenly 
wracked with acrimony and turmoil at the highest levels. When it was over, new 
leadership was installed at the studio and a Dream Team of Steven Spielberg, 
Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen announced plans to form a new studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast and crew of "Waterworld" fled their coastal Hawaiian movie set after 
officials issued a tidal wave warning. But what Universal Pictures really 
feared was a financial tsunami should the Kevin Costner film -- which at $135 
million and climbing stands to become the costliest ever -- bombs next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As 1994 wound down, one could argue that even by Hollywood standards, it was 
an unusually turbulent year. But then, any year that begins with a Jim Carrey 
movie ("Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"), continues with a Jim Carrey movie ("The 
Mask") and ends with a Jim Carrey movie ("Dumb and Dumber") has to be strange.  
</P>
<P>
 From executive suites to the movies themselves, surprises abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought as the year dawned that Paramount Pictures, a studio 
gripped with uncertainty while a merger battle raged over its parent firm on 
Wall Street, would release the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time, 
"Forrest Gump"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that MCA's two top executives, Lew Wasserman and Sidney Sheinberg -- the 
very symbols of stability in the entertainment world -- would hint at leaving 
if they didn't win more autonomy from their corporate owners in Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that Warner Bros. would have lackluster box office with Costner ("Wyatt 
Earp"), Warren Beatty ("Love Affair") and even Steven Seagal ("On Deadly 
Ground"), but succeed beyond its wildest dreams with Carrey's "Ace Ventura"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that Sony would take a staggering $2.7-billion write-off on Sony Pictures 
Entertainment -- on top of a $510-million operating loss on the studio? This, 
in the same year the studio opened its new Art Deco commissary, where waiters 
in black-and-gold striped vests and crisp white shirts serve $15.25 hamburgers 
and $5 desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that 20th Century Fox, which looked so savvy with its summer blockbuster 
"Speed," would look so inept by Christmas with four straight flops, and then 
come up with the bizarre gimmick of offering moviegoers their money back if 
they didn't like "Miracle on 34th Street"? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a year when some mini-studios made major gains. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema, which built its reputation with "Nightmare on Elm Street" 
flicks, became a major Hollywood deal maker, thanks to an infusion of media 
mogul Ted Turner's money. New Line spent $4 million on a Shane Black spec 
script called "The Long Kiss Goodnight" and $1 7 million on Carrey (who starred 
in the studio's summer hit "The Mask") to star in two other films. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA, its glory days long gone and its lifeline now dependent on a French 
bank, suddenly looked like the most stable studio in town. With little fanfare, 
the studio quietly went about its business, making deals and putting movies 
into production and even came up with the surprise hit of the fall, "Stargate," 
which grossed more than $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes there was upheaval and calm occurring inside the same company at 
almost the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Paramount. Was there ever a studio that appeared to be in such chaos? For 
months, Viacom and QVC waged all-out war trying to wrest control of Paramount 
Communications as employees watched with a combination of awe and fear. When it 
was over, Viacom had won and Paramount's top two corporate executives -- 
chairman Martin Davis and president Stanley Jaffe -- had departed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet across the country at Paramount Pictures, studio chief Sherry Lansing and 
her staff remained snugly in place. Saddled with $10.5 billion in debt, the 
company next brought in Sony executive Jonathan Dolgen -- an expert at forging 
financial partnerships -- to chart a new path for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Sony Pictures Entertainment. The studio consolidated power when 
it combined the distribution arms for Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, 
and again when it put Columbia chief Mark Canton in charge of both units.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sony was suffering the most disequilibrium of all the studios. It made few 
movies and many of the ones it did stank up the box office. Sony chief Peter 
Guber bid goodby as did a number of lower-level executives and there were 
constant rumors that Canton himself might go or that one of the units might be 
sold off. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be argued that the studio upheaval was attributable to the movies 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies have become so expensive to produce and to market that management, 
stockholders and boards of directors are less willing to indulge a creative 
executive again and again without seeing a substantial return on the 
investment," said one industry insider. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, given all the pressures to succeed -- and all the headaches putting 
together projects and dealing with egotistical actors and directors -- the real 
question in 1994 was why more studio executives didn't bail. 
</P>
<P>
 While the box office is heading for its best showing in more than three 
decades, clouds were still on the horizon. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * There were too many movies in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekend, it seemed, was a gigantic roll of the dice. While Disney and 
Warner Bros. seemed to be releasing a movie a week, the others had to grit 
their teeth and hope they picked their best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many films chasing too few screens," explained entertainment 
analyst Jeffrey Logsden, managing partner at Siedler Cos. "A lack of screen 
expansion meant that studios had to give up more of the pie to exhibitors just 
to get choice screens. One way you get better screens is to give exhibitors 
better terms." 
</P>
<P>
 * The old adage that nobody knows anything in Hollywood still held true. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year began, who would have guessed that three of the biggest stars of 
1994 would be Jim Carrey, Tim Allen and Keanu Reeves? 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people inside the business who had never even heard of 'Ace 
Ventura' before it came out," said entertainment lawyer David Colden. 
</P>
<P>
 * Violence continues to sell -- even satires about violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" -- a movie about America's culture of 
violence and the media's ratings-driven exploitation of that culture -- raked 
in nearly $50 million at the box office for Warner Bros. Quentin Tarantino's 
ultra-cool, ultra-violent "Pulp Fiction" has already earned nearly $60 million 
and is still performing well at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Studios don't draw talent, material does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warner Bros. has made all these movies with big stars over the years, but 
that doesn't mean the stars won't work anywhere else," said former TriStar 
chief Mike Medavoy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin Costner works for Universal. Clint Eastwood does a movie for Castle 
Rock. Mel Gibson does one for Paramount. Michael Douglas will work for anybody. 
So will Sylvester Stallone. It finally comes down to who has the material to do 
what they want to do. It isn't like in the Golden Age of movies when Warner 
Bros. spun out these gangster movies, Universal did a certain kind of film, 
Columbia did a certain kind of film. That isn't the case anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * Put a project in turnaround at your own peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures basked in the glow of "Forrest Gump," a box-office champ 
and likely Oscar contender. But Warner Bros. and Columbia had earlier turned 
down the project. Paramount, meanwhile, missed the boat when it placed "Speed" 
in turnaround and Fox scooped it up. 
</P>
<P>
 * How many creative development people does it take to make a hit? 
</P>
<P>
 "How many development people did Thalberg have?" asked one movie executive. 
"Those guys loved movies and they made them and they knew how to make them. 
They selected the right people and left them together. People who run studios 
today are not movie makers, they're basically deal makers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Stars ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio executives repeatedly went after the same small group of bona fide 
box-office stars for their big films. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the formula worked (although studios paid 5% to 15% of the gross for 
success): Arnold Schwarzenegger in "True Lies," Harrison Ford in "Clear and 
Present Danger," Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster in "Maverick," Tom Hanks in "Gump" 
and Tom Cruise in "Interview With the Vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the formula didn't work: Costner in "Earp," Julia Roberts and Nick 
Nolte in "I Love Trouble," Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson in "Getting Even With 
Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 "No studio would have done 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' " said one industry 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting a big star for a movie was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Douglas left "Cutthroat Island" after he was displeased with the 
script. Citing similar reasons, Jodie Foster bailed out of "Crisis in the Hot 
Zone" and when no other major actresses would come on board, Robert Redford 
also bailed. Then Redford bailed out of Castle Rock Entertainment's "An 
American President." Castle Rock then announced the picture would be made 
anyway -- with Michael Douglas.

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; IT'S STILL ALL THE RAGE; ANGER HAS NEVER BEEN A STRANGER 
TO ROCK. THIS YEAR THE EMOTION BECAME EVEN MORE ACUTE FOR BOTH ARTISTS AND FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The defining rock 'n' roll moment of 1994 for me didn't occur in a concert 
hall but on a Seattle street corner in April. On this night -- two days after 
Kurt Cobain's body was discovered -- the corner served as a chilling dividing 
line between the opposing sides in the deepest generation gap in rock's 40-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the light to change, you could see outlines three blocks away of 
5,000 young people leaving a park surrounding the towering Space Needle. For 
the last two hours they had stood in the evening chill, largely in silence, to 
pay their respects to Cobain, whose frequently sad, melancholy songs with 
Nirvana touched them deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the sadness, there had been frustration and hostility -- not 
directed at Cobain's shotgun suicide, but at adults who do not understand them 
or how much Cobain's music meant to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, shut up," one fan shouted angrily when a minister stepped to a microphone 
to offer words of comfort. "What do you know about the way we feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in downtown Seattle, many adults were more than simply indifferent; 
they were openly hostile to Cobain and his generation of musicians, who had 
made Seattle a center of their scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought to pass out shotguns to all of the rest of (the bands), if you ask 
me," said a man in his 40s who described himself as a fan of Bob Seger-type 
"old-time rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the generation gap in pop music divided rock fans and parents who 
initially considered the music trivial, but by the '60s, had come to see it as 
the product of a talentless, drug-crazed horde. Today, even the parents who 
grew up on rock 'n' roll find it difficult to relate to today's angry young 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of this generation gap, you have millions of young people who have 
found comfort and support in the music of Nirvana and other young bands whose 
dark, unsettling themes deal with issues of betrayal, hypocrisy, abuse and 
self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 To parents and others, however, the music seems negative and assaulting. Why, 
they ask, isn't there more of the celebration and idealism of the rock of their 
youth? Why is it so hard to make out the words? Why, they ask mostly, does it 
all have to be so angry? Is the anger even real? 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cornell of the Seattle band Soundgarden shrugs at the last question. 
He's an articulate, serious-minded 30-year-old who looks back on rock 'n' roll 
as a life raft during his own troubled childhood. Many of what Rolling Stone 
magazine describes as his "doom-laden" songs focus on life in an age of lowered 
expectations and ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see how an older generation which thinks it already has dealt with the 
problems we went through doesn't want to hear any more about it," he said in a 
recent interview. "I can see them thinking, 'Shut up and stop whining!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But the anger in rock 'n' roll is going to get worse. Just as the world was a 
harder place for my generation, it's even tougher for kids who are 10 and 12 
today. It's so much of a jungle out there . . . so much more negativity and 
violence and with no family support system for millions of those kids. If you 
think I'm angry, wait until you hear the music they're going to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the anger is real. 
</P>
<P>
 The new '90s bands have taken rock's traditional aggression and personalized 
the themes -- giving us the explosive yet relevant and introspective music that 
Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden might have made if a songwriter like Neil Young 
had been at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't the first to do it. In the aftermath of the Sex Pistols, a 
generation of independent-minded American bands -- from Black Flag and the 
Minutemen in Los Angeles to the Replacements and Husker Du in Minneapolis -- 
wrote songs that reflected the alienation of their working-class roots. The 
difference is that their music was too radical for radio tastes at the time, so 
it remained largely underground. When Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," with 
its Beatlesque melodies and seductive guitar lines, hit mainstream stations and 
MTV picked up on it, the door was kicked open for similar-minded groups. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll probably have hundreds of bands trying to duplicate Nirvana and Pearl 
Jam and Hole -- and most of their music will be calculated and hollow. But this 
first wave of bands is built around the purity of musicians telling their own 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews over the last year, the leaders of this new generation 
of musicians -- Cornell, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch 
Nails, Courtney Love of Hole -- all spoke about the factors in their own lives, 
elements that sociologists frequently cite when explaining the low self-esteem 
of so many of today's teens and twentysome-things. 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke of broken homes, unsympathetic schools, generally hostile 
environments and bleak job prospects. Vedder and Cornell even said they had 
contemplated suicide like Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Vedder was 15, his mother and stepfather had separated and he was 
living on his own in Encinitas near San Diego, filled with the bitterness 
that's expressed in many of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt helpless and alone and resentful," Vedder said earlier this year. "I 
can understand someone saying, 'Well, hey, that was years ago. Forget it.' But 
even after things start getting better for you, there is a part of you that 
always goes back to that time and you feel the hurt building again. It's not 
something you ever forget." 
</P>
<P>
 In a key song from Pearl Jam's new "Vitalogy," Vedder strikes out at adults 
who have lost their youthful idealism: 
</P>
<P>
 All that's sacred comes from youth  
</P>
<P>
 Dedications . . . naive and true  
</P>
<P>
 With no power . . . nothing to do  
</P>
<P>
 I still remember . . . why don't you.  
</P>
<P>
 Cornell, a Seattle native, quit school at 15 to help support his mom and his 
five brothers and sisters after his folks were divorced. He didn't mind that 
responsibility, but he does see the lack of family stability as a major problem 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "As starchy and sterile as the '40s generation was, the baby boomers still had 
that as a crutch to lean on . . . a sort of solid pillar, whether it was their 
parents or grandparents," he said. "But that's no longer true for millions of 
kids. My family sort of disintegrated at a certain point and that seems to be 
the norm now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying a single parent can't raise a kid well, but it seems to be 
difficult in a lot of cases. The way the culture is, with the violence and the 
economy, it's hard to keep up your self-esteem and your strength on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a support system at home, at least you have reassurance that 
you are OK. If you have been victimized one way or another, you know it's not 
the entire world that's violent and evil. There have been too many times when I 
didn't feel that." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Love's childhood was also far from idyllic. Her parents were divorced 
when she was quite young and she was so trouble-bent that she was sent briefly 
to a juvenile detention center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was something in me or just the world around me," she 
said. "And it still isn't easy. Maybe we just got programmed wrong. There can't 
be that much bad luck out in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Because rock was a salvation for them, it's easy for these rock heroes to now 
see how young people today are responding to their music. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor, whose music with Nine Inch Nails deals in self-destructiveness and 
self-loathing, grew up in tiny Mercer, Pa., where he was raised by his 
grandparents after his folks broke up when he was 5. Unlike the others, he 
doesn't remember his childhood as a particularly painful period, except that he 
found it hard to relate to anyone in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that I didn't fit into any scene in school very much so music 
became the soundtrack for my existence," he said. "The music told me that it 
was OK if I don't fit in. Albums like (Pink Floyd's) 'The Wall' told me that 
you aren't a freak because you aren't accepted by everyone at school or down 
the street. And that's important because you don't have anything else saying 
that to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Oliver Stone was so impressed by the fury in Reznor's music that 
Reznor was asked by him to produce the soundtrack album for the film "Natural 
Born Killers." In a song written for the project, Reznor captures the 
embittered rage of someone who feels life has cheated him: 
</P>
<P>
 This world rejects me  
</P>
<P>
 This world threw me away  
</P>
<P>
 This world never gave me a chance  
</P>
<P>
 This world gonna have to pay . . . For Cornell, "Music in general and rock is 
part of your identity. If you think about introspective music and mind music, 
the music is a journey you can take. If you think of visceral music and 
aggressive music, it takes the place of actually going out and shooting 
somebody in the head. It gives you a chance to release those dangerous impulses 
without hurting yourself or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 For Vedder, rock was a way to combat the anger and despair -- a reason to keep 
living. Much of the anger in his songs seems directed at the adult world for 
leaving him with so little hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it was like 20 or 30 years ago, but being a kid can be a 
very lonely, strange time these days," he said. "It's hard to find anybody to 
accept you for what you are. If you try to do something different, you are just 
cut down. You are trying to grow up and someone is trying to keep you down." 
</P>
<P>
 What's lost for the over-30 crowd that closes its ears to this new 
generation's best music is the chance to get insights into the disillusionment 
of so many sons and daughters. It also means you miss the chance to sample what 
is proving to be one of rock's golden ages -- a repeat of the energy and 
relevance of the late '50s, mid '60s and late '70s/early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of today's stars, however, see the hostility of adults as a positive 
sign. "Your parents should hate it," Reznor said in September. Agrees Cornell, 
"Rock 'n' roll has always been something that your parents don't like. For me, 
in a sense, I say, 'Thank God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, Vedder is trying to come to grips with his anger. While he 
shares the impulse to feel good about adults rejecting his music, he 
acknowledges that he is intrigued when parents do find in Pearl Jam's music the 
elements that have made rock such a powerful and inspiring art form for four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always get nervous when an older person says, 'I really love your music.' . 
. . That their kids turned them on to it or whatever, " said the leader of 
Pearl Jam, which has sold more than 14 million albums in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it may be good because it may open a door to communication. It's really 
something to think that some people are getting along better because of the 
music or the words. At least it's a start for those kids lucky enough to have 
someone to talk to."*

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; DOWN AND OUT IN H'WOOD; '94 WAS A LOW POINT, SAY TWO 
MOVIE FANS WHO ARE ALREADY LOOKING AHEAD TO '95. 
</P>

 In considering the year in movies, the word disappointing springs quickly to 
mind. But why? Is it that it's impossible to impress an audience in the 
afterglow of a season of cinema that reached a peak with notable efforts like 
"The Remains of the Day" and "Schindler's List"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was this year, with a few exceptions, simply riddled with bombs and 
stinkers? Then again, perhaps 1994 offered some pretty good movies, but we 
forget because it also produced "Bad Girls." Movie commentators Kalle Matso and 
Scott White give a fresh perspective on the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kalle Matso: I'll tell you why I think 1994 was a bad year for American 
movies. The most provocative films -- "Reality Bites," "Natural Born Killers" 
and "Pulp Fiction" -- all struck me as lacking any spirit, notwithstanding an 
intense love of TV and death. And, unlike in 1993, the movies that were made 
just to "pack a wallop" were not good enough to spawn their own line of action 
figures. Although some might not concur with me, I'd bet nine out of 10 people 
will agree that 1994 was a cinematic downer. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott White: First of all, I think you're giving the American moviegoing 
public an overly fair shake. I think if you ask 10 people about 1994, seven of 
them will yell, "Yabba-dabba-doo!" Commercially, this was the most successful 
year for movies ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Well, there are other factors involved with that statistic: the 
economy, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I don't think that makes such a difference. It's not like people check 
the Dow Jones industrial average before buying tickets for "Terminal Velocity." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Well, what was your second point? 
</P>
<P>
 White: My second point is that many of us don't care about any spiritual 
emptiness in cinema. The only reason we're down on 1994 is because we've seen 
about five goodAmerican movies and 50 that made us want to learn a foreign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Give me some examples. 
</P>
<P>
 White: "Beverly Hills Cop III," "My Girl 2," "Major League II," "D2: The 
Mighty Ducks," "City Slickers II," "Death Wish V." 1994 could have been called 
"Derivative X: This Time It's My Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Granted. 
</P>
<P>
 White: And another very important criterion for me is the quality of the 
middle-echelon movies: those that weren't preceded by eight months of hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: In other words, how many times did we walk into a theater on a wing and 
a prayer and end up the loser? 
</P>
<P>
 White: Right, and the answer for this year is "usually." I give you 
"Intersection," "The Getaway," "Clean Slate," "The Chase," "Greedy," "Lightning 
Jack," "The Shadow," "Cops and Robbersons," "The Cowboy Way," "Little Big 
League," "I Love Trouble," "The River Wild," "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues," "A 
Simple Twist of Fate," "Color of Night," "Airheads," "Exit to Eden" . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Matso: You could have bought a Geo Prizm with all the dough you wasted on 
mediocre films. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Exactly. And I don't need to spend money to waste two hours of my life. 
I get a much better bargain at home watching Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: So why do we get suckered into seeing these movies?  
</P>
<P>
 White: I think it's the increase in marketing acumen. It seems that the worse 
the movies are, the better the publicity becomes. It all started out with 
"Batman," a mediocre realization of the story's potential. But that didn't stop 
me from getting whipped into a consumer frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I know what you mean. I bought a cowl. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Of course you did. The public-relations wizards know we're hooked. 
We'll keep seeing the hot release, Friday after Friday, lack of ethics in 
cinema notwithstanding. Many of the releases in 1994 just didn't happen to be 
so hot, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Every year has bad films, and one year even had "Orca." It just gets 
especially annoying when the good movies are few and far between. I mean, it 
would be pretty tough to put together a respectable list of best picture Oscar 
nominees; you've got "Pulp Fiction," for one. "Quiz Show," "Shawshank 
Redemption" and "The Lion King" were all pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 White: "Pretty good." Hardly a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Your point being? 
</P>
<P>
 White: In almost every genre, this year was a letdown. Last year the 
big-action flick was "The Fugitive," which was justifiably nominated for best 
picture. Though they were decent movies, can you see nominating "True Lies" or 
"Speed"? That would be like giving an Oscar to "Octopussy." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I have to admit the tale of the tape isn't too encouraging for 1994. 
"Schindler's List" versus "Little Buddha." "Philadelphia" versus "Natural Born 
Killers." "The Piano" versus "Andre." 
</P>
<P>
 White: And the people that we can usually count on to redeem the year offered 
us precious little. Rob Reiner gave us "North." Kenneth Branagh, "Mary 
Shelley's Frankenstein." The Coen Brothers, "The Hudsucker Proxy." Oliver 
Stone, "Natural Born Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: In my opinion, Oliver Stone owes Quentin Tarantino a case of his 
favorite beer for ruining a good story idea. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I'm not finished. Tim Burton, "Ed Wood." Barry Levinson, "Jimmy 
Hollywood." George Lucas, "The Radioland Murders." And Mr. Miyagi, "The Next 
Karate Kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: You're right. Maybe the best thing about the year were those dark-horse 
movies that took the analysts completely by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Examples? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral" both 
made it to the screen completely unheralded, both were very entertaining and 
both cleaned up at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Sure, and there's a reason for optimism. Perhaps, with the success of 
independent films, Hollywood will be more receptive to throwing some cash at 
new and more creative talent. Then again, perhaps Jerry Reed will make "Smokey 
and the Bandit IV." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: The problem is that people in Hollywood have a penchant for 
misinterpreting the trends. They'll cross-reference "Four Weddings" with "Ace 
Ventura" and buy scripts on comedians who demand prenuptial agreements. 
Besides, those weren't the best movies of the year -- just the biggest 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 White: For me, the best movies of the year were "Pulp Fiction" and "Forrest 
Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: This is another problem. "Forrest Gump" is on my top five list too and 
yet I'm not convinced it was that great. It was a feel-good movie and Tom Hanks 
gave an incredible performance -- there's an excellent chance he'll be offering 
another lecture at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion this year -- but I thought the 
movie had real flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: First of all, they went way too far with the technical razzmatazz. 
Every time Gump met a past celebrity with a badly superimposed mouth, it was 
about as impressive as shadow puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Then I guess the most notable aspect of the year in film was the 
arrival of Tarantino and "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: . . . which, as I alluded to earlier, created a lot of mixed feelings 
in most theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 White: What are you talking about? "Pulp Fiction" was an incredible movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Hey, I agree. I've never seen anyone tightrope between nail-biting 
tension and hilarious satire the way Tarantino does. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I sense a "but" coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But at the same time, I walked out of "Pulp Fiction" really depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Why? Did you empathize with The Gimp? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: No. I mean, it's one thing if someone like Tupac Shakur makes a living 
composing violent raps. He comes from a violent world. This is not a guy you 
expect to do Peter, Paul and Mary songs. But where does Quentin Tarantino's 
violence come from? Quentin worked in Manhattan Beach renting videos to no-life 
kids like you and me. What's he drawing on -- the time we toilet-papered the 
store? 
</P>
<P>
 White: So what are you saying, only John Gotti can make bloody movies? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: No. I'm just saying the violence is a little easier to take when you 
know the writer's representing experiences and not just conjuring up a lot of 
pain for entertainment's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 White: It's like you're saying violence is sacred. "How dare he make a violent 
movie? He's never killed anybody."  
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But Tarantino treats violence so lightly. I mean, no one in that movie 
was good or bad. They were all just cool, which makes it seem totally 
acceptable to blow people away. 
</P>
<P>
 White: It's supposed to be chilling. I can understand your being disturbed by 
the film, but I don't think you can criticize Tarantino. That's the nature of 
the gangster game. The story would have been very disjointed if, after every 
hit, John Travolta asked Samuel Jackson to just hold him. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: You're missing the point. Look at the most talked-about movies of the 
year: "Reality Bites," "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Natural Born Killers" 
and "Pulp Fiction." Translation: a movie about people without values, people 
who go to weddings but don't get married, people who love to kill, and people 
who don't love to kill but don't have a huge problem with it either.

<P>
 White: Why have you suddenly decided to omit entertaining and feel-good movies 
like "Forrest Gump" and "The Lion King"? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: They were fun and I'm happy they got made, but it's not like those 
movies are going to leave a deep imprint on the American psyche, unless you are 
really in the dark about how vicious hyenas can be. 
</P>
<P>
 White: So let me get this straight. You're disappointed with the year because 
entertaining movies were too simple and the edgy, benchmark "Pulp Fiction" was 
too disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That's right. And don't be so incredulous. You were as disappointed as 
I was. 
</P>
<P>
 White: But in a different way. I just want more -- more "Pulp Fiction," more 
"Quiz Show," more "Forrest Gump." You want something deeper. You have to either 
take up audio books or move to a country that meets your spiritual standards. 
Me, I just have to wait till 1995 and all those hot new releases.

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; BIG THEATER IN SMALL PLACES; THERE'S SOME REMARKABLE WORK 
COMING OUT OF THE CAST -- AND OTHER THOUGHTS AFTER SIX MONTHS OF SOAKING UP 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEATER. 
</P>

 Performing in a small theater in Los Angeles can be seen as an act of love or 
an act of vanity, depending on the quality of the show. Actors make as little 
as $5 per performance if the number of seats is less than 99. Often volunteers 
operate the lighting and sound boards, where they can easily throw off pacing 
and destroy atmosphere. Yet somehow, miraculously, real theater companies 
manage to spring up. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive small company I have seen in my six months here is the one 
churning out plays by 30-year-old Justin Tanner at the Cast Theatre in 
Hollywood. On any given night the playwright-director can be seen running madly 
from the stage manager's booth to the box office, when he is not appearing on 
stage. That may seem charming or amateurish, but what shows up on stage in the 
Tanner comedies is utterly serious. Here, individual performances are not the 
point. The company invests in Tanner's alternate universe -- which has its own 
logic, timing and aesthetic. In the course of nine plays, a true theater 
ensemble emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cast artistic director Diana Gibson will be only too happy to tell you how 
difficult it is to hold a company together. "Zombie Attack!," the long-running 
late-night show by Tanner and Andy Daley (also production manager and set 
designer at the Cast), is a loss leader; after the 80-performance mark, costs 
go up considerably for the theater (because of Equity rules). Gibson keeps it 
going, she says, "for the sake of the ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 Theaters struggle just as hard at higher levels of financial crisis. In its 
current struggle, the venerable Pasadena Playhouse has several visible assets, 
starting with the physical beauty of the 1925 building, which is the state 
theater of California, and a community that appears to take theater-going 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse, however, appears to have had an uneasy relationship with 
artistic directors since the Theatre Corporation of America took over 
management in 1979. That company, under president David Houk, must be credited 
with saving the theater, which, by all accounts, the city of Pasadena was 
willing to turn into a parking lot in the late '70s. Yet TCA has its work cut 
out if it is to make the Pasadena Playhouse a truly vital theater.  
</P>
<P>
 A rtistic directors have come and gone in the past decade. When Paul Lazarus 
departed in 1992, Deborah Dixon stepped in, under the title of senior vice 
president of creative services. Dixon was let go in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the two shows I have seen there ("Heartbeats" and "The Crimson 
Thread"), it seems that at present the Pasadena Playhouse is offering bromides 
instead of theater to its community. If it has any ambition to move beyond its 
current status of producing work at a community-theater level, it needs to 
install a real artistic director and give him or her the reins. The Pasadena 
Playhouse has everything it needs to become a great theater; all that's missing 
is something even a theater as poor as the Cast can have -- a vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest anyone doubt what an artistic director brings to a theater, let's 
remember that the La Jolla Playhouse, in its first incarnation in the 1960s -- 
before it reinvented itself and hired Des McAnuff in 1982 -- was presenting Zsa 
Zsa Gabor in "Blithe Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of McAnuff, we all wish him well, but only if he makes good on his 
promise to continue directing at La Jolla -- what was it, once a year? He had 
some highly commercial successes there; his farewell to the theater was a 
dynamite, visually stunning rethinking of Frank Loesser's 1961 "How to Succeed 
in Business Without Really Trying," slated for a Broadway opening in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics like Robert Brustein traditionally frown upon regional theaters that 
use their stages as developing ground for Broadway. About "How to Succeed," 
Michael Phillips, the critic for the San Diego Union-Tribune, wrote that 
"McAnuff is essentially a gun for hire, plucked from Broad way's revised A-list 
by Dodger Productions" and that the production "represents McAnuff's 
opportunity to nab a first-class Broadway revival property before they're all 
taken." 
</P>
<P>
 This assumes that, given a magical, perfect property, any director with talent 
can make a hit on Broadway, which, of course, is not the case. McAnuff and his 
design team reimagined what could easily have been a hopelessly irrelevant 
tale, and they injected it with an incredibly elusive, indefinable elan -- the 
pure joy of a musical that's clicking. "How to Succeed" makes it extremely 
difficult to side with the Brusteins of the world on what nonprofit should and 
should not be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently at the Ahmanson at the Doolittle, the Leiber and Stoller revue 
"Smokey Joe's Cafe" is also slated for a Broadway opening in March. Whether it 
will be a hit in New York is anybody's guess, but I feel pretty certain that no 
one in that city will be able to hear the big finale -- "Stand by Me" -- and 
not think of Citibank Visa, which has been relentlessly using the song for its 
theme since 1991. (A bank promises to stand by "whenever you're in trouble . " 
) 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few more thoughts on the season since June: 
</P>
<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum shared the experiences of three groups: Mexican Americans 
(Luis Valdez's "Bandido!"), Cuban Americans (Eduardo Machado's "Floating 
Islands") and female Americans (Lisa Loomer's "The Waiting Room"), and female 
Americans got the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer's play about self-image and plastic surgery holds out the possibility 
of a time when women won't be accomplices in their own degradation, when they 
can turn away from the self-loathing implicit in repeat cosmetic surgery. This 
represents a rare instance of a playwright on a bandwagon who still manages to 
be witty and moving and imaginative. 
</P>
<P>
 S outh Coast Repertory gave us a searing "A Streetcar Named Desire," which 
paid wonderful tribute to Tennessee Williams and, in a strange way, to Jessica 
Tandy who died on the eve of the opening. As riveted as I was by the 
production, I wrote that Kandis Chappell, although a fine actress, was miscast 
physically in the role of Blanche DuBois. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently I received many letters from people who objected to the premise 
of my criticism -- saying that if an actress can act the role it matters little 
whether she looks the role. As I once heard Pauline Kael say on "The Dick 
Cavett Show," "Well, you know, Dick, taste is the great divider."*

THEATER NOTES; WINNING ENTRIES FROM A FULL FIELD 
</P>

<P>
 So much professional theater takes place in the Los Angeles area that any 
"best of" list is bound to be unfair, because no one has the time to see even 
half of what's available. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw 141 performances this year -- all but a handful of them in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. That may sound like a lot. But it's not even a quarter of 
the shows that are offered under Actors' Equity agreements in Southern 
California during an average year (final figures for 1994 are not in). 
</P>
<P>
 Caveats aside, I'm particularly grateful I saw these 1994 shows, in 
alphabetical order: 
</P>
<P>
 "Assassins" (Los Angeles Repertory Theatre at Los Angeles Theatre Center's 
Theatre 4). This Stephen Sondheim/John Weidman musical-comedy about the 
troubled souls who try to shoot the President moves from little Theatre 4 to a 
larger LATC hall on Jan. 17, opening up a lot more seats (and more comfortable 
ones at that), all of which deserve to be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awake and Sing!" (Odyssey Theatre). 1994 brought several remarkable revivals 
of brawling American work from the '30s ("Counsellor-at-Law," below, and the 
Blank Theatre's "The Cradle Will Rock"). But none topped the Odyssey's 
rendition of Clifford Odets' portrait of a Brooklyn family on the edge of 
despair. Still playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Collected Plays of Justin Tanner" (Cast Theatre). Justin Tanner emerged 
in 1994 as L.A.'s most currently interesting home-grown playwright, thanks to 
the decision by Cast producer Diana Gibson to stage all eight of his 
Cast-nurtured comedies in repertory. Still playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Counsellor-at-Law" (Interact Theatre). In two dramas from different eras, 
John Rubinstein played upscale American Jews beset by personal woes in the 
assimilation process. In the fascinating "Sight Unseen" at the Odyssey, 
Rubinstein merely replaced another actor. But in Elmer Rice's sprawling 
"Counsellor-at-Law," he co-directed as well as starred. The result is fairly 
miraculous -- 24 actors create one memorable characterization after another at 
this small theater in a residential neighborhood in North Hollywood. Still 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyman at the Mall" (Cornerstone Theater at Santa Monica Place). Bill Rauch 
and Shishir Kurup cooked up the year's most inventive staging, using the 
storefronts and escalators of a shopping mall to illustrate the 
anti-materialist theme of this ancient English morality play. Their 
multicultural and ecumenical adaptation fits beautifully into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Glass Menagerie" (Theatricum Botanicum) and "A Streetcar Named Desire" 
(South Coast Repertory). Seeing these sterling productions within a few days of 
each other in the late summer more or less settled the question -- for a few 
weeks, at least -- of whether Tennessee Williams really was America's greatest 
playwright. Director Heidi Helen Davis' decision to split the character of Tom 
in "Menagerie" between two actors worked magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green Icebergs" (South Coast Repertory). Cecilia Fannon's comedy about the 
reshuffling of the marital deck for two Orange County couples during an Italian 
holiday wasn't totally credible, but it was giddily entertaining throughout and 
ultimately made a trenchant moral comment, without being preachy. 
</P>
<P>
 "House of Correction" (Theatre 40). This welcome revival of Norman Lock's 
biting black comedy about the impossibility of justice moved like a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hysteria" (Actors' Gang). Tracy Young revised her 1992 musical comedy about 
women's control over their own bodies, and her audacious split-level show was 
second only to "Assassins" in the provocative musicals sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life in the Trees" (Melrose Theatre). Catherine Butterfield's three one-acts 
have different characters and casts, but they're tied together in a variety of 
tantalizing and amusing ways to create a whole that's greater than the sum of 
its parts. Mary Lou Belli's staging couldn't be better. Still playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marvin's Room" (Tiffany Theatre). Dennis Erdman directed a funny and 
heartening production of Scott McPherson's comedy about facing death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown" (Celebration Theatre). Guillermo 
Reyes' series of monologues about gay Latino immigrants was fired up by the 
dynamic and chameleonic performance of Felix A. Pire. 
</P>
<P>
 "1940's Radio Hour" (Actors Co-op at Crossley Theatre). Alan Johnson's staging 
of Walton Jones' warmhearted slice of life is a peerless re-creation of a time 
and a place. Still playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Business" (Court and Coast theaters). As a high-powered father and son, 
Harold Gould and Alan Rosenberg waged war on each other without ever appearing 
on stage together. It was a moving confrontation, guided by Joe Cacaci's deft 
writing and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The School for Scandal" (A Noise Within). Director Art Manke applied a thin 
but stylish layer of updating to the design of this Richard Sheridan classic 
and assembled a wonderful gallery of comic characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Visit" (Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble). Friedrich Durrenmatt's great 
play about the quality of justice was enormously compelling in Stephanie 
Shroyer's environmental staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: There are too many autobiographical monologues in L.A. 
theater, so I hesitate to encourage others. But Marga Gomez's "Memory Tricks," 
Colin Martin's "Virgins and Other Myths" and Lynn Redgrave's "Shakespeare for 
My Father" momentarily managed to redeem the genre. Also here's a nod to three 
grand star turns in old-fashioned musicals: Sandy Duncan in "South Pacific," 
Marie Osmond in "The Sound of Music," Karen Morrow in "Hello, Dolly!" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a tip of the bowler hat to Bill Irwin and David Shiner for "Fool 
Moon." For me, this show lacked the sense of discovery that I felt during the 
two men's individual earlier efforts. But for the many who had never seen them, 
the tonic of their post-earthquake appearance at the Doolittle certainly 
qualified as one of the year's more blessed events.

 The "Sunset" Saga: After Glenn Close got the nod to star in the Broadway 
production of "Sunset Boulevard," Andrew Lloyd Webber asked Faye Dunaway to 
replace her in L.A. But a few weeks later he changed his mind, decreeing that 
Dunaway couldn't sing. With no time to find yet another Norma Desmond, and with 
slumping summer advances, Lloyd Webber closed the L.A. run with Close's final 
performance. Dunaway sued Lloyd Webber, but an out-of-court settlement is 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Incredible Shrinking Theatre Corp.: With its Pasadena Playhouse-based 
circuit of productions already up and running in three cities, Theatre Corp. of 
America opened 1994 by launching a second circuit of three different venues, 
starting at the newly renovated Alex Theatre in Glendale. But it cost too much. 
By May, Theatre Corp. was going broke and scaled back, leaving angry 
subscribers in satellite cities. By August, the company had retreated to only 
its original Pasadena venue -- and even there the company had to borrow 
$200,000 from the city to keep going. The city of Glendale took Theatre Corp. 
to court over its abrupt withdrawal from the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-Size Mania: More than 1,000 attended a July conference on developing 
mid-size theaters in L.A. Along these lines, the city of Glendale approved $2.5 
million each to Colony Studio Theatre and A Noise Within to help establish 
mid-size theaters. Santa Susana Repertory Company opened a new mid-size venue 
in Thousand Oaks, Grove Theater Center reopened an old one in Garden Grove, 
Laguna Playhouse bought a new one and the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts won 
$250,000 in federal seed money for a theater on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Invigorated Ovations: Theatre LA's Ovation Awards, previously presented for 
lifetime achievement, became L.A.'s first peer-judged competitive theater 
awards, handed out in a ceremony at the Alex. The big winners: Center Theatre 
Group, "Sunset Boulevard," "Fool Moon," "Men on the Verge of a His-panic 
Breakdown" and Blank Theatre Co.'s "The Fantasticks." 
</P>
<P>
 Taper Tonys: The Mark Taper Forum co-produced three of the four nominees for 
best play in this year's Tony competition, a record for a producer in a single 
production category. "Angels in America: Perestroika" won. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Advances: The Ahmanson Theatre went through a $17.1-million 
renovation and was rededicated on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino Lab Moves: After only a year of the Mark Taper Forum's Latino Theatre 
Initiative and the poorly received "Bandido!," the Latino Theatre Lab left the 
Taper to try to create a mid-size company at Plaza de la Raza. The Taper's 
second mainstage show under the Initiative -- the two-part "Floating Islands" 
-- also was judged a dud. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Moves: The Jan. 17 temblor derailed Actors Alley's city-supported move 
into El Portal Theatre, closed Henry Fonda Theatre for more than a year, 
damaged the Pantages, and sent several small companies in search of new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 New Faces of '94: Tom McCoy and Cathy Rigby took over La Mirada Theatre's 
professional series, Michael Greif the La Jolla Playhouse, Luke Yankee the Long 
Beach Civic Light Opera and James Freydberg the Coronet Theatre.Don Shirley

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; THE BECKMESSER AWARDS OF 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By Martin Bernheimer, Martin Bernheimer is The Times' music and dance critic.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a happy, sad, frustrating, exhilarating, discouraging, encouraging, 
soothing, frazzling, stimulating, depressing, uplifting, bracing, painful, 
joyous, provocative, dull, exciting, hysterical, lackadaisical, exceptional, 
humdrum year. Just like 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 To commemorate the high -- and low -- points, The Times proudly and 
shamelessly presents the 27th annual awards dedicated to the spirit and memory 
of medieval Nurnberg's immortal, most noble, most misunderstood humanitarian, 
critic, musicologist, lutenist, poet, singer, bon vivant and guardian of public 
virtue, Sixtus Beckmesser. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us know if we have overlooked anything. Cheers 
</P>
<P>
 Out- of- town media hero of the year: Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most stirring demonstrations of orchestral vitality: The heroic 
concerts of the Kirov Orchestra of St. Petersburg, conducted by Valery Gergiev. 
</P>
<P>
 Dignity- under- pressure award: To Jane Alexander, who tried to sustain 
credibility as the National Endowment for the Arts crumbled around her -- with 
a political future now bleaker than bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagnerian critic of the year: A posthumous award to Katanda, the sensitive 
cud-chewing okapi who threw a fit and collapsed after artists from the Danish 
Opera began to sing excerpts from "Tannhauser" at a summer concert in the 
Copenhagen zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ligeti-split award: To Kurt Sanderling, whose warm and expansive Beethoven, 
Schubert and Brahms are sorely missed at a Philharmonic that now shines in 
fresh-frozen Bartok, Messiaen and Lutoslawski. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most blissful overachiever: Placido Domingo, who sings strenuous 
leading roles virtually every other night, conducts pit bands in between (for 
better or worse, mostly worse), gives normal-size as well as monster-concerts, 
continues to expand his huge repertory, serves as official adviser to the Music 
Center Opera, and now -- ridi , Pagliaccio -- has taken over leadership of the 
Washington Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera- survives- even- in- Los- Angeles award: To the Music Center forces that 
gave us "El Gato Montes," "Rosenkavalier" and "Xerxes" -- all good enough to 
make us nearly forget, though not forgive, the local "Faust," "Boheme" and 
"Elektra." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh- he- isn't- a- faker award: To Bobby (son of former Met baritone Robert) 
McFerrin, incipient maestro for all -- well, many -- reasons.

 Happiest- respite- from- the- summer- Bowldrums award: To Yoav Talmi and the 
San Diego Symphony for playing intimate Schubert indoors at Copley Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most- inspired- combination- of- art- and- altruism award: To the San Diego 
Symphony genius who placed a bloodmobile to accept donations outside the 
concert hall the night the orchestra hosted a screening of "Nosferatu." 
</P>
<P>
 The stimulation- lingers- on award: To the brave powers that be at the 
otherworldly Ojai Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 It- wasn't- perfect- but- it- sure- took- guts award: To the usually cautious, 
sometimes even tawdry Opera Pacific for bringing "Die Walkure" to Costa Mesa, 
while better-endowed Los Angeles continued to neglect Wagnerian music-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 He's- good- even- if- he- ain't- that- good award: To Bryn Terfel, undeniably 
talented Welsh baritone who made an emphatically overballyhooed Met debut as 
Mozart's Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
 There's- no- Commie- hiding- under- the- podium award: To the American Civil 
Liberties Union for exposing the pathetic continuing effort by the FBI to prove 
that Leonard Bernstein posed a threat to our national security. 
</P>
<P>
 Once- in- a- while- the- good- guy- wins award: To Don Bondi for maintaining 
standards of taste and decency while triumphing over bogus accusations of 
racism at the L.A. County High School for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most charming musical salesman: John Mauceri, ever slick emcee and dauntless 
maestro of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most poignant musical moment: Jessye Norman singing "Panis Angelicus" 
at the funeral of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Jeers 
</P>
<P>
 Most- callous- changing- of- the- guard award: To the youth-oriented 
Philharmonic management, which seems to find players of a certain age (even 
concertmasters) easily expendable -- talent, dedication and record of service 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most costly and least funny musical jokes: The tacky concerts of the 
World Cup Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple-hyperbole award: To Itzhak Perlman, pitchperson of the year, for his 
reckless push-button gush as narrator for the triple-tenorissimo telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 What's-in-a-name? award: To the managerial hucksters who tried to persuade us 
that a bus-and-truck farm club called the Moscow Grigorovich Ballet was really 
the mighty Bolshoi. 
</P>
<P>
 There- otta- be- a- law award: To local and visiting dance companies, 
including the one bemoaned above, that think it is artistically defensible to 
straitjacket the dancers with recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddest retrenchment: The shrinking of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra 
season and distancing of its music director, Christof Perick, as the result of 
yet another financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddest- it- ain't- what- it- used- to- be award: To the Royal Ballet of 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 The- still- unanswered- question award: To Peter Hemmings, who makes us keep 
asking why first- rate conductors are so scarce at the Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Most- irksome- trials- in- the- name- of- culture award: To the stations that 
stoop to obnoxious carnival-hawker fund-raising marathons on behalf of 
"non-commercial" radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most dubious journalistic achievement: The institution of Tutti, a 
bubble-gum music magazine for Neanderthals, published at a time when America no 
longer can claim a single serious magazine on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Things- are- rough- all- over awards: To the embattled American Ballet Theatre 
and Joffrey Ballet, both of which are canceling key engagements as they teeter 
(again) on the brink of ultimate fiscal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Was- this- trip- necessary? award: Shared by Marilyn Horne and Jerry Hadley, 
for their cynical popsy-schlocksy crossover CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffery- lives- in- Pasadena award: To Ambassador Auditorium for calling 
18-year-old Alex Slobodyanik "astounding" and for pushing both Ivo Pogorelich 
(the resident dubious-contest impresario) and John Williams (the guitarist) as 
"superstars." 
</P>
<P>
 Year's saddest quasi-comeback: Van Cliburn's much ballyhooed, ultimately 
aborted attempt to re-melt the snows of yesteryear at Hollywood Bowl. Curious 
and Curiouser  
</P>
<P>
 Oddest- aesthetic- double- standard award: To the Pulitzer Prize honchos who 
choose critics for the drama jury but composers for the music jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Political- correctness- is- terrific- but- this- is- bizarre award: To the 
cellist in Eureka who urged a boycott of "Peter and the Wolf" on grounds of 
animal insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics- critics- everywhere award: To the musically sensitive itch- producing 
scabies (mites that burrow under the skin) that infested the orchestra pit at 
the end of one of the deadliest San Francisco Opera seasons in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most expressive operatic actor: The tenor portraying the aristocratic 
Mantuan in an avant-gardish "Rigoletto" in Stuttgart who, according to the 
magazine Opernwelt, "turned and urinated during 'La donna e mobile.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Journalistic-puzzlement awards: To the New York Times for viewing Esa-Pekka 
Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic through the rosiest of rose-colored 
glasses in a huge advance story, then sending its No. 2 critic to cover the 
Lincoln Center concerts. (New York Newsday's No. 1, not incidentally, stayed 
away too.) 
</P>
<P>
 Culture- is- alive- and- well- in- the- City- of- Angels award: To the Music 
Center Opera advertising virtuosa who advised potential customers to pronounce 
Xerxes "ZERK-sees." 
</P>
<P>
 Year's best defender of verbal aids in quest of cultural survival: The same 
advertising virtuosa, who explained that she learned her lesson when she worked 
for a ballet company and would-be patrons requested tickets for something 
called "One-Gin" (as in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
 Virtue-by-association award: To James Doolittle for selling the Radio City 
Music Hall Rockettes in tandem with the Joffrey Ballet to local yokels as part 
of a "dance events of distinction" package. 
</P>
<P>
 Year's loneliest stranger in paradise: Ballet at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep-on-digging award: To the Music Center authorities who promise to replace 
the parking lot across the street with a symphonic auditorium called Disney 
Hall but seem unable to advance much beyond Disney Hole. Quotable Quotes  
</P>
<P>
 Ach- for- the- good- old- days award: To Christa Ludwig on "today's 
conductors": "I think they are afraid to show personality. That would explain 
the revival of Baroque music. It's the kind of music-making you can hide 
behind. They don't give themselves . . . and I have always believed the 
personality of the conductor has to be in the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Love- is- where- you- find- it award: To Luciano Pavarotti, who dedicated a 
song during his Met recital to a soprano in the audience named Freni, saying, 
"With Mirella I have done everything except love." The tenorissimo voiced 
agreement when a voice from a balcony suggested that it wasn't too late. The 
reaction of Freni's husband, basso Nicolai Ghiaurov, went unreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical- myopia- in- excelsis award: To Tibor Rudas, P. T. Barnum of 
quasi-concerts, for his souvenir-book description of the three-tenor circus at 
Dodger Stadium: "One of the landmark events marking the close of the 20th 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden hearing-aid award: To Tibor Rudas, for his official pronouncement on 
the disastrous, echo-ridden, booming, electronified mock acoustics imposed on 
the tenors at Dodger Stadium: "Without a doubt, the finest concert sound ever 
experienced out-of-doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Year's most revealing aesthetic admission: Zubin Mehta's published comments on 
the glories of conducting eine kleine junk-Musik with Luciano, Placido and Jose 
in a ballpark: "I am flying on a magic carpet with them. . . . They don't know 
what a fan I am. . . . I am completely in my element with this concert." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanna-bet? award: To Paul Griffiths of the New Yorker, who claimed that Zubin 
Mehta "is remembered with far more fondness in Los Angeles than in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Soprano-critic of the year: The splendid Karita Matilla, who thus described 
the staging conditions at her Met debut for Finnish Music Quarterly: "That must 
have been one of the most dreadful 'Don Giovanni' productions I have ever been 
involved with. . . . The director Franco Zeffirelli was interested in nothing 
much more than how the thing looked -- the staging and the lights." Milestones 
</P>
<P>
 Stay- tough- stay- bright- stay- in- business award: To the vicissitudinous 
Los Angeles Philharmonic, on the occasion of its 75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>

Pierre Boulez on the occasion of his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone- for- the- moment- but- hardly- forgotten award: To Kathleen Battle, 
exquisite and temperamental diva, who was fired by the mercurial Met 
administration reportedly for difficult behavior at rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 Auf- Wiedersehen- and- Addio awards: To Christa Ludwig, who, for reasons 
unknown, never appeared much in Los Angeles, and is one of the last of a 
vanishing artistic breed. And to Carlo Bergonzi, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
 The- Barenboim- memorial- now- you- see- him- now- you- don't award: To 
Myung-Whun Chung, latest conductor to be pushed through the revolving Bastille 
door by the politicos who run the Paris Opera.

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; ROCK TURNS A VERY YOUNG 40; THANKS TO A NEW GENERATION OF 
MUSICAL REVOLUTIONARIES, FIVE ALBUMS QUALIFY AS THE YEAR'S FINEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who would have imagined that rock 'n' roll would be so vital and inspiring at 
40? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite evidence as recently as 1990 that the music had once again lost its 
relevance, a new generation of musicians has stepped forward with purpose and 
direction -- just as the Beatles and Bob Dylan did in the '60s, Bruce 
Springsteen and the Sex Pistols in the '70s, R.E.M. and U2 in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest rescue unit is drawn chiefly from artists whose music expresses 
the anger and alienation of growing up amid broken homes, hostile surroundings 
and meaningless job expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rock revolution so deeply rooted that it has given us an abundance of 
riches in 1994. Some years it is difficult to find one album that lives up to 
the ambition and craft suggested by the term album of the year . This year, 
there are five: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (1) Hole, "Live Through This" (DGC Records). The cover photo of a beauty queen 
at the moment of victory is the ideal introduction to Hole's major-label debut. 
In a more innocent age, being elected queen was seen by young girls as one of 
life's ultimate joys -- right up there with meeting Mr. Perfect and raising 
those beautiful kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of these songs, singer-songwriter Courtney Love slashes with the 
force of a machete at the idea of guaranteed happiness. She expresses 
disappointment and disillusionment in songs so naked and raw that you expect 
the photo on the album's back cover to show the queen's dead flowers. 
"Someday," she warns, "you will ache like I ache." Instead, the photo shows a 
young, barefooted Love, back when all her childhood dreams were intact. What 
gives Hole's music its power is that Love -- despite her loudmouth, 
confrontational persona -- still clings to fairy tales and the hope that life 
can be transformed magically by romance or, heaven forbid, rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of "Live Through This," with its tales of obsession and betrayal, 
lies in the tension between what Love wants to believe and the stark reality of 
her own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (2) Nine Inch Nails, "The Downward Spiral" (Nothing/TVT/Interscope). Trent 
Reznor may be the most gifted blend of singer, writer and producer since 
Prince. His tenacious guitar- and synthesizer-driven music is not as overtly 
confessional as Love's but it explores today's youthful Angst with breathtaking 
dynamics and craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Prone to dark, desperate themes and frequently shocking language, Reznor 
misses no opportunity to startle or jolt -- in the tradition of the horror 
movies he loved as a kid. Yet "The Downward Spiral" isn't a celebration of 
nihilism. Rather, the songs chronicle the moments of self-destruction and rage 
in an age in which nothing, from family to religion, seems to offer hope of 
comfort or salvation for millions of young people. In a career year, Reznor 
also was the star of Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (3) Pearl Jam, "Vitalogy" (Epic). The most difficult thing in rock is stepping 
up to greatness after you've already been declared a superstar, which is why 
Pearl Jam's rise to creative excellence after two commercial blockbusters 
stands as one of the most remarkable feats of '90s rock. Where it was once 
predictable and stiff, Pearl Jam's music now seduces and assaults you in 
unexpected and frequently spectacular ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Vedder too has improved dramatically as a writer, able now to reflect 
upon the world around him -- from relationships to rock 'n' roll pressures -- 
with the mastery and heart of his own hero, Pete Townshend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (4) Neil Young & Crazy Horse, "Sleeps With Angels" (Reprise). Young, who began 
making records long before most of this new crop of rockers entered grade 
school, also focuses on today's troubled youth. The result is an album as 
tender and soul-baring as anything Young has done since 1975's "Tonight's the 
Night," which was written after the drug-related deaths of two friends. This 
album also refers to a pair of deaths: the drive-by shooting of a young victim 
and the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The message is one of renewed optimism and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (5) R.E.M., "Monster" (Warner Bros.). Following the mostly muted, melancholy 
textures of "Out of Time" and "Automatic for the People," R.E.M. takes a sharp 
turn into the world of feisty rock 'n' roll, and it's a pleasure ride indeed: a 
virtual jigsaw puzzle that invites the listener to unscramble the themes and 
identify the teasing musical influences. Most of the themes deal with romantic 
obsession, and the influences range from the Beatles and grunge to R.E.M. 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (6) Liz Phair, "Whip-Smart" (Matador/Atlantic). Even those who admired Phair's 
debut collection last year had to wonder just how much her appeal depended on 
the titillation factor. While not above resorting again briefly to sexual 
imagery that might make her mom blush, Phair proves that her strongest weapons 
in these tales of sexual politics and desire are her wry intelligence and 
writing skills. A major arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (7) Soundgarden, "Superunknown" (A&M). Like Pearl Jam, this is a band that has 
grown creatively while under the spotlight. The sound still seems a bit too 
close at times to the Led Zeppelin-Black Sabbath power-driven tradition, but 
the questioning, independent spirit updates nicely the honesty and punch of the 
Minutemen, Husker Du and other trailblazing underground rock bands of the early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (8) Beck, "Mellow Gold" (DGC). "Loser" is the song that made this young 
hip-hop-folkie-rocker-whatever a star, but other tracks on this wonderfully 
eclectic debut, including the Dylanesque sarcasm of "Pay No Mind," could have 
done the trick if college radio programmers had picked up on them instead. It's 
too early to tell where this 24-year-old's bootheels are going to wander, but 
he's worth following. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (9) Dionne Farris, "Wild Seed -- Wild Flower" (Columbia). To the rest of the 
pop world, Farris, the only non-rock entry on this year's list, took a big 
chance when she left Arrested Development, where she had contributed soulful 
vocal coloring on the much-admired "Tennessee." But Farris knew one thing we 
didn't until now: She's a richly talented singer and writer with an adventurous 
musical vision that stretches from commentary to caress, from the Beatles to 
Curtis Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (10) Various artists, "Natural Born Killers" soundtrack (Nothing/Interscope). 
Don't judge a soundtrack by its movie. Oliver Stone's film about murderers as 
'90s superstars was maddeningly overwrought, but this collection, produced by 
Trent Reznor, takes us on an exhilarating roller-coaster ride through these 
violent, unsettling times as it mixes music (from Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan 
to Patti Smith and L7) and dialogue. A classic. More Top 10 Picks

1994: YEAR IN REVIEW; COMEDY; IT WAS A FRUITFUL TIME FOR ALL

 Any year that featured warring ice princesses, a pop icon who tried to alter 
the perception that he's weird as hell by marrying the daughter of another 
weird-as-hell pop icon, a celebrity double-murder suspect and Boris Yeltsin's 
nose job had to be a good one for comedians. Here are the top 10 things that 
affected comedy in 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 10 . David Letterman remains the man to watch in late night. 
</P>
<P>
 9 . But Jay Leno rebounded, with a new set and sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 8 . Dennis Miller returned in style, wisecracking through "Disclosure" and 
winning an Emmy for his HBO series' writing. 
</P>
<P>
 7 . Howard Stern turned saving a man's life into high drama and turned his 
ability to get publicity from it into even higher drama. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Roseanne kept at it, dumping Tom Arnold and carrying a li'l Rosie or Roscoe 
courtesy her bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Following Jerry Seinfeld's lead, literary lions Paul Reiser and Tim Allen 
released slender volumes of observations based largely on their stand-up 
material and landed on bestseller lists next to the Pope's slender volume of 
observations. Next up: Brett Butler, Ellen DeGeneres and Dennis Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 4. While Hollywood struggled to create one solid comedy film, "Frasier" week 
in and week out crafted episodes filled with clever characterizations and 
plotting. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Tim Allen no doubt wishes there was some sort of clause in his contract 
paying him more for the success of "The Santa Clause" and "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Forrest Gump wasn't the only guy to profit from being deliriously dumb: Jim 
Carrey earned somewhere in the neighborhood of $35 million in 18 months. But 
the studios got even richer -- his three 1994 releases may gross $300 million 
in all. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Dan Quayle threatened to run for President in 1996, meaning all working 
comics get to dust off a lot of vintage material.*

FOR VARIFLEX, PROFITS JUST KEEP ROLLING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Variflex Inc. is no stranger to fads. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, the company rode to prominence on skateboard and roller-skate 
sales -- and a wild ride it was, since both products fell out of fashion at 
breakneck speed. Variflex even dabbled in foot-powered scooters -- remember 
those? 
</P>
<P>
 Now President Raymond H. Losi II thinks the Moorpark-based company finally has 
a product with staying power. Variflex in-line skates have been such a stunning 
success that even he seems a bit dazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales at Variflex have nearly quintupled since the company started making 
low-priced in-line skates in 1990. The skates accounted for 84% of $80 million 
in sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, up from $17 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought it would grow to this," Losi said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the growth shows no signs of abating. For the quarter ended Oct. 31., 
Variflex posted earnings of $2.8 million on record revenue of $32 million -- up 
94% from the past year's fiscal first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The stellar performance has not gone unnoticed on Wall Street: Variflex raised 
$20.7 million from its first public offering of shares last summer. The stock, 
which started at $15.50 a share, closed Friday at $19.75 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 For the engine behind the growth, look no further than the nearest city park 
or bike path on a Saturday afternoon. In-line skates, introduced as ice hockey 
training equipment, have grown so popular that industry experts compare their 
rise to that of bicycles. Today, more people own skates than ski equipment, and 
sales of in-line skates and related gear will approach $1 billion nationwide 
this year, according to Sports Market Research Group Inc. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a fad at all," said Kevin Dukesherer, an analyst with Kemper 
Securities Inc., the underwriter of Variflex's stock offering. "Fads are big 
purple dinosaurs and rocks that you name, but in-line skates are an outdoor 
activity for kids. . . . It's not a product that has a short life because you 
run out of things to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of two wheels on each of two axles, in-line skates have four wheels 
set in a single line to allow for greater speed and maneuverability. 
Lightweight, molded plastic boots and sturdy wheels have added to their 
widespread appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Variflex has succeeded because it sells some of the lowest-priced in-line 
skates. Its skates are manufactured in China, Taiwan and South Korea and sold 
primarily through Kmart, Toys R Us and Target stores. By using cheap labor and 
parts and producing volumes at low margins Variflex is able to sell skates for 
as little as $26.95 a pair. The skates offered by the industry leader, 
Minneapolis-based Rollerblade Inc., start at $50 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 And Variflex's brightly colored skates, unlike other brands, are geared toward 
children, based on the straightforward reasoning that children's feet grow and 
parents don't want to buy them costly footwear over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done their home work," said Ash Jaising, president of Sports Market 
Research Group. "They control the low end of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Variflex also sells protective gear for skaters and recently launched a line 
of low-price bicycle helmets toward the mass market. It still makes skateboards 
and roller-skates, but those items now account for less than 2% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, the company will introduce skates, sticks and protective gear 
for roller hockey, the fastest-growing roller sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Losi was a 25-year-old surfer and skateboarder when he started the company 
with his father in 1977. The senior Losi is chairman and nominally chief 
executive, though he is not involved in daily operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Variflex attained name recognition early on, but success on a broad scale had 
eluded it. Though both skateboards and roller-skates enjoyed spurts of 
popularity among adults, their true fans were a fairly limited pool: little 
boys and little girls, respectively. At times, sales of these core products 
were so sporadic that Variflex resorted to selling diapers and shipping tires 
to Mexico. Losi foresaw years of hard work just to keep the company afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father would say, 'How did you talk me into this?' " Losi recalled. "But I 
don't hear that any more." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Losi is preparing to move to a new house on a golf course. His 
hectic schedule includes monthly trips to Asia to sign up new suppliers. Tan 
and stocky, he eschews neckties, and his speech evokes the dude-speak Malibu 
surfer. He personally tests each new skate model and is sometimes spotted 
zipping around among the stacks of boxes in the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the market for in-line skates is expected to keep growing, the road 
ahead may not be without bumps for Variflex. The pace of expansion in the 
industry is notoriously unpredictable, noted Michael Shafran, editor of 
Denver-based InLine Retailer and Industry News. Just last year, market growth 
fell short of projections and stores were awash in skates they couldn't sell, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Variflex skates are not highly regarded for quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything they have is cheap. They've got bad wheels, bad bearings, bad 
boots," said Patrick Lochouarn, owner of Venice Roller Works. "They don't go; 
they don't roll; they don't give you good ankle support." 
</P>
<P>
 Lochouarn said he stopped selling Variflex skates because they generated too 
many returns and requests for service. 
</P>
<P>
 Variflex says its skates are ideal for beginners who don't mind going slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollerblade recently introduced skates to challenge Variflex's dominance of 
the children's market. Priced at about $80 a pair, they come with liners of 
varying thickness so the size of the boot can be adjusted as a child grows, 
Rollerblade spokeswoman Cici Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Losi says he isn't worried about the competition. With in-line skates, 
Variflex finally is onto a sure thing, he believes, and he says his years of 
experience with fads on wheels have taught him how to keep success from 
slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just working hard and staying ahead of the next craze," he said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: TAX CUTS LOOK CERTAIN; IMPACT IS ANOTHER MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether it's good will or good sense, the Christmas spirit will continue into 
the New Year, with tax cuts a virtual certainty in 1995. Ruling Republicans in 
Congress want to cut the capital gains tax rate and boost tax credits; 
President Clinton wants to expand tax-deferred contributions to individual 
retirement accounts and increase other deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The betting in Washington is that any tax measure Clinton signs will include a 
cut in the capital gains tax, some IRA expansion and faster depreciation 
allowances so businesses can recover investments more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a feast of political pork. But it's more than that, says 
economist John Cogan of Stanford University. "All the current tax proposals -- 
Clinton with IRAs and the Republicans with capital gains -- support savings and 
investment. That represents a shift from soak-the-rich thinking," says Cogan, 
who was tapped by incoming Republicans to run the Congressional Budget Office 
but turned the job down for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cogan has spotted a trend. The next Congress will not only shift tax policy to 
reward saving and investment, it will begin a great debate over measures that 
would profoundly change the tax system -- from the consumption tax favored by 
Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to a "flat tax" proposed by 
Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Americans are likely to see the capital gains tax reduced from 28% 
to 15% and further encouragement of tax-deferred savings. 
</P>
<P>
 But those breaks will have to be offset by more than $50 billion a year in 
spending reductions or the federal deficit will balloon. That means spending 
cuts far deeper than the $12 billion a year Clinton proposed last week, when he 
revealed plans to trim the Departments of Transportation, Energy and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting $12 billion a year from a $1.5-trillion budget won't buy much in the 
way of tax relief. Only painful cuts in big programs -- such as Medicare, farm 
subsidies, welfare and defense -- would allow taxes to be cut without worsening 
the $170-billion federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet financial markets seem confident that painful choices will be made. 
Bond investors have reacted calmly -- so far -- to tax cut talk from both 
parties. If they sensed that real spending cuts were not forthcoming, interest 
rates would soar and the dollar would weaken sharply as foreigners concluded 
that Americans were going to throw a party without paying the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 So to test whether tax cut promises are real, watch for serious attempts to 
curb spending on: 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare, which is expected to fall $57 billion into the red in the next 
four years 
</P>
<P>
 * Farm subsidies, which total about $12 billion a year 
</P>
<P>
 * Community Development Block Grants and other welfare and urban expenditures 
now costing $17 billion a year 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense. Decisions are going to have to be made to reduce the armed forces 
and the $64 billion plus that goes for military pay and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress and the White House address tough questions on such big programs, 
it's a very good sign for a lesser deficit, lower taxes and a stronger economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but . . . . Tough questions have always been avoided in the past. Why 
should it be different now? 
</P>
<P>
 Because a political shift is evident in the land, based partly on long-term 
worries about the national debt and Social Security. Former Sens. Paul Tsongas 
of Massachusetts and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire are drawing sizable 
audiences of middle-aged and older people to their Concord Coalition meetings 
-- including a recent one at Cal State Northridge -- with a stern message of 
budget and tax reform, including limits on Social Security for future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term, there is a simmering tax revolt among the young, many of whom find 
they're paying close to 40% of their incomes in combined federal, state and 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The young people are not mistaken, either, says Lawrence Stone, a former tax 
adviser to the U.S. Treasury and now a partner in the Los Angeles law firm 
Irell & Manella. 
</P>
<P>
 "They simplified the tax system and cut the rates in 1986," says Stone of that 
year's tax changes. "But since then, rates have crept up and loopholes have 
crept in again." He looks suspiciously on special tax breaks, including IRAs. 
"If they want to encourage saving, why not simply tax consumption?" Stone asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that Congress may take up that very idea in the coming session. 
The Nunn-Domenici consumption tax will be reintroduced and get a respectful 
hearing from new House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tex.), who wants 
to reform the income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Nunn-Domenici plan, you would add up your gross income, subtract all 
savings and investments and income from savings, and pay tax on the rest -- 
after deductions for mortgage interest, tuition or whatever is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey's flat-tax plan would set the income tax rate at 17% and eliminate most 
deductions, both lowering the rate for many taxpayers and broadening the base 
of revenue collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent behind both would be to encourage saving and investment, to provide 
ample capital for U.S. industry and to spur the American people to save 
seriously for retirement in a time when Social Security benefits alone will be 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no magic in either tax idea. Loopholes can always creep in. And if 
Congress tries to cut taxes without cutting government spending, as it did in 
1981, you'll see interest rates go through the roof and the dollar fall through 
the floor. Worry then about recession. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the capital gains rate and the budget deficit can be cut together, 
watch houses move on real estate markets and stocks and bonds gain smartly on 
financial markets. "A 15% capital gains rate would add 15% to the stock 
market," says one market watcher. 
</P>
<P>
 So 1995 may provide a simple test: whether tax cuts take the U.S. fiscal 
system down the road to ruin or the Dow Jones industrial average to 4,300. The 
answer will depend on political will.

 LAND HO! 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Tigrett, co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe and developer of the House of 
Blues, has his eye on future upscale blues joints around the country and as far 
afield as Paris. He is also reputed to be entertaining plans for themed 
entertainment real estate projects -- similar to CityWalk in Universal City -- 
in Las Vegas and elsewhere. . . . Koll Real Estate Group is pressing ahead with 
plans for a 3,300-home development in the environmentally sensitive Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. Expect opposition from environmental and Native American groups. . . 
. Merv Griffin, the one-man entertainment conglomerate, recently got the 
go-ahead to subdivide a 157-acre mountaintop above Benedict Canyon into six 
enormous home sites. . . . Raffi Cohen, the flamboyant developer, has yet to 
pull a rabbit out of his hat in the 20-year struggle to develop a prime piece 
of public land in Downtown Los Angeles, across from City Hall. If Cohen can't 
get the project back on track, he'll lose his development rights. KEEP ON 
TRUCKIN' 
</P>
<P>
 A milestone in the race to build an advanced transportation industry in 
California will be reached this spring when Special Vehicle Manufacturing Corp. 
in Downey rolls out the first composite-material electric school bus, the 
biggest innovation in 40 years in this transportation niche. The low-cost 
composite techniques, similar to those used in advanced aircraft and race cars, 
could help California compete with Georgia, king of the steel school bus 
chassis. A Blue-Bird electric bus prototype passed Antelope Valley testing with 
flying colors. . . . Truck sales will continue at a record pace as Americans 
trade in passenger cars for pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles. 
Chrysler will update its industry-leading minivan, and Honda has jumped in -- 
belatedly -- with the Odyssey, a four-door, Accord-based minivan. . . . Even 
with U.S. auto sales booming, General Motors is finding it tough to make money 
at home. Still, CEO John Smith says GM's turnaround is on track and promises 
that results will show up on the bottom line in 1995. Labor relations are 
likely to be come more strident as the United Auto Workers union crowns 
tough-talking Steve Yokich as its new president. GM is most vulnerable. A major 
priority for Yokich is settling a bitter 3-year-old dispute at Caterpillar. 
BANK ON IT 
</P>
<P>
 The North American Development Bank will open its doors in San Antonio next 
month. Set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the NADBank has 
$750 million available to finance environmental improvements along the 
2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Among those expected to apply for loans are 
Imperial Valley officials looking to treat sewage from the New River, which is 
polluted on the Mexicali side of the border but empties into the Salton Sea on 
the U.S. side. The deputy manager is Victor Miramontes, formerly a vice 
president with Wells Fargo Bank in San Antonio. . . . Paul Hazen, who takes 
over from Carl E. Reichardt as Wells Fargo chairman, displayed steel and savvy 
in negotiating Wells' 1986 takeover of Crocker National Bank and slashing 5,000 
employees in the process. He has been quiet about plans for the state's 
third-largest banking company. HOLLYWOOD DREAMIN' 
</P>
<P>
 Look for some high-profile hirings and announcements from Jeffrey Katzenberg, 
David Geffen and Steven Spielberg as the King's Ransom Trio tries to overcome 
Hollywood skepticism about plans to open a new studio. The entertainment titans 
have dubbed themselves the Dream Team but the proposed studio has yet to be 
blessed with a moniker. . . . Viacom needs more than "Forrest Gump" to make its 
$10-billion Paramount acquisition pay off. It will be up to Viacom 
Entertainment unit Chairman Jonathan Dolgen to contain costs and generate 
entertainment profits. . . . Sony must prove that it can recover from a 
miserable year in Hollywood. A lot of eyes will be on former CBS Entertainment 
chief Jeff Sagansky in his still vague but growing role at Sony. . . . Walt 
Disney Co. must continue to turn around its theme park business, though company 
profit will soar regardless after "The Lion King" comes out on videocassette in 
the spring. . . . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's current regime, led by Frank Mancuso, 
will finally release a full slate of its own films, giving it a chance to prove 
it can rebuild the venerable studio. SHOP TILL THEY DROP 
</P>
<P>
 Inveterate shoppers eagerly await the arrival of nirvana -- a.k.a. 
Bloomingdale's -- on the California scene. Federated Department Stores Chairman 
Allen Questrom and his troops will presumably be choosing two Southland sites 
for East Coast mainstay Bloomie's by spring, with openings likely before 
year-end. . . . Questrom will also put his imprint on Bullock's and other 
stores of R.H. Macy & Co., which merged with Federated in late December after a 
painful period in bankruptcy. It's a homecoming of sorts for Questrom, who 
headed Bullock's in its heyday. . . . Meanwhile, David Dworkin, Broadway 
Stores' chief exec, will be aiming to gather sales momentum at the chain, also 
getting back on its feet after an episode in Bankruptcy Court. With store 
renovations complete, the retailer will push its Taste of California housewares 
line and introduce new casual clothing lines. . . . Yucaipa Cos. Chairman Ron 
Burkle rocked the Southern California supermarket industry with a deal to merge 
his Food 4 Less chain with 121-year-old Ralphs Grocery. Now comes the hard 
part: He must negotiate the regulatory process and consolidate operations. Good 
news for shoppers: Burkle promises to escalate the grocery price war. . . . 
Down the aisle, look for giant Tri-Valley Growers, a fruit and vegetable 
processing cooperative based in San Francisco, to be bought or merged with 
another company. Over-leveraged and undercapitalized, the co-op faces stiff 
competition in the tough new world of global agriculture. Shoppers know one of 
its best-known subsidiaries, S&W Fine Foods. CRUISING THE INFOBAHN 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year, Congress will take another stab at opening up the burgeoning 
telecommunications industry to more competition, and two new faces will guide 
the effort: Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) and Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.). 
Billions of dollars and potentially 1 million jobs will ride on their reform 
effort. . . . In California, the scramble is on as MCI, AT&T and others try to 
win local long-distance customers from Pacific Bell and GTE, with competition 
opening up in that market on New Year's Day. The California Public Utilities 
Commission has vowed to end monopolies in all phone markets by 1997. . . . 
Cellular phone magnate Craig McCaw is on the prowl for licenses to offer 
personal communications services, the new generation of wireless technology. A 
federal auction of 99 broad-band PCS licenses is expected to generate more than 
$4 billion. . . . The launching of the new United Paramount and WB networks 
will test whether viewers really want a fifth and a sixth network, let alone 
500 channels. IN THE CHIPS 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on Lawrence Ellison of Oracle, a database company that wants to be 
a key cog in the info revolution by making possible such applications as video 
on demand. Also John Moussouris, who promises that his MicroUnity Systems 
Engineering will ship super-fast chips that can perform multimedia tasks that 
now require several microprocessors. . . . No matter how late its arrival, 
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system is likely to make the personal 
computer trade's biggest splash next year. The real war for the hearts of 
computer users is fought at the operating system level, and the battle comes 
down to these questions: Who is the best marketer and who has the biggest 
installed base? Windows 95 beats offerings from Apple Computer and IBM by 
default, despite their superior ease of use. . . . Microsoft CEO Bill Gates 
will be the hot individual to watch; besides Windows 95, he's rolling out 
Microsoft Network, the company's entry in the sizzling on-line arena. A 
potential stumbling block: Will the Justice Department clear Microsoft's 
pending merger with Intuit, the king in personal-finance software, or bow to 
concerns of bankers and other financial service companies? . . . Apple is 
likely to license its Macintosh operating system to Motorola, a partner in the 
company's PowerPC venture. If Motorola starts making Power Macintosh clones the 
platform will get a needed boost, but 1995 is also expected to be the year 
Intel's Pentium microprocessor outsells the popular 486 chip -- especially 
since Intel promised to replace flawed chips. INFORMATION, PLEASE 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic commerce could come of age as security and convenience improve. 
Helping to foment change will be Netscape Communications of Mountain View, 
Calif., which is licensing navigation software that makes the Internet 
comprehensible to average mortals. . . . The integration of PCs and TVs will 
continue apace with cable modems that transfer data as much as 1,000 times 
faster than conventional modems. Interactive television trials will proceed in 
markets from Castro Valley, Calif., to Orlando, Fla. . . . Can agent Michael 
Ovitz drum up business for the Baby Bells with which he is allied? Stay tuned. 
. . . Multimedia will reach critical mass as the number of U.S. homes with 
computer systems that play shiny CD-ROMs more than doubles, to 10 million. . . 
. Video games will increasingly go on line. But Sega Enterprises, Sony Computer 
Entertainment and NEC Home Electronics, all based in Japan, are among the game 
makers hoping to escape a sluggish market for their machines with new 
high-powered, 32-bit devices. In the wings is a 64-bit system that Nintendo 
hopes to release next fall. . . . Little Grafix Zone in Irvine opened the 
recording industry's eyes and ears to interactivity this year with a CD-ROM 
based on the work of Prince; coming soon is a multimedia Bob Dylan in "Highway 
61 Interactive." The times, they are a-changin'. HOW ARE WE DOING? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy casts a wide shadow over California, but its 
effects on the state economy will be subtle and modestly negative at worst. The 
crisis will clip a percentage point -- about $800 million -- off the county's 
economic growth. Freeway renovations won't advance and an $82-million police 
information network will stay on ice. . . . With small companies as the 
workhorses pulling California out of the ditch, the state's recovery is likely 
to pick up steam even as the nationwide upturn begins to show signs of fatigue. 
The number of payroll jobs should register somewhat healthier gains than the 
paltry increase of 6,000 over the last 12 months, despite continued problems in 
aerospace and the planned closures of military bases. California consumers 
won't spend with the gleeful abandon of pre-recession times, but the forecast 
is for a continued upswing as incomes revive and job growth holds up. . . . 
Look for a high-profile role for real estate expert Dan Garcia, Warner Bros. 
executive and head of the Community Redevelopment Agency, as Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan pushes City Hall streamlining and economic development. Plans 
include reforming the permit process and folding the CRA into a super-agency 
for economic development. . . . The bipartisan federal commission that has 
already closed 22 of California's 66 military installations is going to take 
another whack at the state's remaining bases in March. Additional cuts could be 
deep. In San Diego County alone, local officials are fearful that the Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot, the North Island Naval Air Station and one or more of the 
four U.S. Navy research laboratories could be axed. ON THE (REGULATORY) 
WATERFRONT 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC will settle on a precedent-setting plan for a deregulated electric 
utility industry, with final adoption expected in September. The state's 
investor-owned utilities will face tough competition from independent power 
producers and rival utilities. Utility stocks are unlikely to appeal to widows 
and orphans any time soon. . . . With Republican Charles Quackenbush replacing 
John Garamendi as insurance commissioner, the industry is expecting much more 
sympathetic treatment in Sacramento. But Quackenbush has vowed to deliver all 
remaining rebates owed to policyholders under Proposition 103, the 1988 
rate-cutting initiative. . . . Joseph A. Dear, head of the U.S. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration, will be on the hot seat. A preliminary 
proposal designed to protect workers from carpal tunnel syndrome and other 
repetitive stress injuries is due out, and both labor and management groups are 
ready to pounce on anything they don't like about it. . . . As the 
fastest-growing sector of the environmental services industry, pollution 
prevention will be the buzzword for companies trying to comply with the law and 
also reduce overhead costs. Revamping manufacturing processes to make them 
cleaner is often cheaper than installing scrubbers and other machinery at the 
other end of the pipe. Big winners already in Southern California: Arco, 
Anheuser-Busch and Northrop. . . . California workers' compensation insurance 
rates will be deregulated in '95. When employers renew their policies, they'll 
find there is no longer a state-mandated minimum charge for their coverage. 
Critics say that some small firms will find themselves paying more. AND WATCH 
FOR... 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Groves, a former emergency room physician, has been at the forefront of 
change in California's rapidly evolving health care industry. In 1981, he 
founded one of the nation's first publicly held companies that manage group 
medical practices, Pacific Physician Services. The Redlands company has grown 
quickly and now provides medical services for more than 280,000 people, mostly 
in California. Aiming to put a tighter rein on costs, Pacific Physicians 
recently acquired a hospital in Montclair, where it can funnel patients and 
keep closer tabs on expenses. And Groves has snatched up medical practices in 
Nevada and North Carolina, two states with paltry HMO enrollment. . . . In Los 
Angeles, the pulse of the advertising business is measured with a speedometer. 
The new Venice agency Houston Effler Helm Stingley says its first order of 
business is to land an automotive account. Co-founder John Stingley handled 
creative work on the Infiniti at Chiat/Day.

 Kris Bhatt apologizes for the clutter of supplies stacked inside her Ford 
Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get calls on the road, so I have to have a little of everything," Bhatt, a 
respiratory therapist, explained as she set out for another long day of 
visiting patients across two counties. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a little bit like a country doctor, making rounds from the company's 
regional center in Cerritos to patients' homes, striking up friendships along 
the way. The people she treats are happy to be home instead of tethered to 
hospitals. And the costs are significantly less for insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why Bhatt's employer, Homedco Group Inc., is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley company is grabbing an ever larger share of the at-home 
care market, a segment one analyst says is growing at a rate of 10% a year. 
Homedco has succeeded not only by capitalizing on the trend, but by allying 
itself with medical groups and buying up smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been impressive earnings growth. Homedco's profit was up 22% to 
$29.8 million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the fourth straight year of 
double-digit increases.

 Homedco stock has risen right along with the earnings. After starting the year 
at $30.75, the firm's shares closed Friday at $36.50 UPDATE on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been recommending the stock for more than two years," said analyst 
Randall S. Huyser of the Furman Selz brokerage in San Francisco. "It's been a 
very consistent performer." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for that has been Homedco's attention to consolidation in 
the industry. Homedco extended its penetration deep into the Southeast and 
Midwest with its 1992 acquisition of Glasrock Home Health Care Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, they have become aggressive in acquisitions," said Vivian R. 
Wohl, an analyst for Robertson, Stephens & Co. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the company announced it had completed two more 
acquisitions. As with past deals, Homedco picks up the market share of Corpus 
Christi, Tex.-based Am-Tex Healthcare Services Inc. and Crest Medical Inc. of 
Marietta, Ga., but retains only a handful of their most essential or productive 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost savings go straight to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Homedco makes an acquisition . . . it can wipe out a fair amount of 
existing cost structure by, for instance, closing a branch," analyst Huyser 
said. It "can offer one-stop shopping for respiratory, home infusion and home 
medical equipment. That has proven to be attractive to managed-care payers, 
because Homedco is typically less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has paid special attention to courting managed-care operators and 
health maintenance organizations, to which it provides services on a flat-rate 
basis. Indeed, with the rapid expansion of managed care, Homedco is 
increasingly having to watch its own spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the future of health care being in prepaid plans," said Jeremy M. 
Jones, the boyish-looking chief executive who formed Homedco in a 1987 
management buyout of Santa Monica-based National Medical Enterprises' home care 
business. "We are becoming a cost manager as well as a (care) provider." 
</P>
<P>
 While cost management reduces revenues, Homedco is confident it will continue 
to expand thanks to two allies: government policy and demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government, Jones noted, has encouraged home care for more than a 
decade by limiting Medicare reimbursements. Doctors and hospitals recommend 
that patients convalesce at home because it is cheaper than extended 
hospitalization, and more and more medical equipment is being designed to be 
operated by the patient or a visiting technician without continual attention 
from nurses in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a confluence of managed care and technology that is pushing people (into 
treatment at) home," analyst Wohl said. "They want to be treated at home, and 
it is more cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Care at home still represents less than 2% of the government's medical 
spending, but that segment is expected to grow, and experts say it is less 
vulnerable than other segments when reimbursements are cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Homedco "should benefit over the next several years, because home health care 
is lower-cost," said Al Madison, an analyst for the investment banking firm 
Parker Hunter in Pittsburgh. "The trends are in their favor. They are a leader 
in home health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics have helped Homedco too. The population as a whole is growing 
older and people are living longer -- often with one of the chronic ailments 
for which Homedco provides treatment, according to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Homedco's business has roughly three segments. About two-thirds of revenue 
comes from respiratory therapy, which usually involves the supply of machines 
that assist patients' breathing as they sleep. The rest comes from equipment 
rentals and infusion therapy, the intravenous supply of medicine and 
nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The services are delivered by 4,600 employees in 45 states, people such as 
therapist Kris Bhatt who drive from home to home delivering equipment or 
helping patients use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhatt tries to visit each of her 25 patients at least once a month. Showing 
someone how to use a respirator can take several hours, but most visits last 
only a few minutes as she replaces filters or checks tubing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She keeps everything huffing and puffing," said Roger Wolcott, an FBI retiree 
who depends on a Homedco respirator at night in his Whittier home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolcott, 77, suffers from a disorder that can cause him to stop breathing 
while he sleeps. On this visit he suspects something is wrong with his machine. 
The tubes are tangled, and Bhatt replaces it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do well," Wolcott said of Homedco's visiting agents. "Sometimes they are 
kind of hard to get hold of, but that's nothing to (complain) about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bhatt, a mother of two, said meeting patients is the most enjoyable part of 
her work. On her last visit, one longtime patient, a 10-year-old, gave her "a 
big hug and kiss and said, 'Kris, I love you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another client, Margaret Hardenbrook of Long Beach, has become such a good 
friend that the two are always vowing to get together for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually follow her out to the car so I can get in a word about recipes and 
all," said Hardenbrook, who was disabled by polio as a teen-ager and uses a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhatt said she appreciates the relationships she develops in her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are caring and loving, it helps," she said. "You go with a smile and 
professionalism -- it helps the patient and the family both."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: YOUR MONEY; DEALING WITH THAT HOLIDAY 
CREDIT HANGOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the holiday bills start rolling in this January, many people will find 
new and ominous meaning in the expression The party's over . 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card spending, bolstered by increased consumer confidence and wider 
acceptance of plastic at such non-traditional outlets as supermarkets and 
fast-food joints, posted double-digit gains this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While that alone would be enough to give some consumers a credit hangover, the 
woes of the overextended are likely to be exacerbated this year because of 
higher interest rates. And whereas these rate increases hit other types of 
consumer loans in mid-1994, the bulk of the credit card rate hikes will hit in 
January, 1995 -- just as the holiday bills come due, says Robert McKinley, 
publisher of CardTrak, a credit card newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because credit card rates don't adjust as quickly as rates charged on 
other types of consumer loans, McKinley says. Moreover, the credit card market 
was uncharacteristically competitive in 1994, which forced some issuers to hold 
the line on rates longer than they normally would. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you do if holiday spending puts you in a New Year's crunch? Here are 
some tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a picture. The first step to handling a credit hangover is determining 
just how bad it is, says Becky Cutler, a credit consultant who wrote Citibank's 
"Coping with a Credit Crisis." Get out a notebook and start jotting down your 
expenses in three categories: Fixed expenditures, such as mortgage or rent 
payments, utilities and insurance; variable expenses, such as food, clothing 
and entertainment, and expenditures for short-term credit, including credit 
card debt and car payments. Compare the amount you're paying out for 
necessities to your after-tax income. 
</P>
<P>
 Trim, don't slash. If you're like many people, you spend almost every dime you 
earn on bills and daily living expenses. Without making cuts, there's little 
left to whittle down the holiday bills. But don't be overzealous. People who 
vow to cut too drastically rarely follow through, Cutler says. Resolve to 
simply trim. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at how and where you're spending and see how much you'd save by 
cutting out small, unnecessary luxuries -- the $2.50 morning cappuccino; the 
dollar or two dropped into the office vending machines; the $5 to $10 daily 
lunches. Most people can save upward of $100 a month by simply skipping costly 
snacks and brown-bagging a few days a week, says Judy Lawrence, an Albuquerque, 
N.M., budget counselor and author of "The Budget Kit." One client of Lawrence's 
discovered that she was spending $60 a month on vending machine snacks alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Involve the family. Discuss the credit situation with spouses and children and 
make sure everybody knows you're trying to cut back. There's no need to cause 
alarm -- just set goals and explain why you need to be frugal. Kids are often 
surprisingly supportive and creative, checking supermarket prices and sometimes 
voluntarily giving up their own luxuries, Lawrence says. And getting everyone 
on the same fiscal diet means no one person has to suffer alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Prioritize your debts. After trimming your expenditures, you ought to have a 
tidy sum to start paying against your debts. Many people are tempted to use the 
money to pay off their biggest loans. But a smarter tack is to pay off the 
highest-cost bills -- such as those 18% or 19% credit card balances, says Ruth 
Susswein, executive director of Bankcard Holders of America in Salem, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Put away the plastic. Another good way to cut back is to simply put the credit 
cards away for a few months. Cutler suggests stashing them in a safe-deposit 
box. That takes your cards out of reach on nights and weekends, when you're 
most vulnerable to binge spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop shopping. If you have little will power, walking into a mall after 
Christmas is like walking into a minefield. Banners trumpet post-holiday sales 
from virtually every store window. Exchanging a $10 item can easily turn into a 
$100 spending spree, Cutler says. Don't go if you can avoid it. If you must go, 
bring a friend who'll rein you in before you spend again. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider debt swapping. If you have good credit and high-cost credit card 
debts, you may be able to refinance your loans. Many credit card companies 
offer single-digit "teaser" rates. And people with homes can often refinance 
into home equity loans. While you must always be careful to check the terms and 
fees, those who swap wisely can often save hundreds of dollars. If you use the 
savings to pay down your debts faster, you reap a double benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fess up and negotiate. If your debts are more than you can possibly handle -- 
even after trimming the budget and refinancing some loans -- call your lenders 
immediately. Many of them will negotiate lower interest rates or more flexible 
payments for consumers who are sincerely trying to repay their debts. You may 
also want to contact a financial professional to help you get back on track.

YOUR MORTGAGE; HOW TO KEEP LOAN RATE LOCK-IN FROM EXPIRING BEFORE CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What should I do if my interest rate lock-in expires before closing? 
</P>
<P>
 With today's rising interest rates, most buyers choose to lock in an interest 
rate. A lock-in is a guarantee from a lender to give the borrower a loan at a 
certain interest rate as long as the loan closes by a specific date. 
</P>
<P>
 Lock-ins usually vary anywhere from 15 to 60 days. You have to pay for the 
privilege of a rate-lock. How much you pay will vary with the lender, the type 
of loan and the length of the lock. 
</P>
<P>
 Complications can arise when financial markets change during the course of a 
transaction. Let's say interest rates are stable when you make an offer to buy 
a house. You and the seller agree to a 90-day closing, which gives you plenty 
of time to get a loan, give your landlord notice and save a few more dollars 
before you join the ranks of homeowner. The 90 days also gives the sellers more 
time they may need. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks into the transaction, interest rates jump and threaten to move 
higher before closing. You talk to your mortgage broker, or lender, and decide 
that it's wise to lock in a rate. You pay for the longest rate-lock you can 
get, which is 60 days. If you can't close the purchase two weeks earlier than 
your contract date, you will lose a desirable interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as you discover that you need to close early, ask the sellers to amend 
the purchase contract to permit the early closing. Get the agreement in 
writing. Verbal agreements aren't binding when they involve real estate matters 
and memories often fade with time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers who can't change their moving plans might agree to close early if you 
allow them to rent back the property until the original contract closing date. 
This way you get your interest rate and the sellers aren't inconvenienced by an 
early move-out. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually sellers rent back at a cost that's equal to the buyers' cost of owning 
the home, called PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance). The buyers' 
PITI is usually calculated and paid on a per diem (per day) basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers may object to an early close and rent-back if the buyers' PITI is much 
larger than the sellers' cost of ownership. In this case, explain to the 
sellers that they'll have their cash equity out of their home, which will start 
earning interest for them. They'll also be relieved of their house payments, 
and they'll have the certainty of a closed sale. 
</P>
<P>
 If they still aren't eager to accommodate you, offer the rent-back at an 
amount that's less than your new cost of ownership. The lower interest you'll 
get by closing early will probably more than offset the amount you may be shy 
on the rent payment from the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Although most sellers will attempt to accommodate buyers who 
are in jeopardy of losing an interest rate, a seller doesn't have to agree to 
do so unless it's part of the purchase agreement. One way to ensure that the 
sellers will cooperate is to include a provision in the original purchase 
contract that requires them to close early, if necessary, in order for you to 
preserve an interest rate. Give the sellers the option to rent back at a cost 
equal to your PITI if they can't vacate before the contract closing date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: When rates are jumping, it's imperative that buyers do everything 
possible to get the necessary financial documentation to the lender as soon as 
possible so their loan can be approved quickly.

NEW KEYBOARDS TRY DIVIDING TO CONQUER TYPING INJURIES; ERGONOMICS: SALES OF THE 
MORE EXPENSIVE UNITS ARE SLOW AND THERE IS LITTLE MEDICAL DATA YET TO SHOW THAT 
THEY WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mounted on the edge of a desk, the prototype looks like a conventional 
computer keyboard on life support after surviving an ax attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Dividing the keyboard into halves attached to rods and hinges, the custom 
keyboard allows typists to rotate the two sides to position their hands 
vertically, as if holding a basketball, instead of using it in the flat, 
horizontal position demanded by a conventional keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many alternative designs that have been introduced as PC use has spread 
into homes and offices across the country, the adjustable keyboard being 
developed by Irvine-based Genovation Inc. is meant to reduce typing stress by 
allowing users to change their posture and hand position as they work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If repetition is the problem, variation is the solution," said Kevin Conway, 
a Santa Rosa physical therapist who holds three patents on the device. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway began work on it about three years ago after treating a stream of 
data-entry workers, newspaper reporters, cash-register clerks and other workers 
who complained of hand, wrist and arm pain after using a computer terminal all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 But are such typist-friendly devices ahead of the curve or ahead of their 
time? Even Conway agrees that the medical justification for such keyboards is 
spotty. Lawsuits will likely have as great an influence as government 
regulation in determining how soon these alternative keyboards are adopted as 
standard equipment by companies and home users. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a favorable response to its prototype at industry trade shows, 
Genovation executives are not sure whether they will put the design into 
production. At a retail price Genovation estimates at $500 to $600, Conway's 
keyboard would be pricier than a basic, $100 adjustable model built in 
conjunction with software giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Meshi, Genovation's executive vice president, said he also worries that 
aside from Microsoft's design, most of the other so-called ergonomic keyboards 
-- those designed to better fit users' hand and wrist movements -- aren't 
selling well. Most manufacturers of such keyboards are small start-up 
companies, which do not release data on their sales or profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hearing from the market, and the reason I'm a little bit negative 
about this, is that companies are buying small quantities of these keyboards 
and supplying them only for those people (employees) who insist on having 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Irvine-based company may stick to its core business of making 
related products like key pads for cash-registers and add-on key pads for 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when major PC makers begin to include adjustable keyboards as part of 
their original equipment will they catch on with users and companies, Meshi 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Today just a few PC manufacturers include the Microsoft keyboard, which 
divides the letter keys of a standard keyboard into two angled sections. And 
last year Apple Computer began offering a split keyboard of its own that sells 
for $115. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, neither Genovation nor any of the current manufacturers of ergonomic 
keyboards make medical claims of the usefulness of their devices for avoiding 
repetitive stress injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they say only that the various hand positions allowed by their 
products will permit more comfortable typing by encouraging better posture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The science is extremely complicated, and the number of variables involved 
are so numerous, it's very difficult to draw an exact cause-and-effect 
relationship between the computer keyboard and symptoms of physical problems," 
says Jeffrey Szmanda, president of the Health Care Keyboard Co. of Wauwatosa, 
Wisc. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recently obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to market its device to people already suffering from 
disabilities. It is only because it has such approval, Szmanda said, that his 
company dares to mention "cumulative-trauma disorders" in the manual that 
accompanies its $795 keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 If companies are reluctant to tout the medical effectiveness of their 
products, they are only following the uncertainty expressed by the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board last month when it voted 6-0 
against a measure that would have established the country's first comprehensive 
ergonomics program for office workers. 
</P>
<P>
 James Smith, a RAND Corp. economist and one of the board members who voted 
against the proposal, said some action is probably needed to deal with rising 
injury rates, but that there hasn't been enough study of the hardware that 
might be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future is that you have to deal with it. There's no question that there's 
going to be a growing workplace health problem," he said. But until he sees 
additional data on how much alternative keyboards would help, Smith said he 
can't vote to impose standards on companies. "It's really lowbrow science we're 
seeing at this point. "It's hard to distinguish science from advocacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he expects the board will continue to discuss standards in coming 
months. And the federal government may issue its own regulations or guidelines 
on ergonomic standards by the end of this year as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators like the state's health board have also been hesitant because 
government agencies have collected few statistics to measure rates of 
keyboard-caused injuries or of whether such injuries are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 89,875 cases of 
repetitive motion injuries that resulted in one or more lost work days in 1992, 
11,111 were associated with typing or repetitive key entry. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those workers, the injuries can be severe and career-destroying. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa resident Pam Allison, 28, suffered nerve damage and carpal tunnel 
syndrome after working as a secretary for 10 years for several companies. No 
longer able to type or write for long periods, or even open jars, she is now 
developing a home child-care business. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it first happened, I didn't know what to do. This was how I made my 
livelihood," she said. "Of course I thought it wouldn't happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by the rise of such cases, 1992 was the first year the Department of 
Labor broke down keyboard-injury statistics. That is also the only year it has 
tabulated the figures. Repetitive-motion disorders are reported far more 
frequently by blue-collar employees, such as those who work in meat-packing 
plants, knitting mills and auto factories, according to the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of more conclusive data or medical studies about injuries from 
keyboard use, the growth of product-liability lawsuits against computer 
manufacturers -- now numbering in the thousands -- have become the main measure 
of the seriousness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Compaq Computer Corp. won a lawsuit brought by a Houston 
secretary who claimed that her injuries left her unable to work. In another 
case, scheduled to go to trial the first week of January, a Hastings, Minn., 
school district employee is seeking damages for the injuries she claims were 
caused by using keyboards on IBM and Apple PCs for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff is represented by Levy, Phillips & Konigsberg, a New York firm 
that represents about 2,000 plaintiffs in various keyboard injury cases against 
manufacturers of PCs and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Goodman, a lawyer at the firm, said most of the plaintiffs are women, 
which mirrors the Labor Department statistics that show 10 times as many women 
as men are injured by keyboard use. The obvious difference, Goodman said, is 
that most of the secretarial and administrative support jobs that involve 
continuous typing are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're arguing that there's been enough scientific literature that at least 
should have put the defendants on notice that their keyboards were dangerous," 
Goodman said in an interview. "The defendants take the position that there's a 
lot of uncertainty . . . but they should at least have a duty to ask more 
questions than they did" of their equipment's safety, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple declined to comment on the case or to release sales figures for its 
split keyboard. But other equipment manufacturers say they are concerned about 
the added costs of including such keyboards with their products as competition 
increasingly focuses on costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to add costs to our machines that we don't see having an 
obvious benefit," said Joan Tharp, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co. "There 
isn't much customer demand for these things. If we had a clamoring for them, it 
might be different," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable enthusiasm for the keyboards comes from Microsoft itself, 
which says it has sold more than 100,000 of the $99 Microsoft Natural keyboard 
in two months and that its suppliers don't have the manufacturing capacity to 
keep up with demand. Such popularity surprises even Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keyboards get a low mind-share from customers," said Keith Kegley, a 
Microsoft product manager. "They approach it as something they don't want to 
think about, they simply get used to it and deal with it. In the end, their 
bigger interest is to use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft considered making a more complex, more adjustable keyboard, he said, 
but "the problem was that people felt as if they were looking at a contraption. 
Adjustability has to be subtle." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's success with its keyboard may break open a larger market for 
smaller companies, said Shirley Lunde, vice president for marketing of Kinesis 
Corp. in Bothell, Wash., which sells a $390 keyboard whose keys are mostly 
contained in two concave pods. 
</P>
<P>
 With larger distributors beginning to pay attention, she said, overall sales 
may rapidly increase. A privately held company with revenues of under $100 
million, Kinesis does not disclose exact sales or profit figures, Lunde said. 
</P>
<P>
 One point all sides can agree on is that even if the sales of alternative 
keyboards continue to grow, it is doubtful they alone would reduce injury 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Rempel, director of the University of California's ergonomics 
program in Richmond, said more studies are needed to conclude whether any 
particular design can prevent injury, or even to see how those injuries are 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can demonstrate that there's a health edge with a certain design, you 
would force every keyboard manufacturer to adopt your design. But that would 
have to be a very well-done, convincing study, and there are no such studies," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next question is: Given that there are no studies like that underway, 
what will change users' opinions about whether they need an input-device? I 
think they (users) will retreat to how well it works, whether it has any bells 
and whistles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's success probably has more to do with features that make it 
specialized for the company's popular Windows operating system than with it 
ergonomic effectiveness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rempel, who was a member of the committee that drafted the standard rejected 
by the state's safety board, said he was not surprised that it didn't pass. 
More studies are needed to show what particular type of keyboard and 
positioning can actually reduce injury rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just pose the question, 'What kinds of keyboards work?' you can get 
everybody and their brother inventing a design with no biomedical 
understanding" of what reduces injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For typists, the costs of the alternative designs are hard to balance against 
the fear of developing career-ending injuries. Marylou Remy, owner of 9 to 5 
Etc., a West Los Angeles secretarial service, said she had been concerned about 
her own heavy typing for years but couldn't afford an alternative keyboard 
until Microsoft's went on sale earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept putting off buying it. It's funny that even though you know it's 
better for you -- or you think you know it's better for you -- that the price 
is still a consideration. $500 is still $500," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After using the Microsoft keyboard for week, Remy returned it, saying the keys 
required too much pressure to type. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Trouble With Typing 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 90,000 cases of repetitive motion injuries serious enough to require 
one or more days off work occured at U.S. businesses and factories in 1992, the 
only year for which such information is available. One in eight of these 
injuries was caused by typing or key entering, and most of those injured typing 
were women. 
</P>
<P>
 All repetitive motion injuries:

HIGH-TECH COMPANIES MAKE TREK TO TOULOUSE; TECHNOLOGY: FRANCE'S FOURTH-LARGEST 
CITY, LONG DOMINATED BY AEROSPACE, IS SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING ELECTRONICS 
FIRMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The area around Toulouse, France's fourth-largest city in the southwest near 
the Pyrenees mountains, is turning into a new Silicon Valley with a growing 
number of high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its California model, Toulouse offers an attractive climate and lifestyle 
to researchers and executives. 
</P>
<P>
 It has qualified labor, good transport links and boasts a number of top-level 
research institutes. But it took a focused marketing effort to convince foreign 
companies to set up their European sites in and around Toulouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Toulouse industry has been dominated by aerospace. Ever since 
aviation pioneers like Antoine de Saint-Exupery used a Toulouse airstrip, the 
city has been the center of France's plane manufacturing industry. Airbus, 
Aerospatiale and ATR are the big names on an imposing roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 But electronics, chemistry and biomedical activities as well as space, 
computing and biotechnologies are now also booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to offer a one-stop service," said Ignacio Antona, project manager at 
Technopole Toulousaine, a body promoting the Toulouse area to foreign 
companies. "We can help with sites, financing and access to research 
institutes," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is that a foreign company, setting up business here, has the same 
access to research facilities as a local company," company chairman Didier 
Bernadet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to laboratories was one of the factors that helped Toulouse gain the 
150-million franc ($27.7-million) high-tech European plant and research center 
of Louisville, Colo.-based Storage Technology Corp. despite heavy competition 
by a Scottish site. 
</P>
<P>
 Storagetek makes data storage and retrieval systems, using a robot that 
quickly picks up data cartridges from a library and puts them in a computer 
data server. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Barcellini, managing director of the site, said he hoped to start 
production in April and would have 470 employees in 1998, of which 170 would be 
researchers. He was now busy hiring staff to start production with 160 people. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Chicago's Motorola Inc. semiconductor unit decided to invest 
another $139 million at Toulouse, where it has been based since 1967, partly in 
a new joint research laboratory with Toulouse institute LAAS and the CNRS 
national research center. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the research institutes in Toulouse that combine fundamental research 
with industrial applications is the CERFACS European Center for Research and 
Advanced Training in Scientific Computation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a white, spacious building adorned with in-house gardens, some 50 
researchers combine their brainpower with the powerful parallel processing 
computers to develop such things as a computer model to simulate wind-tunnel 
testing for aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
 This cuts time and costs compared with the current practice of building 
prototype parts and putting them in giant wind tunnel to test future behavior 
in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Closely linked to France Meteo, it also has a team working on improving 
weather forecasts. As a tribute to its international standing, it will host the 
1995 World Linear Algebra Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every high-tech start-up firm heads straight for success. ATG Cygnet is 
one such example. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1984 by Alcatel and Thomson-CSF to develop optical discs for 
information storage, the company went bankrupt in 1986. But it was bought up in 
early 1987. Thomson remained shareholder but Altus Finance, a unit of bank 
Credit Lyonnais, took a 49% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, Altus increased its stake to 70% and transferred ownership to 
another Credit Lyonnaise unit, Innolion. It also brought in a new chairman and 
chief executive by naming Bernard Meffre. His predecessor had bought the 
jukebox maker Cygnet in the U.S. for $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A large jukebox contains a robot arm which picks up optical discs from two or 
more large stacks and puts them in a reader. Now ATG Cygnet is, with Sony of 
Japan and LMS of the United States, joint market leader in the field of optical 
storage on 12-inch discs. 
</P>
<P>
 These so-called Write Once Read Many discs each permit the storage of the 
equivalent of 5,000 books of 500 pages in both text and images. 
</P>
<P>
 Large hospitals are using them for patient records while both the FBI in the 
United States and Scotland Yard in Britain have ordered systems for their files 
on, for instance, fingerprints.

<P>
 The long winter months are a perfect time to focus on the home, and here are 
some new products to help you along. 
</P>
<P>
 Maytag, maker of major home appliances, has developed a new "intelligent" 
dishwasher that decides how dirty the load is, how hot the water needs to be 
and how it can save energy and, therefore, money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maytag IntelliSense dishwasher is advertised as the first dishwasher 
(other than a human one) that can think. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newton, Iowa-based manufacturer said the dishwasher uses an advanced 
control system that monitors the load conditions and has sensors that see food 
particles in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the machine determines how long it needs to run. When the dishes are 
clean, it shuts off. 
</P>
<P>
 Maytag said it saves money on energy and water and keeps utility bills lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Priced at about $799, it will be available in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (800) 688-9900. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With the holidays ending, can spring -- and spring cleaning -- be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 The 3M Co. is introducing a product designed to make home improvement projects 
a little less daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 3M Wallpaper & Paste Remover has been developed to make the job easier for 
do-it-yourselfers. It is a quick-acting water-based gel that penetrates all 
wallpaper, including grass cloth and foil, for removal in 20 to 30 minutes. It 
also removes paper backing and paste residue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the gel has a mild scent to counter unpleasant odors from old 
paste. The remover does not emit harmful vapors, is not toxic and is 
non-flammable. Special ventilation is not required and gloves are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3M Wallpaper & Paste Remover is applied with a roller, brush or trigger 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be available early next year in a one-gallon size (approximate retail 
price $15.99), a half-gallon size ($9.99) and a 22-ounce trigger spray ($6.99). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the latest developments in home theater technology comes from Sony -- 
the CPJ-100 liquid crystal video projector. 
</P>
<P>
 The portable projector works with any video source, including camcorders, VCRs 
and television. It projects images of up to 100 inches diagonally. 
</P>
<P>
 The liquid crystal projector display uses a long-lasting halogen bulb for up 
to 400 hours of continuous use. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPJ-100 can be tilted to project at any angle, from traditional horizontal 
projection to overhead on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a suggested retail price of $1,100. 
</P>

 Sometimes tying or untying shoes is a Herculean task, especially for those 
with disabilities. A product from Faulkner International Inc., a Honolulu-based 
company, fastens shoelaces firmly without having to tie them in the traditional 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Gull Lace Fastener is made of back-to-back hinged buckles. To tighten 
the laces, pull the loops. To release, raise Sea Gull "wings" and the laces 
loosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner said the fastener will fit any laced shoe of any style. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastener sells for $2.99, plus $1 shipping and handling.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions this week affecting central Los 
Angeles. CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * ANIMAL POUND FEES -- Approved a new fee for claiming rabbits or poultry from 
city animal shelters. Previously, there was no charge. A $15 fee has been 
instituted because it was discovered some people were cooking the rabbits or 
poultry after claiming them, according to an Animal Regulations Department 
official. In other fee changes, $3 to $5 will be charged for use of traps used 
to catch such nuisance animals as skunks and raccoons. The traps previously 
were free. Also new is a $130 yearly permit fee for dog and cat grooming 
parlors. The cost of claiming a dog or cat will remain $5 and $3, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONTRACT AWARD -- Authorized the Community Development Department to award a 
$3-million Department of Labor contract to Community Build Inc., a nonprofit 
organization, for the Youth Fair Chance demonstration project. The pilot 
program aims to teach job skills and instill a sense of community pride in its 
participants, who must be between the ages of 17 and 30. The center, to be 
located at 8730 S. Vermont Ave., will focus its efforts on the area bounded by 
Florence Avenue on the north, 104th Street on the south, Vermont Avenue on the 
west and Central Avenue on the east. The project is to begin in early January 
and will focus on developing close ties to the community by forming an advisory 
council of residents and business and civic leaders. The project hopes to work 
with 600 people in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 * KWANZAA FESTIVAL -- Approved the following street closures from 6 p.m., Dec. 
30, to 6 p.m., Jan. 2 for the 18th annual Kwanzaa Gwaride Parade and Festival: 
43rd Place between Crenshaw Boulevard and Leimert Boulevard, Degnan Boulevard 
between 43rd Place and 43rd Street, and 43rd Street between Creed Avenue and 
Bronson Avenue. The festival at Leimert Park will include jazz, blues and 
reggae concerts, food booths, and arts and crafts displays. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * PARKING FEE STUDY -- Instructed the Transportation Department to 
study the economic impact of eliminating parking meters from Downtown streets 
or reducing meter rates in half. The motion, by Councilwoman Rita Walters, came 
in response to approval of a plan to lower meter rates on Westwood Boulevard 
from $1 an hour to 50 cents. Walters, whose 9th district includes much of 
Downtown, argued that, because the Westwood plan was approved on the grounds it 
would increase area business, the same rationale could be applied to Downtown. 
A Transportation Department official estimated that eliminating the Downtown 
meters would cost the city $5 million in revenue. The current rate for the 
meters is $2 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed 11-2. Voting yes: Mike Hernandez, Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr., Walters. Absent: Richard Alatorre. MICHAEL

THEY'LL BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS; HOUSING: VOLUNTEERS OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY 
ARE BUILDING HOUSES FOR TWO FAMILIES, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. 
</P>

<P>
 For years, Sally Wills knew that no Santa could grant her fondest wish: to own 
her own home. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, 300 volunteers made her Christmas wish come true. They built a 
house for her and her family in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting more and more exciting as I see them put it up," Wills, 26, said 
last week as she watched the Habitat for Humanity crew hammering together the 
frame of her three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important for us to know we have someplace to live all the time," 
said Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 She, her husband, Anthony, and their three children have been sharing a small 
apartment in Lynwood with relatives. In the nine years before that, they had to 
move many times. 
</P>
<P>
 For Travon, 9, the Willses' oldest child, the greatest thing about the new 
house was the promise of his own basketball hoop nailed to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I want most," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wills family moved into their new house on Christmas Eve. Moving into a 
four-bedroom house next door will be Oscar Salazar and his family. Both homes 
were being "blitz-built" in one week by Habitat for Humanity, the national 
ecumenical organization that builds homes and sells them for no profit to those 
who need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter works with the group and has become its most 
visible symbol. This summer, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, along with 2,000 
Habitat for Humanity volunteers, plan to build 31 homes in the 
Watts/Willowbrook area. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, individuals, churches or other organizations donate funds to cover 
the cost of materials, generally between $50,000 and $60,000. Each family must 
make a down payment of 1% and contribute 500 hours of "sweat equity," such as 
helping pave driveways or frame windows, toward their home or another Habitat 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage payments of about $300 per month are put in a revolving fund to 
help build other Habitat homes. Families who apply for the homes are chosen on 
the basis of need and ability to repay the no-interest loan. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Lynwood project, the city of Lynwood used federal affordable-housing 
money to buy the lots, and sold them to Habitat for $1 each. Key sponsors 
included the Rancho Los Cerritos Assn. of Realtors and the California Assn. of 
Insurance Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the building site on Louise Street was bustling and festive, with 
Santa Claus picking his way among planks and nails to pass out candy canes. A 
volunteer crew from the culinary program at Los Angeles Trade Technical College 
dished up free turkey dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed architects and contractors oversaw teams of volunteers, some of whom 
had never lifted a hammer before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, someone else does my hammering for me, so I don't know much about 
this," said a smiling Eliza Tam Hemans, 39, of San Gabriel, who on weekdays is 
a banker at United Savings Bank in Artesia. "But it's a good cause, helping 
someone become a homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Munson, 40, of Castaic, chief credit officer at JCB Bank N.A. in Los 
Angeles, is also a carpenter and fix-it man, so he brought expertise to his 
volunteer work. He said one of the things he liked best about the project was 
that it "wasn't a handout, but a hand up" for someone who would also work hard 
to become a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the American dream, to move into your very own house on 
Christmas Eve," said Lynwood Mayor Louis Byrd, who beamed as he watched 
bustling crews at work. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is just how Oscar Salazar felt as he watched the walls of his new 
home go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," said Salazar, 44, who immigrated from Guatemala as a 
teen-ager. "It is my realized dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, an unemployed warehouseman, has never owned his own home. He and his 
wife, their two daughters, son-in-law and two granddaughters will now be able 
to move out of their rented South-Central Los Angeles house, which has a 
slanted foundation, broken windows and leaky plumbing caused by the Northridge 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 With all the hard work going into the two houses, the construction site had 
more smiles on it than most typical building sites. Jack Davidson explained 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, who has supervised the building of the six prior homes by the Los 
Angeles chapter of Habitat, said there is a feel-good factor in this work that 
is lacking in the commercial building industry. He should know. For years, he 
was a building superintendent with Santa Monica-based Watt Industries, which 
builds residential and commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a professional job," he said, "you'd have the plumber fighting 
with the electrician, saying, 'He won't let me put my pipes there,' and you'd 
have the electrician fighting with the contractor," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in it for money. That's it. But here, all I hear is, 'What do you 
want me to do, Jack?' Everyone's happy because they know what the end result 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put these people in their own homes, that's the great thing," he 
said, shaking his head and smiling. "It's wonderful."

EXCLUSION FROM FUNDS STUNS LOCAL ACTIVISTS; EMPOWERMENT: OFFICIALS FROM SOCIAL

 The news from Washington left stunned neighborhood activists in Los Angeles 
using words like tragic, shocked and bitter.  
</P>
<P>
 This reaction followed the rejection last week of Los Angeles' application to 
become one of six urban zones designated to receive a special $100-million 
federal grant and tax breaks worth hundreds of millions of dollars. For many 
local activists, the rejection was unbelievable in light of the 1992 riots and 
the earthquake last January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm crying the blues, man," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio 
Planners Inc. in East Los Angeles, one of many community groups that pushed for 
a zone. "That's a real slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Many activists remained upset even after the Clinton Administration announced 
that a consolation package could provide about $350 million for economic 
development in Los Angeles. That secondary package does not include lucrative 
wage tax credits for businesses or the $100 million for social services that 
are part of the federal government's empowerment zone program. 
</P>
<P>
 C. David Henry, a consultant and former board member for the Dunbar Economic 
Development Corp. in South-Central, called the city's exclusion from the main 
empowerment zone program tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles was your prototype," he said. "I was boasting and bragging back 
in September that Los Angeles was going to get it. It is tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 A joint application by city and county officials called for a zone that would 
have included neighborhoods in South-Central, the Eastside and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal guidelines, the city would have been able to spend $100 million 
for programs ranging from child care to job training. In addition, business 
incentives would have included tax breaks of as much as 20% on the wages of 
workers living in the zone, and owners could have claimed purchased machinery 
as a tax loss immediately rather than having to wait several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was supposed to lure private employers to poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Whitney, co-owner of Genes Plating in East Los Angeles, said the 
federal tax incentives also would have helped businesses like his grow by 
allowing them to keep more profits. The chrome-plating business has about 150 
employees, and the majority live in the neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awfully darn tough to grow a business and then have 40% of your profit 
taken away through taxes," Whitney said. "We never count on anything like (a 
government break), but we had hoped (for one)." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney said less-lucrative local and state incentives remain available in the 
area, but nothing as significant as the federal zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities described the proposal from Los Angeles as too vague, 
instead selecting applications from New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Atlanta, 
Detroit and the Philadelphia-Camden, N.J., area. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who headed the city committee that oversaw drafting 
of the application, said the $350-million pledge by the Clinton Administration 
may turn out to be as good or better than empowerment zone status. More 
economic development could be generated quickly with the larger amount of 
upfront grant money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also pledged to ask Congress to extend the wage tax credits to Los 
Angeles, although congressional approval is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he was upset initially but now believes Los Angeles will be 
able to generate improvements as an empowerment zone runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of California was ignored. The consolation prize is tremendous," 
Hernandez said. "We got a good chunk of money." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a consolation prize was not immediately convincing to activists and 
residents who believed the empowerment zone would be the most significant 
economic development program in Los Angeles in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the second-largest city in the country, and you're going to give it 
a consolation prize? Give me a break," Villalobos said. "You had the biggest 
riot. I think everyone in L.A. should be angry. I'm kind of bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry said the federal tax incentive for businesses was a key part of the 
application. The Central City area, for example, is perfect for developing 
large industrial parks if a good enough deal is available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now how do you attract industries to this area?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists said poor communities, especially those neighborhoods with 
primarily Latino or black residents, were bound to feel slighted by Washington 
decision makers and by local officials who should have done a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed we didn't have that opportunity to make more of a difference 
in Los Angeles," said Gladys M. Lewis, executive director of the nonprofit 
Coalition of Neighborhood Developers. The 61 member organizations of the group 
focus on developing housing, jobs and improvements citywide. "We still will be 
working to make a difference in those neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry said the episode is another painful lesson for Los Angeles. Local 
officials, who were warned more than once that the application was too vague, 
should have immediately given federal officials all the details they wanted on 
how the money would be spent rather than taking a chance on blowing what nearly 
everyone thought was a done deal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not just a virtual slam dunk. Don't take it for granted," Henry said, 
admitting again, "I'm surprised, shocked and amazed. I really am."

A GIFT OF FRIENDSHIP; CHRISTMAS KINDNESS LETS HOMELESS MAN VISIT FAMILY HE 
HASN'T SEEN IN 11 YEARS 
</P>

 Last Christmas, Charles Oliver Jr. huddled on a Downtown sidewalk with his 
buddies and divvied up the booty of ham, imported liquor and clothes he 
received from the office workers who appreciate the cheery "good morning" he 
greets them with each day when they park their cars in the lot where he sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 This Christmas is different. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 11 years, Oliver got an opportunity to return home and 
be surrounded by his parents, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews in East 
Chicago, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to hug and kiss every one of them and I hope they will want to 
hug and kiss me too," Oliver, 41, said a few days before he boarded the plane 
back to his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 His Kris Kringles this year were Yvette Kalachian, 28, and her aunt and uncle, 
Lana and Irv Paley. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver met Lana Paley about two years ago when she started working at her 
husband's Hill Street jewelry store and began parking across the street, in 
Oliver's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he welcomed her -- "Good morning. Do you have any spare 
change?" -- she ignored him and he cursed her out.  
</P>
<P>
 "He used to dance in the middle of the street. I was scared of him," she said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to stay warm somehow," Oliver responded, and they both broke into 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, a few days later, Lana gave him some change. They exchanged a 
few jokes and became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver began walking Paley from the parking lot to her building each morning 
and guarding her each night as she made her way back to her car. As Oliver did 
for many of his friends who park in the lot, he was the first to give her a 
card on the holidays and remembered her birthday with small gifts from nearby 
Thrifty or J. J. Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 He manages to pay for these tokens with savings from the $50 to $75 he makes 
each week panhandling and doing odd jobs for the local shops, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When Kalachian began working at the jewelry store in July, she was eager to 
meet this Charles that her aunt had been raving about. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Kalachian and Oliver, who share a common spiritual devotion, were 
singing, "I shall not be moved like a tree planted by the water," and other 
spirituals during their evening walks to her car. 
</P>
<P>
 One night in September, Kalachian noticed that the usually effervescent 
Charles had been crying. He was thinking about his family, which he had not 
seen for 11 years, Kalachian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going home," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver did not believe her but played along. "During Christmas would be nice," 
he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalachian, described by her aunt as "Mother Teresa in disguise," went to work. 
She called the Antioch Baptist Church, where Oliver had been an altar boy, and 
found out that his family was still living in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister informed her that a Roseanne Oliver in the congregation often 
prayed for her missing brother, Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver said although his older sister and his baby brother might have 
suspected he was homeless, his parents and five other siblings were unaware 
that he had spent the last decade living on and off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kalachian told her aunt and uncle about the idea, Irv Paley immediately 
volunteered his frequent-flyer miles to cover the trip. Yvette bought a 
suitcase and began packing it with all he would need -- clothes, a Bible with 
his name embossed in gold, and gifts for his nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles is very special. He can be sick with a fever, and he will tell me to 
go home and take care of myself. He deserves this," Kalachian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver had tried to save money to go home in the past but could never scrape 
enough together. When he realized what Kalachian and the Paleys had done for 
him, he was dumbfounded with gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are God's children. I don't know where they came from in my life," he 
said, and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kalachian and the Paleys contacted the Biltmore Hotel to make 
arrangements for Oliver to stay the night so he could get cleaned up before his 
trip, the hotel put Oliver up for free after they heard his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would look his best, Oliver was still worried about the reception 
his family might give him. With the exception of a few scattered phone calls, 
he had not had any contact with them since he left home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is not the only thing that can be cold in Indiana," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver admitted that he still carried a slight grudge against his family for 
not helping him as much as he would have liked when he lost his foundry job in 
East Chicago. But he said he thinks he can forgive them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to Oliver, who believed he would be surprising his folks, Kalachian 
called ahead to let his family know that he would be coming home the Wednesday 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver's sisters said they would meet him at the airport in rented limousines 
and throw a party for him when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver's father said the whole family would be glad to see him and that he was 
more than welcome to stay at any of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing against my son. He knows where to come home to. He knows the 
address," Charles Oliver Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver's father offered to pay for him to come home once, in 1990, but Oliver 
said he couldn't leave a sick friend he was caring for. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver is scheduled to return to Los Angeles Jan. 9. He wouldn't leave Los 
Angeles without a round-trip ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all right for me to go and visit," he said, "but it's too cold back 
there for me to stay."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; GROUP GEARS UP FOR LOUISIANA FESTIVAL

 It may be Christmas, but the Louisiana to Los Angeles (LALA) Organizing 
Committee is already looking ahead to February and another winter season of bon 
temps -- good times. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mardi Gras in mind, the committee kicked off a campaign last week at 
Fifth Street Dick's to promote the annual Louisiana culture festival to be held 
Feb. 18 and 19 in Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Parading down 43rd Place, blowing police whistles and waving fur-trimmed 
parasols, about 50 committee members and curious onlookers got a taste of 
things to come as they joined together in a spirited "second line," the 
unofficial party dance of old New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do a series of events this year leading up to the festival," 
committee member Fred Thomas explained.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said second-line troupes and accompanying bands plan to travel the 
Southland to raise awareness about the upcoming festival, now in its seventh 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 Between the live Dixieland jazz music and dancing, the committee unveiled the 
official graphic by local artist Avery Clayton that will advertise the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, best known for his ink renderings of black historical figures, said 
he merged Los Angeles and Louisiana for the project, done in watercolor: A jazz 
band marches down a street past a New Orleans-style frame house, palm trees 
jutting overhead and the Hollywood Hills -- decorated with a "Baldwin Hills" 
sign -- in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 A banner held aloft by marchers proclaims "Laissez le Bontemps Roulez" ("Let 
the Good Times Roll"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to combine the best elements of both places," said Clayton, 
who was commissioned to do murals for the 1984 Summer Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the next LALA festival will be one of firsts: the first to span 
two days instead of one and the first to feature a "walk of fame" that pays 
tribute to the many community people who helped found the festival and keep it 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 That group includes former city councilman and transplanted Louisianian Bob 
Farrell, second-liner extraordinaire Benji de Lille and Aquille Jase, owner of 
Sid's Louisiana Cafe on Exposition Boulevard, who died recently. It was at 
Sid's that the idea for LALA was born. ERIN J. AUBRY

 Bondage Busters, the homeless services organization that not long ago was 
flying high with spacious new quarters and ambitious programs, finds itself 
homeless this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondage Busters founder and director Charles Hudson had been hoping to work 
out an arrangement with property owner Robert Wilson since the organization 
shut down four months ago, but a change in tenants is most likely to happen 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said he was forced to close up shop because he couldn't make mortgage 
payments on the property at 4433 Crenshaw Blvd. Hudson had entered into an 
agreement with Wilson to take over payments on a $300,000 mortgage, but Hudson 
said sluggish funding led to a speedy demise for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no money now," said Hudson, a nondenominational pastor. "We were 
acting on good faith that this would work out. . . . It's been a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called the financial failure of Bondage Busters "unfortunate."  
</P>
<P>
 "It became obvious that a nonprofit organization like this one wouldn't work," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, Bondage Busters moved into its new home with high hopes 
and a financial boost from Wilson, who admired the cause and donated $25,000 
toward rehabilitating the two-story building and its six apartments. But after 
that initial help -- the building needed $75,000 in improvements -- Hudson said 
donations were scarce and he could only secure $4,500 in private grant money to 
cover operating expenses and the renovation. Telephone bills alone ran nearly 
$2,200 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson's trouble began not long after Bondage Busters moved into the building, 
the former site of a secretarial school. Wilson signed the deed over to Hudson 
with an agreement that Bondage Busters would become financially solvent and 
begin mortgage payments in nine months. That didn't happen, Wilson said, and 
though he extended the deadline for payments several times, Bondage Busters was 
never able to make one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a hard blow for the 47-year-old Hudson, an energetic man who started 
Bondage Busters seven years ago. Last year he was running his agency out of a 
small back office in the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 His vision was always the same: providing the basic needs of food, shelter, 
and job referral and training to the homeless. Hudson had a van to pick up and 
help individuals who called the Bondage Busters hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 The new quarters enabled Hudson to initiate several new components he had 
planned for a long time, including computer classes, retail checking classes, 
youth art workshops and gang intervention services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson remains optimistic about resuming operations. From his home in the San 
Fernando Valley, he still helps those in need by phone and with a car 
temporarily standing in for his van. 
</P>
<P>
 "The needs out there don't stop," he said. "You can't just stop working 
because you don't have a place." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Botanica owner Carmen Mujica doesn't believe the warnings about rattlesnake 
capsules, even if county officials say they caused three deaths in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken rattlesnake capsules my entire life and I'm strong and healthy," 
said Mujica, who last week heard on a Spanish-language radio station the 
warnings that the capsules can cause illness and death. "What else are poor 
people going to cure themselves with?" 
</P>
<P>
 Five Los Angeles County residents were hospitalized in recent months with a 
bacterial infection caused by a strain of salmonella commonly found in 
reptiles, according to county health officials. Three of the patients died. 
Cause of death: powdered rattlesnake meat consumed in capsule form. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the warning issued last week by the County Department of Health 
Services carries no legal weight, officials expressed concern over the 
popularity of the capsules, a Latino folk remedy touted to combat a variety of 
chronic medical problems including acne, cancer, arthritis, blood disorders and 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles County, this is the kind of medicine people turn to when 
modern medicine fails," said Dr. Roshan Reporter, a county epidemiologist who 
helped identify the rattlesnake capsules as the source of the three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Health Services has no plans to prohibit sale of 
the capsules because their manufacturers make no specific health claims. The 
capsules are considered a food, since they are nothing more than dried 
rattlesnake meat, said Frank Nava, the chief of field operations for the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make people aware that the rattlesnake should be cooked 
properly, since it's the cooking process that kills potentially harmful 
bacteria," Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the warning issued by the county, Mujica said she will continue to 
sell the capsules, known in Spanish as polvo de vibora , carne de vibora and 
vibora de cascabel . 
</P>
<P>
 Mujica is not alone in her continued faith in the healing power of dried, 
ground rattlesnake meat. Along Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park, half of 
the six botanicas sell rattlesnake products. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled between posters in Hindi advertising the afterlife and dozens of 
herbal remedies imported from Latin America, customers at one shop can purchase 
a packet of 50 rattlesnake capsules for as little as $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "The capsules are part of our culture, they're the way people survived when 
there wasn't anything else," said a botanica clerk who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it (dried rattlesnake) is good enough for the poor in Mexico, it's good 
enough for us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Produced in Mexico and shipped across the border as a general health 
supplement, the rattlesnake capsules have caused dozens of county residents to 
get sick in recent years. According to county health officials, an average of 
15 people fell ill each year since 1984 from the particular type of salmonella 
found in rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly called Salmonella Arizona or Salmonella Subgroup Three, the bacterial 
infection can cause fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain and sometimes vomiting. 
Salmonella bacteria can also infect the bloodstream, resulting in potentially 
fatal illness. 
</P>
<P>
 People with decreased resistance to infections because of other illnesses are 
especially prone to bloodstream infections. The three individuals who died 
after taking the capsules were cancer patients who were more susceptible to 
falling terminally ill from the capsules, Reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 From behind the counter of her Botanica San Jose, Mujica remains unfazed by 
the hullabaloo surrounding the capsules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking a bad capsule is just like eating a bad hamburger; you take your 
chances and hope for the best. And if you don't have much money, sometimes it's 
all you can afford," she said, standing near a rack containing brightly colored 
packages of shark cartilage, cat's nail and powdered rattlesnake. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; BOXING CLUB DODGES A KNOCKOUT PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Park's amateur boxing program -- ever tenuous and poorly funded but 
very popular among city youths -- survived a tough round at last week's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the surprise resignation at the Monday meeting of club manager Josie 
Arrey and persuasive testimony by the boxing club's board of directors, the 
City Council decided not to cancel its $3,000-per month funding of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed the council that we could run the club efficiently, like a 
business," said board chairman Rudy Griego. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of axing the program as city staff recommended, the council also chose 
to review the club's finances month-to-month to determine if it is aggressively 
courting its own funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The program receives all of its funding from the city through a $2.1-million 
federal Community Development Block Grant. The grant, given to the city last 
year by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, allows the city to 
spend up to 15% of the money on such social programs as day care for children 
of working parents and after-school programs such as the boxing club. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Jack Wong said spending on such services has 
reached 14.9% of the grant. "We're right on the border so we have to watch very 
carefully how much we spend. Some cities spend zero percent on social 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, spending for the club, which has two part-time employees, was 
halved from $70,000 to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an August inspection of the club, the council decided to withdraw 
funding if the club did not raise funds more efficiently and draw more city 
residents as members. The inspection found that 16 of the club's 31 members 
lived outside the city. Since June, the club has required monthly fees of $10 
for non-residents and $6 for each additional family member. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that the federal grant stipulates that the majority of the club 
members must live in the city. Now, 18 of the club's 25 members are city 
residents, Arrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're planning on getting even more kids involved by offering aerobics and 
other types of martial arts classes," Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board this month changed the name of the club to the Greater Huntington 
Park Youth and Community Services Program in an effort to broaden the club's 
appeal. To boost membership, the board is also considering offering citizenship 
and English as a second language classes at the club, Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club also is seeking donations from area businesses. Next month board 
members plan to solicit via mail an annual donation of $146 or more from 
businesses in Huntington Park, South Gate, Bell and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that for as little as 40 cents per day -- less than the price of 
a cup of coffee -- businesses can support a program that keeps kids away from 
trouble after school," said Griego. The board also has planned a Jan. 26 
benefit dinner for the boxing program at Diana's Restaurant in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1987 by the Police Department, the club quickly gained a reputation 
as a prime training spot for amateur champs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, it produced two national Golden Gloves champions -- Salvador 
Casillas, 18, in the flyweight division, and Jose Hernandez, 14, in the 
middleweight division. Both are Huntington Park residents.

 Arrey, 43, who has been with the club since its inception seven years ago, 
cited the combined difficulty of coaching budding boxers and frantically 
searching for funds as one of the main reasons for her resignation, which is 
effective Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the city took money away from the club last year, that was wrong," said 
Arrey, who plans to continue working with young boxers in a separate Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department program. "It's hard to juggle worrying 
about money and the kids' safety at the same time." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; HOMELESS SHELTER FOR FAMILIES REOPENS 
</P>

<P>
 Araceli Tavares, 19, and her 17-month-old daughter had been looking for a 
place to live for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 They found it Tuesday at the Dolores Mission's Casa Miguel Pro homeless 
shelter, becoming the newest tenants since the shelter closed four months ago 
for asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Tavares hopes to find day care for her child so she can enroll in school 
to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, named after Miguel Augustin Pro, a Mexican priest who helped the 
poor in the 1920s before he was killed by the Mexican army, has assisted 
families like Tavares' since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the Dolores Mission School, its rooms hold twin beds and a closet. 
Bathrooms and showers are down the hall, and a large kitchen holds an antique 
stove where families can take turns cooking dinner for other occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, which can accommodate up to 26 people, was reopened with the help 
of a $5,000 Nancy Chandler Memorial Award grant from Lucky Stores and the Food 
for All Program, a nonprofit organization that uses donations from grocery 
store customers to fight hunger in low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who helped paint the cupboards and walls, clean the floors and 
wash the windows were on hand for the reopening celebration Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of work here," said volunteer Rosa Ramos, who lives in the Aliso 
Village housing project and is a member of the church's Comite Pro Paz, which 
works with gang members to bring peace to the neighborhood. "We'll do different 
things because it's all for the same community." 
</P>
<P>
 "The same people who (worked on the shelter) do other things in the 
community," said Teresa Zarate, a church employee who runs the shelter with 
co-worker Javier Perez. "The goal is to support them." 
</P>
<P>
 Need for the shelter has grown over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 gave amnesty to 
people who had been in the United States illegally, many families in the 
Pico-Aliso neighborhood were besieged by relatives for a place to stay. But 
because many of them live in the housing projects, where more than one family 
are prohibited from staying in each apartment, they needed the shelter, Zarate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the Dolores Mission declared itself a sanctuary for Central American 
immigrants fleeing wars in their countries. In addition, the church began 
opening its doors to homeless men, who rest on pews and are fed each night by 
members of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not an easy decision," said Georgianna McBurney, chairwoman of the 
Food for All advisory board. "The courage it took was there and the faith it 
took was there." The church now houses 90 to 100 men each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Families, who are referred to the Casa Miguel Pro shelter across the street 
from the church by other social service agencies or who simply show up at its 
doors, stay for an average of four months while they look for jobs and find 
permanent housing, Zarate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place will provide food and shelter, but more than anything else, hope," 
said Grover L. McKean, chairman of the board of Proyecto Pastoral. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope and shelter is what Rebecca Garcia received when she stayed at the 
shelter before it closed in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As her two boys ran around, carrying balloons, Garcia took in the third-floor 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears came to her eyes as she remembered what her family of four had gone 
through, being returned to Mexico by the Border Patrol three times and having 
to raise $850 to pay smugglers. The family finally crossed the border four 
months after they set out from Nicaragua and eventually ended up at the Dolores 
Mission shelter. They stayed six months, receiving food, shelter and 
information on government-subsidized housing, before leaving when the shelter 
was closed for the asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget this place because they helped me so much," said Garcia, 
whose family now lives in a house in Hacienda Heights. MARY ANN PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: HIGHLAND PARK; RESIDENTS QUESTION BLUE LINE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents whose homes are threatened by the proposed Blue Line construction 
through Highland Park and Lincoln Heights plan to send a letter to the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority board this week asking it to reopen the 
approval process, claiming the plans were made without sufficient community 
input. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Highland Park Neighborhood Assn., the Lincoln Heights 
Preservation Assn. and neighborhood groups from Glassell Park, Cypress Park and 
Elysian Valley have been meeting the last two months to try to find out more 
about the MTA's plans for the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena extension of the Blue Line, a project estimated to cost $900 
million, will follow the old Santa Fe Railroad line out of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, many of whom will have to move or sell off portions of their 
property to make way for construction, say they were not given enough notice 
about the approval process and did not know they would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has conducted public hearings and completed environmental impact 
reports on the project since 1990, with outreach in Korean, Chinese and 
Spanish, said Enrique Valenzuela, MTA construction spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela and two other MTA employees went door-to-door through the 
neighborhoods in the Marmion Corridor before those hearings were conducted to 
alert residents to the proposal to build the 13.6-mile extension from Union 
Station, through Chinatown, Mount Washington, Highland Park and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our information to them was basically to let them know this was coming down 
the pipe," Valenzuela said. "We gave them information on who to talk to and a 
number to call when they didn't understand a paper they received." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has begun on a bridge over the Los Angeles River near Elysian 
Park, but Valenzuela did not know when the affected properties will be bought 
out. The MTA estimates the entire construction project, including 14 stations 
along the way, will be complete by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 170 properties, including homes and businesses along the route, 
will be partially or fully acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents say the project will reduce the affordable housing stock in the 
area, and they also question the safety of the route because several elementary 
schools are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 people attended a community meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most feel that the most that's wrong is they were not informed," said 
resident Don Newton, whose property in Glassell Park will not be affected. 
"There was no translation into Chinese, Korean, Tagalog or Vietnamese, and the 
Spanish was spotty." 
</P>
<P>
 Newton said many who attended the November meeting said they believed the Blue 
Line, a high-speed train, would travel at the same low speeds as the old Santa 
Fe Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in the community are feeling that MTA's pulling a fast one on 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents plan to hold another community meeting next month in their 
effort to get the MTA to reopen the public hearings. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 The Milagros AIDS Project and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation's Latino AIDS 
Project will collaborate to serve East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Milagros will provide space at its South Goodrich Boulevard offices for Latino 
AIDS Project staff members.Milagros caseworkers will coordinate the services 
with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said Program Director Henry Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 Milagros has focused on social services while the AIDS Healthcare Foundation 
concentrates on medical needs for people with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration will reduce cost and aggravation to patients, said AIDS 
Healthcare President Michael Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients "have to maneuver through two different agencies, two different 
systems," Weinstein said. AIDS Healthcare operates four outpatient HIV clinics 
at medical centers throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Milagros AIDS Project was established in 1988 and provides case 
management, counseling, food and transportation to more than a thousand 
Eastside residents.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; SHATTO PARK HOLIDAY PARTY DRAWS 600 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Driving along the Santa Monica (10) Freeway three years ago, hairdresser Grace 
Munoz looked around at the blighted pockets of the Mid-City area and had a 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, three weeks before Christmas," she recalled. "I just thought, 
'Wouldn't it be great to put together a big party for homeless people and needy 
families?' I thought it would be a great idea, with music and everything, just 
to give them some love." 
</P>
<P>
 When Munoz arrived at her relatives' house and excitedly related her idea, 
they thought she had lost her mind.  
</P>
<P>
 But last Sunday marked the third annual realization of Munoz's dream, as more 
than 600 children and adults flocked to the Shatto Recreation Center in 
Koreatown to receive free Christmas meals, food bags, clothes and toys, and to 
hear live music at what has come to be known as the "Shatto Park Christmas 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Needy parents lined up with their children around the park's sandy playground 
to receive toys from a volunteer Santa; others stood around tables, laden with 
food trays, munching on turkey dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers were busy handing out plates, assisting people as they rummaged 
through piles of donated clothing and distributing bags filled with fruit and 
non-perishables. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great, because right now we have neither money nor work," said Maria 
Rosales of Westlake, holding her two small sons' place in the toy line while 
the boys played in the sand with other children.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Rosales and her husband are unemployed, and receiving a toy was going to 
give her sons at least a little taste of Christmas, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Munoz has been assisted in sponsoring the event by 
People in Progress, an alcohol-and-drug intervention and recovery center based 
in the Westlake area. The organization provided security and several volunteers 
as well as some of the food and clothing, while Munoz procured the rest of the 
food from local restaurants and clothing from private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vincent Medical Center donated cookies for dessert, and most of the 700 
toys donated came from the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads were placed in local newspapers, but the event was publicized mostly 
through the 2,000 flyers distributed in the community by Munoz and her 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I've really gotten to know this neighborhood, by passing out 
flyers," said Munoz, who lives in Century City and works in Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't spend a lot of time in this area, but I think there is tremendous 
need here, and there are many homeless people." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Shatto Park Christmas Party was put together in the three weeks 
following Munoz's vision on the freeway, with the assistance of several 
friends. Each year since, with support from local charities and nonprofit 
groups, a steadily increasing number of people have found their way to the 
park, many of them finding out about the event by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Jones came all the way from South-Central after hearing about the 
Christmas party through a friend in church. As she stood in line with her two 
daughters, she and the girls joked about what they wanted for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know what I want, but my first choice is I wish I could get a 
car," giggled 9-year-old Mika, as 2-year-old Shawntae looked ahead toward the 
toy table with wide-eyed anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, are you getting it for me?" Jones, said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was glad the girls could get a little more than her limited income will 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a few things," she said, "but a little extra will help." LESLIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; APARTMENT CLEANED OUT BY 4 BURGLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the 12 years they have lived in the United States, Rosa Arrazabal and her 
husband, Oscar Valencia, have worked hard, trying to ensure a good life and 
provide for their two sons. Counting their pennies, the Salvadoran couple 
furnished the single apartment on Union Place with simple luxuries -- a 
television and VCR, a Nintendo game set for the kids, a little jewelry and 
other tokens of the American dream taken for granted by many. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Arrazabal rode the bus as usual from her housecleaning job, 
arriving home around 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When she got there, she found her mother and her youngest son, 10-year-old 
Jonathan, standing in an all-but-empty apartment. All were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything the couple had worked for, save for a sofa, their beds and a second 
older television set that was damaged in an apparently unsuccessful attempt to 
remove it, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrazabal's mother, Tere Canas, who had walked Jonathan home from school and 
was planning to baby-sit the youngster until his parents came home from work, 
had found the front door forced open. After talking to a few neighbors, she and 
her daughter discovered that four men posing as movers had cleaned the family 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve years, all gone in a moment," Arrazabal sobbed in Spanish. "You ask 
yourself, 'How? Why?' It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the family's electronics were taken, as well as all the records, 
cassettes, videos, compact discs and games the family owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Their closets were ransacked, and the family's newer and better clothing and 
shoes were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 They also lost a typewriter, several glass and porcelain curios that Arrazabal 
had been collecting for years, as well as the couple's jewelry, including her 
high school ring from El Salvador and a watch her mother had given her for her 
15th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the kitchen utensils were stolen; the beds left behind were stripped of 
their linens and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who lived in the building had approached the men, who were described 
as male Latinos, to ask what they were doing. But the thieves dismissed the 
curious neighbor, claiming they were moving the family to a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's possessions were packed into a gray van, and the men drove off. 
It was not until the family arrived home that the neighbors realized no one was 
moving anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived here for 10 years, and nothing like this has ever happened," 
Arrazabal said. "Now I'm scared. I don't even like to be in the house alone 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrazabal and Valencia, who works in a manufacturing plant, had hoped to buy 
Christmas presents for Jonathan and 13-year-old Victor, but now they must 
combine their scant savings to try to replace a few of the necessities they 
lost. They have no insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The boys are old enough now," Arrazabal said sadly. "They understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the theft may contact the LAPD's Rampart Division 
at (213) 485-4073. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; SLUMLORD'S BUILDING WILL BE HIS OWN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A slumlord was sentenced Thursday to spend 60 days in his cockroach-infested 
Koreatown apartment building for ignoring a court order to clean up the place.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph G. Tabello, 62, was to begin serving his sentence Friday in Unit 408 of 
his six-story, 103-room apartment house at 840 S. Hobart Blvd., said City 
Attorney Jim Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronically monitored house arrest was ordered by Los Angeles Municipal 
Court Judge Gregory Alarcon following a hearing at which Deputy City Attorney 
Michael R. Wilkinson presented evidence showing serious housing code violations 
at the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Housing Task Force inspections revealed that the building had broken fire 
doors that didn't close, tangled fire hoses, 10 missing fire extinguishers, 
deficient electrical wiring, broken walls and leaky plumbing, and was infested 
with cockroaches, Hahn said.  
</P>
<P>
 In September, Tabello was ordered to repair the violations by Nov. 1, and 
Municipal Court Commissioner Kristi Lousteau placed him on three years' 
probation.  
</P>
<P>
 A condition of that probation was to clean up the place, and Lousteau ordered 
Tabello to pay $15,136 in fines and serve 50 hours of community service, Hahn 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; FOOD NETWORK OFFERS TOYS, JOB REFERRALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children's hungry eyes peeped through a door, waiting anxiously for some 
Christmas relief. But it wasn't food the 400 children were hoping for at the 
South-Central food and clothing distribution center. It was toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Genesis Food Distribution Foundation passed out nearly 500 toys to about 
150 low-income families from its offices at Broadway and 94th Street last week. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how to distribute food. We ought to know how to give away toys," said 
Tracy Spratt, executive director of the nonprofit organization, which works 
with more than 140 nonprofit food and clothing relief groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by the Brotherhood Crusade, the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference and First African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Genesis network 
was created in response to the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The network serves about 25,000 families a week in South-Central Los Angeles, 
providing food, clothing and referral services to job banks and free health 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 As the network grows, so does the number of needy people, staff members say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need food not only when there are disasters," said Faye Newman, assistant 
director of Genesis. "We need food weekly. There are daily disasters going on 
in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The network obtains its food through partnerships with mom-and-pop grocery 
stores and from buying in bulk from wholesale food outlets at the lowest 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Genesis, which has 10 full-time staff members and seven to 20 volunteers, is 
funded by a $50,000 yearly federal grant. The Brotherhood Crusade provides a 
salary for Spratt, and the other nine staff people are paid by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the toys, which were donated by the Los Angeles Fire Department, clothing 
and some food are donated from agencies connected to the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Three to four tons of food, transported in donated trucks, are stored at the 
agency's warehouse, where it is sorted and prepared for distribution to 
affiliate groups.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of Genesis, we are serving 108 families every Saturday," said the 
Rev. Thomas King of New Vision of Life Baptist Church on South Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 On the average, most church organizations serve 100 to 150 people a week, with 
some groups providing food for up to 700 hungry people, Newman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for Genesis, there would have been a lot of people who would 
have been left without a Thanksgiving dinner," said Pastor R.A. McKinley of the 
New Pilgrim Baptist Church, 8225 S. Main St. With donations mostly from 
Genesis, New Pilgrim provided dinners to 125 families for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 When a new organization joins the network, Genesis staffers teach members 
about free resources that are available -- such as health clinics and drug 
counseling centers -- so that they can help their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Genesis is trying to empower people who need resources," said Spratt, who was 
an administrator at the New Life Outreach Center in Inglewood until she took 
over at Genesis in June. "I want people in this community to be 
self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by that philosophy, Genesis has begun acting as a job referral service, 
using its chain of organizations to find jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 people from the New Pilgrim ministry have found employment through 
Genesis, McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Genesis has done to link social service agencies is something network 
members say has been needed for a long time -- even more so after the riots and 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had more agencies like Genesis," McKinley said, "Los Angeles would be a 
much better place."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH LOS ANGELES; 7 PASTORS TO SPEAK ON KWANZAA 
PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pastors from seven churches representing five denominations will each give 
sermons Wednesday about one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular celebration of Kwanzaa is geared to the religious community," 
said the Rev. M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither, senior pastor of Faith United 
Methodist Church, which will hold events on three of the seven days of 
Kwanzaa.Families are encouraged to observe the remainder of the holiday at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa, which means "first fruit of the harvest" in Swahili, was created in 
1966 by Cal State L.A. professor Maulana (Ron) Karenga as an Afrocentric 
alternative to the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith United, 1713 W. 108th St., will begin its celebration with a poetry 
recital Monday. Tuesday will feature music, dance, a candle-light ceremony and 
food. All events are free and begin at 7 p.m. African attire is encouraged at 
all celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third day, the preachers will speak about unity, self-determination, 
responsibility, family, purpose, creativity and faith -- the principles of 
Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles are so universal that they cross all lines that divide," 
Robinson-Gaither said. "This model of Kwanzaa is shaped to reflect our 
Christian experience and to make it acceptable to the African American church."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; HOSPITAL BRINGS SPIRIT OF SANTA CLAUS TO 
LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The doctors, nurses and staff at California Hospital Medical Center pulled on 
their black boots and jumped into their baggy red suits to bring some holiday 
cheer to 400 inner-city children last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The private nonprofit hospital, which serves Downtown, South-Central and Pico 
Union, launched its second annual Operation Santa Claus a few days before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 They encouraged their young patients and their patients' children to write 
letters to Santa Claus to say what they want under the tree this year.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 children dropped their letters into collection boxes in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff gathered the letters and tried to fulfill the wish lists by 
purchasing the gifts with money from their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure that these kids felt special," said Shannon 
Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Remote control cars, Power Rangers and Barbie dolls topped the list of 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 For the little girl who asked for a pony, hospital staff consulted her parents 
and decided that a rocking horse would be best. 
</P>
<P>
 Some staff members spent upward of $100 for bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were both surprised and touched by what we read in the children's 
letters," said nurse Melinda Beswick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most asked for toys but some children merely wrote to wish Santa a Merry 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The presents were distributed to the children by old Saint Nick himself at a 
holiday party hosted by the hospital Thursday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; SLUMPING SALES NO JOY FOR TOY TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toy Town merchants said this has been their worst holiday season ever, with 
toy sale revenue down more than 20% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy sellers blamed the downturn on a variety of factors, including 
restrictions on their trade with Mexico, Proposition 187 and the troubled 
California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighborhood better known for its missions and homeless encampments, more 
than 400 wholesalers and importers of inexpensive toys from Asia sprung out of 
nowhere in the late 1980s. At its peak, Toy Town reported annual sales at $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Used to boom times, merchants in the sprawling toy market, bounded roughly by 
3rd, San Pedro, 6th and Los Angeles streets, endured their slowest season yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wu, who has operated IMC Toys on 4th Street for nine years, said his 
wholesale revenues were down 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my worst Christmas ever," Wu said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wu relies on exports of his China-made toys to Mexico for almost half of his 
wholesale revenue. After Mexico imposed a high duty on Chinese products earlier 
this year he lost up to $4 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month the Mexican government relaxed the tariff for non-competing 
Chinese products. But Wu hasn't gotten much relief because many of his toys are 
still deemed competitive with Mexican goods. 
</P>
<P>
 While many Toy Town customers run small businesses in L.A.'s ethnic 
neighborhoods or sell their toys from booths at Southern California swap meets, 
exports to Mexico and South America account for 30% to 50% of the district's 
wholesale business, said Charles Woo, owner of Megatoys and a pioneer Toy Town 
entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales, which account for about 30% of the area's revenue, also slumped, 
Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Hau, proprietor of 88 Toys, in part blames Proposition 187, which would 
bar illegal immigrants from receiving government health and education services 
if it survives court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hau believes his Latino customers, who account for a large percentage of Toy 
Town's retail sales, 
</P>
<P>
 may be devoting their resources to fighting the measure's enactment or saving 
their money in case they need to assist family or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo said: "Everyone has a different theory for the slowdown," adding that he 
believes the weak California economy is a factor.  
</P>
<P>
 Woo estimated that sales were down 20% across the board in Toy Town. Last year 
a surge in sales two weeks before Christmas saved the season, he said. Although 
sales picked up last week, Woo said it probably came too late to salvage this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo says the dip as temporary, adding that he believes the Mexican markets 
will reopen. He attributes much of the groaning to merchants who are accustomed 
to seeing their robust businesses expand instead of contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a growth year," he said, but businesses that provide good 
service and good products at reasonable prices will do fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone are the times when you can just open up a toy wholesaler and have a line 
outside the door." BRETT MAHONEY

THE FALL OF LAFAYETTE PARK; IT HAS BEEN IN SHARP DECLINE FOR THE 10-ACRE PARK 
IN WESTLAKE, WHERE RESIDENTS SHARE SPACE WITH GANG MEMBERS AND DRUG USERS IN AN 
ATMOSPHERE SO THREATENING THAT EVEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH GROUP DISBANDED. 
WHAT'S HAPPENED AT LAFAYETTE IS TYPICAL OF THE CITY'S DETERIORATING URBAN 
OASES. YET SOME SEE GLIMMER OF HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Lafayette Park in Westlake, children climb up and down a jungle gym, just a 
leap and a short hop from a transient's shopping cart. Families picnic at 
lunchtime while gang members lounge at a nearby table. Residents carefully plan 
out their visits because, in the words of one who strolls through the park with 
her baby, by late afternoon, drug addicts "come out like roaches and ants." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Lafayette sprawls next to a Superior Court building frequented 
by judges and cops; on the slope closest to it, drug dealers and addicts hold 
court in an area dubbed "dope dungeon." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a hard fall for the 10-acre park, situated in what was once a 
fashionable hub amid such landmark buildings as a Bullocks department store -- 
now closed -- and the defunct Sheraton Town-House hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contrast between Lafayette's pastoral past and present peril is 
especially marked, it is typical of the city's deteriorating urban parks, many 
of which are seen as dangerous eyesores rather than refuges from the noisy 
grind of city life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the Los Angeles area have stopped seeing parks in urban areas as a 
community asset, but as a blight on their safety," said Steve Kelly, program 
director at People for Parks, a nonprofit organization working to improve 
county parks. "The problems in Lafayette are mirrored in other parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The next closest park, MacArthur, is four blocks away and has had plenty of 
troubles, too. In fact, police sweeps and its temporary closure for subway 
construction are reasons for the increase in homeless and gang problems at 
Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, residents have gone so far as to ask that the neighborhood park 
be closed because of crime and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not here. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafayette sits in a densely packed low-income, working-class area where most 
people do not have the money or time to travel far for a walk in the park. So 
they keep coming, hoping the future will bring the return of a safer park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has promised improvements -- more lighting and installation of 
athletic fields. These steps can help, experts say, but often they are not 
taken by cash-strapped municipalities -- Los Angeles reduced spending for park 
maintenance by 13% over the last three years, to $28.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, residents, with an eye over their shoulders, venture forth 
despite an atmosphere that is so threatening that the local Neighborhood Watch 
group disbanded over safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 20 Koreans have played badminton in the park for two years, 
but only during the early morning. Even then, players don't feel entirely 
secure, although they say they have never had problems with gang members or 
vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't feel that safe," said Yoon, who goes by one name. "I like it when 
the police car drives by in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmine Wadsworth brings her 2-year-old niece to the park for walks, but 
within limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late afternoon, I won't come here because the drug addicts come out 
like roaches and ants," said Wadsworth, 25, who has been offered drugs as she 
walked toward the playground with her niece in tow. "Maybe they'll steal (the) 
stroller; they're on drugs, they'll steal anything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Until 1991 Lafayette was a very quiet park, police say. But in the last three 
years, six murders occurred there, half of them gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem, police say, has been the sale and use of crack cocaine, 
concentrated in the "dope dungeon" -- so named because the lack of street lamps 
keeps the area dark at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack is popular because of its relatively low price. The entrenched Mara 
Salvatrucha gang sometimes uses transients to make sales to a variety of 
customers that police say include homeless people and Wilshire district office 
workers who whisk in and out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack cocaine has been apparent in Lafayette since about 1989, and Mara 
Salvatrucha -- Salvadoran Spanish slang for the motherland or the people -- has 
considered the park its turf for 16 years, increasing its presence recently as 
the crack trade boomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang unit Detective Terry Wessel said the gang has committed street robberies, 
several murders and in the past has rented territory to drug dealers -- until 
taking over the trade themselves about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They leave the civilians alone, but the truth is these bullets don't have any 
name on them, so they (could) end up killing innocent people," Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members said they see themselves as protectors for the children and 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all like family here in the park," said one member in his late 20s. "My 
homeboys, I know what they are up to. We don't hit or rob anyone for no reason. 
Anyone who messes with us, we will deal with them, but we won't kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 The gang members said they get along with the homeless, their faithful 
narcotics buyers, and have even bought them clothes and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessel said, however, that members occasionally do rob the homeless, but the 
victims often don't report it. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of undercover narcotics officers include the park among their targets. 
But, said Officer Tom Mossman, getting rid of dope dealers is "like trying to 
stamp out cockroaches: You kill one and 10 more come to take its place." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, officials said, complaints about the park recently have dropped 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always have complaints of gang members, the homeless and drug sales -- at 
least two to three complaints every two weeks. Now, that is changing because 
the police have put a special emphasis on the park," said Francisco Lopez, an 
aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, whose district includes the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has promised improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months to come, the Department of Recreation and Parks plans to use 
$440,000 to spruce up the park, said Julie Riley, a landscape architect for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also plans to build a baseball diamond, which may double as a 
soccer field, in the southwest corner of the park, where many transients now 
congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baseball diamond will help in reducing the homeless and bringing the 
community to the park, especially families," Lopez said. "It will also reduce 
crime in the area because criminals don't like to be around large groups of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Other improvements will include lighting for the basketball courts (one was 
renovated by 20th Century Fox for the filming of the 1992 release, "White Men 
Can't Jump"), as well as lighting for the area around the adjacent Phillipe de 
Neve branch of the city public library and its parking lot and the area around 
the "dope dungeon." 
</P>
<P>
 The library, which was closed in the spring of 1990 because the 65-year-old 
building did not meet seismic standards, is scheduled to reopen in 1996 after 
completion of a renovation that will include new public restrooms and a 
multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
 Other improvements on tap for the park are a new irrigation system and fencing 
around the senior citizen center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such plans are heartening for those who knew the park in better times. Ten 
years ago, attorney James Davis moved into his Wilshire Boulevard offices 
overlooking Lafayette and made a home video of what it looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lafayette was lovely and the street was clean. This spot is essentially one 
of the most beautiful places in Los Angeles, but it is part of a very real 
problem. The homeless problem has gotten worse everywhere, but especially in 
this area," said Davis, a homeless advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafayette, named after the French marquis who fought with the colonists in the 
American Revolution, sits in what used to be the hub of old Los Angeles, the 
fashionable Wilshire district. Originally known as Sunset Park, the land was 
donated to the city in 1899 by Clara R. Shatto, wife of George Shatto, who 
owned Santa Catalina Island in the late 1800s, on the condition that it be used 
as a park. Its named was changed to Lafayette in 1918 at the urging of local 
French-heritage groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It was surrounded by major churches, retail stores and office buildings in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly across the street looms an 18-floor glass office tower whose main 
tenant is a Los Angeles Superior Court branch. Judges and lawyers have watched 
drug deals going down just six floors below, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rampart Division Officer Webster Wong, who specializes in crime prevention, is 
optimistic that some of the park's luster can be restored. "Common sense says 
that what (police officers) are doing right now is not having impact . . . we 
have to look at proactive approaches, like getting involved in the park, 
instead of reactive approaches," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some Westlake residents are skeptical about whether the city can do enough 
to make them feel safe in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Thompson is a member of the Neighborhood Watch group that met at 
Lafayette Park before disbanding two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided not to have the Neighborhood Watch meetings there because it was 
not safe," said Thompson, who has lived near the park for 21 years. "Even with 
escorts who would walk members to their cars, the group dwindled down to 
practically nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take my kids and grandchildren to the park, but I wouldn't go there 
during the day now," said Thompson, a volunteer neighborhood coordinator 
working with the Rampart Division on ways to improve the park. "I used to take 
my dog for a walk there too, but I haven't done that in four years. And I 
definitely don't go there at night."

KEEPING PARKS SAFE, CLEAN AND ACCESSIBLE IS NO PICNIC 
</P>

<P>
 Prompted by growing concerns that county and city budget cuts and other 
constraints are eroding urban parks, advocates are attempting to mobilize 
communities to take their parks' destinies into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county parks directors solicit volunteers to supervise youth 
activities. Residents scrape together sports leagues for children. The Police 
Department attempts to make parks more accessible via police sweeps of 
transients and drug dealers -- often to see them return shortly thereafter or 
move on to other nearby parks. Graffiti marks the sides of dilapidated swimming 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened to the parks? 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say crime and blight seeped into inner-city parks shortly after the 
passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, which reduced property taxes that paid for 
public services. Parks and recreation services were casualties as money that 
once reached community parks in low-income areas dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of funding led the city of Los Angeles, which maintains 450 parks, to 
halve the number of parks department employees to 4,000 over the past decade 
and significantly scale back youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department, which oversees 129 
parks, has also suffered: Full-time employees declined from 2,200 in 1978 to 
800 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks in South-Central Los Angeles were among the worst hit by the cutbacks, a 
situation that parks advocate Jack Foley calls "recreational apartheid." 
Affluent areas could afford to charge user fees to maintain parks, but that is 
not the case with urban parks, many of which serve low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes government makes budget cuts in areas of least resistance," said 
Foley, a founder of People for Parks, a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, community groups have stepped in to spruce up parks and 
organize activities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Sports Friendship League, for example, has created sports 
tournaments for South-Central children at seven parks with the help of city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonie Marie Grooms, a Housing Authority Police Department officer and founder 
of the league, said it serves about 5,000 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We service a lot of kids and we'd service a lot more if we had the 
resources," Grooms said. "When kids are playing baseball, they don't have too 
much time to spray-paint walls."

CITY ARTS: A SPIRITUAL RENEWAL

<P>
 Patterned after traditional African harvest festivals and versed in the East 
and Central African language of Swahili, Kwanzaa has given African Americans a 
unique cultural holiday of their own since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kwanzaa celebrations will be taking place all over Southern 
California on Monday through Jan. 1, nowhere is there more activity than in the 
Crenshaw district, the last predominantly black section of Los Angeles. Events 
include a kickoff candlelighting ceremony Monday at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 
Plaza, a parade and festival in Leimert Park, special church services and a 
karamu (feast) at the African American Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by activist and educator Maulana Karenga as an Afrocentric alternative 
to the Christmas season, it is nonetheless non-religious and celebrated by 
blacks of all faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrants take time to renew the spirit of family and community -- 
traditionally strong African values -- by observing the nguzo saba (seven 
principles) of Kwanzaa, one for each day: umoja (unity), kujichagulia 
(self-determination), ujima (collective work and responsibility), ujamaa 
(cooperative economics), nia (purpose), kuumba (creativity) and imani (faith). 
People typically exchange gifts that have some cultural significance and that 
reinforce one or more of the principles.  
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa yenu iwe na heri! (May your Kwanzaa be one of happiness, goodness and 
prosperity.) Kwanzaa highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 17th annual candlelighting ceremony, second level of the Baldwin Hills 
Crenshaw Plaza, noon Monday. Free Kwanzaa information books and T-shirts 
giveaway for kids. This year's theme is "Lighting a candle and leading the way 
for the children."  
</P>
<P>
 Children's Kwanzaa Celebration, 2-3:30 p.m. Monday, African American Cultural 
Center, 2560 W. 54th St. An afternoon celebrating the values of Kwanzaa in 
music, dance, stories and song. $5 per family.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Dec. 30: 10 a.m., Kwanzaa parade beginning at Adams Avenue and 
Crenshaw Boulevard, proceeding south on Crenshaw to Vernon Avenue. Kwanzaa 
festival follows in Leimert Park (at Crenshaw and Vernon) from 11 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Festival featuring music, crafts and food continues Saturday and Sunday, 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
</P>

VOICES: KWANZAA VIBES; THE DUALITY OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN HOLIDAY AND 
CHRISTMAS CATCHES ON WITH THOSE WHO YEARN FOR A NON-COMMERCIAL, SPIRITUAL AND 
ETHNOCENTRIC CELEBRATION.

playwright. She owns JemStone Productions, a public relations, theater and 
video production company. Mwelu lives in the Rancho Cienega area of Southwest 
Los Angeles and has been celebrating Kwanzaa, a cultural holiday patterned 
after traditional African harvest festivals celebrated by a growing number of 
African Americans. Mwelu will be one of the featured readers on At One With the 
Spirit, a special Kwanzaa radio program that airs tomorrow at 10 p.m. on KPFK 
(90.7 FM) She was interviewed by Erin J. Aubry.

<P>
 I've been celebrating Kwanzaa since the early '80s, when I lived in the Bay 
Area -- Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco and East Palo Alto, which was later 
named Little Nairobi because of the African consciousness there. 
</P>
<P>
 Each region celebrated it so differently. In the Bay Area, each community was 
linked by their celebrations. It made it really nice that each night you had 
the opportunity to go to a different area to observe one of the nguzo saba 
principles. It made it a real connected community vibration. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several things I like about Kwanzaa, things that made me start 
celebrating it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing is the alternative to a commercial Christmas, what I knew 
Christmas to be when I was growing up. To me, Christmas really began to deviate 
from that vibe of friends and family -- of that vibe of being thankful for just 
a stocking full of nuts. It escalated into, "Well, I want a leather coat," and 
"I want a record player," and then people started getting mad because they 
didn't have enough money to buy things.  
</P>
<P>
 There's supposed to be a spiritual connotation to Christmas of family, of 
nomads traveling from all over the world to come home.  
</P>
<P>
 But you run into people with attitudes, mad from shopping all day, elbowing 
each other in parking lots, running their credit cards up, getting into debt. 
</P>
<P>
 So when I first heard about Kwanzaa and the values it was trying to put on 
life, particularly African American life, it was an automatic appeal to me. It 
appealed to me from a political standpoint, as an African American and also 
from a commemorative community ritual standpoint. People need rituals and 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, I have seen Kwanzaa grow tremendously. People are not only 
tired of the commercialism, but younger people like my son Gregory, who's 22, 
are coming up with a different consciousness about who they are. They're 
becoming more Afrocentric in their base; they also want an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa isn't something you just jump in and out of, like Christmas Eve and 
Christmas Day. It's a seven-day period. And more people are understanding that 
they're not giving up anything, that they're not being indoctrinated into a 
cult by celebrating Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 People think they have to take an African name, they have to stop being a good 
Christian. Not at all -- Kwanzaa has nothing to do with Christianity, except 
that it has the Christian consciousness of reaching out and extending yourself 
to others.  
</P>
<P>
 With Kwanzaa gift giving, you try to give people things that have some meaning 
to you, that have some personal meaning to them. And you get them something of 
African origin, something that relates to their history, their ancestry, and 
also some type of crafted thing if you're gifted. 
</P>
<P>
 I've crocheted things, I've sewn things, I've done appliques. It personalizes 
something from me to them, and it symbolizes one of the principles of Kwanzaa 
-- kuumba, which is creativity. You give gifts that are meaningful, that can 
nurture people and are memoirs, rather than five sweaters or more makeup bags 
than you could ever use. Usually, you think back on Christmas gifts, you say, 
"What did I get last year?" and you can't even remember. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child of divorce, my son has embraced both worlds of Christmas and 
Kwanzaa since he was very young. He could groove with Christmas every year with 
his father, and come right into the Kwanzaa thing with me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We light our candles, we go to the Kwanzaa celebrations, he puts on his 
African clothes. It's natural to him. I've never dictated to him, "Christmas is 
over for you, you've got to do this now because you're a black child." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa is a thing that, because it raises your consciousness and sense of 
self-worth, is really a personal choice. And because you don't embrace it 
doesn't mean you're any less celebratory, or care any less about having a time 
of commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
 As more knowledge is brought to Christian organizations about what Kwanzaa 
really is, Christmas and Kwanzaa are being celebrated more in duality.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, let's not negate the fact that there are many African 
Americans who want no association with their lineage or with Africa. They say, 
"I was born in America, my name is Beverly Jones" or whatever. I think that 
particular attitude is truly unfortunate. Too many African Americans want to 
begin their history with slavery because they don't know who they were and 
where they came from.  
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating your ancestors during Kwanzaa gives you the most tremendous amount 
of strength and spirit. You realize that with all the slaves endured, they must 
have been a great people before they even got here. And we're still around to 
put Kwanzaa together.

VOICES: NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR; ON MALTMAN AVENUE IN SILVER LAKE, THE QUALITY OF 
LIFE CAN BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HELP A STRICKEN STRANGER OR JUST THE 
SIMPLE PLEASURE OF PLAYING A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OUTDOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Anita-Louise Halstead, Anita-Louise Halstead is a proud member of a diverse 
community just off Sunset Boulevard in the Silver Lake area. She has a 
long-held belief in the importance of individuals working together to build 
neighborhoods based on the principles of love, cooperation, sharing and caring. 
She relates some of the personal experiences that have motivated her to work 
toward her ideals. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems like the middle of the night is when I do my most creative thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with that tradition, I awoke recently at 3 a.m. and began to think 
about the beautiful and profound experiences I've had in my neighborhood, a 
small community intersecting Sunset Boulevard in the Silver Lake area. I began 
to consider what it means to be a neighbor, and as I did, several incidents 
came to mind: 
</P>
<P>
 One morning before dawn, I was awakened by a neighbor who called out to me 
from the street. I went to my second-floor front window and asked what the 
problem was. He pointed to the sidewalk, where I could see someone lying. 
</P>
<P>
 My neighbor said he didn't know whether the man was still alive. I dialed 911 
and was asked the usual questions. I was also asked to administer CPR. I 
explained that I didn't know how, but the man said he'd tell me what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately I was filled with an intense fear. I thought, "What if this man 
has AIDS or some other disease? What if I don't do CPR correctly and he dies? 
What if I injure him?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I knew God was with me, I was unable to control my terror. But the 
man needed my help, and I could not refuse him. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked down the stairs in a daze. Finally, I reached the man. His body felt 
cold; I was horrified. My heart was pounding so hard I couldn't even take his 
pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave him CPR to the best of my ability, though I really believe he had been 
dead for some time. The police and paramedics arrived within minutes and told 
me the man apparently had died of a massive heart attack. In spite of the 
outcome, I was quite touched by the compassion of everyone at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Other incidents came to mind which didn't involve anything as dramatic as 
death, but rather the quality of life here on Maltman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the success stories involved our work getting a corrupt underground bar 
closed. This bar created serious problems for the neighborhood, including drug 
dealing, gang violence, blatant sexual activity, defecating/urinating on the 
sidewalks and other undesirable acts. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than two years, but we brought about the resolution of these 
problems through mutual cooperation, without any form of harassment, threats or 
violence toward the bar owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The police commission, as a result of our work and appearance before it as a 
unified community, denied the owner's application for a dance permit and also 
refused to renew the liquor license. A short time later, the bar closed its 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what it means to live in a community. 
</P>
<P>
 In my spare time, I play the recorder, an instrument in the flute family. 
About 12 years ago, I was inspired to sit on my porch and play because I felt 
shy and lonely. I wanted to connect with my neighbors. People passing by were 
-- and continue to be -- kind enough to acknowledge and appreciate my music, in 
spite of some broken notes, odd rhythms and occasionally playing Christmas 
songs on the hottest of summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 I sit outside almost every day and play. When I miss a day or two, neighbors 
and others passing by on their way to the Sunset buses, who are used to seeing 
"the lady who plays the flute," will come up and ask, "When are you going to 
play again? I can hear your music clear up the hill." And children as young as 
3 or 4 stop and ask me to "sing" (their word for playing the recorder) for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 I am white, but many of my neighbors are Filipino. There are also blacks, 
Latinos, Chinese, and other ethnic groups. Some on the block are gay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what bonds me to them all are the simple, unpretentious acts of kindness 
I've experienced here on Maltman, like a few months ago with a Russian woman 
who lives a few houses away. She telephoned one day, concerned that she hadn't 
seen me on the porch for over a week. She just wanted to make sure I was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 What does being a neighbor mean? Does it mean when we are called on for help 
we gladly respond, offering assistance in spite of inconvenience or fear? Or is 
it merely existing in a community, deliberately isolating oneself from 
neighborhood companions, never interacting except for an occasional "hello" if 
we are lucky? 
</P>
<P>
 That happens here on Maltman, of course. But there are also those who have the 
courage to become involved, such as after the January earthquake, when my 
neighbor's chimney fell into my driveway, completely blocking it. About 10 of 
my Filipino neighbors came over while it was still dark, and without being 
asked, cleared the rubble. And having removed the larger debris, they then 
swept the driveway clean. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood is meant to be an extended, loving family; a village, actually. 
And when we at last accept our part, our responsibilities and our membership in 
the village family, our lives are extraordinarily enriched. 
</P>
<P>
 I am deeply grateful for the more than 14 years I've spent here on Maltman, 
and for the wonderful experience of living near so many culturally rich ethnic 
groups from other lands and other traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 This is something we in Los Angeles need to appreciate and be grateful for; 
the wonderful diversity in the City of the Angels.

PACIFIC OPEN; WASHINGTON SNAPS COUGAR STREAK AT 27 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington High may not be a Crenshaw-killer but it has fared better against 
the Cougars than any other team in the area -- or nation, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's last defeat was in January against Richland Northeast in the Beach 
Ball Classic in South Carolina, and its last loss to any California team was 
against Washington two years ago in the Pacific Open Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Generals broke Crenshaw's string of 27 consecutive wins Wednesday with a 
96-80 victory in the championship game of the Pacific Open Tournament at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured we had to play a half-court game to play with Crenshaw," 
Washington Coach Andy Davis said. "We came out after halftime and decided to 
play a half-court game, which allowed (Patrick) Blake to step up" and work 
one-on-one against Crenshaw with the tempo slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake scored 23 of his game-high 34 points in the second half, including 10 in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gordon-Lamar added 31 points for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bumped on the defensive end and our defense became our offense," said 
Gordon-Lamar. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw suffered a big loss when Raymond Palmer was forced to sit out the 
entire third quarter with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really hurt us when I had to sit out," said Palmer, who scored 14 points 
but only two in the second half. "It's just one game." 
</P>
<P>
 One game that Ronnie Arch would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the momentum changed and we were down, the team quit," said Arch, who 
led the Cougars with 19 points and nine rebounds. "We'll bounce back for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Washington 10-1; Crenshaw 9-1

GIRLS' BASKETBALL; MARSHALL HIGH'S EARLY-SEASON JITTERS APPEAR TO BE A THING OF 
THE PAST

 Marshall High didn't win the Washington or Bell tournaments, but the 
experience helped the Barristers defeat San Pedro, 62-33, in the San Fernando 
tournament final Wednesday at San Fernando High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wake-up call," senior guard Jamie Kogan said. "It made us a better 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall opened the season by splitting four games in the Washington 
tournament, and then lost two of three games in the Bell tournament the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a humbling experience, but they came to the reality there are other 
good teams out there," Marshall Coach Wendy Triplett said. "And when we're 
playing in the playoffs in the first round, that could make the difference down 
the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little drama against San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by 16 first-half points from Kogan, the Barristers raced to a 29-13 
second-quarter lead. Marshall, which led at halftime, 35-17, opened the second 
half with a 9-0 run and built a 50-22 advantage with two minutes left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kogan finished with a game-high 19 points. She also had seven rebounds and 
seven assists. Teammates Korey Kobata added 12 points and seven assists and Eva 
Rodriguez scored eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kogan, who had 21 and 20 points in a 63-18 first-round victory over Cleveland 
and a 37-21 semifinal win against Hamilton, was selected to the all-tournament 
team along with Kobata and Rodriguez for Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a good chance to win the tournament, but we didn't go in 
thinking we were going to win it all," Kobata said. "We're starting to get to 
know each other and playing better together." 
</P>
<P>
 Records: San Pedro 4-4; Marshall 8-4 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 50, Cerritos 46 -- Trysta Wilson made three three-point baskets and 
had six assists to lift Washington to the championship quarterfinal victory in 
the Touranment of Champions in Santa Barbara Thursday. Wilson and Lareishia 
Findley had a team-high 11 points each. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Washington 7-3; Cerritos 7-2 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw 74, Las Vegas Chaparral 43 -- Naila Moseley had 17 points and 12 
rebounds and Kristi Lattin had 15 points, nine rebounds and eight assists as 
the Cougars defeated Nevada State champion Chapparral on Wednesday in the 
finals of the Cheyenne Las Vegas Basketball Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Lattin was named the tournament most valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Crenshaw 13-0; Chapparral 9-1 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont 71, Chatsworth 67 -- Shaterry Danley scored a game-high 31 points as 
the Pathfinders won a round-robin game in the Van Nuys Tournament Wednesday at 
Van Nuys High. 
</P>
<P>
 Aisha Sabage and Florastine Hillis added 16 points each for Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Record: Fremont 3-7 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens 46, Katella 40 (OT) -- Adriana Villalobos made a three-point shot 
to tie the score at 39 with 27 seconds left in regulation and scored six of the 
Lancers' seven points in overtime to lift the Lancers to the nonleague victory 
Tuesday. Villalobos had 27 points.

NOTEBOOK; COACH DETERMINED TO 'RING' BELL FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a lot of hard work for the Bell High football team to win its first 
City Section title in the 3-A final Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Henry Santiago said raising funds to purchase championship rings 
will be a much more difficult task. Santiago is seeking sponsors to purchase 
rings for 64 players at a cost of $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traditional to have a ring when you win a City championship, but about 
80% of our players cannot afford it " Santiago said. "This is an enormous 
undertaking. Hopefully, we'll reach our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations from staff and teachers at Bell have raised enough money to purchase 
20 rings. Santiago hopes that with the help of contributions from the 
community, he will garner enough money to purchase the rest by the team's Jan. 
28 awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is excited and we had a lot of responses," Santiago said. "Besides 
a marriage ring, this will be the only one most of our players' will have in 
their lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago, who directed Bell (11-3) to its first title in five championship 
appearances, was chosen City 3-A coach of the year and Dicky Purcell of Bell 
was named player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior tight end, caught 51 passes for 786 
yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, Purcell had 84 tackles and 112 assists at inside linebacker. He 
also had two fumble recoveries and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Gus Valenzuela, running back Vern Benard and defensive back Freddy 
Hernandez were also named to the 3-A team for Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinalist Wilson placed running back Arlin Slayton, quarterback Eddie 
Gonzales and receiver Buster Bradley on the 32-player team chosen by the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation and First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 City Times player of the year running back Sirr Parker, linemen Eboni Wilson 
of Jefferson and Lamar Lightburn of Manual Arts and defensive back Damon 
Whitehurst of Manual Arts were other selections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw placed three players on the 4-A team. Running back Farrel Payton, 
linemen Todd Moore and Kabeer Smith were chosen for the City runner-up Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franklin duo of Jeff Deno and Johnnie Sanders, who led the area in passing 
and receiving, were also named to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Hoffman Cortes and tight end Mark Redoval were selected after 
leading South Gate to its first Southeastern Conference title since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey defensive back Jemell Gordon and linebacker Darius Wesber, defensive 
back Jesse Villalobos of Garfield and lineman Steve Barragan of Fremont were 
other selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar running back Durell Price was selected the 4-A player of the year. 
Sylmar's Jeff Engilman was coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prawit Namutawong of East L.A. College has been selected to the National 
Soccer Coaches Athletic Assn.'s All-American team. The sophomore goalkeeper, 
one of two California players on the first team, allowed only five goals 
against 151 shots and had 130 saves to help East L.A. (20-3-1) reach the State 
junior college final. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A free-throw shooting contest for boys and girls age 10-14 will be held at St. 
Vincent school Jan. 14 at 10 a.m. The event will serve as a local qualifier for 
the Knights of Columbus International Free Throw championship. Nearly 200,000 
participated in 2,990 local competitions last year.

PACIFIC OPEN ROUNDUP; MVP BREEDLOVE CARRIES JORDAN TO CONVINCING TOURNAMENT 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clem Breedlove, who scored a game-high 39 points and received MVP honors, 
erased all doubts that Jordan Coach Ed Kamiyama may have had going into 
Wednesday night's Pacific Open basketball 3-A tournament final against Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have some trouble tonight," Kamiyama said before the game. "Canoga 
Park is a little bigger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a 37-4 run in the second quarter -- including Breedlove's 23 points 
during that stretch -- size and strength didn't mean a thing as Jordan defeated 
Canoga Park, 117-78, in the lower division. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:24 left in the first quarter, Eddie Hernandez, who scored 29 points, 
nailed a 20-footer to give Jordan a 16-15 lead. But six minutes into the second 
quarter, the Bulldogs were rolling with a 53-19 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I could score against that team," a smiling Breedlove said. "Besides, 
we needed to win on back-to-back nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's Termell Goss chipped in with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Kamiyama explained the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took Canoga Park out of their game and played solid ball."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; LACC ROLLS TO AN EASY WIN, 107-59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City College had an easy time running its fast break against San 
Diego City College and rolled to a 107-59 win in the semifinals of the Los 
Angeles City Classic on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Higgins scored 23 points and Derrick Brown added 16 for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran our lanes well," Los Angeles City College Coach Mike Miller said. "It 
was the sort of game where no one really stood out, but at the same time 
everyone gave an effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Record: Los Angeles City 16-1 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City College 86, Harbor College 46 -- Using a tenacious pressure 
defense, the Cubs cruised to victory in the first round of the Los Angeles 
Classic on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC led only 7-6 early in the first half, but turned up the pressure to build 
leads of 34-18 at the half and 71-28 midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 LACC forward Derrick Brown led all scorers with 22 points, while teammates 
Jason Wright and Markee Brown added 12 and 11 respectively. Forwards Saipele 
Tuialii, Terrance Askew and Sako Balian combined for 21 of the Cubs' 45 
rebounds.

1994 / YEAR IN REVIEW; ARTS AND THE COMING STORM; AFTER THIS YEAR'S POWER SHIFT 
IN WASHINGTON, MANY FEAR THAT GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THE ARTS WILL ONCE AGAIN 
BE TARGETED FOR EXTINCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The phrase sounds like some ominous new kind of military strategy: "Zeroing 
out." A tactic that might, say, destroy all foliage within a 50-mile radius or 
wipe out the population of a mid-sized city. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "zeroing out" seems to be the buzzword in Washington when discussion 
turns to a much smaller target in a very civilized war: the battle over federal 
funding for arts and culture in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the agencies that control federal arts dollars -- the 
National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the 
Humanities (NEH) and the Corp. for Public Broadcasting (CPB) -- were 
established in the 1960s, Congress is in the hands of a Republican majority. 
And the Speaker of the House of Representatives will be ultra-conservative Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has recommended that these agencies be scrapped in favor 
of private-sector funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives -- most notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and George Bush's 1992 
challenger for the Republican nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan -- have 
consistently bashed the NEA since 1989, when the agency was challenged for 
funding "obscene" exhibitions by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. But 
this is the first time Republicans have the power to actually "zero out" the 
NEA, NEH and their sister organization, the Institute of Museum Services, and 
CPB. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the arts universe, no matter what party, what meeting they are 
attending, is talking about 1995 and what it holds," said Wayne Lawson, 
executive director of the Ohio Arts Council. "There is not one person who is 
not, as we speak, thinking about what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hero, president of the Community Foundation of Santa Clara County and a 
member of the National Council for the Arts, the NEA's advisory board, says 
council members nationwide have been sent an alarming stack of East Coast 
newspaper clippings predicting doom for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic that this new Congress, which contains many people who are, 
and were, supportive of the arts before they were elected, will give thoughtful 
considerations to the role of the NEA. I don't anticipate a wholesale shutting 
down of the agency," Hero said. "But then, there is that stack of clippings . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 2, at a meeting of the President's Committee on the Arts and 
Humanities -- a group of 31 private citizens appointed by the President -- 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged support for continued federal funding 
of cultural programs and encouraged bipartisan support. In attendance were 
Californians Harold Williams, director of the Getty Trust (who described the 
mood as one of "apprehension and concern"), and Irene Hirano, executive 
director of Los Angeles' Japanese American National Museum, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Dec. 2, a Washington Post Op-Ed piece by conservative pundit Charles 
Krauthammer recommended balancing the Republican plan to cut welfare by also 
cutting "middle-class welfare" -- the NEA and the NEH. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of these cuts is the cultural side benefit that comes from 
strangling agencies that cannot -- it has by now been proven -- be kept out of 
the hands of the academic Left," Krauthammer wrote. Clearly, on any given day 
in Washington, both sides of the issue are being vehemently debated. 
</P>
<P>
 While NEA watchers are split down the middle as to whether NEA chief Jane 
Alexander has made recent funding cuts due to political pressure or is simply 
trying to save money, all agree that a conscious feather-smoothing effort has 
been made by Alexander to go from state to state, soothing egos and pointing up 
NEA's role in supporting educational programs and traditional institutions to 
stave off a backlash against the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's serious, but we are going to work very, very hard," said NEA spokeswoman 
Terry Simon. "We are going to do everything we can to educate the new Congress 
as to what the NEA does in their own back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Corp. for Public Broadcasting President Richard W. Carlson is also stressing 
education and cooperation with the new Congress. While denying that CPB will 
grow more conservative, "I think Congress has a right and even the 
responsibility to question how those dollars are used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are particularly high for the NEA and the NEH, which come up for a 
reauthorization in 1995. But from a public relations standpoint, CPB may be 
taking a greater hit. In what amounted to a pitch for conservative cable 
channel National Empowerment Television, on which Gingrich hosts a weekly 
program, Gingrich told NET viewers that CPB should be "zeroed out" and that 
they "have been paying taxes involuntarily to subsidize something which told 
them how they should think, and NET is free." 
</P>
<P>
 CPB, with a current annual budget of $285 million, helps operate public TV and 
radio programs and stations. The bulk of its money goes for television, and it 
has long been a target for conservatives claiming a liberal bias, as has the 
NEA. The always-colorful Buchanan once called the NEA "the upholstered playpen 
of the arts-and-crafts auxiliary of the Eastern liberal Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol Hill watchers say that it's not just a case of the Republicans being 
in the majority, since there have always been some Republican arts supporters 
on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they see a particularly strong movement against such funding among the 
new leaders, especially in the House (Senate leadership in those committees 
that oversee arts and culture are perceived to be more moderate). Even 
California representative-elect Sonny Bono, according to the Washington Post, 
has denounced the NEA -- leading some wags to suggest that Bono had already 
harmed the arts enough during his musical career. (Bono could not be reached 
for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Gingrich) has made his intentions pretty clear: He does not see federal 
support for the arts as part of the 'contract with America,' " said attorney 
Marjorie Heins, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Arts Censorship 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort (to abolish the NEA) has been made ever since the 
Mapplethorpe-Serrano controversy began in '89, but there hasn't until now been 
enough support in the Congress for complete abolition of the agency," Heins 
said. "From what I now hear from Capitol Hill pundits, that support now does 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 In an appendix, the 'contract with America' recommends a 50% budget cut for 
the NEA, rather than the complete withdrawal of support suggested by Gingrich. 
But some NEA supporters say that a cut this massive would effectively eliminate 
the NEA's power. The agency already underwent a $2.9-million cut (down from 
$170.2 million to $167.3 million) for fiscal year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated phone calls, Gingrich was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His press secretary and spokesman, Tony Blankley, said that Gingrich's 
position is that "philosophically, there is no need to have taxpayer subsidies 
of art or public broadcasting in America. When the Corp. for Public 
Broadcasting was brought on line three decades ago (in 1967), there were three 
networks. Today, there are 120 channels, and there are soon to be 500. There is 
an explosion of niche programming . . . every conceivable taste is available to 
the public. Why are we subsidizing -- with taxpayer's money?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the NEA, Blankley said: "In the past few years, we have seen the 
difficulties which arise when bureaucrats get involved in the arts and make, 
shall we say, eccentric patronage choices with their artists. The public is 
outraged, and the artists who aren't funded claim they are being censored in 
some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NEA did not seem to surface strongly in anyone's campaign 
platform in November's election, the NEA-as-whipping-post rhetoric, at least, 
is back with a vengeance, according to a White House official who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "(NEA) detractors continue to look for some ancient incident that gives some 
grotesque interpretation of what is art," the official said, adding, "there 
will be some on the Hill who will vigorously try to change the landscape of the 
level of public funding for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a few less- than-ancient NEA flash points, too. This year, the 
NEA came under fire for a grant to the Minneapolis Walker Arts Center that paid 
$150 to Los Angeles performance artist Ron Athey. Complaints came from Congress 
about a performance in which Athey, who is HIV-positive, carved a pattern into 
the back of another artist, who was said not to have the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
 And the NEA sparked another controversy by overturning grant recommendations 
to three photographers -- a group which included the infamous Serrano, whose 
1986 photograph of a crucifix in urine, "Piss Christ," touched off the earlier 
round of censorship battles. 
</P>
<P>
 While expecting a flood of anti-NEA rhetoric as the new Congress settles in, 
however, longtime NEA watchers argue that the agency is not a whole lot more 
embattled than usual; routinely, Helms proposes that the agency be abolished 
and it remains standing, though perhaps a little wobblier than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens every year," said one Capitol Hill source. "I have serious 
doubts that there will be any real obstacles to reauthorization." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former NEA chief John Frohnmayer, who weathered the agency's most 
controversial years before being forced out by Bush in 1992, "I'm not sure that 
they (Republicans) will, willy-nilly, rush in to rip apart the endowment. My 
guess is that when they take a close look at it, they will recognize two 
things: one, the endowment does contribute significantly to mainstream America, 
and the second is that the endowments (which operate on a system of matching 
grants) more than pay for themselves in terms of their stimulation of tax 
dollars. When you lay out that argument, it's a very Republican thing." 
</P>
<P>
 While NEA supporters hope to preserve the agency by arguing its financial 
prudence, the Getty's Williams mused that perhaps a more important issue is at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government plays a very significant role in today's world in 
articulating what's important to this country," he said. "I guess what I worry 
about most is what message comes out of Washington about the importance of 
culture in this nation, and the importance of the arts and humanities to what 
we call a civilized society.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the issue is federal funding. That's my sense of it -- it's 
something more profound."*

1994 / YEAR IN REVIEW; DANCE; THE YEAR OF THE TANGO AND 'DON Q' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lewis Segal, Lewis Segal is The Times' dance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 New venues changed the pat tern of dance presentation in Southern California 
during 1994, adding institutional nouns ("the Luckman," "the Carpenter") to the 
audience's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile other venues fell prey to weird programming obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Orange County Performing Arts Center kept retailing the 
morbid ballet-hackery of the late Kenneth MacMillan, while the Cerritos Center 
for the Performing Arts seemed to book every company in the world with the "Don 
Quixote" pas de deux in rep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance Kaleidoscope" grew dangerously stale this year and "Black 
Choreographers" desperately directionless. UCLA suffered the closing of Royce 
Hall (earthquake damage) and let a number of major events bypass the Southland 
-- notably Mark Morris' full-evening "L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato." 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, a tango revival lent vitality to ballet, modern and world dance 
programs on local stages. At the Wilshire Theatre in June, "Forever Tango: The 
Eternal Dance" presented Argentine style at Broadway scale, never more 
persuasively than when soulful veterans Gloria and Eduardo took the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the intimate Fountain Theatre in Hollywood proved ideal for 
"Ritmo Tango" (March), an atmospheric survey of Argentine traditions featuring 
the drop-dead authority of Alberto Toledano and Loreen Arbus.  
</P>
<P>
 Far less successful, ballet virtuoso Julio Bocca bared his chest for two 
quasi-steamy tango showpieces on his Ballet Argentino programs at the Cerritos 
Center in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at Nosotros in December, Toledano and Arbus created for Dance Theater 
of East L.A. the year's most daring tango: a man-to-man psychosexual struggle 
for dominance fought out by Bogar Martinez and Frank Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a summary of other memorable events and performances from one 
aficionado's journals: 
</P>
<P>
 World Dance: The Chindo Sikkim Kut/Festival of Korea program at UCLA in March 
offered excerpts of shaman funeral rites that layered song, chant, instrumental 
music and dance to convey the joy of living while accepting the inevitability 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Night in the Kraton" at UCLA in June, Bandoro Raden Mas Bambang Irawan 
embodied Central Javanese performing traditions in a superb masked solo from 
Solo, while a program of South Indian classical dance at UCLA in November 
showcased the stylistic refinement of Malavika Sarukkai.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mevlevi Ensemble of Turkey came to the Wadsworth Theater in November with 
a mesmerizing sample of 700-year-old Whirling Dervish ritual banned for most of 
this century by Turkish law. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam and Laila del Monte dramatically expanded the expressive scope of 
flamenco music and dance with jazz, Middle Eastern and Western European Gypsy 
influences in a program at the Fountain Theatre in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Dance: For power, nuance and creative breadth, nothing outclassed 
Nederlands Dans Theater in its five-part Jiri Kylian "black-and-white" program 
and, especially, Kylian's full-length "Kaguyahime" dance-drama at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in October. However, Mark Morris' uneven 
repertory at the Irvine Barclay Theatre in October held several treasures 
(particularly the solo "Rondo" and the dance drama "The Office"). 
</P>
<P>
 Also impressive: Edouard Lock's visionary "Infante -- C'est Destroy" at the 
Wiltern Theatre in March, which managed to deepen La La La Human Steps' 
inimitably gymnastic rock-dancing into an imposing multimedia metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning his family's history into a cultural monument, David Rousseve's "Urban 
Scenes/Creole Dreams" arrived at the Wadsworth Theater in April with a 
multifaceted, multicultural, multidisciplinary call-to-battle "against 
misogyny, race-hatred and AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Dean's "Light" at the Alex Theatre in June found her working for the 
first time with a world-dance company -- our own Aman Folk Ensemble -- and 
reshaping folkloric music and dance motifs according to the priorities of 
postmodern structuralism. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally daring, Donald Byrd's full-evening "Bristle" on the "Dance Without 
Borders" series at the Japan America Theatre in May developed its sardonic view 
of sexual manipulation through inventive, technically challenging group 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet: Miami City Ballet displayed a distinctively incisive, emotional and 
energetic style of dancing at the Wiltern in April. Especially in Balanchine's 
"Apollo," "The Four Temperaments" and "Rubies," the best of Edward Villella's 
principals danced as if the choreographies were brand-new, created especially 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey Ballet brought Leonide Massine's groundbreaking "Les Presages" to 
the Music Center in June, recapturing the energies of a work created the year 
Hitler came to power -- and eerily prescient about the imminent collapse of 
European values and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Decline of another sort characterized the Royal Ballet engagement at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in May, though Sarah Wildor and William 
Trevitt gave performances in Frederick Ashton's "The Dream" that creditably 
upheld a magnificent, endangered British ballet legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Better still, Yuri Posokhov's debut in the San Francisco Ballet's "Romeo and 
Juliet" at the Pavilion in December merged two great traditions, tempering 
Bolshoi intensity with Royal Danish refinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to Home: At Cal State L.A. in February, Stephanie Gilliland proved that 
intelligence, a sense of craft and sensitivity to emotional values in dancing 
can make even a cat's carpet-covered scratching post a splendid platform for 
movement expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark view of physicality informing Naoyuki Oguri's haunting "Protestation: 
Silent Shout" on the "Dance Without Borders" series contrasted eloquently with 
Mehmet Sander's heroic athleticism in "Spacetimegravity" in the same event. 
</P>
<P>
 In several 1994 appearances, Winifred R. Harris and Joel Christensen confirmed 
the promise they'd shown the previous year, while L.A. Chamber Ballet returned 
to prominence with a challenging program (shared with the Lo Cal Composers 
Ensemble) at the Japan America Theatre in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed by Bonne Oda Homsey's newly reconstituted Los Angeles Dance Theatre, 
seven legendary modern-dance solos dating all the way back to the beginnings of 
the art paid tribute to female resilience on a memorable "Weeping Women in 
Dance" program at the L.A. County Museum in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Media Dance: In its final season, "L.A. Law" drafted Gelsey Kirkland to 
portray a litigious ballerina whose triumph supposedly came in a scene showing 
her rehearsing the second act of "Giselle" -- but, strangely, only on half-toe, 
for reasons never explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers also weren't told that the PBS "Dance in America" series deleted more 
than a fourth of the Joffrey's full-evening Prince extravaganza "Billboards" to 
bring the running time under an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-minute showpiece on the Academy Awards telecast featured major dancers 
from the Paris Opera Ballet, the Kirov, Dance Theatre of Harlem, Garth Fagan 
Dance, National Ballet of Canada, Central Ballet of China, the Shanghai Ballet 
and Les Ballets Africains flashing across the stage of the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion in delirious pile-'em-up choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest scandal: Virtually all the companies involved were appearing at 
the Music Center for the very first time.

 Herewith, in no particular order, the 10 events, episodes and issues most 
significant for the Los Angeles art world in 1994:  
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic Duo: Simultaneous retrospectives of the pivotal work of Bruce Nauman 
and Mike Kelley at the Museum of Contemporary Art and the L.A. County Museum of 
Art, respectively, made for a knockout summer museum season, while definitively 
underscoring the continuing international significance of art made in Los 
Angeles. An added twist: You would have expected the show of the younger artist 
(Kelley) to be at MOCA and of the older (Nauman) to be at LACMA, but the tables 
were refreshingly turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo Stars: Among the impressive solo shows in L.A.'s resilient galleries were 
those by L.A.-based artists Phyllis Baldino, Judie Bamber, Linda Burnham, 
Carole Caroompas, Michael Coughlan, Roy Dowell, Sam Durant, Sally Elesby, Nancy 
Evans, Chris Finley, Judy Fiskin, Michael Gonzalez, Scott Grieger, Roger 
Herman, Jim Isermann, Larry Johnson, Mike Kelley, Joyce Lightbody, Paul 
McCarthy, Dan McCleary, Patrick Nickell, Jennifer Pastor and John Souza, as 
well as those of out-of-towners Stephan Balkenhal, Max Cole, Vernon Fisher, 
Michael Goldberg, William Klein, Richard Misrach, Joel Otterson, Therese 
Oulton, Peter Saul and Richard Tuttle. This extensive list -- not definitive 
because incomplete -- already ranks with the liveliest gallery scenes anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Show Business: The city's museums came through the January earthquake 
relatively unscathed, while somewhat downsized exhibition schedules nonetheless 
managed to impress. LACMA boasted a sizable number, including "Picasso and the 
Weeping Women," "Helen Levitt," "The Camera I: Photographic Self-Portraits From 
the Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection," "Korean Arts of the 18th Century: 
Splendor and Simplicity," "Spanish Polychrome Sculpture (1500-1800) in United 
States Collections" and the current "Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics 
from the Classic Period" and 'The Peaceful Liberators: Jain Art of India." 
</P>
<P>
 MOCA's prudently trimmed Roy Lichtenstein retrospective looked infinitely 
better than at its debut at New York's Guggenheim Museum. "Fouquet's Century: 
Transformations in French Painting, 1415-1530" and "Andre Kertesz: A Centennial 
Tribute" dazzled at the J. Paul Getty Museum, as does the current "A Passion 
for Antiquities: Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence 
Fleischman." The Getty also undertook an unprecedented collaboration with the 
Huntington Art Gallery for "Pictorialism in California: Photographs, 
1900-1940." The Norton Simon Museum opened an absorbing, yearlong show about 
German dealer Galka Scheyer, early champion in Los Angeles of the European 
avant-garde, while the Long Beach Museum of Art offered an eye-opening 
assessment of "The First Generation: Women and Video, 1970-1975." 
</P>
<P>
 About Face: In January, the Lannan Foundation stunned the American art world 
with its announcement that it would stop collecting contemporary art. Instead, 
between $2 million and $3 million annually has been shifted to social programs 
in Native American communities. Lannan's crucial program of funding museum 
exhibitions remains intact -- both the Nauman and Kelley shows saw the light of 
day thanks to Lannan largess -- but the heart of the foundation's enterprise 
had been its ambitious acquisition program. 
</P>
<P>
 Percent-for-Ego: Culver City detonated a multi-megaton bombshell in April when 
it tentatively agreed that, henceforth, the one-percent-for- art requirement in 
civic development projects could be considered fulfilled if the city found the 
quality of the project's architecture to be substantial enough. The silly plan, 
ostensibly intended to boost public recognition of building design, was widely 
seen as a political accommodation to an influential local developer and his 
favored architect. Suddenly disenfranchised artists and newly enfranchised 
architects were polarized into warring factions, while the precedent 
jeopardized hard-won percent-for-art ordinances in cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudderless Ship: Sixteen months have passed since the surprise departure of 
short-lived LACMA director Michael E. Shapiro. In November, Shapiro was named 
chief curator and program director at Atlanta's High Museum, but LACMA will 
finish the year still directorless and without a likely candidate in sight. 
Meanwhile, major museums in Boston and New York successfully completed their 
protracted searches for appropriate leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 First Generation: A distinct changing of the guard was felt more strongly than 
ever as significant figures among the first generation of artists, collectors 
and curators to make L.A. an emergent cultural force in the 1950s and early 
1960s either retired or went on to the Big Art World in the Sky. The passing of 
pivotal artists Sam Francis, Edward Kienholz and Hans Burkhardt; one-of-a-kind 
architect John Lautner; influential collector Frederick R. Weisman; 
multiple-museum trustee (and former Times Mirror Co. CEO) Franklin D. Murphy; 
and the widely revered collector, curator and dealer Betty Asher was followed 
in December by the unexpected retirement of Maurice Tuchman, founding curator 
in 1964 of LACMA's 20th-Century art department. 
</P>
<P>
 NEA No-No: With an unconscionable action, the National Endowment for the Arts 
destroyed from within more of its hard-earned credibility than its most rabid 
enemies had yet managed. The presidentially appointed National Council on the 
Arts, which oversees the NEA, declared in August that political considerations 
would henceforth guide the awarding of NEA grants. Asserting that "we cannot be 
blind to political reality," council member and Tufts University theater 
professor Barbara Grossman helped reject peer panel recommendations for 
fellowships to three artists -- even though the NEA's enabling legislation 
expressly forbids turning down grants on political grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Hammer: The Nov. 11 sale by the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and 
Cultural Center of a rare, autograph manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci bottomed 
out as "a new low for museum ethics," in the words of Lee Rosenbaum, newspaper 
columnist and author of a standard reference work on art collecting. The museum 
auctioned off the irreplaceable public asset in order to create a war chest to 
deal with possible lawsuits against the Hammer estate. Adding insult to the 
injury was the cowardly silence of the leading professional organizations for 
American art museums, whose ethical guidelines had been so blatantly breached 
by the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery Glut: The September opening of Santa Monica's multiple gallery 
enclave, Bergamot Station, generated enormous enthusiasm, attention and 
support. Less noticed has been the quiet emergence of a variety of new, smaller 
galleries -- Acme, Dan Bernier, Blum & Poe, Crossing Gallery, Marc Foxx, TRI -- 
which, following the successful precedents of such spaces as Thomas Solomon's 
Garage, Food House, Sue Spaid and Richard Telles Fine Arts, are replacing in 
significance the "apartment galleries" that mushroomed a few seasons back. 
Finally, 1993's budget-minded effort to have out-of-town dealers show their 
wares in borrowed L.A. galleries had felt thin and vaguely desperate, because 
most dealers brought only work they could fit in their suitcases -- a practice 
that turned out to be ideally suited to the convivial art fair held in December 
in spacious hotel rooms at the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip. The 
traveling-salesman ambience of a hotel was perfect, and the fair is likely to 
be repeated in 1995.*

1994 / YEAR IN REVIEW; JAZZ; KENNY G IS A FORCE, BUT YOUNG LIONS RULE; L.A. 
AUDIENCES SEEM WILLING AND EAGER TO HEAR JAZZ BUT RELUCTANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN MAJOR NAMES AND FAMILIAR MUSIC. NEW YORK, ANYONE?

 The peculiar state of jazz at the end of 1994 was best summed up early in 
December, when Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Artist of the Year award was given 
to Kenny G. There it was: a year in which more people were buying jazz records 
than ever before, and Kenny G was the headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Weird as it may seem, however, logic was on Billboard's side. The magazine 
makes its awards on the basis of sales, and G clearly sold more albums than 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But is G's music "contemporary jazz"? Not exactly. And if there was one silver 
lining for the year, it was the growing recognition that the music played by G, 
and performers such as Dave Koz, Richard Elliot, Candy Dulfer, etc., is not 
contemporary jazz but harmless, pop-oriented instrumental pabulum. The problem 
lies in the mistaken identification of pop jazz as the contemporary expression 
of the jazz mainstream. 'Taint so. Kenny G may be able to co-opt the name, but 
he can't really play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, 1994 was a year in which several young musicians who could play 
the game and legitimately claim roles in contemporary jazz came to the fore, 
via performances and recordings. Players such as Joshua Redman -- who brings 
his quartet into Catalina Bar & Grill for six-nights starting Tuesday -- David 
Sanchez, Christian McBride, Billy Childs, Joe Lovano, Wallace Roney, Vincent 
Herring, Benny Green and dozens of others came rushing onto the scene, actively 
proclaiming the widespread establishment of a generation of talented young 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing the work of the newer players was the impressive resurgence of such 
powerful veterans as pianists Kenny Barron and Barry Harris, saxophonists Joe 
Henderson (continuing to reassert his role as the premier tenor player in 
jazz), Jackie McLean and Eddie Harris, and trumpeter Art Farmer (to name only a 
few). 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, it was yet another year in which the most widespread media, 
television, didn't quite know what to make of jazz. The rare TV performances 
were usually limited to well-established players, generally on PBS programs, 
with a few regular shows on the BET cable network and a few videos on Bravo 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The starry-eyed prospect -- never actually very likely -- that more jazz would 
appear on "The Tonight Show" when Branford Marsalis joined Jay Leno to become 
music director in 1992 had already drifted away into the programming ether when 
the show celebrated its second anniversary in May. (Marsalis now is planning to 
take an extended hiatus in January to support a new album, which ironically may 
contain more hip-hop and rap than jazz.) Yet, curiously, jazz was popping up 
all over the place in TV commercials: a Coltrane-like soprano saxophone playing 
"My Favorite Things" in support of the Mitsubishi Galant; a Cadillac Seville ad 
that mentioned Wes Montgomery in its text (accompanied by a Montgomery-like 
underscore); a Benny Goodman quartet clone hyping the Saturn, and a flat-out 
Goodman big band-style version of "Sing, Sing, Sing" to sell Chips Ahoy. Maybe 
the network programmers should start taking lunches with the ad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio remained pretty much status quo. In Los Angeles, KLON, with its 
difficult transmission signal, was the only full-time game in town, although 
other public radio stations such as KPCC and KCRW came up with the occasional 
bright moment of special programming. (Marian McPartland's performance-oriented 
interviews with musicians on NPR is an especially fine example of the still 
largely unfulfilled possibilities of jazz radio.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, 1994 was a year which saw the passing of an all-star roster of jazz 
greats: guitarist Joe Pass, trumpeters Red Rodney and Shorty Rogers, 
saxophonist Bob Cooper, singer Carmen McRae, bossa nova godfather Antonio 
Carlos Jobim, drummer Connie Kay, composer/critic Leonard Feather, among too 
many others. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From a local perspective, employment prospects for L.A. jazzers did not 
improve. Like dozens of gifted musical associates, talented artists such as 
saxophonists Rickey Woodard, singer Stephanie Haynes, pianist Cecilia Coleman 
and multi-instrumentalist Ray Pizzi traded off high visibility in their chosen 
field for the joys of living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 A few new clubs came, a few old ones shut down. On the upside, the Jazz Bakery 
began to book major name acts. On the downside, the Bakery -- despite its 
attractive new venue and secure parking facilities -- was having difficulty 
selling enough tickets to fill the room. Catalina Bar & Grill, in the face of 
high artist fees and occasional slim audiences, continued to carry the banner 
for major artist appearances. It would be hard to even think of Los Angeles as 
a world-class jazz city without Catalina's year-round schedule of first-rate 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Stage and Fifth Street Dick's, on considerably smaller budgets, 
became equally important performance arenas, vital keystones in the structure 
of jazz in the Southland that are willing to risk taking chances with new ideas 
and new players. 
</P>
<P>
 The large venues continued to do well. The Playboy Jazz Festival at the 
Hollywood Bowl sold out once again, and venues ranging from the Greek Theatre 
and Ambassador Auditorium to the Cerritos and Orange County performing arts 
centers programmed jazz of one form or another in their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 But very few of the large venues programmed with the range, the vision and the 
sheer willingness to take chances that is apparent in the events scheduled for 
almost any given week in New York. Los Angeles may be a trend-setter in film, 
television, pop music and lifestyles, but not in the area of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1994, jazz in 1995 will very likely continue a long, slow dance to the 
future, unfolding in lingering, evolutionary fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 There don't appear to be, at the moment, any major innovators lurking in the 
wings. Instead, talented, still-evolving players such as Redman, McBride, Mark 
Whitfield, Geri Allen, Jacky Terrason and others will continue to expand the 
horizons of mainstream contemporary jazz. Their work already has established 
musical guidelines for the thousands of young players passing through expanding 
jazz education programs, and will impact the music that emerges for the balance 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz also will continue to interact with various other musics around the 
world. Expect to hear more examples of American jazz players performing with 
Middle Eastern rhythms, with Norwegian folk guitarists, with Japanese koto and 
shakuhachi players, and with Indian singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestically, many jazz players will continue to experiment in the 
hybridization of jazz rhythms with hip-hop, rap and dance music. Marsalis will 
tour with his eclectic group Buckshot Le Fonque, and Herbie Hancock's 
long-awaited new studio album -- a follow-up to his successful '80s fusion 
album, "Rockit" -- is due. (Another, quite different variation on stylistic 
fusion arrives in January with the first complete album of Stephen Sondheim 
tunes performed by an array of jazz musicians -- including Hancock.) 
</P>
<P>
 Local jazz players will continue to have to struggle to find audiences in the 
coming year , while the Kenny Gs and Grover Washingtons will play to sold-out 
houses at the large venues. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony, of course, is that the audiences seem to be there, willing and 
eager to hear jazz, but reluctant to take a chance on anything other than major 
names and familiar music. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the situation change in the coming year? Maybe. But only with better 
artist management, better publicity and promotion, more imaginative programming 
and, above all, more receptive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 And how can that happen? In a lot of ways. One would be for more producers to 
follow the lead of the Playboy Jazz Festival in reaching out to the community 
with a variety of satellite programs and free events as a supplement to the 
Hollywood Bowl concerts. How about Saturday afternoon jazz concerts at the Mark 
Taper Forum? And dirt cheap (or even free) tickets to music students to fill 
the middle of the week empty seats at places like the Jazz Bakery? 
</P>
<P>
 And there can be more. Bill Graham's Fillmore programs in the 1960s and 1970s 
mixed jazz acts with rock artists on the same bill. Why can't the Greek 
Theatre, the Universal Amphitheatre and the area's various arts centers do the 
same? Imagine Bobby Watson opening for Pearl Jam, or Mark Whitfield on the same 
bill with Bonnie Raitt. Endless possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But if an avid jazz fan had only one wish for the coming year, it would be for 
the arrival of the too long-delayed acknowledgment of jazz as what it really is 
-- America's true classical music, and the single most creative musical 
expression of the second half of the 20th Century. That alone would make 1995 a 
year to remember.
