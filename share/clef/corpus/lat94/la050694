 Introducing -- the East L.A. Warehouse of Fame!As the whole world surely 
knows, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce recently revealed that Metro Rail 
construction has necessitated the temporary removal of 450 stars from the Walk 
of Fame, including those of Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Barry Manilow. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprooted plaques will be stored in a warehouse in East L.A. "in a 
temperature-controlled atmosphere," spokeswoman Ana Martinez-Holler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stevens has an alternate suggestion. "We'll take 'em," said Stevens, the 
founder of the rival Fargo, N.D., Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In its five-year history, Fargo has laid out concrete slabs on 
semi-world-famous First Avenue North for 93 visiting luminaries including 
singer Garth Brooks, televangelist Robert Schuller and tulip-tiptoer Tiny Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got plenty of room for more," Stevens pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather keep them close to us," Martinez-Holler told Only in L.A., which 
gallantly acted as a go-between during Fargo's unsuccessful bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you say we'd promise to give them back?" Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 We knew we forgot something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Walk marches on: "We got phone calls from Japan and other countries asking 
whether we still have a Walk of Fame," Martinez-Holler said. "Of course we do. 
We have about 1,500 stars left. And we're putting 30 new ones in in June." 
</P>
<P>
 She revealed -- and this is an Only in L.A. exclusive -- that the uprooted 
stars of Presley and Monroe would not be going to the East L.A. Warehouse of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Honorary Mayor) Johnny Grant decided they'll be put in our new Gateway to 
Hollywood section (of the Walk of Fame)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans of other uprooted celebs were miffed, including a group of fans who 
clean Barry Manilow's star each month. Nevertheless, the singer's plaque is 
going into storage. His fans are coping. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us they'd clean Big Bird's star in the meantime," Martinez-Holler 
said. 
</P>

 Ah, the beauty of the English language: Radio station KLSX-FM is holding a May 
19-22 exhibit titled "The Poetry of Rock" -- and don't you dare call Poetry of 
Rock an oxymoron! On display will be handwritten autographed lyrics from 
"popular music's greatest" songs. We hope the station remembers to include 
these lyrical gems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Alley oop oop. Oop. Oop oop. Alley oop oop. Oop. Oop oop" (sung by the 
Hollywood Argyles). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "There she was justa walkin' down the street, singin' doo wah diddy diddy 
dum diddy do" (Manfred Mann). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Yummy yummy yummy. I've got love in my tummy" (Ohio Express). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "One-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people-eater -- sure looked good to 
me" (Sheb Wooley). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Papa oom mow mow. Papa oom mow mow." (The Rivingtons). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "That's the way, uh huh, uh huh, I like it" (KC and the Sunshine Band). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ain't got a mudder. Ain't got a fadder. I'm a lonely frog." (Frogman 
Henry). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Wooly bully. Wooly bully. Wooly bully" (Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Surfer Joe. Man, look at him go. Oh oh oh. Surfer, surfer surfer 
J-o-o-o-o-e" (Surfaris). 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, we give you The Kingsmen:  
</P>
<P>
 -- "Louie, Louie, me gotta go." LAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Dave Kenney came upon the enclosed business card, which reminded us of 
Surfer Joe's skin.

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR CALMS STOCKS, BONDS; MARKETS: ADMINISTRATION'S 
INTERVENTION IS A SUCCESS. THE DOW AVERAGE CLOSES DOWN 1.78 POINTS IN SUBDUED 
TRADING.

<P>
 The dollar extended its gains against most major currencies Thursday, and the 
sense of calm spread to the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the dollar's advance shows that the Clinton Administration had 
succeeded -- at least for now -- in its battle to rescue the battered currency. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 102.85 Japanese yen, up from 101.85 on 
Wednesday, and at 1.667 German marks, up from 1.654. The dollar also 
strengthened elsewhere in Europe on Thursday, a day after it surged worldwide 
on the U.S.-led support move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the central banks of 15 other nations 
intervened heavily in the U.S. and European markets Wednesday, buying up 
dollars. It was the largest coordinated intervention by the leading 
industrialized nations since August, 1992. The dollar's rapid decline against 
key currencies had aroused fears of inflation and capital flight from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we closed over certain levels (Wednesday), a lot of people changed 
sentiment," said Matt Porio, vice president for foreign exchange at Chase 
Manhattan Bank. "There's been such a bearish trend since February. This is the 
biggest sign of life for the dollar in two to three months." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said that economic fundamentals -- notably robust U.S. 
growth compared to sluggishness in Europe and Japan -- had not supported a weak 
dollar, and the intervention provided traders with an excuse to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
 A nation's currency tends to strengthen with economic growth, which helps 
raise the price of stocks, bonds and other assets and thus draws in capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks closed modestly lower in quiet trading as traders turned 
cautious ahead of today's closely watched jobs report for April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smartest thing anybody could say about this market is that it's looking 
for something to push it one way or another," said Richard Meyer, head equity 
trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.78 points to 3,695.97. On the New York 
Stock Exchange, declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on Big Board 
volume totaling 255.69 million shares, down from 267.9 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index managed to edge up 0.25 to 740.55, even though most 
small-capitalization stocks finished lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts expect today's report to show that unemployment remained 
steady at 6.5% and that non-farm payrolls rose by just under 200,000. If the 
report shows that more people than expected are working, it could be 
interpreted as potentially inflationary and drive bond and stock prices lower, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were supported through most of the session by a firmer bond market, 
where the 30-year Treasury yield finished unchanged from Wednesday's 7.33%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow had moved up more than 15 points early in the session, dipped backed 
to nearly unchanged, then recovered to post modest gains for most of the 
afternoon, until last-minute selling pushed it lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds rose early in the day in response to the dollar's strength and a Labor 
Department report saying first-time state unemployment claims rose by 17,000 
last week, much more than most economists had expected. Traders viewed the 
number as a positive harbinger for today's jobs report. A rise in joblessness 
could ease the market's fear of upward pressure on wages, a key component of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kmart led the action on the NYSE, falling 3/8 to 15 5/8 after reporting that 
sales in U.S. stores open at least a year slipped 3.2% in April. Gap, which 
fell 1 1/8 to 47 1/2, said same-store sales were unchanged while total sales 
rose 10%. Sears rose 1 1/4 to 47 5/8. Its same-store sales advanced 12.3% and 
overall sales rose 12.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilities stocks fell amid fears that another interest rate tightening by the 
Fed would raise operating costs for utility companies, which tend to borrow 
heavily in the capital markets for large-scale construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Electric Power finished down 7/8 at 3 1/2, Peoples Energy fell 7/8 
to 27 7/8 and FPL Group fell 2 1/8 to 31 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks rose amid mounting consensus that oil prices will remain steady. 
Atlantic Richfield rose 2 1/8 to 99 3/8. British Petroleum advanced 2 19/32 to 
71 15/32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance stocks rose amid sentiment that the downward pressure on premiums 
is easing. Aetna rose 1 to 53 7/8. Marsh & McLennan rose 2 to 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices were mixed in overseas trading. In London, the Financial Times 
100-share average climbed back above the psychological 3,100 level, closing up 
35.5 at 3,106, while Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average ended 13.18 points lower 
at 2,235.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng index climbed 43.44 points to 8,412.88 after 
trading lower for most of the day. It hit the year's intra-day low at 8,249.20 
in morning trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Mexican and Japanese markets were closed for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold prices fell on New York's Comex to $373.60 an ounce, off $3. 
Silver finished at $5.107 an ounce, down from $5.175 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee futures topped $1 a pound for the first time in more than 3 1/2 years 
on speculative buying ignited by tight supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a buying frenzy," said analyst Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Green coffee beans for May delivery surged 5.45 cents on New York's Coffee, 
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange to $1.002 a pound, the highest daily settlement for 
near-term deliveries since Sept. 5, 1990. The more actively traded July 
contract rose 4.95 cents to 99.85 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee futures have rallied 27.7 cents this year, or about 38%, as production 
and exports have dwindled due to nearly five years of low prices and poor 
growing weather in some producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have also been driven higher by an agreement among 28 producer 
countries to hold back up to 20% of normal exports. The countries began 
retaining shipments Oct. 1 but stopped last week when a 20-day moving price 
average reached 80 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Their agreement requires the producers to begin releasing the retained stocks 
when the indicator price reaches 85 cents. It stood at 82.83 cents Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil prices also rose strongly in reaction to the outbreak of civil war 
in Yemen and forecasts of higher demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, sweet crude oil for June delivery settled at $17.29 a barrel, up 43 
cents on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemen, which pumps about 350,000 barrels a day, was plunged into civil war 
Thursday between historically conservative northern Yemen and the socialist 
southern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil prices have slowly been recovering from five-year lows on 
expectations of higher demand and a decision by the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries to keep production steady.

NOWADAYS, MOST AMERICANS KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT A LATTE; TRENDS: IT STARTED IN THE 
PACIFIC NORTHWEST. TODAY BOUTIQUE ROASTERS ARE THRIVING NATIONWIDE.

 Americans are thirsty for a really good cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, more and more people are sipping gourmet coffees brewed 
from specialty beans from boutique roasters -- and paying a hefty premium for 
it, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has opened doors for companies like mine . . . to satisfy consumers who 
want to have a good cup of coffee," said Phil Johnson, president of Millstone 
Coffee Inc., a privately owned roaster in Everett, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., which has gourmet cafes around the 
country, many small roasters sell beans but not java by the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Those that do sell coffee by the cup, such as Heritage Coffee Co., a roaster 
and retailer in Juno, Alaska, tend to be regional businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Northwest, about half of all the coffee sold is of gourmet 
grade, but consumers in other parts of the country tend to buy their coffee in 
cans packed under the well-known brands and sold in supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gourmet coffee craze gets perking, experts say specialty beans will be 
available everywhere, from convenience stores to grocery stores, some of which 
will even provide do-it-yourself roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the expected growth, the gourmet coffee industry will not be spared 
taking a lump or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a considerable amount of consolidation in the industry," said 
Grady Saunders, president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America and 
president of Heritage Coffee. "Companies will merge and companies will be 
bought," he told an industry discussion group this week. 
</P>
<P>
 If local roasters' share of the $5-billion U.S. coffee market reaches a 
critical mass so that the major brands start to feel the pinch, the big 
companies are likely to respond aggressively with new products and may even 
lower prices, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the winners, from the company standpoint, in the (gourmet) category 
will be those who stick with the quality they started with and are not overly 
tainted by any pricing factors that come into the market," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if more consumers develop a taste for naturally decaffeinated 
hazelnut-flavored coffee from hand-picked Arabica beans, will there be enough 
to go around? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nugent, a senior vice president at Dean Witter who specializes in gourmet 
coffee, said roasters will have to integrate vertically -- invest in coffee 
plantations and mills -- to ensure steady supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 If demand for gourmet coffee continues to rise, experts say, the beneficiaries 
will be the producers, who recently have seen prices drop dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have producers who have in the past few years been in a very difficult 
situation," said Tom Kilty, executive vice president of M.P. Mountanos Inc., a 
coffee broker. "Now they're seeing a market in the U.S. and other countries 
where consumers are wanting and appreciating a better-quality cup of coffee."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SALT-N-PEPA SURE KNOW HOW TO SPICE THINGS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "This is girls' night out!" proclaimed premier female rappers Salt-N-Pepa 
early in their Greek Theatre show on Wednesday, leaving no doubt about who they 
consider their core constituency, and adding as a word to the wise: "You might 
want to send your fella out to get a drink, 'cause I'm telling you, the guys 
ain't gonna like this part of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't bluffing, either, these platinum-selling single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The following minutes brought a fusillade of warnings and encouragements. 
"Ladies, don't be lettin' no man put his hold on you, 'cause it only gets 
worse! I know!" warned Sandy (Pepa) Denton. "You gotta let them know that no 
means no!" said Cheryl (Salt) James. "You can be happy by yourself! Let God be 
your man!" exhorted De De (Spinderella) Roper. 
</P>
<P>
 This in itself might qualify as fairly subversive, given that this was a 
couples-oriented crowd and not a feminist rally. But what came next was really 
interesting: a ritual humiliation of the show's three male dancers, made to get 
on their knees and endure a mimed whipping. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for peeing on the toilet seat!" said whip-wielding Pepa. Snap. "That's 
for who be calling and hanging up!" Lash. "That's for my 36 hours of labor 
pains!" Crack.  
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that when Salt-N-Pepa later invited three men up onto the stage to 
be seductively teased and straddled during the trio's latest hit, "Whatta Man," 
the poor guys looked vaguely terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 So do we count this as bona fide empowerment in the unlikeliest of date-night 
settings, or puerile pandering to the homegirls? 
</P>
<P>
 Isolated, lines like the toilet seat one might seem redolent of too many 
female comics, and the pretend lashing might recall all the times Madonna has 
whupped her boy-toy dancers on stage. But in the broader context Salt-N-Pepa 
aren't really playing this shtick for laughs, and definitely not -- unlike 
Madonna -- for naughty S&M allusions. They're serious about the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 But not angry. The threesome manages to touch on touchy gender politics like 
few other performers in the vicinity of the Top 10 and come out as one of pop's 
most invitingly playful acts at the same time, even the fellas banished to the 
beer line might agree. 
</P>
<P>
 They're smart enough to balance the carping with celebration, and to provide 
"Whatta Man" as a "props"-offering, pro-guy tonic to what might have seemed a 
predictable stridence in their female independence anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Salt-N-Pepa have been through a severe make-over -- they've trimmed 
down and toned up some of the best abs in the business after all three had 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Their image as increasingly self-made women is bolstered by the fact that 
they've gotten far better at being able to offer the goods live, growing from a 
so-so novelty act into being Hammer's logical successor as the chief pop/rap 
crossover act. Backed by recorded tracks, and occasionally the old-style 
record-scratching of Spinderella and her deejay cohort Kid Capri, the three 
delivered flawlessly rhythmic patter with the charm of tomboy glam-girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Also making this unquestionably "ladies' night" was co-headliner R. Kelly, who 
simply oozed sexuality through every R&B song in his hourlong set. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, whose "Bump and Grind" recently topped the national singles chart, 
relied more on sex shtick -- with his look-alike brother joining him, he was 
like the Patty Duke of soft-core porn rappers -- than on his own considerable 
vocal talents. These chops did eventually get a workout when Kelly broke risque 
form and performed an extended, gospel-style ode to his late mother. That 
climaxed with a gigantic framed portrait of Mrs. Kelly lowering onto the stage, 
her overcome son finally collapsing in apparent anguish beneath the heavenly 
visage. Bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's shaved pate did make for a striking visual: As the cool night air lit 
upon his profuse perspiration, it seemed -- in the right spotlight -- as if his 
entire head were severely smoldering. Now that's a special effect.

MOVIE REVIEW; RARE 'ENTERTAINMENT!'; LATEST MGM COMPILATION SHOWS HOW GREAT THE 
GRAND DAYS WERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "That's Entertainment! III" is the sunniest of memento mori , a showy tribute 
to the flabbergasting musicals of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that emphasizes both how 
delightful the genre was and how inescapably extinct it's become. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the visibility of Westerns and science-fiction movies fluctuates 
according to popular taste, it's doubtful we'll ever see anything like the 
flood of musicals that characterized MGM in its grandest days. It's not only 
the money they cost, it's how time-intensive these films were to make, and how 
much they depended on the army of support personnel only a literal principality 
like Metro could afford to keep on call. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Roman numerals conveniently indicate, this is the third "That's 
Entertainment!" musical compilation, and though it contains some familiar 
chestnuts like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland blasting a peppy "Good Morning" 
from "Babes in Arms," it benefits from the extra work Bud Friedgen and Michael 
J. Sheridan had to do in order to avoid the usual suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors on the first two films and producer-writer-directors and editors here, 
Friedgen and Sheridan have spent at least part of the 18 years since Part Two 
was released methodically investigating the considerable material in the MGM 
vaults, and what they have unearthed is dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
 Most obvious are the obscure musical items that fans know well but that most 
audiences may not because the films they come from are less familiar. 
Energetic, enthusiastic numbers such as Cyd Charisse's boxing-oriented "Baby, 
You Knock Me Out" from "It's Always Fair Weather" or Ricardo Montalban, Ann 
Miller and Charisse throwing themselves into "Dance of Fury" from "The Kissing 
Bandit." 
</P>
<P>
 Also utilized is irresistible behind-the-scenes material, for instance an 
in-house film that shows just how complex the logistics were when Eleanor 
Powell danced from stage to stage in the celebrated "Fascinatin' Rhythm" number 
from "Lady Be Good." New technology has also been put to use, with Fred Astaire 
and Ginger Rogers dancing the swing trot from their last film together, "The 
Barkleys of Broadway," now visible without the opening credits that previously 
obscured their footwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, however, are the outtakes, numbers completely filmed but cut from 
the final version, often shown here in split screen with unexpected results. On 
view, for instance, are the India Adams-dubbed Joan Crawford and Cyd Charisse 
each doing "Two Faced Woman," the former used in "Torch Song," the latter cut 
from "The Band Wagon," decisions unfortunate on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Garland, the icon of the MGM musical, gets special attention here. 
Friedgen and Sheridan have discovered not only "March of the Doagies," an 
elaborate sequence cut from "The Harvey Girls," but also "Mr. Monotony," 
Garland's first use of her trademark half-tuxedo and cut from "Easter Parade," 
and, strangest of all, "I'm an Indian Too," a politically incorrect number 
Garland filmed for "Annie Get Your Gun" before temperament problems led her to 
be dropped in favor of Betty Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 Though these clips can't and don't miss, another aspect of "That's 
Entertainment! III" is more problematical, and that, paralleling the first two 
films, is its use of nine different MGM stars to introduce the individual 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these situations are unobjectionable, for instance, having a relaxed 
Esther Williams revisit her trademark saucer pool and talk us through a 
selection of clips from her surreal water ballets. And having Lena Horne speak 
frankly about the frustration of being a showstopping African American 
performer the studio didn't know what to do with is a welcome dose of 
levelheadedness. Most of the talk from most of the performers, however, is 
laden with "I loved every minute of it" banalities that do nothing but detract 
from the magic on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to put it gently, no amount of magic, both movie and otherwise, can make 
these stars look as youthful as they did 18 and 20 years ago, let alone in 
their primes, and to compare a weakened Gene Kelly with the lithe athlete who 
danced with a newspaper and a squeaky floor in "Summer Stock" is a melancholy 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, seeing visible signs of aging does add a kind of unforeseen 
poignancy to "That's Entertainment! III," a reminder of how completely these 
performers have moved off screen and what an irreplaceable vacuum their absence 
has left in our moviegoing lives. The tagline for the original "That's 
Entertainment!" turns out to be even more sadly apropos today: "Boy, Do We Need 
It Now!" 
</P>

 Looking at the World: National Geographic's acclaimed hourlong documentary 
specials -- which have aired on PBS for 20 years -- will return to network TV 
in January with five prime-time shows a year on NBC. Meanwhile, PBS, which 
previously presented four one-hour shows each year, will switch to longer 
National Geographic productions, tentatively titled "National Geographic 
Horizons." Two programs will air in the 1994-95 season -- "China Beyond the 
Clouds," a four-hour film about the people of southwestern China, and "The 
Great Indian Railway," a two-hour show illuminating that nation's rich cultural 
and geographic diversity. POP/ROCK

 House Rap Hearing Held: The recording industry fought against a rating system 
for rap lyrics on Thursday, telling a House subcommittee in Washington that a 
voluntary advisory label already alerts parents to lyrics emphasizing sex, 
violence or drugs. "Virtually every recording that has been the target of 
public controversy . . . has a voluntary parental advisory on its cover," 
Recording Industry Assn. of America president Hilary Rosen told the Energy and 
Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.) 
called for the hearings to debate the effects of the violent, anti-women theme 
of many rap recordings. Thursday's session followed a similar February hearing, 
which Collins said had made the recording industry more willing to help and 
made more women express their dislike of derogatory references in rap lyrics. 
Lawmakers have said they don't want to censor rap, but they question whether 
the current voluntary warning labels -- which read "Parental Advisory: Explicit 
Lyrics" -- are sufficient. PEOPLE WATCH

 Togetherness: Hoping to dispel lingering rumors about trouble in their 
marriage, Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford have taken out a full-page ad in 
today's Times of London that reportedly proclaims "reports of a divorce are 
totally false" and "we look forward to having a family." The couple's 
spokeswoman said that the ad, which blames rumors of their split on a French 
tabloid, would run only in the London newspaper. She refused to discuss its 
content, however, except to say that it is a "very carefully worded statement" 
and that the couple wants it to "stand on its own." THE ARTS

 Slow Auction Start: The annual art auction season got off to a shaky start in 
New York this week, with several top lots at both Christie's and Sotheby's 
failing to find buyers. Sotheby's had the better response, ringing up more than 
$20 million in a Wednesday night sale that set a record for artist David Smith, 
whose large stainless steel sculpture "Cubi V" went for $4 million, twice the 
pre-sale estimate. But the evening's total take was still $10 million below the 
presale estimate, and 18 of the 63 works offered didn't sell, including a 
Jasper Johns painting that was expected to bring $7.5 million. At rival auction 
house Christie's, a disappointing Tuesday night sale brought in just $12.5 
million ($19 million-$25 million had been expected), with only 44 of 76 lots 
sold. The night's top seller was a Jackson Pollock that fetched $1.76 million 
-- well below the $2 million-$3 million presale estimate. MOVIES

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' VIDEO SELLING LIKE WILDFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 FoxVideo underestimated "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the company shipped 8 million cassettes of the Robin Williams 
comedy to video stores, but that wasn't nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out that we need 10 million and the total may wind up at 12 
million," says Bruce Pfander, FoxVideo's senior vice president of marketing. 
"This all took us somewhat by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Now FoxVideo is scrambling to keep up with the unexpected demand. How did the 
miscalculation happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem apparently stemmed from the fact that there were still a 
lot of people wanting to see it for the first time; the film was still showing 
in some theaters when it debuted on video last week. "They went to the video 
store instead," Pfander said. "This situation doesn't happen often in the 
business, so it's hard to gauge." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the relatively inexpensive price helped attract extra hordes of 
customers. Normally a movie like this would sell for $25 and be discounted to 
$16-$18 in many places. But "Mrs. Doubtfire" is priced at $20 and therefore 
available in the $13-$14 range.  
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo's biggest fear is shortages in the next two weeks -- people showing 
up at stores only to find that the tape is out of stock. "These next two 
weekends are crucial," Pfander said. "In the sales market, you normally get 85% 
of your sales in the first four to six weeks. If a store is out of stock, some 
people may not come back." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 June 29 will be one of the biggest days of the year on home video. Three major 
movies come out in time for the July 4 weekend: Columbia TriStar's 
"Philadelphia," starring Tom Hanks in his Oscar-winning role and Denzel 
Washington; Warner's "The Pelican Brief," starring Washington and Julia 
Roberts, and MCA/Universal's "In the Name of the Father," a nominee for the 
best picture Oscar.  
</P>
<P>
 When Disney recently announced that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" will be 
released Oct. 28, the big surprise was the price -- $27, about $2 higher than 
most movies geared to the sales market. There will be a rebate, though, through 
a promotional tie-in, which should help defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers knew that "Snow White" would be out before Christmas but 
everyone was curious about how far away it would be from the Oct. 4 "Jurassic 
Park" release date. By the time "Snow White" is out, the furor over 
MCA/Universal's "Jurassic" will have died down somewhat.

<P>
 What's New On Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "A Perfect World" (Warner): Many Kevin Costner fans steered clear of this 
drama because their idol, usually the glamorous hero, plays a loser -- a 
blue-collar convict on the run. Tracked by a Texas Ranger (Clint Eastwood, who 
also directed) and a criminologist (Laura Dern), the fugitive bonds with his 
hostage -- an 8-year-old boy (T.J. Lowther).  
</P>
<P>
 "The Remains of the Day" (Columbia TriStar): A melancholy tale of the 
consequences of emotional repression. In 1930s England, a staid butler (Anthony 
Hopkins) stoically stifles his feelings about his naive pro-Nazi employer 
(James Fox) and an appealing housekeeper (Emma Thompson). Garnered a passel of 
Oscar nominations, including best picture, actor and actress -- all 
well-deserved.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby in Paradise" (Republic): Searching for a new life, young Ruby (Ashley 
Judd) heads for "paradise" -- a cozy Florida town -- and winds up as a trinkets 
saleswoman who gets involved with two very different men. It's a modest, decent 
film with a terrific performance by Judd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" (Warner): Based on the TV cartoon series, this 
animated feature plays better on the small screen because of its simplistic 
TV-style animation. It nicely captures the dark, eerie spirit of the Batman 
myth and features an exciting finale. Adults can enjoy it along with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernest Rides Again" (Monarch): Parents would love to see Ernest (Jim Varney) 
ride off into the sunset forever but he just won't go away. Kids love this 
lovable moron because he's an overgrown kid himself. In this adventure he finds 
some jewels and is chased around by both cops and crooks. As idiotic as the 
others in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 "Addams Family Values," "The Three Musketeers," "Orlando" and "Into the West" 
(Wednesday); "A Dangerous Woman," "RoboCop 3" and "Look Who's Talking Now" (May 
18); "The Return of Jafar" (May 20); "The Piano" and "Rudy" (May 25); "Short 
Cuts" (June 1); "Wayne's World 2" and "My Life" (June 8); "Ace Ventura, Pet 
Detective" (June 14); "The Getaway" and "The Air Up There" (June 15); "Six 
Degrees of Separation," "Geronimo: An American Legend" and "Tombstone" (June

MOVIE REVIEW; 2,000 YEARS OF 'BEING' GO AWRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a film like "Being Human," there is no point belaboring the obvious. 
Misconceived, misguided and a completely miserable viewing experience, this is 
one to avoid at all costs and for all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that it stars Robin Williams, was produced by David Puttnam and directed 
by Bill Forsyth, the fact that "Being Human" appeared in theaters with little 
advance warning or publicity was not the best of signs. Still, no one could 
have predicted what a colossus of tedium it turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams stars as a character named Hector, an Everyman type who is shown 
trying to muddle through life as best he can in five different epochs in 
history. There is a modern story, one set in the Bronze Age, one involving a 
Roman slave, another showing a soldier returning from the Crusades and a final 
episode about a Portuguese nobleman shipwrecked in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to convey how unconvincing in every respect each of these 
tales are, how ineptly they relate to one another and how little they add up 
to. In fact, apart from the vague notion that human beings are fond of love and 
emotional connection, it is hard to tell exactly what this film is trying to 
convey. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director Forsythe, so adept when dealing with his native Scotland in 
films like "Gregory's Girl" and "Local Hero," has fearfully overreached himself 
in attempting to portray 2,000 years of human history. None of the cast, not 
even John Turturro, can survive its bathetic qualities, and poor Robin Williams 
can do no more than look increasingly worried as the film goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the single most irritating aspect of "Being Human" is its nauseating, 
insufferably coy voice-over narration, read by Theresa Russell sounding like 
Cybill Shepherd. Devoid of energy and wit, the only purpose this film serves is 
making every other failed film you've seen this year look much better by 
comparison. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SLATE'S' REACH EXCEEDS GRASP BUT HAS SOME GOOD LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 "Clean Slate" might seem even funnier if its premise wasn't so good. As it is, 
you keep comparing what it is with what it could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's about an L.A. cop-turned-gumshoe, Maurice Pogue (Dana Carvey), who 
suffers from a rare form of amnesia that wipes out his memory every time he 
falls asleep. He wakes up with no idea who he is or what happened the day 
before. Worse, he's about to appear as the key witness against a mobster in a 
murder case -- but he can't remember the mobster or the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The film begins with Pogue's terrier scooting across his porch and butting 
head first into a wall. The dog, you see, has a depth perception problem. (He 
wears an eye-patch.) 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it looks as if "Clean Slate" is going to be one of those movies 
where the dog steals the show, particularly since no one else in the film seems 
to be performing up to the dog's level. (His real name is Barkley and, 
according to the press kit, he's "equally adept at comedy and drama.") 
</P>
<P>
 Things perk up a bit when the plot finally kicks in. The premise takes too 
long to establish, though. It's as if director Mick Jackson and screenwriter 
Robert King suffered from a form of amnesia themselves; they keep recapping 
stuff they've already established. They also milk jokes that weren't all that 
funny to begin with, like the mural artist who keeps effacing his rendition of 
"Mona Lisa" because Pogue doesn't recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Carvey would seem to be well-cast in the role of a man without an identity of 
his own. After all, Carvey's specialty on "Saturday Night Live" was 
impersonations. But gifted mimics, when they're called upon to create something 
closer to themselves, often blank out. (There's no there there.) Carvey is much 
better here than he was in his last leading man outing, "Opportunity Knocks," 
but he still seems weightless and wan. He's best when he plays around with his 
own wispiness instead of just being wispy. Some of his deadpan befuddlements 
are right on the mark. He has the look of a man who is patiently, dedicatedly 
trying to rejigger his memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent supporting cast have a few inspired moments. Michael Gambon's 
mobster is a gelatinous dandy who regards Pogue as an annoying riddle. Michael 
Murphy, as Pogue's doctor, seems to enjoy his patient's quandaries; he's like a 
sadistic Oliver Sacks. Valeria Golina, playing Pogue's girlfriend (sort of), 
has a cushy comic sense. Rumbly-voiced James Earl Jones plays a district 
attorney named, appropriately, Dolby. Kevin Pollak is Pogue's assistant D.A. 
best friend who can't assimilate the hilariously obvious evidence that Pogue is 
having an affair with his fiancee. Pollak and Carvey get a real comic tempo 
ticking in some of their scenes: Pollak is like a revue-sketch Othello to 
Carvey's Stan Laurel-ish Iago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson attempts to jack up the high jinks with lots of quick cutting and 
swervy camera moves. Some of it works, some of it just seems like desperation. 
He works in doodly little references to "Groundhog Day" as well as "The 39 
Steps," "The Big Sleep" and many other mystery thrillers; there's even what 
appears to be a plug for "That's Entertainment! III" -- also an MGM production. 
(A bodyguard watches clips from it on TV while Pogue sweats it out in a locked 
sauna.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean Slate" is the kind of movie where just about everybody involved seems 
to be working below their best level. But glints of their best stuff comes 
through anyway, which makes this comedy about amnesia almost worth remembering. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; ALMODOVAR'S 'KIKA': FREEWHEELING PARABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the title role of "Kika," Pedro Almodovar's latest darkly outrageous attack 
on propriety, Veronica Forque emerges as an adorable innocent, as giddy as 
Geena Davis in "Thelma & Louise" but as buoyant as a rubber duck in a bathtub. 
She's sweet, sex-loving and kind, but it's her naivete that protects her like a 
suit of armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Had not Almodovar seriously overplayed his hand by stretching out a clever and 
ironic finish interminably, "Kika," which needs to lose at least 10 minutes, 
might well have been his most substantial picture since "Women on the Verge of 
a Nervous Breakdown." As it is, "Kika" most likely will please primarily only 
die-hard Almodovar fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kika can use all the protection she can get. A Madrid makeup artist, she's 
involved with Ramon (Alex Casanovas), a commercial photographer and collage 
artist who feels compelled to photograph himself making love to Kika; this is 
surely the sequence that originally pulled down an NC-17 rating (it's now 
unrated). Since Ramon, who worships the memory of his mother, an apparent 
suicide, is so kinky, Kika is also involved with his stepfather, Nicholas 
(Peter Coyote), an American writer and ardent womanizer (who's much like the 
character Coyote plays in Roman Polanski's "Bitter Moon"). 
</P>
<P>
 One of Nicholas' discarded lovers calls herself Andrea Scarface (Victoria 
Abril) -- she had scarred her face in a crazed attempt to hold on to Nicholas 
-- and stars in a tabloid TV show, dressed in Jean Paul Gaultier futuristic 
garb, that makes Geraldo Rivera seem like Mary Worth. Kika, in turn, has a 
lesbian housekeeper, Juana (Rossy de Palma, an Almodovar regular, a comedian 
with a regal hatchet nose) who's mad for her and whose brother Pablo (Santiago 
Lajusticia) is an escaped convict, a rapist and ex-porn star (who also makes 
love to his sister). 
</P>
<P>
 As Almodovar catches up all these individuals -- and others -- in a 
freewheeling farce plot, he creates a contemporary parable on violence that's 
become so random and sex so bizarre that both have lost meaning; he perceives 
the relationship between sex and violence as constantly evolving and 
treacherously complex. Although Almodovar can actually get a laugh from a rape 
scene, he's seriously concerned with an increasingly perilous and arid world in 
which people tend to connect destructively if they connect at all.

<P>
 Almodovar's exuberant style remains intact; he's one director who's intensely 
verbal yet always keeps his films moving, always inspiring trust in his actors 
to cast away virtually all their inhibitions. They in turn reward him with 
terrific comic portrayals. "Kika," which has Almodovar's characteristic high 
gloss, may not be a vintage film but it's nevertheless indelibly idiosyncratic. 
Nobody but Pedro Almodovar could have made it.

MOVIE REVIEW; KAZAN'S 'DREAM LOVER': A HARROWING LITTLE THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Reardon (James Spader) is an upscale architect, just divorced, who appears 
to be leading the perfect life. He's highly successful, handsome, smart and on 
the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he encounters a woman who is so eminently his "type" -- moody and darkly 
attractive -- that he's hooked. Lena (Madchen Amick) is alternately blunt and 
full of ah-sweet-mystery airs, and Ray spends most of his courtship in a state 
of deep ga-ga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream Lover," the first feature directed by the talented screenwriter 
Nicholas Kazan, is about how Ray is drawn into a marriage with a woman he 
realizes, to his horror, he doesn't even begin to know. Although Kazan draws on 
the femme fatale conventions of film noir, he's trying to tap a wider range of 
meanings. At its best, the film plays like a shadow play on the themes of 
marriage and fidelity -- on the limits of really knowing the person you share 
your life with. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tricky, harrowing little film. Kazan keeps things fairly schematic -- 
every plot point is secured, every look is "knowing" -- but the overall effect 
is ambiguously unsettling. Most of the movie is taken up with how Ray slowly -- 
incrementally -- learns and then unlearns practically everything he knows about 
his wife's past (and present). The suffocation of their burnished, perfectly 
appointed life is made even more suffocating by the up-close specimen-like way 
Kazan frames the couple. He keeps a microscopic eye on their torments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sick jokes played out in "Dream Lover" is that the characters' 
worst fears get realized again and again. Kazan is a sophisticated sadist; he 
sets up situations with multiple escape routes and then closes off all the 
exits. And even though you recognize what is happening before Ray does, the 
dread is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray isn't a bad guy, and he's on the receiving end of most of the anguish. But 
Kazan doesn't give all his sympathy to him. There's something too buffed and 
yuppie-ish about Ray. Ray is so smoothly narcissistic that, despite his 
decency, you almost want to see him brought down -- his frictionless good 
fortune is an indignity. Despite Kazan's sophistication, there's a narrow, 
moralistic edge to his approach. (The classic Hollywood film noirs from the 
'40s and '50s, once you cleared away the drizzle and the fog, often thumped for 
"traditional" values too.) Ray is drawn to Lena primarily because of her "look" 
and he must be punished for his superficiality. Even though Lena, too, is drawn 
to Ray, the film seems more concerned with Ray's defects -- and redemption. 
Spader can't provide all the emotional levels the part requires -- beneath all 
those burnished surfaces of his are still more surfaces. We're periodically 
shown Ray's nightmares -- he dreams he's in a circus -- and we can't connect up 
the imagery to the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Madchen Amick, however, is a real find. In her first full-scale film role, she 
manages to give Lena's surface blankness some depth. Lena has a way of looking 
both vague and fixated. It's the look of someone who is constantly reinventing 
herself.  
</P>
<P>
 Kazan recoils from her but coddles her too. He understands that Lena is too 
fragrant a monster to squash. 
</P>
<P>

includes brief nudity and violence.

RESTAURANTS; A TASTE OF MEXICO CITY IN LOS FELIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico City may be the name, but this newly opened Los Feliz Village cousin of 
Mexica is not your usual Mexican restaurant -- for one thing, it has the mildly 
stark and edgy atmosphere of a diner in an Edward Hopper painting. The 
commodious red booths house blond wood tables, and the walls are the matte, 
tamped-down orange of an ancho chile sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Add a casual, neighborhood clientele, and this is all plenty attractive, but I 
do have a couple of complaints about Mexico City, mostly having to do with the 
service. The personable waiters always ask you whether you want corn or flour 
tortillas when you order, but we found that half the time they didn't bring us 
tortillas of any description, and when they did, it was only after we reminded 
them. And just try to catch their attention to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The food, though, is mostly a pleasure. The menu virtually duplicates 
Mexica's, meaning that it's interesting and large enough that you'll still have 
new things to try even after numerous visits.  
</P>
<P>
 When you're seated, thick corn chips arrive with two salsas, a fresh salsa 
Mexicana (so named because tomatoes, onions and green chiles provide the three 
colors of the Mexican flag) and a smokier, hotter, dark puree. It's made of 
essentially the same ingredients as the fresh salsa, but owner Sylvia Solis 
says they have been broasted on the grill, so the onions are browned and the 
chile seeds have released their more volatile oils. 
</P>
<P>
 The quesadillas will be a surprise if you're only familiar with the kind 
served in Los Angeles restaurants, made with flour tortillas and cheese. Mexico 
City does serve that sort, but it calls them nortena quesadillas, and they're a 
platillo fuerte or entree, rather than an appetizer. The name nortena refers, 
of course, to Northern Mexico, where wheat is more common than elsewhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizer quesadillas, however, are the Central Mexican variety, made from 
fried cornmeal masa -- they look like fat little yellow turnovers. There are 
six varieties, with fillings ranging from chicken to mushrooms, and only two 
contain cheese at all. So basically, if it's melted cheese you're after in an 
appetizer, get the queso fundido con chorizo (melted cheese and sausage served 
in a cunning little frying pan) or the nachos with beans and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopes are little cups made from the same chewy masa as the quesadillas. The 
ones I tried, filled with potatoes, chorizo sausage and cheese, turned out 
surprisingly bland. The crab cakes -- not the American kind, but crunchy 
deep-fried masa envelopes filled with very lightly seasoned, and not terribly 
crabby, meat -- were bland too, despite a hot tomatillo sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Another warning is in order for the green corn tamales, which have no filling; 
they're a sort of steamed corn bread, and terribly sweet. Speaking of green, 
though, all the salads are fresh, juicy and judiciously dressed.  
</P>
<P>
 One entree not on the Mexica menu is the glorious pollo en menta , half a 
chicken marinated in mint, baked, then dusted with ground chile de arbol and 
crisped under the broiler before serving. My portion was over-done, but the 
flavors were so resonant, the skin so crisp, I scarcely cared. The accompanying 
charro beans were also awesome.  
</P>
<P>
 Another beautiful and enormous plate of food is the carne asada Tampiquena : 
small slabs of grilled, marinated beef, refried beans, rice, a green enchilada, 
guacamole and chile strips. With all these taco possibilities, though, one 
really misses those tortillas.  
</P>
<P>
 Seafood is also well handled here. There are clean, crunchy-fresh shrimp in a 
buttery garlic haze called mojo de ajo . Camarones enchipotlados are those same 
fresh shrimp in a sauce of bright tomatillos and subtly smoky chipotle chiles. 
A friend has cautiously declared the red snapper Veracruzana among the best 
he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a cold, firm flan for dessert, and crepas de cajeta , little crepes 
filled with a dark, slightly sandy, caramelized milk custard with a little halo 
of pure butter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Mexico City is only open for dinner. But the marquee out front 
says it's also open for lunch, and there are rumors that this will soon be 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico City, 2121 Hillhurst Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 661-7227. Open for 
dinner daily. Parking lot. Full bar. Visa, Master Card and American Express 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $24 to $56.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MR. WRITE': A PLAYWRIGHT FALLS IN LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mr. Write," unfortunately, is "Mr. Wrong," a stale, labored romantic comedy 
all too obviously adapted from a play that is at best fodder for whatever is 
left of the summer-stock circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Reiser stars as a nebbishy struggling playwright who grabs an acting gig 
for a candy commercial and winds up falling hard for the beautiful woman 
(Jessica Tuck) who wrote it.He thinks her material is as rotten as everybody 
thinks his play is, but she's the daughter of the candy company's owner (Martin 
Mull). 
</P>
<P>
 Howard J. Morris' adaptation of his own play is such sub-Woody Allen material 
that it's too much to expect Reiser to rise above it. Yet Charlie Loventhal's 
direction is so clearly committed, so determinedly energetic, that at least 
Tuck, Mull, Tom Wilson as Reiser's glib roommate and Tom Wilson as Tuck's hunky 
but dense fiance actually are able to make favorable impressions despite the 
circumstances. 
</P>

sexual innuendo and situations. 'Mr. Write'

MUSIC REVIEW; THE MOST HUMANE MIKADO TELLS SOME TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Adams, who brought his one-man show to Ambassador Auditorium on 
Wednesday, does not give conventional song recitals. That seems natural. He 
hasn't exactly had a conventional career. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been, and remains, an extraordinary career -- a career notable for 
its variety and invention, its invariable success, its unfailing integrity, its 
good luck and, yes, its longevity. Adams is the very model of a modern major 
basso-sometimes-buffo. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born, quintessentially British, in Bristol in 1928. His formative years 
involved choir duty at Worcester Cathedral, modest service as a military 
Pooh-Bah and acting in the backwoods of Thespis. His life changed for the first 
time when he joined the chorus of Englishmen (no French or Turks or Proosians) 
at the D'Oyly Carte Opera, then still a sacred bastion of Gilbert and Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he found himself redefining traditions as an irresistible Pirate King who 
resembled a blustering puppy, as a booming Mikado whose bloodthirsty cackle 
suggested nothing more distressing than mild indigestion, and as a Dick Deadeye 
whose triangularity was more to be censured than pitied. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the sinking D'Oyly Carte ship in 1969, but continued with his own 
Savoyard adventures until the fateful year of 1983. Then, at an age when others 
might contemplate a dignified retirement, Adams fell into a new career. He 
began his second life singing what passes these days for grand opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Major international houses wanted him for comic duties in Rossini and Mozart. 
Some gave him serious work, too, in masterpieces of Verdi, Britten and Janacek. 
He even attempted the massive Teutonic- profondo challenge of Baron Ochs in 
"Der Rosenkavalier" for Wales in 1990 (the critic Elizabeth Forbes found him 
"magnificent" as the lovable old scoundrel). 
</P>
<P>
 He is surely the only basso in history to have mastered the mock-horrors of 
"Ruddigore" and also mustered the genuine horrors of "Lulu." He expresses 
pleasure that stops short of delirium, however, when recalling his encounter 
with Berg's schleimy Schigolch. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ambassador recital was a sentimental occasion, more a cheerful reunion 
with old friends than a formal survey of art songs and arias. Adams set his own 
standards -- lofty, to be sure -- and met them with equal parts charm, 
savoir-faire and old-fashioned showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He maneuvered snazzy entrances and exits, musical accompaniment courtesy of 
his stylish pianist, Theodore Crain. Without benefit of microphone, he told 
tales on himself ("Ladies and gentleman, tonight I have chosen a very dull 
subject." Pregnant pause. "Me."). He executed some artless little dances. He 
cracked jokes, mostly dry. He gesticulated, grimaced, pranced, beamed and 
froze, as the vehicle at hand demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sang, with booming, wide-ranging tones that have lost virtually 
nothing over the decades. He offered object lessons in textual projection, even 
when the language didn't happen to be English. With no costumes and no props 
(well, hardly any), he defined instant characterizations, no two alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sampling his regular collection of greatest hits, Adams offered 
a few surprises. He simulated a fine Handelian trill by shaking his noble 
jowls. During a nice old music-hall ditty, he transformed himself into an 
amnesiac elephant, the best trick of its kind since Zero Mostel became a 
rhinoceros. He sang folk songs without resorting to phony folksiness. He 
managed to bring uncondescending pathos to a couple of spirituals, without 
dropping his British accent. 
</P>
<P>
 In trademark G&S territory, he offered the Mikado's song, still definitive, 
and neatly embellished with a flourishing fan. He added excerpts from 
"Pinafore," "The Pirates of Penzance," "Iolanthe," "Princess Ida," "Ruddigore" 
and "Gondoliers." He confessed special fondness for the last-named because it 
wasn't part of his repertory during his D'Oyly Carte years. "Whenever they did 
'Gondoliers,' " he recalled, "I had the night off. It became my favorite 
opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Before sending the crowd home with the quaintly serious Victorianism of "The 
Lost Chord" (nice pianissimo, nice legato), he showed what he can do with the 
Italianate patter of both Mozart's and Rossini's Bartolo. He can do quite a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, Baron Ochs. Please.

DANCE REVIEW; SOLYMOSI AND BENJAMIN PAIR IN SECOND 'MAYERLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second Royal Ballet "Mayerling" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center paired Hungarian firebrand Zoltan Solymosi with Australian lyric paragon 
Leanne Benjamin in the leading roles of the doomed lovers Crown Prince Rudolf 
and Mary Vetsera. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, with superbly expressive hands, Solymosi threw himself into the 
gymnastic partnering challenges on Wednesday with great daring, although he 
couldn't always make these passages appear an expression of character.His 
acting tended to ricochet from one effect to another -- with puzzling shifts in 
and out of drunkenness, for example, during the tavern scene. But Solymosi's 
best moments as Rudolf -- the scene with his mother, his yearning for Mary -- 
proved very impressive indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny, with enormous eyes, Benjamin never seemed to have more than a schoolgirl 
crush on her partner, so this Mary became more of a victim than a collaborator 
in their final murder-suicide. However, Benjamin's dancing remained exemplary 
in its pliancy, lightness, drive and line. 
</P>
<P>
 In other new casting Wednesday, Deborah Bull made Mitzi Caspar a high-class 
prostitute indeed -- far more elegant, in fact, than Fiona Chadwick's 
flagrantly cheap Countess Larisch. (Chadwick had played Mitzi in the Tuesday 
performance.) Both artists danced strongly but Elizabeth McGorian outclassed 
them with a complex, restrained, highly sympathetic portrayal of the Empress. 
</P>
<P>
 David Drew doddered ineffectually as the Emperor, Anthony Bourne soloed 
capably as Bratfisch and, as Princess Louise, Benazir Hussein made a 
disarmingly vulnerable diversion for Rudolf in the first ballroom scene. Jane 
Burn again danced Princess Stephanie and Barry Wordsworth again conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Royal Ballet performs different programs at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, through Sunday. Tickets $20-$70 
at the box office, (714) 556-ARTS, Ext. 240.

THEATRE REVIEW; 'BECKETT' A RESPECTFUL STAGING OF EARLY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Have you no respect for misery?" 
</P>
<P>
 This question, typical of Samuel Beckett's double-edged black humor, is asked 
by an old woman trudging along an Irish country road in "All That Fall." 
Variations on this despair are further illuminated in "Krapp's Last Tape." 
</P>
<P>
 But this question might also serve as promotional slogan and consumer warning 
for "Beckett Speaks," the Company of Angels' respectful staging of the Nobel 
Laureate's early short plays. Beckett fans will appreciate seeing these rarely 
produced pieces. But those unfamiliar with his satirical portraits of human 
misery will probably remain perplexed by the late author's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt such ambivalence is precisely what Beckett would want. "All That 
Fall" was originally written in 1956 for radio and when staged can become 
uncharacteristically realistic. The Company of Angels shrewdly distorts such 
naturalism by letting us watch the technicians creating the sound effects. 
While old Mrs. Maddy Rooney (Peg Shirley) labors to a train station to meet her 
blind husband Dan (Dick Welsbacher), technicians delightfully construct animal 
sounds and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use none but the simplest words, I hope," the old lady sighs to herself, 
"and yet I sometimes find my way of speaking very bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 This confession is Beckett's aside to his audience, and provides a clue to a 
private anxiety about his work. "I will only take credit for making fundamental 
sounds," he once said, denying philosophical intentions. The Company of Angels 
signals its understanding of this by focusing on speech. Each actor enunciates 
with a clarity that's been precisely honed by director Kenneth R. Klimak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Krapp's Last Tape" is on the surface more bleak than "All That Fall." An 
elderly writer celebrates each birthday alone, reciting into a tape recorder 
the past year's triumphs and the next year's ambitious plans. But the old man's 
loneliness grows ever more desperate as he impatiently listens to previous 
tapes. Welsbacher, a retired professor, adds haunting echoes from his own youth 
by employing tapes he used in another staging 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeated Krapp, squinting under a bleak lamp at the turning tapes, hears 
his youthful confidence with a developing awareness of loss. Krapp is Beckett's 
imagined worst-case scenario of himself, an endgame portrait of the artist as a 
lonely old man who can't go on. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Beckett's voice from the grave we hear at the Company of Angels, and it 
remains an eloquent testimony to the human condition and to his genius. 
</P>
<P>

MOVIE REVIEW; '3 NINJAS' SHOWS CONCERN FOR VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "3 Ninjas Kick Back" is just as lively and engaging as the 1992 original. 
Writer Mark Saltzman and director Charles T. Kanganis, neither of which were 
involved in the earlier film, do a fine job of keeping things happening and 
moving in an easy yet highly kinetic fashion. Although aimed at children, this 
smart-looking TriStar release is actually more inventive and better-paced than 
many a comedy for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The sly and ingratiating Victor Wong is back as the Japanese American martial 
arts whiz who coaches his three grandsons, Rocky (Sean Fox), Colt (Max Elliott 
Slade, the only actor to reprise his role as one of the brothers) and Tum Tum 
(Evan Bonifant) in the art and philosophy of self-defense. When we catch up 
with them, however, they find their passion for baseball vying with their love 
for martial arts to the extent that they would rather remain home for the 
upcoming big game when their grandfather goes off to Japan to present a 
ceremonial dagger he himself had won 50 years earlier to the winner of a ninja 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The dagger is no ordinary weapon, and the man (Sab Shimono), now a shady 
business tycoon, defeated by Wong half a century ago, covets it mightily 
because legend has it that the dagger can open the door to a cave of gold 
hidden beneath an ancient castle. Lending comic relief are Shimono's wanna-be 
heavy-metal rocker nephew (Dustin Nguyen) and his equally inept cohorts (Jason 
Schombing, Angelo Tiffe) struggling to get their hands on the dagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its predecessor, this film shows a genuine concern for values as well as 
action with its emphasis on discipline, integrity and fair play, and it even 
dares to suggest that it's possible for a girl (Caroline Junko King) to be 
better at martial arts than a boy. And when the boys' busy father (Alan McRae), 
an FBI agent, wonders why his sons respond to their grandfather more than they 
do to him, his wife (Margarita Franco) gently points out that her father 
listens to what they have to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for martial arts action and some mild language. Times 
guidelines: Overall, it is exceptionally thoughtful children's fare ; 
appropriate for all ages.

POP ALBUM CHART; REBA'S MAKING HER MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reba McEntire may have replaced Wynonna Judd as the queen of country music. 
McEntire's "Read My Mind" debuted at No. 5 and her "Greatest Hits Vol. 2.," 
which has sold more than 2 million copies, is climbing the chart again, up six 
notches to No. 50. Her co-hosting of the Academy of Country Music Awards TV 
show this week will turn out to be a big sales boost. The detractors' 
prediction that the vocal group All-4-One would be just another one-hit ("So 
Much in Love") wonder is all wrong. The group's debut album, "All-4-One," 
continues to be a strong seller--No. 22 in its third week on the chart. That's 
because of a second Top 10 single, eighth-ranked "I Swear," which shot into the 
elite circle in just one month. On the pop singles chart, Ace of Base's "The 
Sign" is still No. 1 and Madonna's "I'll Remember," from the soundtrack of 
"With Honors," is No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hole continues to plunge, disproving the old doctrine that any publicity is 
good publicity. This group, headed by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, got a 
lot of media attention both because of his recent death and her drug problems. 
"Live Through This" even got good reviews. But the negative publicity, along 
with lack of airplay, has hurt. The album slipped to No. 80.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; ALEXANDER IS GOLD AT END OF CD 'RAINBOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Alexander won a place in pop trivia history in the '60s by having songs 
that he recorded also recorded by both the Beatles ("Anna") and the Rolling 
Stones ("You Better Move On"). 
</P>
<P>
 But there was too much intimacy and character in Alexander's own vocals to 
have his recordings remain in the shadows of pop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why "Rainbow Road: The Warner Bros. Recordings" is such a welcome 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 The album from Warner Archives doesn't include Alexander's celebrated 
early-'60s work that caught the ear of the young British rockers, but the 
15-song package still serves as a marvelous showcase for the country and R&B 
instincts that served the Alabama native so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rainbow Road" consists of all of the tracks from Alexander's much admired 
1972 Warner Bros. album plus four selections that were released only as 
singles. The material ranges from Alexander originals to remakes of Billy 
Swan's "Lover Please," which had been a hit a decade earlier for Clyde 
McPhatter, and Dennis Linde's "Burning Love," which would later become a hit 
for Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights of the retrospective package: the seductive longing of 
"It Hurts to Want It So Bad," the Drifters-like romantic tension of "Go Home 
Girl" and the soulful regret of "They'll Do It Everytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander was born in Florence, Ala., in 1940, the son of a blues guitarist. 
He joined a local R&B group, the Heartstrings, while still in his teens, but 
the group was short-lived and Alexander worked as a bellhop in the Florence 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 His musical dreams were encouraged by a group of young music-biz hopefuls from 
the region, including songwriters Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham as well as 
producers Rick Hall and Billy Sherrill. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hall who went into an area studio with Alexander in 1961 and recorded 
"You Better Move On." Released by Dot Records, the record became a Top 30 hit 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander's work on Dot was inconsistent, and his career was pretty much a 
shambles by the end of the '60s. The 1972 Warner Bros. album, with its nicely 
tailored material and arrangements, should have revitalized his career, but the 
music didn't find an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked up again briefly in 1975 when Alexander's version of "Every Day 
I Have to Cry Some" on Buddah Records broke into the Top 50. But it didn't 
generate any momentum and within two years he moved with his family to 
Cleveland where he drove a social services bus for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's final reach for the stardom he deserved occurred in 1993 when he 
recorded a final album for Elektra Records' American Explorer series. The 
project lured him out of seclusion, according to Daniel Cooper's liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he became gravely ill the day after a Nashville concert and died last June 
9. 
</P>
<P>
 The music in "Rainbow Road" isn't the complete musical story of Alexander, but 
it demonstrates the depth of his talent and the rewards of discovering it -- 
even at this late date.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FUGITIVE' JUST KEEPS ON RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of these weeks, "The Fugitive" will finally run out of gas. But its 
top-of-the-chart status continues, even though some retailers are reporting 
rentals are down somewhat from the huge early numbers."Cool Runnings," No. 5 
after two weeks, seems to have cornered the comedy market. Featuring the late 
John Candy, the Disneyesque spin on the story of Jamaica's Olympic bobsled team 
is one of only two comedies in the Top 15. The other, "The Beverly 
Hillbillies," isn't tickling that many funny bones. It hasn't made much 
progress in three weeks, holding at No. 13. Debuts: "Another Stakeout," with 
Richard Dreyfuss, at No. 17, and "Mr. Jones," starring Richard Gere, No. 20.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't let the low (No. 38) rental-chart debut fool you. "Mrs. Doubtfire" 
really is a big video hit. One reason for the low opening is that it's also on 
the sales market, discounted to $14-$15 in many outlets. So the hard-core fans 
are buying it rather than renting. It should move into the Top 5 next week.

ART REVIEW; VIEWS OF VIETNAMESE AMERICAN PSYCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans finally came to grips with that profound, self-inflicted wound 
called the Vietnam War. It was a nasty, immoral mess, but we can now stand 
before Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, know our soldiers fought bravely, 
weep and try to heal ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibition at Cal State Fullerton reminds us that another legacy of that 
conflict took the form of tens of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants who, 
utterly displaced, came here hoping to piece together decent lives. It started 
nearly 20 years ago. Now they are Americans too. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has the largest Vietnamese population anywhere outside their 
homeland. Close to 100,000 Vietnamese live in enclaves from Westminster to 
Anaheim. The largest, nicknamed "Little Saigon," has more than 1,000 Vietnamese 
and Chinese businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton pays praiseworthy attention to this phenomenon in "A New 
Generation: Vietnamese American Contemporary Art." Organized in tandem by 
co-curators Trang Nguyen and Farid Hassan, it includes the work of 10 artists 
and comes with a slender catalogue. The essay was written by Chor Swang Ngin, 
who ponders the question of assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
 A scan of the work suggests that these artists are culturally assimilated. 
Work is driven by a raw energy and a sense of chaos that comes from styles 
ranging from Abstract Expressionism through installation and performance. The 
ensemble puts one in mind of the work of Jon Borofsky. So, fine. Since that's 
all good American stuff, the artists must all be assimilated, so everything's 
OK and we can all go home. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we can't. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to get a wrong answer is to ask a wrong question. For one thing, 
Western art styles were practiced in South Vietnam, so that is not mentally new 
to the work. In modern times, all artists have been in the business of being 
unassimilated. All artists become self-elected outsiders by their choice of 
profession. If they are social critics, it's not because they set out to act 
that role, it's because they are just being themselves, which is rare to the 
point of being taboo in most cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 We may be able to tell something about the collective state of the immigrant 
Vietnamese psyche from this work, but if we can it's because common experience 
has been uncommonly absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some artists seem to emphasize the Vietnamese experience. Dong Phan makes 
ripped and weathered abstract collages out of what might be the debris of a 
wrecked town after a bombing. The work bears a generic resemblance to art made 
by Italian Alberto Burri and others who lived through the devastation of World 
War II. Toi Hoang and Viet Nguyen pursue similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Man Bui's installation "No Near" is made of fabric and wood and calls to mind 
parachutes, bogs and blood. It feels like a cultural reaction but becomes 
unsettlingly intimate in photographs where the artist seems to accuse himself 
of being intolerant, cynical and hypocritical. It's said that one result of 
terror can be a feeling of guilt on the part of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 All this work is individualized by embodying the humanity of mixed emotions. 
There is a lyrical quality of hope to Ann Phong's Expressionist paintings that 
belies imagery of boats, bombs and swamps. Darlene Nguyen-Ely fashions 
miniature assemblages of wrecked shrines. Their mournfulness is made all the 
more poignant by poetic restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists seem to address the American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Le makes racks of little series paintings about daily life here with its 
cars, bikes and fast-food emporiums. They have some of the folk-art feel of 
Mexican ex-votos and some of the same resigned humor. Their collective title 
(slightly bowdlerized for a family newspaper) is "Same Bull, Different Day." 
Thai Bui waxes philosophical and a bit ironic in neo-primitive sculpture 
incorporating tattered books. "Tool for a Newcomer" is in the form of an ax 
with an English dictionary for a blade. Thy Nguyen's installation is called 
"Progeny." It consists of a rocking mechanism, projected slides and anatomical 
wall drawings depicting human internal organs and genitalia. It could as easily 
have been inspired by private obsession as by social conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Han V. Nguyen takes a posture of anthropological detachment in 
his "Ancestor Series." Images are made up of archive-style montages covering 
everything from the skeletons of ancient hominids to works of master art. A 
particularly mordant image shows a display case including models and death 
masks of peoples of many races. It's called "Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 Most crimes are essentially similar, they say, but all murders are different. 
It's true that the violence of Vietnam was singular, as was that of the 
Holocaust or Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 All, however, leave a dark residue of haunted minds. At that level the terror 
universalizes itself. Whether the demons of the individual mind were placed 
there by warring nations or rotten parents, they require the same courage in 
the coping. Here it is done with uncommon frankness, grace and fortitude. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; IMAGES OF MOTHERHOOD ON LASER DISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Mom can't say her kid is a doctor or lawyer or President, what's the next 
best thing? That guy putting you at the top of his list, and thanking you on 
Oscar night as 100 million people check out your beaming face? Maybe a couple 
of moms have it even better. This Mother's Day, they can pick up two new 
laser-disc releases and freeze-frame their own images. Of course, right after 
they applaud their son's name in the director's credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Image's new wide-screen THX edition of the 1989 romantic comedy hit "When 
Harry Met Sally . . ." ($40) gives Estelle Reiner a chance to relive one of the 
most memorable moments in cinema. Son Rob Reiner couldn't have given her a 
better slice of film history. Just zip to Chapter Stop 19 on Side One for an 
instant replay of her classic one-liner. It follows Meg Ryan's offering Billy 
Crystal something not on the restaurant menu -- proof that, yes indeed, women 
can fake it and even Don Juan won't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing that moment and helping you savor the rest of the eminently 
rewatchable tribute to love and friendship is a sharp digital film transfer and 
THX sound, underscoring that THX may be spectacular in action-packed films, but 
is still most welcome in a quieter environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sumptuous visual, literary and period feast that Martin Scorsese serves up 
in "Age of Innocence" (Columbia TriStar Home Video, $40) also continues his 
series filmic "thank-you" notes to his mother and father. As they have in many 
of the director's other films, Catherine and Luciano Charles Scorsese venture 
on-screen in the Oscar-nominated film starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle 
Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Scorsese's father suffered a heart attack the day 
after their close-up on a staircase. "That was the last image that we saw of 
him on film," Scorsese has said. The film is dedicated to the elder Scorsese, 
who died before its release. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades earlier, the filmmaker's parents were the subject of Scorsese's 
affecting exploration of his roots in a documentary called "Italianamerican." 
The 1974 film is among "Three by Scorsese," released a few years ago by 
Criterion ($50). The other short features are "The Big Shave" from 1967 and 
"American Boy" from 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the time spent with the Scorseses, originally shot for a 
public-television series on immigrant families, that is the most compelling. In 
some ways, it parallels the "testimony" of the various couples interjected 
throughout "When Harry Met Sally . . ." But we know this is real, a home movie 
by a premier filmmaker that makes us wish we could also discover our parents, 
and so ourselves, in much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 While few filmmakers have put their moms on camera, fewer still have trained 
their lenses on in-laws, or near-in-laws. In "Hannah and Her Sisters," Woody 
Allen, then still enamored of Mia Farrow, brought Farrow's mom, Maureen 
O'Sullivan, into the picture. Available in an Image Entertainment release 
($40), the 1986 film remains one of Allen's most tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, on Mother's Day, moms -- surrounded by their families, of course -- 
could always spend the day watching films on laser about moms and dads and 
kids. Put "Mrs. Doubtfire" (Fox/Image, $40), "Parenthood" (MCA, $35), "I 
Remember Mama" (Republic, $30) and "Mommy Dearest" (Paramount, $35) all 
together and you may have a film that comes close to spelling "M-O-T-H-E-R." 
</P>
<P>
 (And if you can wait till fall, you can find "Mrs. Doubtfire" in a promised 
wide-screen, THX director-approved edition with additional footage and other 
supplementary material, for $100.)

TV REVIEWS; 'GRAHAM' THOUGHTFUL PORTRAIT OF THE MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By itself, "Martha Graham: The Dancer Revealed" is incomplete -- a documentary 
emphasizing the life of the artist over the masterworks that make her story 
worth telling. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, this thoughtful, hour-long "American Masters" portrait is followed by 
an hour that completes the picture: the previously telecast "Dance in America" 
episode featuring Graham's "Steps in the Street," "El Penitente" and "Maple 
Leaf Rag."  
</P>
<P>
 Boasting an array of rare but incredibly pristine archival films plus 
forthright interviews with Graham's contemporaries, "Martha Graham: The Dancer 
Revealed" refuses to ignore the woman's capacity for violence -- or descent 
into alcoholism -- and also develops a controversial thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of depicting Graham as a proto-feminist, the program highlights the 
influence and even dominance of key men in her life -- especially her mentor 
Louis Horst and her husband and lead dancer Erick Hawkins.  
</P>
<P>
 Horst is seen as virtually directing her career, while Hawkins emerges as a 
kind of male fertility symbol and the inspiration for a whole body of her work. 
(For the first time, he comments on the record about their relationship in 
interview segments teeming with unresolved emotional conflicts.) 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on Graham's men seems particularly intriguing in view of all the 
women shaping this project: director Catherine Tatge and executive producer 
Susan Lacy, for example. Some of the most outspoken interviews also come from 
women -- among them the late Agnes de Mille and a number of Graham's 
ex-dancers.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham died in 1991, a month short of her 97th birthday. The final scene of 
the documentary shows this skeletal, arthritic, modernist icon standing up in 
company class, still blazing with the same inner fire evident in her earliest 
black-and-white dancing photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is by turns a heroic and ironic life, retold here (often in her own 
voice) with a candor and eloquence she would have appreciated. However, Graham 
doubtless wouldn't have permitted her dances to be upstaged by constant 
voice-over commentary -- and she would have insisted that her leading dancers 
be individually identified. * "Martha Graham: The Dancer Revealed" airs at 9 
tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28. "Dance in America: Three Dances by Martha 
Graham" follows at 10 p.m.

SOLYMOSI AND BENJAMIN PAIR IN SECOND 'MAYERLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second Royal Ballet "Mayerling" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center paired Hungarian firebrand Zoltan Solymosi with Australian lyric paragon 
Leanne Benjamin in the leading roles of the doomed lovers Crown Prince Rudolf 
and Mary Vetsera. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, with superbly expressive hands, Solymosi threw himself into the 
gymnastic partnering challenges on Wednesday with great daring, although he 
couldn't always make these passages appear an expression of character.His 
acting tended to ricochet from one effect to another -- with puzzling shifts in 
and out of drunkenness, for example, during the tavern scene. But Solymosi's 
best moments as Rudolf -- the scene with his mother, his yearning for Mary -- 
proved very impressive indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny, with enormous eyes, Benjamin never seemed to have more than a schoolgirl 
crush on her partner, so this Mary became more of a victim than a collaborator 
in their final murder-suicide. However, Benjamin's dancing remained exemplary 
in its pliancy, lightness, drive and line. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In other new casting Wednesday, Deborah Bull made Mitzi Caspar a high-class 
prostitute indeed -- far more elegant, in fact, than Fiona Chadwick's 
flagrantly cheap Countess Larisch. (Chadwick had played Mitzi in the Tuesday 
performance.) Both artists danced strongly but Elizabeth McGorian outclassed 
them with a complex, restrained, highly sympathetic portrayal of the Empress. 
</P>
<P>
 David Drew doddered ineffectually as the Emperor, Anthony Bourne soloed 
capably as Bratfisch and, as Princess Louise, Benazir Hussein made a 
disarmingly vulnerable diversion for Rudolf in the first ballroom scene. Jane 
Burn again danced Princess Stephanie and Barry Wordsworth again conducted.

STANDING UP AGAINST MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have been hard -- maybe impossible -- to imagine it as recently as 
last year. But behind the strong support of the Clinton Administration, three 
former presidents, the law enforcement community and, according to polls, more 
than 70% of Americans, 216 members of the House of Representatives took a 
dramatic step Thursday toward a safer -- and saner -- nation by approving 
landmark federal legislation outlawing the manufacture and sale of most assault 
weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 The 216-214 vote was as tenaciously fought as it was improbable. Down as much 
as 20 votes a few weeks ago, proponents furiously lobbied lawmakers, never 
abandoning hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end that perseverance paid off handsomely, with a mere two votes 
providing the winning margin.  
</P>
<P>
 A good measure of credit for the victory must go to California's senior 
Democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein, and Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). 
Both put their names -- and hearts -- behind the legislation that President 
Clinton has promised will become law once the House version is reconciled with 
the Senate's. Clinton also provided leadership and deserves credit for working 
the phones in his best victory style. 
</P>
<P>
 No rational person would suggest this legislation is a cure-all. The 210 
million weapons now in circulation suggest a serious degree of violence in the 
future. But passage of the assault gun ban and, earlier, the Brady bill -- the 
five-day waiting period for handgun purchasers -- represents the beginning of 
the sea change that must take place if this nation is ever to get a handle on 
gun crime and gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The House "stood up against the madness," Clinton declared Thursday, as did 
Los Angeles voters in the San Fernando Valley last month in gunning down the 
gun lobby's effort to recall state Sen. David A. Roberti, who pushed for 
California's assault gun ban. Mindless opposition to sensible gun control may 
finally be on the run.

SINGAPORE WATCH; BARBARIC, AT FOUR OR SIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singapore, having rejected Michael Fay's plea for clemency on Wednesday, 
promptly proceeded with the barbaric caning of the 18-year-old American, who 
pleaded guilty in March to vandalizing cars by spray-painting them. The 
flogging was disclosed only after it took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dayton, Ohio, youth was struck four times with a four-foot rattan cane. He 
remains in jail, serving a four-month sentence, and his medical condition was 
said to be satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was called a goodwill gesture, the Singapore Cabinet intervened at the 
last minute to reduce Fay's sentence from the original six strokes. The 
Singaporeans acted like rug merchants splitting the difference in price. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities dismissed Fay's assertions that he was coerced into confessing by 
threats of a beating and prolonged interrogation in a refrigerated room. This 
was the first time that the vandalism laws calling for mandatory caning 
sentences were used in a case involving private property; they were adopted in 
the 1960s to fight political graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of Fay, whatever one may think about his alleged crime, puts in 
full view the dark, authoritarian side of Singapore and sullies the island 
state's image of clean and safe streets. Its legal system needs modernizing. 
The world will watch closely how Singapore handles the other defendants in the 
Fay spray-painting case. Shiu Chi Ho, a 17-year-old from Hong Kong, has been 
sentenced to 12 strokes. Another U.S. youth, Stephen Freehill, 17, has yet to 
come to trial. The civilized world must keep protesting.

AN ANGELENO ON THE SHORT LIST?; VILMA S. MARTINEZ WOULD BE A STRONG CANDIDATE 
FOR U.S. SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Great Mentioner is at it again. This time it's about who shall be 
nominated by President Clinton to fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice Harry 
M. Blackmun, who will step down later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the White House has dribbled out half a dozen plausible names. Whether 
any particular person on the list is a genuine candidate or merely for show 
isn't clear. But at least one name said to be under consideration richly 
deserves the White House's serious attention. She is Vilma S. Martinez, a 
prominent Los Angeles attorney and the only Californian yet mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is well known throughout the Southwest. The Mexican-American is from 
Texas but made her career in California. Martinez, a San Antonio native, 
graduated from Columbia University Law School and was a staff attorney at the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund early in her career. From 1973 to 1982 
she served with distinction as president and general counsel for the L.A.-based 
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an influential national 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has been on several corporate boards and is now a partner at the 
well-established Munger, Tolles & Olson law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Reported to be on the Great Mentioner's short list are Judge Richard S. Arnold 
of Little Rock, chief judge of the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals (though 
said to be perhaps too Arkansan and thus seemingly cronyish), Judge Stephen G. 
Breyer of the 1st Circuit in Boston (though said to be too white and male), 
Judge Amalya L. Kearse of New York (though she would be the second African 
American on a court with no Latinos), U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes, 
chief judge of the District of Connecticut (though said to be perhaps not 
liberal enough) and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (though said to be, as a 
former moderate Democratic governor, too much like Clinton). 
</P>
<P>
 All respectable candidates, to be sure. Like Martinez, who might be just what 
the Supreme Court, and history, needs.

MORE HEAT ON HAITI'S COHORTS; THOSE CIRCUMVENTING SANCTIONS MUST BE TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States today will ask the U.N. Security Council to renew economic 
sanctions against Haiti and the military junta that refuses to allow exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return. But new sanctions will be no more 
successful than previous ones unless both the United Nations and Washington 
come down hard on any countries that try to get around them. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two years the military and police officials who seized control 
of the government in Port-au-Prince have held virtually the entire world at bay 
by playing cynical diplomatic games. They went so far as to negotiate an 
agreement for Aristide to return last October; then, at the last moment, they 
reneged, humiliating the Clinton Administration when a boatload of unarmed U.S. 
troops sent to help enforce the agreement was prevented from landing by a 
pro-junta mob. 
</P>
<P>
 As illustrated in that incident, the United States is reluctant -- 
understandably -- to use force against a much weaker nation. And both the 
United States and the United Nations have been hesitant to impose truly harsh 
economic sanctions against one of the poorest nations in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday President Clinton may have set himself up for another humiliation 
when he publicly announced he is considering military force as an option for 
resolving the Haitian crisis. Tough talk like that should not be used unless 
Washington really means it, and experience in both Haiti and Bosnia suggests it 
does not. Economic sanctions remain the only real option. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments that sanctions hurt only Haiti's poor are disingenuous. The poor, 
the vast majority of Haitians, already are suffering, not just from poverty but 
from repression by a government desperately afraid of ceding power to any 
popularly elected civilian. Sanctions can be targeted on the military and the 
small elite class. The new sanctions proposal seems to do that, banning travel 
outside Haiti by 600 top officials and government supporters and freezing their 
financial assets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations must also be prepared to pressure the Dominican Republic, 
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. A recent U.N. report concedes 
that past sanctions against Haiti were ineffective because of a "significant 
trade" in oil from an unnamed "border country." That trade must be stopped, and 
stopped cold, before anyone seriously considers using military power against 
Haiti. As was proved in South Africa, with patience and firm application 
economic sanctions can work against a pariah regime.

SUBSIDIES FOR ELECTRIC CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "The Electric Car: Its Time Is Here -- and So Is Its Opposition," 
editorial, April 24: 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial implies that anyone who speaks out against utilities receiving 
subsidies to develop electric vehicles is simply an instrument of the petroleum 
industry. In fact, we support the development of electric vehicles for all the 
same reasons you do. What we oppose is utilities getting into the car business 
at ratepayers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric and gas companies that want a handout from the PUC in the form of 
rate increases to fund electric car development are investor-owned companies, 
not public agencies. In every other industry, it is investors who are expected 
to fund R&D programs. That should be the case here, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If the utilities and their investors are so confident that electric cars are 
the wave of the future, then let them put their own money on the line. The 
small businesses represented by our organization already have enough expenses. 
They don't need to be the funders of multimillion-dollar experiments that stand 
to benefit only those who can afford to buy blue-chip utility stocks.

<P>
 * Kudos to The Times for pointing out that the time is here for electric cars 
and that many of the arguments against these zero-emission vehicles -- which 
can dramatically help improve air quality and California's economic 
competitiveness -- are not valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers also should be aware that mass penetration of electric vehicles into 
the Southern California market offers the potential to stabilize their electric 
rates. With charging of hundreds of thousands of vehicles overnight (off-peak), 
when energy use is lowest, utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power (DWP) can operate more efficiently. The DWP already offers a 
discount demonstration nighttime charging rate to eligible electric vehicle 
owners (a long-term discount rate is under development), and thus electric 
vehicles make sense not only environmentally but also from many economic 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of the state's utilities, and other private agencies, 
California will be ready for the introduction of electric vehicles. If the 
public interest is there, the infrastructure will be there -- now all we need 
are the commercially produced vehicles.

 * I never thought that I would be considered "opposition" to either progress 
or an environmental cause, but your editorial supporting the electric car on 
the basis of being "97% cleaner than today's autos" gives me no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Your calculation includes atomic fission power plants as a contributing source 
of electricity for electric cars. It is certainly true that they do not pollute 
the air with nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, or unburned hydrocarbons. But they 
do pollute with radiation, and with toxic waste. And their potential for 
detrimentally affecting the environment is enormous. So if you want to be 
intellectually honest, remove them from your list, and redo your calculations. 
Better yet, support a law that says that for every electric car produced, a 
truly clean power source must be built and a polluting one must be 
discontinued. Nobody could argue with that.

BORDER PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As the sponsors of the amendment to the crime bill to provide an additional 
6,000 Border Patrol agents, we were disappointed by your editorial of April 22 
("Immigration Aid: At Last, a Bit of Fairness"), which criticized this 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 We take exception to your conclusion that hiring these new agents will be 
ineffective.Experience shows that numbers do matter. In a March 30 letter to 
us, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner commended Congress on our initiative last 
year to add 600 agents. She stated, "A special operation carried out in El Paso 
last fall demonstrated that a heavy concentration of agents on the line can 
effectively deter illegal entry. This special operation stopped the 'revolving 
door' that had dominated illegal immigration patterns from Juarez, Mexico, to 
El Paso, Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration demands a multifaceted approach. There are many measures 
pending in Congress that would help with this problem. But the key is to regain 
control of our borders. The Border Patrol does not have the agents or resources 
to cope with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 If illegal aliens are stopped at the border, they will not be filling hospital 
beds, classrooms, or prison bunks in this country. All 52 California 
representatives supported this amendment because common sense and the record 
show that we can deter illegal immigration if we give the Border Patrol the 
resources it needs.

 * I found something even more provocative than the main thrust of the April 19 
Column One, "Setting the Human Clock Back." It was in the first paragraph:

laser's fierce light, Robert C. Walter is prospecting for time."

destroy in all my holy mountain."

CONTROVERSY OVER CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * According to your April 22 article about the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District's refusal to administer the CLAS tests, the groups who oppose 
the test charge, among other things, that a question asking students to write 
about a school rule they disagree with encourages children "to defy authority." 
Therefore, to prevent California's children from learning to defy authority, 
these critics are urging school boards and administrators to defy state law by 
refusing to administer the test. Did I miss something? 
</P>
<P>
 As an educator, I firmly believe in teaching children to think for themselves, 
a process which often includes questioning authority. In fact, questioning 
authority and even defiance of authority are valued American traditions of long 
standing, dating back at least to the Boston Tea Party and the American 
Revolution. What I find ironic is that the California Learning Assessment 
System critics seem unaware that they are providing their own children with a 
far more powerful lesson in the defiance of authority than writing a test essay 
disagreeing with a school rule could ever teach them. 
</P>

 * Congratulations to the Antelope Valley School Board. For more than a year, I 
have been trying to tell anyone who will listen that the CLAS exams are a cruel 
joke. My criticism has nothing to do with the selections for the readings but 
only with the mathematics questions. I could write and have written pages on 
them but the short form is: The types of and number of mathematics questions 
are ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
 My biggest criticism of the exams is that they excuse the state's malfeasance 
in not publishing the results of the California Tests of Basic Skills or valid 
equivalent, still given by nearly all districts, to document the actual 
performance levels of our students. That information on each school should be 
easily available to parents of current and prospective students. That 
information on each student should be easily available to that student and his 
or her parents.

MAYBE IT TAKES A CON TO SEE THE CON IN 'THREE STRIKES'; CRIME: WILSON'S 
ELECTION-YEAR GET-TOUGH STANCE WILL ONLY FURTHER BRUTALIZE THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE VERNON WHITE, Leslie Vernon White's perjury conviction in 1990 arose 
from his role as a jailhouse informant; his whistle-blowing about giving false 
testimony in return for leniency led to a Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
investigation and report critical of the district attorney's and sheriff's 
offices.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was doing time in a California prison for most of the last three years. 
Where was Pete Wilson? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Gov. Wilson has been on a crime-fighting rampage. He signed the 
"three strikes" law, which mandates that anyone convicted of a third felony 
must do a 25-year-to-life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he and the California Department of Corrections are telling everyone how 
plush it is inside the California prison system. They also have been 
complaining that the Prisoner Bill of Rights, a law enacted during the Jerry 
Brown years to protect prisoners from unwarranted abuses, prevents wardens from 
controlling the flow of pornography and racist materials into prisons or the 
way inmates wear their hair and clothing. The governor wants to bar inmates 
serving life sentences from the overnight family-visiting program. He claims 
that repealing the Prisoner Bill of Rights, or at least greatly watering it 
down, will allow him and corrections officials to correct these "abuses." 
</P>
<P>
 As a four-time loser, having done time in prisons throughout the state system, 
I have a little better insight and perspective than the governor and a few 
things to tell the public that he has not.  
</P>
<P>
 First, the three-strikes law: While the concept is good -- I agree that no one 
should be subjected to repeated victimization by violent offenders -- the law 
should have been tailored to the third-time serious offender. As the law reads 
now, we will have hundreds (at least) of car thieves and check bouncers doing 
life at the taxpayers' expense. Not good for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, will this law reduce crime, as the governor claims? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a well-known fact that most crime is drug-related. In the old days, when 
I was a "hope to die" drug addict, I did not think about prison, and I would 
not have been impressed by a sentencing law fashioned after a baseball game. 
All a drug addict wants is another fix, and believe me, he will do whatever it 
takes to get it. A dope fiend who has been up for three days on cocaine or 
speed couldn't care less about the governor in Sacramento making political 
points by telling the public how bad criminals are. 
</P>
<P>
 I assure you, the governor and his laws have no impact on the drug offender, 
and three strikes will not reduce crime. It will, however, turn California into 
a prison state, with the taxpayers paying dearly for the governor's 
election-year cravings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections has made repeated attempts to repeal the 
Prisoner Bill of Rights. These attempts are not about pornography, hairstyles 
or overnight visits. They are about power and control. They are about placing 
someone in solitary confinement for years at a time without having to justify 
it. They are about taking an inmate's personal property and not giving it back 
to him for months. They are about taking away someone's visits arbitrarily. No 
justification is needed other than the vague claim that the action is 
reasonably related to the system's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I fully understand how some of the public may feel about this. So what, 
you say; prison is supposed to be punishment. Well, let's give that attitude a 
little thought. 
</P>
<P>
 I can assure you that most of the people in prison belong there. But the 
public would be surprised at the hatred and resentment that builds within a 
person who sits in solitary confinement for months or even years only because 
prison officials have taken a dislike to him. And it's not hard for anyone to 
imagine the hate a man feels who has lost his wife and children because the 
Department of Corrections has taken away his family visits and thus eroded the 
family bond.  
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, these hate-filled people will get out from behind those walls 
and will come out with nothing -- no hope, no job and no one who gives a damn 
to try and help them get started on the right track. All this in the name of 
Pete Wilson wanting to be governor again. Is this beneficial to the public? 
Again, I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous problems with the governor's crime-fighting campaign. First 
and foremost, it is not sincere. Let us see it for what it is: politics, pure 
and simple. The governor wants to be reelected and has grasped our fear about 
crime and run with it. After all, it is highly unlikely that he just found out 
about the Prisoner Bill of Rights, or that inmates do not have to submit to 
haircuts, or that some of them receive overnight visits with their spouses and 
children. If all this really is news to him, where has Pete Wilson been these 
last three years? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of my parole (after serving time for perjury), I have to 
obtain the Department of Corrections' permission in advance for anything I 
write for publication or say in a public speech. Initially, the department 
refused permission to publish this commentary on the grounds that it was 
"inflammatory" and "not in the best interests of the state." The department 
relented only after Steve Fama, an attorney with the nonprofit Prison Law 
Office, threatened federal litigation to challenge this censorship.

MUZZLED IN A NURSING HOME, THE SPIRIT IS EXTINGUISHED; HEALTH REFORM: FOR MANY 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, THE INCLUSION OF HOME-BASED CARE IS WHAT MATTERS 
MOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE ERVIN, Mike Ervin is a writer and disability-rights activist with 
ADAPTAmerican Disabled for Attendant Programs Today. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you surveyed people with significant disabilities about their greatest 
fears, I'd wager that the top vote-getters would be going into a nursing home 
and dying, in that order. Those certainly are my greatest fears. I've seen too 
many people with disabilities like me -- people who need help getting out bed 
and getting dressed every day -- end up needlessly in nursing homes. To us, the 
most important issue in health-care reform is long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you had no control over your most basic life decisions. Someone else 
would determine when and even if you got out of bed, when you went back to bed, 
what and when and if you would eat, with whom you would associate. That's life 
in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this systematic denial of rights, even without the endemic abuse and 
neglect, that makes living in these institutions dismal. Nursing homes corral 
large numbers of people with long-term physical or medical needs into a 
manageable corner. There's no room in these corners for free spirits -- people 
unwilling to do what they're told, when they're told. Freedom is too much of a 
threat to efficiency and profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nursing homes are more expensive than in-home attendant services, 
nursing homes are still a dominant force in the lives of the disabled. Federal 
policy is contorted by disability bigotry and rigged to maintain the coffers of 
the multi-billion-dollar nursing-home industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicaid requires all states to cover the long-term care needs of all 
recipients in nursing homes. States have the option to spend Medicaid money on 
home attendants. But in the many states that do not exercise this option, 
people who need even basic physical assistance for a few hours a day must 
surrender themselves to a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 States are allowed, and in some cases even required, to limit spending on 
in-home attendant services, but they cannot cap nursing-home payments. In 
essence, the federal government issues nursing homes a blank check, and the 
bill comes to about $30 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Why haven't cheaper in-home attendant services overtaken the more expensive 
institutionalization? Nursing homes are a big business, and people with 
disabilities are among the commodities that provide the cash flow. Monitoring 
home care for abuse of clients or fraud may be difficult, but nursing homes are 
subject to the same sorts of problems. And the most likely recipients of home 
care will be more able to protect their own interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care reform provides an unprecedented opportunity to shed the inhumane 
and expensive institutional bias of the present Medicaid system. But only two 
of the many reform plans -- President Clinton's and the single-payer plan 
supported by more than 100 members of Congress -- challenge the nursing-home 
industry in any way by even mentioning home-based care. 
</P>
<P>
 States should be required, not just allowed, to spend some of the money now 
paid to nursing homes on providing in-home care. The plans put forth by Rep. 
Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Sen. John Chafee (R-R.I.) do not consider the issue. 
Clinton's plan and the single-payer system, in which the government pays for 
health care directly, would provide the first-ever national program for home 
care. Still, neither plan comes close to setting a standard of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton calls for $65 billion -- from an as-yet-unspecified source -- in 
funding for long-term care over five years. But states would still not be 
required to participate, and nursing-home care would still be mandated. The 
Clinton plan would also have a spending cap for in-home care, but not for 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer plan is much simpler than Clinton's, and much more vague. It 
would mandate that states provide as much long-term in-home assistance as 
necessary, to anyone who needs it, as long as it doesn't cost more than 65% of 
the cost for the same care in a nursing home. Otherwise, back to the nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The bold promise of health-care reform rings hollow without comprehensive, 
truly equitable long-term care. Our present system is inefficient, misguided 
and cruel. It condemns people with disabilities to life in a nursing-home 
prison.

PERSPECTIVE ON RWANDA; BEFORE THE BLOODLETTING, AND AFTER; UNDER THE GUISE OF 
ETHNICITY, ZEALOTS FOSTER PREJUDICE AND INCITE MURDER TO PURSUE A POLITICAL 
AGENDA IN WHAT WAS A POOR BUT PEACEFUL COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY LITE, Jeffrey Lite is a senior Foreign Service officer with the 
United States Information Agency in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small, poor and remote, the landlocked central African republic of Rwanda 
burst upon the American consciousness with an orgy of bloodletting. Among the 
dead is my friend and former colleague, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs 
Landoald Ndasingwa. His Canadian-born wife, Helene, is missing and presumed 
dead. Their two teen-aged children, Malaika and Patrick, are unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwanda the world knows from reading the newspapers and watching the 
evening news is a savage killing field, a place where human life is cheap and 
vengeance the prevailing emotion. But I remember another Rwanda, a poor but 
peaceful and beautiful country whose people struggled to build a better life 
for themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, when I worked as public-affairs officer at the U.S. 
Embassy there, every cultivable acre of the "Land of a Thousand Hills" was lush 
and green with beans, rice, banana trees and other produce. Some of the world's 
finest tea and coffee grew on mountain slopes. Lions and other wildlife roamed 
the Akagera National Park, and the world's few remaining highland gorillas -- 
Dian Fossey's "Gorillas in the Mist" -- found sanctuary in a protected zone in 
the shadow of active volcanoes on the border with Zaire. The civil war that has 
engulfed Rwanda places these magnificent creatures, already endangered, at risk 
of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the main roads were unpaved when I lived there. A trip south from the 
capital, Kigali, to the town of Butare was a bone-jarring three-hour journey on 
a dirt road that precariously hugged the sides of the hills. That road is paved 
now, a result of improvements financed by the international community. It was 
along this road last month that Americans and other foreigners fled in convoys 
to safety in Burundi.  
</P>
<P>
 The convoys passed the university in Butare. A generation of Rwandans, both 
Hutus and Tutsis, studied together there to gain the skills necessary to lead 
their country toward greater prosperity. In doing so, they followed in the 
footsteps of an earlier generation of Rwandans who had studied abroad and 
returned to help build their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Landoald Ndasingwa was one of these. Stricken with polio as a child, he walked 
with a limp but refused to be limited by his physical handicap. He attended 
university in Canada and then worked as my assistant for cultural affairs in 
Kigali. After saving enough from his job with the embassy, he and his wife 
built a restaurant and hotel and worked hard to make their business a success. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he became active in politics. When the Hutu-dominated 
government broadened its ethnic base, "Lando" was one of a number of Tutsis 
invited to join the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 We had many conversations about Rwanda's future over bottles of locally 
bottled Primus beer on the front porch of his home overlooking one of the 
valleys around the capital. Lando spoke of the need for ethnic reconciliation 
and of his vision for the country as a place where his children could live free 
of the strife earlier generations had endured. Many other Rwandans -- Hutu and 
Tutsi alike -- shared the dream that Lando described. Indeed, Hutus and Tutsis 
mingled easily and got along well in their daily activities, and intermarriage 
was not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the former Yugoslavia and Haiti, though, it is not the common folk in 
Rwanda who have plunged their country into violence, but ethnic zealots who 
have fanned the embers of mistrust to advance their own political objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda never had much going for it. It lacks strategically important or 
intrinsically valuable natural resources. With more than 7 million people in an 
area roughly the size of Maryland, it is the most densely populated country in 
sub-Saharan Africa. It has little industrial base, and its growing population, 
which doubled between 1970 and 1990, places heavy demands on the limited land 
available for farming. It has been hit hard by AIDS. Poverty, hunger and 
disease cut across ethnic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 If it had not been for April's bloodbath, most Americans would never have 
heard of Rwanda, and as the violence decreases and other, more urgent stories 
command the headlines, it is likely to sink back into obscurity. People will 
forget and move on to the next crisis, left only with a vague memory of 
atrocities committed somewhere in Africa and an image of anonymous bodies piled 
by the roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dead are not anonymous. This tragedy is happening to real people, 
whose society is very different from our own but whose aspirations for 
themselves and their families are not. Such violence is not limited to Africa. 
We have witnessed too much ethnic conflict around the world in this century to 
dismiss mass slaughter as merely an African phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Political opportunists in many lands who manipulate their compatriots to 
achieve their own selfish ends seem not to know or care about the destructive 
forces they unleash when they appeal to ethnic prejudice and misguided national 
pride. We can only hope that the bloodshed in Rwanda will stop soon, and that 
what happened in Rwanda will make people in other lands understand the lunacy 
of answering such appeals and following such leaders.

DODGERS SURVIVE AT 'STICK; BASEBALL: MARTINEZ STRONG FOR EIGHT, THEN DREIFORT 
SAVES THE DAY IN NINTH AFTER A 9-3 LEAD TURNS INTO A 9-6 SCARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Darren Dreifort heard the crowd of 23,271 at Candlestick Park on Thursday 
night, and how could he not? The San Francisco Giants, who had trailed by six 
runs at the start of the ninth inning, had just scored three runs to cut the 
Dodgers' lead to 9-6, a score that would stand.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who, like the Dodgers, has shown a propensity this season for 
keeping things interesting, had relieved Jim Gott, and once again, did his 
part.  
</P>
<P>
 With no one out and a runner on third, Dreifort gave up a fielder's choice for 
the Giants' final run, a soft liner to right and then hit Darren Lewis to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "A crowd is a crowd; they are going to yell, no big deal," Dreifort said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda watched with interest. With Todd Worrell 
sidelined, Dreifort, 21, has been anointed the closer.  
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he gets out of more jams than he gets into, that's fine with me," 
Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort came back to strike out Robby Thompson and Dave Martinez, and that 
was good, because Matt Williams, who hit his league-leading 13th homer 
Thursday, was on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he was in the on-deck circle," said Dreifort, who earned his 
third save. "I didn't know where we were in the order." 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-inning squirming in the Dodger dugout came long after the Dodgers 
had scored six runs in the fifth inning to take a 7-1 lead. Mike Piazza, who 
helped ruin an entire season for the Giants in their final game of 1993, 
continued his domination, when his two-run opposite-field homer started the 
scoring in the six-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of a four-game series that brought the Giants wanting revenge and 
the Dodgers wanting to reach the top of the division, Piazza drove in three 
runs and homered against Giant ace John Burkett (3-2). Burkett began the game 
with the third lowest earned-run average in the league and left in the fifth 
inning ranked among the rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it was the Dodgers' ace of old, Ramon Martinez (1-2), who held 
the Giants to one run and two hits through the first six innings and also 
helped out with two hits, including a two-run double in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who has struggled this season, sailed quickly through the game until 
the seventh inning, when he gave up two runs, including a leadoff homer by Matt 
Williams. He needed help in the ninth after giving up two consecutive singles 
to start the inning and was relieved by Jim Gott, who didn't help at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Gott gave up two run-scoring hits to reduce the Dodgers' lead to four runs. 
Then in came Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bullpen is too good, I have no worries about our pitching at all -- we 
are going to be fine," said Tim Wallach, who was two for five with a double. 
"Dreifort is cool. In that situation with the crowd and being here, it showed a 
lot of moxie." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who earned his first victory, said before the game that all he 
wanted to do was go out and have a good outing, and it helped that he was 
facing the Giants, who have the worst offense in the league. But what helped 
Martinez more was the Dodgers' potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers hit three home runs against three pitchers, with Eric Karros, who 
also singled and doubled, hitting his third of the year and Brett Butler a solo 
shot to right field for the Dodgers' final run.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing here at Candlestick," said Butler, who was three for four and 
scored three runs.  
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty at stake in this early-season series. The Dodgers began the 
series two games behind the Giants and in third place in the National League 
West with a chance to take over the top spot, which the Giants have held all 
season. This is the first meeting for either club against a division opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 But this was not quite the way the Giants wanted to start this series, with a 
loss and without Barry Bonds. Bonds, who was hit by a pitch Wednesday by the 
New York Mets' Eric Hillman, is sidelined on a day-to-day basis. X-rays and a 
CAT scan taken Thursday showed no broken bones in his injured right arm, and 
early indications were he will play sometime in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonds, despite seven home runs, has been struggling at the plate along 
with most of the regulars. Contrary to last season, when the Giants' offense 
was strong from the start, Williams and Willie McGee are the only regulars who 
have been hitting well. It has been the pitching and fielding that have kept 
the Giants in first place in the West, but not even Burkett could hold up 
against the Dodger's offense. 
</P>
<P>

the 15-day disabled list. C6

DODGERS HOLD OFF GIANTS IN 9TH

<P>
 The Dodgers, who have shown a propensity for keeping things interesting this 
season, took a six-run lead into the ninth inning Thursday night against the 
San Francisco Giants and nearly blew it.  
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort, who has been promoted to closer with Todd Worrell sidelined, 
was called on for the third time in four games, and, after loading the bases, 
struck out Robby Thompson and Dave Martinez to preserve a 9-6 victory over the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-inning squirming in the Dodger dugout came long after the Dodgers 
had scored six runs in the fifth inning to take a 7-1 lead. Mike Piazza, who 
helped ruin the season for the Giants in October last year, continued his 
domination, this time at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of a four-game series, Piazza's two-run opposite-field homer 
started a six-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, who knocked in three runs, homered off Giant ace John Burkett, who 
began the game with the third-lowest earned-run average in the league, and left 
in the fifth inning ranked among the rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it was the Dodgers' ace of old, Ramon Martinez (1-2), who held 
the Giants to one run and two hits through the first six innings and also 
helped out with two hits, including a two-run double in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who has struggled all season, breezed until the seventh inning, when 
he gave up two runs, including a leadoff homer by Matt Williams, his 13th of 
the season. He needed help in the ninth inning after giving up two singles, and 
was relieved by Jim Gott, who didn't help at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Royce Clayton doubled and Todd Benzinger singled to score two runs and 
decrease the Dodgers' lead to four runs. In came Dreifort. With no outs and 
runners on first and third, Kirt Manwaring's force play scored one run. 
Pinch-hitter Mark Carreon hit a soft single to right, putting Manwaring on 
third. Then Dreifort hit Darren Lewis to load the bases before he struck out 
the next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said before the game that all he wanted to do was have a good outing, 
and it helped that he was facing the Giants, who have the worst offense in the 
league. But what helped Martinez more was the Dodgers' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers hit three home runs against three Giant pitchers. Piazza had his 
sixth, Eric Karros, who also singled and doubled, hit his third of the year, 
and Brett Butler -- yes, Brett Butler -- hitting a solo shot to right field for 
the Dodgers' final run. Butler hit only one home run last season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, who entered the series two games behind the Giants and in 
third place in the National League West, this series is a chance to take over 
the top spot, which the Giants have held all season. For both clubs, this is 
their first meeting against any division opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 But this was not quite the way the Giants wanted to start this series, with a 
loss and without Barry Bonds. Bonds, who was hit by a pitch Wednesday by the 
New York Mets' Eric Hillman, is sidelined on a day-to-day basis. X-rays and a 
CAT scan taken Thursday showed no broken bones, and early indications were he 
will play sometime in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonds, despite seven home runs, has been struggling at the plate along 
with most of the regulars. Contrary to last season, when the Giants' offense 
was strong from the start, Williams and Willie McGee are the only regulars who 
have been hitting well. It has been the Giants' pitching and fielding that has 
kept them in first place in the NL West, but not even Burkett could stop the 
Dodgers' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett, who entered the game with a 3-1 record and a 1.98 ERA, left with one 
out and the bases loaded in the fifth inning, and that was after Piazza had hit 
a 1-0 pitch over the right-center field wall to put the Dodgers ahead, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Burba, who gave up one of Piazza's two homers during the Dodgers' 12-1 
rout in the final game last season, said this week he wanted revenge. His 
chance came when he relieved Burkett with Tim Wallach and Henry Rodriguez on 
base with singles and Karros on first with a walk.  
</P>
<P>
 With one strike on Raul Mondesi, Burba unleashed a very wild pitch. It bounced 
off the plate and rolled to the Dodger dugout. Two runs scored, and Karros 
moved to third. Mondesi struck out and Jose Offerman was intentionally walked, 
before Martinez, who had one hit all season, hit a double off the right-field 
wall, giving the Dodgers a 7-1 lead.

LEFTWICH DOES RIGHT BY ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich knows it might soon be time to fill out those dreaded 
change-of-address cards. He glances at the locker stall to his left, sees the 
quick recovery by pitcher Mark Langston and has a hunch that it might be time 
to find his passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston is scheduled to return next week to the starting rotation, and unless 
there's a sudden change of plans, Leftwich will be traveling to the Angels' 
triple-A team in Vancouver, Canada, to make room. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich doesn't know if he changed anyone's mind Thursday, but maybe he at 
least provoked some thought, pitching the Angels to a 4-3 victory over the 
Oakland Athletics before 15,245 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich pitched seven solid innings, yielding seven hits and three earned 
runs, before Craig Lefferts picked up his first American League save. The 
Angels are still without a complete game from a starting pitcher -- their 
longest drought in any season in club history -- but Leftwich hardly cared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know things don't look too good for me," said Leftwich, who is 1-4 with a 
6.27 earned-run average. "But I figured whatever happens, happens. I'm going to 
quit worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of putting too much pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers refused to say whether Leftwich's performance will 
affect his decision, but said, "I'll take any kind of difficult complications 
rather than have easy ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Angels' second in a row after losing 10 of the previous 
11. Despite their 11-18 record, they are only two games behind the first-place 
Texas Rangers in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so lucky to be in the division we're in, or else we'd be sucked down to 
the bottom by now," shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "It's like everyone is stuck 
in quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think the worst is behind us. I mean, things have got to get 
better, don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Athletics (8-20) have been thinking the same, but only 17 
months after winning their fourth division title in five years, they have the 
second-worst record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nothing exemplified the Athletics' performance more than their play in 
the fifth inning. The Athletics were starting to get to Leftwich. Geronimo 
Berroa began the inning with a homer to left center, and then with two out and 
runners on first and second, the Athletics had Rickey Henderson at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 He never got a chance to hit. Scott Brosius wandered off second base, and 
catcher Jorge Fabregas picked him off for the final out. It was Fabregas' 
second pickoff of the game, and he also produced a hit, bringing his average to 
.375. His play has been so impressive that the Angels have already decided that 
barring a sudden collapse, Fabregas will be kept on the team when catcher Greg 
Myers returns from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done everything you could possibly want," Rodgers said. "He's given 
every indication that he's ready to play up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, who was 4-6 last season after being called up in July, figured he 
was ready to stay in the big leagues too. He was penciled in as the No. 3 
starter this season, and the Angels were counting on him to win at least 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Leftwich failed to win any of his first five starts, yielding a 
whopping .328 batting average. The more he lost, the more he began pressuring 
himself. This time, he decided to quit worrying about his future, and a phone 
call from his college pitching coach at Radford University helped his 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think once Mark (Langston) comes back, that's when you'll see a different 
team," DiSarcina said. "Mark just has that presence about him, he creates that 
state of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich knows all about it.

NBA ROUNDUP; SUPERSONICS HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics, with the NBA's best record, found out in five minutes 
Thursday night what that means in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much, at least in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets got six points each from Bryant Stith and LaPhonso Ellis in 
overtime and it was enough to defeat Seattle, 94-85, to square their 
first-round playoff series, 2-2. Denver has won all four home games against 
Seattle this season, including two in the playoffs, but Game 5 is scheduled for 
Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics had the best home record in the NBA and have won 14 in a row 
at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't give up when things didn't go our way," Denver Coach Dan Issel 
said, acknowledging the Nuggets were behind, 0-2, after the first two games of 
the series. "We're not conceding anything. I've told the guys since the first 
game that if we can get this to a fifth game, anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis had 27 points and 17 rebounds, Stith finished with 15 points and Dikembe 
Mutombo added 10 points and 16 rebounds for the Nuggets, who outscored the 
SuperSonics, 12-3, in overtime after Robert Pack pulled the Nuggets even by 
making a three-point basket with 27 seconds to play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stith swung the momentum in overtime. His dunk after taking a pass from 
Mutombo put Denver ahead, 86-83, with 2:39 to play, and Stith made two 
subsequent strong moves to the basket, drawing fouls both times and making all 
four free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Stith's final two free throws gave the Nuggets a 90-83 lead with 1:07 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle was led by Detlef Schrempf and Gary Payton with 20 points each. Shawn 
Kemp had 16 points, 13 rebounds and some criticism of the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make all the excuses in the world, but the team that works the 
hardest usually wins," Kemp said. "We just threw the game away. Game 5 is what 
it's all about and it will be on our home court. This will be a bigger game 
than Game 7 in the conference finals last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 103, Miami 89 -- The Hawks joined Seattle as teams who could clinch 
their opening-round series at home when Mookie Blaylock shook a shooting slump 
and scored a season-high 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat, bidding to become the first eighth-seeded team to eliminate a 
regular-season conference champion, shot 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 5 will be Sunday at Atlanta, with the winner advancing to play the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock, nine for 41 in the first three games of the series, made seven for 
13 shots and made six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't worried about Mookie," said Atlanta's Danny Manning, who scored 26 
points. "He had been struggling, but no one lost confidence. When he was open, 
we didn't say that he wasn't hitting. We said, 'Give him the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Bimbo Coles led the Heat with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 95, San Antonio 90 -- Karl Malone scored 34 points and made a 20-foot 
jump shot with 42 seconds to play to help the Jazz hold off a late San Antonio 
rally at Salt Lake City, eliminating the Spurs from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs trailed, 91-84, before Dale Ellis scored and missed a free throw 
that Dennis Rodman tipped in, making the score 91-88. Malone then made his key 
jump shot to rebuild the Jazz lead to five. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson came back with a spinning jump shot, pulling the Spurs to 
93-90, and they got the ball back with 12 seconds remaining. But David Benoit 
grabbed a loose ball and dunked just before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the best-of-five series, 3-1, Utah beat San Antonio in Salt Lake 
City for the 21st time in 22 games and for the seventh time in eight games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone also had 12 rebounds and John Stockton had 18 assists.

GOLF; KITE, SUTTON TIED FOR LEAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-shot swing on the final hole Thursday left Tom Kite and Hal Sutton tied 
for the lead at six-under-par 66 in the first round of the $1.2-million 
BellSouth Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite, the 1992 U.S. Open champion and winner of this event the same year, 
rolled in a five-foot birdie putt and Sutton, winless since the 1986 Memorial, 
had his only bogey of the day after he missed the ninth green. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kite and Sutton began play on the hilly, 7,018-yard Atlanta Country Club 
course on No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 They held their one-shot lead over Craig Parry, whose bogey-free round 
featured birdie putts of 30 feet on No. 4 and 20 feet on No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven others were at 68 -- Lennie Clements, Paul Goydos, Corey Pavin, Brian 
Henninger, Mark Wurtz, Esteban Toledo and Wayne Levi, a two-time Atlanta 
winner.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: KMPC SIMPLY DIDN'T GO THE XTRA MILE, AND NOW IT'S 
GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And then there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio sports-talk war is over, with XTRA the victor. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC, under new ownership, this week went to a non-sports talk format, 
although Week 1 was mainly devoted to dreadful promos and auditions. The 
regular programming, which we hope will be an improvement, begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The XTRA-KMPC war lasted two years. XTRA, a San Diego station whose signal 
carries to Los Angeles, went all sports in February of 1992, and then KMPC, 
with much fanfare, joined the fray two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot is being made of the failure of KMPC," said Lee Hamilton, the 
46-year-old veteran sports talk-show host who has been at XTRA since 1986. "But 
give us some credit. We beat them with style, content and personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Freedman, XTRA's 36-year-old program director who grew up in the Los 
Angeles area -- he's a graduate of Taft High in Woodland Hills -- said, "We not 
only hired the best talent, but we promoted them by sending them out into the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said he makes about 150 public appearances and remote broadcasts a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's "Loose Cannons," Steve Hartman and Chet Forte, do four or five each 
week. They made an appearance at the National Sports Grill in Fullerton Tuesday 
night, they broadcast from Poncho's in Manhattan Beach Thursday, and today they 
will be at Johnny M's in San Diego for lunch. Hartman also will be at the 
Stuffed Pizza in Del Mar Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before television work with ESPN2 began occupying his evenings, midday host 
Jim Rome made public appearances almost nightly, and his popularity soared. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC, meanwhile, marketed with billboards and mailings and had its announcers 
involved in stunts with sponsors rather than out meeting the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But then much of KMPC's crew was made up of sportswriters whose radio gigs 
were second jobs. They didn't have time for public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said XTRA spent less on marketing but gained more "by being out among 
the listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's motto could be: Shake a hand, gain a listener. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for XTRA's victory was continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out the scorecard and start counting how many changes KMPC made," 
Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC started out with Robert W. Morgan in the morning, Joe McDonnell and Todd 
Christensen at midday, Jim Lampley in the afternoon, a baseball show with Steve 
Yeager, Geoff Witcher and Bob Rowe in the evenings and Fred Wallin overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, basically a disc jockey, was uncomfortable working on an all-sports 
station and eventually left for KRTH-FM. There wasn't enough room for the egos 
of McDonnell and Christensen in one studio and Christensen quit. Lampley went 
to mornings to replace Morgan but also eventually quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportswriter Doug Krikorian was paired with McDonnell and those two went to 
afternoons. Two more sportswriters, Brian Golden and Paola Boivin, took over 
the midday slot. Wallin got off the overnight shift and took the evening spot, 
and newcomer Tony Femino took Wallin's old spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lampley was replaced by Chris Roberts and Jack Snow, and then in June of 1993, 
Krikorian, Golden and Boivin were all fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallin replaced Roberts and Snow, Femino went to midday and McDonnell, despite 
starting to click with Krikorian, was told to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The dour Wallin failed miserably in the mornings, and Femino, a success in the 
wee hours, failed in daytime hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott O'Neil, a former KMPC disc jockey who was serving as both a disc jockey 
and program director at FM sister station K-LITE, was brought in and asked to 
save a sinking ship. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil did the best he could. He immediately lifted morale. He brought in 
upbeat Charlie Tuna for the mornings and brought back Golden and Krikorian and 
paired them in the midday slot. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Golden and Krikorian, after a successful run and increased ratings, 
got fired for failing to appear at a sponsor's function. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, the sale of the station loomed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, XTRA stayed with its cornerstone people -- the Cannons, Rome 
and Hamilton -- and developed an upbeat and entertaining nighttime show with 
Rick Schwartz and Steve Mason, a team that was broken up in February when Mason 
left the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently did XTRA tinker with its lineup. Trying to broaden its morning 
listening audience, it moved the Cannons to a later morning slot and moved 
Schwartz to early mornings with FM disc jockeys Mike Berger and Jeff Prescott. 
The new morning show initially drew criticism because there was no sports talk 
at all, but it is beginning to find its niche. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who is to blame for KMPC's failure? 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, with tongue only slightly in cheek, said he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take full responsibility for killing off sports talk in Los Angeles," he 
said. "Shortly after I turned down an offer from George Green (KABC's general 
manager who is now also the general manager of the new KMPC), KABC took 
'Sportstalk' off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then KMPC wanted to hire me, but I turned them down too. So I'll take full 
responsibility, and you can put that in your newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamilton also said, "I am saddened by the failure of KMPC because it put 
people out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Others at XTRA echoed the same sentiment. No one there is gloating. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of hard-working people at KMPC are now out of work. The list includes 
established radio veterans Tuna, Witcher, Scott St. James and Dr. Angel Fever 
himself, Rowe, a KMPC employee since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 St. James, who is still looking for a break in acting, a craft he has been 
studying for years, currently has a small role in the soap opera "The Young and 
the Restless." But he will be done taping on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I don't know what I'm going to do," he said. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The expected deal between XTRA and UCLA was announced Thursday. XTRA will 
continue to carry San Diego State, but the station said any conflicts will be 
worked out to the satisfaction of both parties. There might be some King 
conflicts as well. UCLA announcers will be hired by XTRA with the school's 
approval. UCLA wants Chris Roberts to continue working football with David 
Norrie and basketball with Marques Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA, continuing to establish more of a presence in Los Angeles, plans to move 
its nighttime show to the Los Angeles area. John Ireland, the current host, is 
the leading candidate to continue in that role once the show moves. . . . XTRA 
earlier tried to hire Joe McDonnell for nights, but McDonnell stayed at KMPC 
and now is the lone survivor. He'll be doing sports commentaries and reports on 
the new KMPC morning show beginning Monday. . . . XTRA, which will carry NBA 
playoff broadcasts through the finals, next will start carrying ESPN radio 
features and programs formerly on KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 A caller to Jim Rome's show Wednesday wanted to know why TNT didn't switch 
from Tuesday night's Utah-San Antonio blowout to Houston-Portland. The reason 
was that sister network TBS was carrying Houston-Portland. . . . Former UCLA 
defensive back Ron Pitts, who played in the NFL with Buffalo and Green Bay, has 
been hired as an NFL commentator by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 A multi-fight pay-per-view card usually means none of the fights could stand 
on its own. The exception is Saturday's SET card from Las Vegas, featuring four 
championship rematches, including Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Frankie Randall. Jay 
Larkin, SET's executive producer, said the hope is that this card will give 
pay-per-view boxing a needed boost. The 6 p.m. card will be available in 25 
million homes nationwide and the price on most systems varies from $29.95 to 
$34.95. The order of the fights is Azumah Nelson vs. Jesse James Leija, Simon 
Brown vs. Terry Norris, Gerald McClellan vs. Julian Jackson, and then Chavez 
vs. Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis fights Phil Jackson on 
HBO tonight on a two-fight card that begins at 6:45. . . . Thursday night's 
Olympic Auditorium card, originally scheduled to be shown live on ESPN, will 
instead be shown today at 5 p.m. . . . ABC's Jim McKay returns as the host of 
the Kentucky Derby for the 20th consecutive year Saturday, and Dave Johnson 
will call the race.

NHL ROUNDUP; RANGERS, RICHTER GETTING USED TO SHUTOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It can't be this easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every athlete wants to play on a team that's on this type of roll," said New 
York's Craig MacTavish after the Rangers won their seventh playoff game in a 
row, 3-0, over the Washington Capitals in Landover, Md., Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not naive enough to take it for granted," MacTavish said. "It's nice 
while it lasts." 
</P>
<P>
 It has lasted through two series -- a sweep of the New York Islanders and a 
3-0 lead over the Capitals -- in part because of Mike Richter's goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 New York made it easier for him, scoring power-play goals by Brian Leetch and 
Mark Messier in the first 14 minutes. Washington challenged him with only 21 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter's three shutouts are one short of matching the NHL record for one 
playoff year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richter has played very well in all three games in this series," Capital 
Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. "Every time they had a breakdown, he was there to 
make sure it didn't get in the net. You have to give him a lot of credit, not 
only for the game tonight but for the Rangers' success thus far in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 New York has not swept two consecutive series since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down three games, but it's not over," Washington defenseman Sylvain 
Cote said. "We've just got to win here Saturday and then hope for the best back 
in New York. We're not ready to die right now." 
</P>
<P>
 They might not have much choice. The Rangers, vying for their first Stanley 
Cup since 1940, have outscored their opponents, 36-8, in setting a club record 
for consecutive playoff victories. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 4, Boston 2 -- The Devils switched goalies and turned around the 
momentum in their playoff series at Boston that has been dominated by the road 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Terreri made 25 saves in his first playoff start this season, and Tom 
Chorske scored twice as the Devils cut the Bruins' lead to 2-1 in the 
best-of-seven Eastern Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting team has won all three games in the series, which continues 
Saturday night with Game 4 in Boston, where the Bruins have a 2-3 record during 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Terreri was not challenged often by the Bruins, but he challenged them. After 
being checked hard by Brent Hughes behind his net with 11:30 to play, Terreri 
went after Hughes at the next stoppage of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Terreri hit Hughes with his stick, gloves and blocker. He got two roughing 
penalties and gave up Iafrate's power-play goal 22 seconds later as the Bruins 
pulled within 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got ugly, with two fights in the final seconds. New Jersey's Mike 
Peluso flicked his stick at a fan during a fight, and other fans doused the New 
Jersey bench with soda and beer. Boston Coach Brian Sutter tried to go after 
the Devils' Bill Guerin after the second fight.

 The back-to-back plays by Angel center fielder Chad Curtis Wednesday night in 
the 13th inning of a 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees were the greatest 
his manager and several teammates had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen back-to-back plays like that in my life," Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said starting pitcher Joe Magrane: "After seeing that, you can burn that 
Willie Mays tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Said right fielder Tim Salmon, who played alongside Curtis at Grand Canyon 
College: "I never have never seen him make a play like that. In fact, I've 
never seen anyone make a play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 It happened with one out and Don Mattingly on second base. Gerald Williams hit 
a drive that began sailing over Curtis' head. Curtis ran back at nearly full 
speed, stuck his glove in the air, and caught it over his left shoulder. 
Mattingly, who was caught halfway between second and third, had no choice but 
to retreat to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Right afterward, Paul O'Neill slapped a single to center. Curtis, knowing that 
Mattingly would be sent home, charged the ball, and threw it with all his might 
while somersaulting in the air. The throw was perfect, and catcher Jorge 
Fabregas was waiting with the ball when Mattingly arrived home, tagging him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Relievers Joe Grahe and Bob Patterson were the unsung heroes in Wednesday's 
game, pitching 5 2/3 shutout innings. It was the first time either had appeared 
in a winning game for the Angels since April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been involved in any kind of playoffs," Grahe said, "but as much 
as we needed a win, that was the greatest win I've ever been a part of. Boy, we 
needed that one. It was like a playoff game for us. Hopefully, we can look back 
and that one and say that was the one that got us going." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez will be kept out of the starting lineup 
until at least Saturday, Rodgers said, while they attempt to get him out of his 
hitting slump. Perez is batting .200 this season, and only .146 since April 22. 
Perez, who also is playing with a strained ligament in his left wrist, was 
replaced in the lineup by Jim Edmonds . . . Angel third-base coach Ken Macha 
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow, and missed Thursday's the 
game. First base coach Bobby Knoop moved to third, and bullpen coach Max 
Oliveras moved to first . . . The Athletics activated second baseman Brent 
Gates before the game, and designated Mike Brumley for assignment. The move 
also sends former Dodger Steve Sax back to the bench. . . . Angel catcher Jorge 
Fabregas, who was called up when Greg Myers was placed on the disabled list, 
began the game batting .381, throwing out three of seven potential base 
stealers. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Two consecutive defensive plays by center fielder Chad Curtis in the 13th 
inning of Wednesday night's 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees were among 
the greatest his manager and teammates have seen.

 "I've never seen back-to-back plays like that in my life," Manager Buck

<P>
 Curtis barely had time to see the replay on the scoreboard when Paul O'Neill 
slapped a single to center. Curtis, knowing that Mattingly would be sent home, 
charged the ball and threw it before somersaulting on his follow-through. The 
throw was perfect, and catcher Jorge Fabregas was waiting with the ball when 
Mattingly arrived home, tagging him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis was mobbed by his teammates when he reached the dugout, and the crowd 
went into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real good week for me so far," said Curtis, whose wife delivered 
a baby girl on Monday.

 The Boston Red Sox put pitcher Frank Viola on the 60-day disabled list after 
tests revealed he had damaged muscles on the inside of his left elbow and a 
partially torn ligament. . . . A day after an injury sidelined him for several 
days, Florida Marlin catcher Benito Santiago dropped his appeal of a four-game 
suspension and immediately began serving the penalty. Santiago was suspended on 
April 21 by National League President Len Coleman for charging pitcher Kevin 
Rogers and starting a bench-clearing brawl against the San Francisco Giants.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; SABERHAGEN PICKS UP WHERE HE LEAVES OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had been nine years, but it seemed like yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Bret Saberhagen pitched a five-hitter and beat the Cardinals, 8-1, 
Thursday night in a St. Louis outing reminiscent of his dominating performances 
for the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen was 2-0 with an 0.50 earned-run average and was named the Series 
most valuable player for Kansas City in 1985. Ozzie Smith, the only remaining 
Cardinal from that series, said Thursday that the only thing that had changed 
about Saberhagen was his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had it all tonight," Smith said. "Good fastball, good breaking ball, good 
changeup, good bat, good running. He's the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Those long-ago feats were on Saberhagen's mind when he got to Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I still think about it? Yeah, definitely," Saberhagen said. "You come to a 
place and the people always remind you. They were yelling ' '85 World Series' 
and stuff tonight, and I still sign a lot of memorabilia from that series." 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (4-1) stopped two streaks: the Cardinals' 12-game home-run streak 
that tied a team record set in 1955 and Gregg Jefferies' 17-game hitting 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Philadelphia 0 -- Chris Hammond pitched a seven-hitter and Jerry 
Browne tripled home three runs in the first inning for the Marlins in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond (2-3) walked one and struck out five in pitching his first nine-inning 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies have lost six consecutive road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 8, Cincinnati 6 -- Luis Gonzalez singled home the go-ahead run in the 
10th inning as the Astros recovered from Brian Dorsett's ninth-inning grand 
slam at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsett had tied it, 6-6, with a two-out grand slam -- the first of his career 
-- off Tom Edens. AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 11, Toronto 9 -- The Royals got home runs from Greg Gagne and 
Brent Mayne at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kansas City trailing, 5-0, Gagne hit a three-run homer in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 7-3, the Royals scored five runs in the third to take an 8-7 lead. Felix 
Jose singled in a run and Mayne hit his first grand slam.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL PUT ON 15-DAY DISABLED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell was put on the 15-day disabled list after suffering a muscle 
strain in his left side Wednesday while pitching against the Montreal Expos. 
Worrell accompanied the team to San Francisco, then flew to Los Angeles on 
Thursday, where he was examined by Dr. Ralph Gambardella. X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 With Worrell sidelined, Manager Tom Lasorda said he will turn to Darren 
Dreifort to be the closer. Dreifort, destined for that role eventually, said he 
is ready. "If that's what they want me to do, yes," he said before getting the 
save in Thursday's victory.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers activated left-handed reliever Al Osuna from triple-A Albuquerque 
to take Worrell's place on the roster, giving the Dodgers three left-handed 
relievers. Osuna, from Inglewood, was acquired by the Dodgers in a trade with 
the Houston Astros during spring training.  
</P>
<P>
 Osuna, 28, played at Cerritos College and Stanford and was a 16th-round pick 
of the Houston Astros in 1987. His best season was 1991, when, as a rookie, he 
had a 7-6 record with 12 saves and a 3.42 earned-run average in 71 appearances 
and 81 2/3 innings.  
</P>
<P>
 In nine games at Albuquerque, he has given up six earned runs in 12 innings 
for a 4.50 ERA, with one save. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move, the Dodgers released pitcher Nelson Castro, who was 3-2 with 
a 5.25 ERA in six starts for double-A San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Dodgers shouted insults at Matt Williams of the Giants during the 
season finale last year, but the loudest insults did not come from Orel 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers say the loudest guy on the bench that day was minor leaguer Jerry 
Brooks, who was with the team at the time. But when Williams went on television 
and accused Hershiser of yelling, Hershiser called Williams and told him he 
hadn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was standing next to (Kevin) Gross when he stood up and yelled out to Matt 
after a couple of our guys got knocked down (by pitches), Cory (Snyder) and 
another guy," Hershiser said. "Gross (who was pitching that day) yelled to Matt 
that he was the leadoff hitter the next inning, and Matt yelled back, 'Do what 
you have to do.'  
</P>
<P>
 "But Matt was getting badgered the entire game by our bench, one player was 
particularly loud, nothing ugly, just normal badgering, but given the value of 
that game for them, it made it more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who apologized to Hershiser publicly, said he took Hershiser at his 
word. "I went about expressing my emotions the wrong way and I don't think that 
was characteristic of me," Williams said. MARYANN HUDSON

VOLLEYBALL / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; BRUINS, THE BEST IN THE WEST, ALSO THE ONLY

 UCLA has been tabbed all season as the overwhelming favorite to win the NCAA 
men's volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that's not enough pressure, the Bruins are also the only hope to keep 
the championship trophy on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked and defending champion UCLA (26-1) takes on fourth-seeded 
Indiana-Purdue Ft. Wayne (19-6) tonight at the Allen County War Memorial 
Coliseum in the second national semifinal. In the opener, second-seeded Penn 
State (24-3) faces third-seeded Ball State (27-9). 
</P>
<P>
 The winners play for the title Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the tournament's 25-year history, there are not two West 
Coast schools in the final four. West Coast schools have won every 
championship, with UCLA taking 14. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, Ball State and Penn State earned automatic berths along with conference 
championships. Ft. Wayne was given the at-large nod over Stanford, which won 
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation postseason tournament after the Bruins 
had beaten the Cardinal for the league's automatic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Al Scates refused to give his rivals extra incentive when asked 
about reports that West Coast teams don't respect those from the Midwest and 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have been misinformed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is led by middle blocker Jeff Nygaard, who was selected the American 
Volleyball Coaches Assn. player of the year Thursday.

ROUNDUP; SEA KINGS EARN SHARE OF THE TITLE

<P>
 Corona del Mar upset eighth-ranked Newport Harbor in five games Thursday, 
helping the Sea Kings earn a share of the Sea View League boys' volleyball 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Hoppe had 26 kills and Brad Callahan added 12 to lead the Sea Kings to 
a 3-15, 15-4, 15-8, 11-15, 15-6 victory at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar (14-2, 12-2 in league) lost to Newport Harbor in four games 
during their first match, so Newport Harbor will be the league's top-seeded 
team for the Southern Section playoffs, which begin May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mitch McCoy had a match-high 28 kills for Newport Harbor (13-4, 
12-2), the Sailors were sluggish after an easy 15-3 victory in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 2, Hoppe and Brian Coleman had three kills each to help Corona del Mar 
take an 11-1 lead. In Game 3, Hoppe and McCoy had eight kills each, but the Sea 
Kings won eight of the last 10 points to take a two-games-to-one lead. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy's jump serve helped the Sailors win five consecutive points to take an 
11-8 lead in Game 4. Newport Harbor won to force a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sea Kings took a 10-3 lead in Game 5 and closed out the match with 
three points on three consecutive Newport Harbor errors. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

 The Mission Viejo boys' tennis team clinched second place in the South Coast 
League and secured a spot in the Southern Section playoffs with a 13 1/3-7 2/3 
victory over El Toro Thursday at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important for us to win today, because obviously the No. 2 team gets a 
much better draw," Mission Viejo Coach Bill Smith said."The chances are we will 
play another second- or third-place team in the first round and there is only 
one second-place team we wouldn't want to face . . . University. Everyone else 
we are comfortable with."

 El Toro (15-9, 5-5 in league) needed the victory to clinch a tie for second 
place with the Diablos, But the Chargers fell into a tie for third with San 
Clemente and will face the Tritons today in a tiebreaker match to decide the 
final playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo (10-10, 7-3) led throughout, behind the play of its doubles 
teams. After two rounds, the Diablos led, 8 1/3-5 2/3. El Toro knew it could 
rely on John France and Alex Brown to win their final sets in singles, but they 
needed a sweep in doubles to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Diablos were the ones with the sweep and the victory. Fernando 
Machuca and Christian Fernandez swept their sets, 6-2, 6-1, 6-0, and Josh Fair 
and Coung Tran also swept, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. Toffer Patton and Derek Toross won 
4-6, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally found some combos that help us win more," Smith said. "I don't 
think we have any one strength; we are just very well balanced. I don't think 
our record reflects how good we really are." MELANIE NEFF

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham, the wit, summed up his contributions to the training 
career of a protege. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I taught you everything you know," he told Rodney Rash. "But not everything I 
know." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rash, 34, worked for Whittingham, 81, for 15 years and was his top assistant 
when the Bald Eagle saddled Ferdinand and Sunday Silence for victories in the 
Kentucky Derby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, they will be rivals, Rash's Powis Castle matched against 
Whittingham's Strodes Creek and 13 others. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle is 30-1, but his conditioner kind of fancies his chances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a live longshot," Rash said Thursday at his barn before drawing the 
favorable No. 3 post. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbeaten, two for two, at Churchill Downs," he said. "He's been working 
very well and should be able to handle any kind of track condition. Chris 
Antley is a terrific rider who fits the horse perfectly." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But if Powis Castle doesn't spring the upset, Rash hopes that Strodes Creek, 
8-1 in the morning line, does. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'll be rooting for Charlie if we can't get there," Rash said. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie would have been a success no matter what career he had chosen. In the 
military, he would have been a MacArthur, in politics a Reagan, in religion the 
Pope." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rash joined Alcoholics Anonymous eight years ago and hasn't had a drink since. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd cry if I won the Kentucky Derby," he said. "I had lost faith in myself. I 
didn't like myself. To win the Derby would be so important to me, so 
unbelievable." . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Every year, ABC cameras isolate four horses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Even though no favorites have won, the network has isolated seven of the last 
eight winners, missing only Lil E. Tee two years ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Curt Gowdy Jr. (the producer) and I will pick the four horses Saturday 
morning," associate producer Steve Nagler said. "We'll probably go with a 
couple of well-bet horses and a couple of outsiders." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Co-host Al Michaels is picking longshot Blumin Affair. His selection should be 
respected. Michaels cashed a winning ticket on 133-1 shot Arcangues in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 200 of 10,000 hotel rooms in Jefferson County remain available for 
the weekend. A couple of venerable downtown establishments are charging $1,400 
for three nights' residence in a small room. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Soul Of The Matter, who beat Brocco and Valiant Nature in the San Felipe 
at Santa Anita, is 20-1, you know this is the deepest Derby field in years. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturing of Louisville Slugger bats is supposed to be moved to, of 
all places, Louisville within two years. They have been made in Clark County, 
Ind., the last 22 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Winick, whose Brocco has trained here better than anyone in the field, 
loves the Churchill Downs oval. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "After three days of pouring rain, the track was fast," Winick said. "I wish 
we could transport this surface to Southern California." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former football coach Jimmy Johnson continues to enjoy the good life. Johnson, 
who took in the Michael Moorer-Evander Holyfield fight at Las Vegas, will be at 
the Derby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas will watch the race on television with friends in Southern 
California. . . .. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff is very much in tune with what's going on here," said his father, Wayne. 
"We talk on the phone every day and he wants to know how all the horses are 
working and he's already analyzed the race." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Jeff's scenario has Tabasco Cat, the horse who knocked him down and 
seriously injured him last year, staying close to the pace and then storming 
home in front. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, who will ride Brocco, visited his 1988 Derby-winning mount, 
Winning Colors, in Lexington on Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Stevens said. "The barn manager said she was so mean that 
nobody could get within 10 feet of her. Well, I yelled, 'Yo, Mama' from a 
distance, walked right up to her, and she was as nice as could be." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Run for the Roses is presented a garland of 554 roses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry, on what he will tell Eddie Delahoussaye before he 
rides Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks today: "If you have to give him 
instructions, you've got the wrong jockey."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; GARRIDO HOPES BASEBALL TEAM HAS 
HEARD WAKE-UP CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton baseball Coach Augie Garrido was disappointed with the 
Titans' showing in the first two games of last weekend's Big West series 
against Nevada, but he remains hopeful they will bounce back and finish well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to build on this series and let it serve as a wake-up call for us," 
Garrido said. "What happened is history now, and our season is still out in 
front of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada, with the best hitting team in the Big West, overwhelmed the Titans' 
strong pitching in the first two games. The Wolf Pack won, 5-2, last Friday 
and, 7-2, on Saturday before Fullerton rebounded to win, 8-0, Sunday behind 
pitcher Dan Ricabal's three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 30 players, and on Friday they seemed to be in 30 different frames of 
mind," Garrido said. "We didn't execute well or play well in the first two 
games. It was hard for us to get back to playing well (on Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, however, gave credit to Nevada. "They didn't sneak up on us," he 
said. "They're good . . . and well-coached. We knew they could hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido felt the series underlined that the Titans can't take their starting 
pitching for granted. The Wolf Pack got to Mike Parisi for nine hits and five 
runs in 3 1/3 innings in the first game and then had eight hits and seven runs 
in six innings off Matt Wagner. Parisi fell to 9-3. It was Wagner's first loss 
to go with 10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, however, is that Nevada is in first place in the Big West at 
11-4 and Fullerton is percentage points behind in second at 12-5. Long Beach 
State is 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada has six conference games remaining, three at home this weekend against 
San Jose State and a three-game series at UC Santa Barbara the next weekend. 
Long Beach State has three games at Nevada Las Vegas and three at home against 
Pacific. Fullerton has a three-game series at New Mexico State this weekend and 
a possible makeup game from a rainout at Pacific if it has impact on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The two losses cost Fullerton (36-10) the No. 1 spot in the national rankings. 
Baseball America dropped Fullerton to third behind Georgia Tech (35-10) and 
Florida State (40-13). Fullerton fell to seventh, one spot behind Nevada 
(34-8), in Collegiate Baseball's rankings. Clemson (45-13) is ranked first and 
Georgia Tech second. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan softball team has found new life, and is rolling along with an 
11-game winning streak after beating UC Santa Barbara, 9-1 and 3-1, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning three consecutive games from Hawaii, the conference leader, put 
Fullerton in high gear and the Titans haven't slowed since. The surge has 
carried them to third place in the Big West with a 17-9 record, and they are 
only percentage points behind second-place Nevada Las Vegas (18-6). Hawaii 
leads at 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Mortensen has been the winning pitcher in six of those games and 
Trinity Johnson has accounted for the other five victories. Mortensen is 17-14 
with a 1.95 earned-run average. Johnson has moved up to 11-10 with a 2.20 ERA, 
and has a 0.65 ERA in her last six starts. Mortensen has a 1.41 ERA in her last 
nine appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans have five hitters over .300: Monica Bagalayos (.331), Jstone Vines 
(.330), Heidi Robertson (.321), Melissa Hadfield (.315) and Traci Fischer 
(.309). Robertson has hit .529 and Vines .464 in the past 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real difference in the team lately has been confidence," Coach 
Judi Garman said. "Our team feels that good things are going to happen and 
they're going to make them happen. We are a young team, and I think early in 
the season the players were afraid they were going to make mistakes, and that's 
what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton plays doubleheaders at Long Beach State today and at Nevada Las 
Vegas Sunday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Mike Tansley won the 3,000-meter steeplechase Sunday at the 
California-Nevada Collegiate track meet at UCLA, and Coach John Elders hopes 
Tansley will be able to qualify for the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley's time of 8:56.28 was below the provisional NCAA qualifying time of 
8:57 for the event. "That time doesn't guarantee him a spot in the national 
meet, but I feel he'll be able to make it," Elders said. "I feel he can make it 
if he can run 8:52, and I think he should be able to run that." The runners 
with the top 15 times qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley was surprised. "I had a wisdom tooth pulled last Wednesday and really 
wasn't feeling that well," he said. "I almost didn't go to the meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tansley is optimistic about further improvement at the Big West Conference 
meet, May 13-14 at Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The California State University system has begun the formal process of 
appealing the $1.35-million wrongful termination verdict awarded to former 
volleyball coach Jim Huffman in February. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU has hired the Irvine-based firm of Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold to 
handle the appeal, which began with the April 22 filing of a notice to appeal 
and Monday's filing of the Designation of the Record in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Huffman, Jim's brother and attorney, said the case would not go before 
an appellate judge until the end of 1994 or early 1995, at the earliest. The 
award earns 10% interest until the case is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Huffman, whose firm was awarded $300,000 in attorneys fees and court 
costs, said the school system declined a recent settlement offer of $1.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke," Huffman said of the appeal. "It's a loser. They know it's a 
loser and they're doing it anyway. We're ready to settle and save them money, 
and they have an appeal they can't win. When it's over, the judgment will be 
well over $2 million, and someone will have some explaining to do."

 Hollywood Park will offer wagering on the Kentucky Derby today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Betting on the Derby and the 16 other races -- five simulcasts from Churchill 
Downs, two from Golden Gate Fields and nine live races -- will be accepted from 
7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. today and during the races tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates will open at 9 a.m. Saturday and the first of the simulcasts from 
Churchill Downs, the $75,000 American Turf, will be shown at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The EZQ will be history after tonight's races. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bet, a form of the quinella that allowed players to cash if their 
horses finished 1-2, 1-3 or 2-3, has been eliminated and replaced with the 
traditional quinella, in which a bettor has to select the first two finishers 
in either order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said on opening day we would measure the feedback from our patrons and 
their preference is clear -- they want to have the option of playing the 
quinella," said Rick Baedeker, Hollywood Park's vice president for marketing 
and publicity.

 Exercise rider William Strauss, 57, died of what appeared to be a heart attack 
after working a horse Thursday morning at Hollywood Park.

ROMERO WINS TITLE AT OLYMPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Romero, a boxing coach from Albuquerque, N.M., realized early that his 
son, Danny Jr., was destined to be a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been training him since he was 5," the elder Romero said. "Everybody 
used to tell me that he had all the moves. He started jumping rope just like a 
fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero built a makeshift ring in his back yard, where he trains his son, now 
19, and the other fighters in his stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero scored a second-round technical knockout over Brian Lonon of Las Vegas 
to win the vacant North American Boxing Federation flyweight championship 
Thursday night before an announced crowd of 1,400 at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium  
</P>
<P>
 Romero knocked down Lonon three times in the second round before referee Vince 
Delgado stopped the fight with one second left in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero (16-0 with 14 knockouts) floored Lonon with a right to the chin. After 
Lonon (18-2) got up, Romero knocked him down with another right to the chin 
before using a combination to knock him down a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had studied the tapes and we knew he was awkward, and I was going to fight 
him with my best and that's my jab " said Romero, who weighed 111 1/2. "And 
that's what set the tempo for the big right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't prepare for a second-round knockout, I prepared for 12 rounds of 
hard, hard work and as you saw it paid off in two." 
</P>
<P>
 In his third fight after a 2 1/2-year suspension for testing positive for 
cocaine, John Tapia of Albuquerque scored a unanimous 10-round decision over 
Antonio Ruiz of Mexico in a super-flyweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Henry Ellispuru and Lou Moret each had it 100-90 for Tapia and judge 
Jose Corbian had it 97-93. Both fighters weighed 113 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia, who had his boxing license revoked by the New Mexico State Athletic 
Commission in October of 1991 after a third positive test for cocaine, is 
24-0-1 with 14 knockouts. Ruiz fell to 15-5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Romero want to fight Tapia because they're from the same town? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen him and he's a tremendous fighter," Romero said. "We're in two 
separate weight divisions. We're from the same town and we're striving for the 
same thing -- to build a great boxing town. Why press that fight now?"

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; 'ADIEU' TO A SONGWRITER; * VETERAN ACTOR-SINGER NOEL 
HARRISON WILL PAY A MUSICAL TRIBUTE TO JACQUES BREL, ONE OF FRANCE'S BEST-KNOWN 
ENTERTAINERS, AT A NEW THEATER IN STUDIO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Actor and singer Noel Harrison was scheduled to unveil his award-winning show, 
"Adieu, Jacques . . . ," a musical tribute to the late French singer and 
songwriter Jacques Brel, to San Fernando Valley audiences Thursday night at the 
new Ventura Court Theatre in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, the son of late actor and theater legend Sir Rex Harrison, is 
probably best remembered for starring with Stephanie Powers in "The Girl From 
U.N.C.L.E." television series in the mid-1960s and for his several Top 40 
recordings, including the Academy Award-winning "Windmills of Your Mind" 
(1968). 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he has performed roles in regional productions of various stage 
musicals, including Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady," a role his father 
originated on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has performed "Adieu, Jacques . . ." off and on since 1989. Last 
year, he won a Drama-Logue Award for his performance. In the show, Harrison, 
accompanying himself on the guitar, sings 15 of Brel's compositions in French 
and provides an English translation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has admired Brel's work for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him perform live in 1960," Harrison said. "As a kid, I was attracted to 
French music, and I was very moved." 
</P>
<P>
 Brel was born in the Flemish section of Belgium in 1929. His musical career 
began in the early 1950s, and he became one of France's most successful 
entertainers. At the height of his popularity in 1967, he quit his music career 
to pursue other interests. He didn't make another record until 1977, just 
months before he died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is not the only one showcasing Brel's songs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another show featuring Brel's music, "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well . . . and 
Living in Paris," starring Teri Ralston, Jeff McCarthy, Jeffrey Rockwell and 
Sue Hull, is at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 This 1968 show, which has been produced many times and was also made into a 
feature film, is primarily responsible for introducing Brel to American 
audiences. An ensemble cast of four singers usually performs translations of 23 
Brel compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine is a totally different show," Harrison said. "People with an interest in 
Brel would enjoy both productions." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's show is the first mounted at the new Ventura Court Theatre. The 
theater management boasts of its new, state-of-the-art equipment, including 
computerized lighting and sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adieu, Jacques . . ." will run 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays 
through May 28 at the theater, 12417 Ventura Ct., Studio City. Tickets are $15. 
Call (818) 763-3856. 
</P>
<P>
 THERE GOES THE BRIDE: The Cal State Northridge production of Federico Garcia 
Lorca's "Blood Wedding" ( "Bodas de Sangre" ) continues tonight in the Little 
Theatre. The play, which will be presented in Spanish and English, is a 
co-production of the CSUN theater and foreign language departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The English version of the play will feature student actors from the theater 
arts department, and the Spanish version will be performed by foreign language 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The two departments have been collaborating on annual productions since 1990, 
said Dorette Egilsson, a foreign language professor and professional actress 
who is the production's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Lorca," Egilsson said. "It's a real challenge for the actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorca (1895-1936), one of Spain's best-known modern poets and playwrights, was 
killed by Falangist soldiers in the opening days of the Spanish Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote "Blood Wedding," his most famous work, in 1933. The story is about a 
bride in an arranged marriage who runs away with her lover. The lover is 
subsequently murdered by the husband. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Blood Wedding' was picked because of its tremendous passion," Egilsson 
said. "It awakens the tragic emotions of pity and terror, with the ultimate 
anguish of the mother and the bride." 
</P>
<P>
 The English version will be presented at 8 p.m. today, Saturday and Sunday. 
The Spanish version plays Thursday and May 13 to 15. There also are matinees. 
Tickets are $8, $6 senior citizens and $4 CSUN students. For a complete 
performance schedule, call (818) 885-3093. 
</P>
<P>
 AT THE MOVIES: Close to four months after the Northridge temblor, three movie 
theaters in the greater San Fernando Valley area remain closed due to 
earthquake damage: the General Cinema Center in Northridge, the United Artists 
Valley Plaza theater in North Hollywood and the Mann Sycamore theater in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, the Mann theater seems closest to a reopening date. A Mann 
representative said that although a definite date has not been set, the theater 
is expected to reopen before summer. 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists officials in Colorado have scheduled July 1 as the reopening 
date of the Valley Plaza Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an extensive amount of seismic-upgrade work," project manager Tim Ward 
said. "And we did some remodeling as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a General Cinema representative said no decision has been reached 
on whether the Northridge theater will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the severe damage to Northridge Fashion Center, where the theater 
is located, company personnel have not been able to inspect the premises, so no 
decision has been made on its future.

BEHIND THIS GREAT MAN IS A WOMAN; * IN '221 B BAKER STREET,' SHERLOCK HOLMES IS 
A FEMALE DETECTIVE WHO HIDES HER TRUE SEXUAL IDENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Therese Lentz loves Sherlock Holmes. She especially loves Billy Wilder's 1970 
film "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes." She loves the character so much, in 
fact, that she decided to turn Holmes into a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "221 B Baker Street" -- currently in previews at Group Repertory 
Theatre -- in which the famous detective solves crimes while concealing her 
true sexual identity. "It's vital to her existence that 19th-Century England 
not find out she's a woman," says the playwright, 31, who's also producing the 
show and understudying the lead role. "At that time in history, they were 
starving women in prisons because they wanted to vote. Women were pretty things 
that sat in a corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this woman. The eight-character story finds "Mr. Holmes" on the case of a 
young man whose aunt has committed suicide the night before, changing her will 
at the last moment and leaving her entire estate to her servants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the play's sense of humor," says director Patricia Lee Willson, who is 
segueing to this show from her recent acting turn in "I Never Sang For My 
Father" at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Willson, who also counts herself as a Sherlock Holmes fan, directed the play's 
first reading three years ago at GRT and has been along for the long ride. 
"Therese kept rewriting, and it kept getting funnier," Willson says. "I'd 
describe it as a comedy with a lot of plot, because there is a mystery -- and 
just a smidge of 'Victorian- woman- has- to- pretend- she's- a- man- to- have- 
a- great- career.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lentz admits that she's been sitting on this story for more than a decade; 
when she first came up with the gender-bender slant, it was the time of 
"Tootsie" and "Victor / Victoria." 
</P>
<P>
 "I let the idea float in my brain for a while," she says of "Baker Street," 
which will mark her full-length, main stage writing debut. "It took a year to 
get the first draft out." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, there have been other distractions: playing mom to 4-year-old 
Sara, and working full-time as a junior high school substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Illinois and raised in Arizona, Lentz graduated from Occidental 
College as a theater major, with a performance emphasis. "The idea was you need 
to do everything," she says. "So I put myself through school building sets, 
designing costumes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in school that she also wrote her first one-act, the real-life story of 
how her parents got married one day after they met. "Acting is still my first 
love," she says, "although writing is probably the way I can making a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Lentz is confident that theater audiences won't have any problem making the 
leap of faith to Lady Sherlock. "Shakespeare always had women disguised as men 
to protect them," she points out. "If you go with the idea of her being a 
woman, a lot of the (character's) eccentricities begin to make sense. All you 
have to say is 'What if?' " WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "221 B Baker Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Group Repertory Theatre, 10900 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Opens May 13, and plays at 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 3 p.m. 
Sundays. Closes June 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Previews are free. After opening, $12 general admission, $10 students 
and seniors.

DIGGING OUT A HISTORY; * JOE LUCAS' SOLO SHOW 'ONCE A MAN, TWICE A BOY' DRAWS 
ON FAMILY MEMORIES FOR AN INTIMATE TELLING OF MINERS' STRUGGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The simple, civilized handkerchief doesn't belong in the world of writer-actor 
Joe Lucas' solo performance work, "Once a Man, Twice a Boy." Simple civility 
had no place in the dank, dreary and bloodstained Pennsylvania coal mine 
communities where generations of Lucas' family were born and grew up and 
married and labored and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was a handkerchief that started the play on its course to tonight's 
opening at Theatre West. Lucas was studying 10 years ago with legendary acting 
teacher Nina Foch, who ran her students through an exercise requiring them to 
speak their feelings about a chosen object. Lucas happened to choose his 
grandfather's handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I held it, looked at it," Lucas says, sitting on the edge of the Theatre 
West stage, "it brought back a specter of the mines, my grandfather's slow, 
painful death -- the way miners usually died, from black lung disease -- and 
the lives people led in that memorable, terrible place. Nina was moved to 
tears, and, believe me, she's a very tough lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years passed, though, until Lucas, in his early 30s, wrote his memories 
down for a Theatre West workshop. Only later did Lucas realize that he was 
writing a solo play that opened a long-shuttered door on an ugly, brutish 
chapter of American history. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Once a Man, Twice a Boy" intertwines Lucas' account of himself and his 
father with an intimate telling of miners' lives, work and struggles, its 
dramatic centerpiece is the 1875 miners' strike, led by the Working Mans' 
Benevolent Assn. The organization, co-founded by Lucas' great-great 
grandfather, Thomas O'Neill, was the incipient union that later became the 
United Mine Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's men posed the first real challenge to the mining companies' iron 
grip on workers and families, triggering the companies to hire Pinkerton's 
National Detective Agency. "The Pinkertons," as they were known, Lucas says, 
concocted an imaginary cabal, supposedly led by O'Neill and others called the 
Molly Maguires. O'Neill and 19 others were tried, convicted and hanged for the 
murder of mining officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the largest mass executions in U.S. legal history," says Lucas. 
"The Pinkertons mistook old rituals the miners knew from the Irish fraternal 
group, the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, like handshakes and so on, and 
falsely attached them to a group conspiracy. It brought back all the old 
dislikes of the Irish -- the whole region was rife with ethnic conflicts -- and 
destroyed the strike's coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvanian historian Joe Wayne informed Lucas that he is the first 
descendant of the hanged strikers to tell this history, which Lucas says has 
been distorted in such previous tellings as Martin Ritt's 1970 film "The Molly 
Maguires." 
</P>
<P>
 The final work, resulting from many months' collaboration between Lucas and 
director Mark Travis, is "the expression of guilt and pain. Guilt, which is 
mine, because I describe how I left my family and hometown of Pottsville (Pa.) 
behind for UCLA, an education and a better life -- all while they suffered back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The pain is even more complex. Until the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration 
made it illegal, mining companies kept workers in permanent debt under a system 
in which the companies owned goods, services and property and issued a weekly 
"bobtail check" to each worker that tallied the money owed the company after 
expenses were deducted from wages. The result: Miners' children were born into 
debt. "If you tried to leave town," Lucas says, "company guards could shoot you 
on sight because you were considered a thief, running out on what you owed." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Joe told me this story," says Travis, "he was amazingly matter-of-fact 
about it, as if this were typical practice in any American town. He had so 
internalized it, because it had been such a fixed reality of those peoples' 
lives, that he didn't view it as something extraordinary. I mean, is there 
anything else like it in American history?"  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Travis says he has drawn out of Lucas other kinds of 
"assumptions, amazing details that needed explaining but that fill out the 
story." Unlike his usual practice, which is to develop an autobiographical 
script with a performer, Travis began working with Lucas after a few rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I heard it," Travis says, "it was a history lecture, but Joe 
the person was lost in it. I encouraged him to bring himself out more, which 
nicely worked with my core interest in the performer's personal journey and 
making that live on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this piece contains something I've never seen before, which is Joe's 
blending of his father, his growing up and the history of the mining region, 
turning history into a personal story." 
</P>
<P>
 It may have begun with a handkerchief, but it ends with the title, a miners' 
adage with a typically grim meaning. "As a boy miner," Lucas says, "you'd be 
assigned to pick out or 'size' coal. Then, as a man, you'd be sent down into 
the mine shafts. After they'd worn you out in the mines, you'd be sent back up 
to 'size' coal again, an old man working with the boys. So 'once a man, twice a 
boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas says it with a slight shudder, knowing how close he came to never 
leaving that life for UCLA and an acting career that includes everything from a 
four-year stint playing a gang member on "Days of Our Lives," to Brian Friel's 
drama, "Freedom of the City." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people my own age who've never left," he says without a hint of 
judgment. "Maybe, as bad as that place still is, they feel that the outside 
world is even worse." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; IT'S ROUGH SAILING FOR 'PIRATES' TALES OF PAST, PRESENT; * 
INEFFECTIVE PLAY TELLS STORY OF A NOTORIOUS WOMAN WHO LIVED ON THE SEAS AS A 
MAN, AND A PRESENT-DAY TEACHER'S VIEW OF HER.

 The authentic Anne Bonney lived her life as a man and became one of the Carib 
bean's more notorious and dangerous pirates during the era when white sails 
rose stiff against high winds and lonely ships were ripe for plundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Mark Lee's choice of Bonney as role model for his male-bashed 
present-day historian heroine in "Pirates" at the Road Theatre is sort of like 
presenting her namesake William Bonney (Billy the Kid) as a role model in Los 
Angeles high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The conceit does give Lee a springboard for his sexual-political agenda, which 
has college history teacher Helen Raymond longing for Bonney's freedom from 
male domination in her struggle to bring new ideas into the school's history 
department. Among minor flaws in the conceit is Raymond's ignoring of Bonney's 
cross-dressing as a weapon that gained her her freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Political agendas aside, Lee's one-note pageant presents its ideas firmly, but 
they do not grow out of human drama. The characters use movie-of-the-week speak 
and never confront anything more dramatically viable than the getting or losing 
of a job because you're a woman. It's an ineffective setup in this case because 
the job hunter in question, Raymond's protegee, Rebecca Skolnick, is 
self-centered, confused, vindictive and an escapist to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Hills has directed the work with imagination and some fire, especially in 
the 18th-Century scenes, in which Taylor Gilbert is superlative as the 
notorious Anne, with a rough-textured interior and a flashing surface. If some 
of the quick transitions from one period to the next are a bit too leisurely 
for complete effectiveness, details like having a character from one century 
accidentally bump into one from another period help to bridge the eras. 
</P>
<P>
 Nealla Gordon is all self-containment as Raymond, which is right for her slow 
build to anger at the end. Michael Dempsey is excellent as a contrasting fellow 
teacher and Anne's bumbling pirate partner. Lance Guest makes impeccable 
choices in defining the intricacies of a murderous pirate on Anne's ship and 
Raymond's intelligent, understanding department chair. Christopher Michaels 
effectively doubles as another job applicant and a lecherous pseudo parson with 
unspiritual things on his mind, and Karen S. Gregan is strong as both Raymond's 
protegee and Anne's cross-dressing sidekick Mary Read. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mills' setting is inventive, but sometimes cumbersome. David Flad's 
lighting could have more of a dark tone, and Alison Franklin's costumes 
couldn't be more appropriate. But someone should have told Gilbert that Anne's 
lifetime as a man would have been seriously jeopardized when they noticed he 
was wearing lipstick. WHERE AND WHEN

GIVING MIXED MESSAGES; * THE WOODBURY UNIVERSITY SHOW MINGLES THE WORK OF 15 
ARTISTS INSPIRED BY IDEAS AND ELEMENTS AS VARIED AS FEMINISM, FURNITURE AND 
LANDSCAPING.

<P>
 The centuries-old question, "What is art?," gets a challenging contemporary 
response at Woodbury University in the exhibit "Interdisciplinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Curated by Los Angeles gallery owner Sue Spaid, the show presents the work of 
15 Los Angeles-area artists who have been inspired by ideas and elements from 
such diverse fields as women's studies and architecture, anthropology and 
furniture design. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid said her inspiration for the show came from a Woodbury recruitment 
brochure, which stresses the interdisciplinary nature of the university's 
bachelor degree programs in business, design and architecture. "At Woodbury, 
business majors discuss marketing strategy with graphic designers. . . . 
Fashion marketing majors turn psychology and the social sciences into business 
tools," the brochure states, among other examples of the thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the university's philosophical approach to education as a backdrop, Spaid 
organized the exhibit in the Burbank campus' art gallery to spotlight her view 
"that artists are no longer looking to art school techniques. They go out into 
the world and bring back information and put that into their work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also fits nicely into art gallery Director Carolee Toon-Parker's goal 
to "bring really current contemporary art" to the university, she said, 
"especially art being seen in Los Angeles for the first time or by artists just 
starting to exhibit. The artists in the show investigate design or philosophy 
or science, addressing (these disciplines) as art forms. (Their studies) may 
evolve as commentary or visual or conceptual possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Howe's monumental charcoal drawing, "Emma Goldman," is based on a 
photograph of the anarchist, free-speech advocate and feminist making a speech 
before a crowd in the street. It covers a wall area from floor to ceiling. One 
can't help but feel the power of Goldman through the sheer size of the work, 
the strength illustrated in her face and, behind her, the forthright image of 
the open palm of a hand, which lends her support. Additionally, the attentive 
audience looks upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe has been moved to depict heroic women in our history in part, she said, 
as "a response to Mt. Rushmore." 
</P>
<P>
 On a wall nearby Howe's drawing hangs Jim Iserman's intricate, hand-stitched 
quilt. Spaid said Iserman made it from material he found in thrift shops and 
that it took him about 200 hours to complete. "How many paintings have that 
kind of intensity?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away from the quilt is David Perry's not so functional, but finely 
formed chair(s). What looks like two Shaker-style chairs have metamorphosed 
into one art object. A small person could sit on the front chair form, but 
Perry said it is up to the viewer to decide "whether or not it is functional." 
</P>
<P>
 With the drawing of Goldman, the quilt and Perry's Shaker forms, Spaid said 
this corner of the gallery "reads like American history." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunna Menoh applies the art of costume design in her three-dimensional, 
wearable "Linear Skirt." Designed somewhat like a carousel, it goes on over the 
head. An inner tube-like center of images relating to fashion from different 
eras and realms revolves underneath a black, textile exterior, which has 
openings so viewers can see the images. When the wearer walks, the inner layer 
rotates. Menoh said she wanted to explore "the relationship between society and 
the body." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hawkins incorporates ideas from landscape design in his "Orientalist 
Geranium." The flower is elegantly arranged in a fine pot, taking in the 
gallery's indirect sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Stein has been grafting different forms of cactus together, using 
pantyhose and rubber bands to bind and then grow them together. A large color 
photograph of one of her new life forms documents her efforts. Two inventive 
drawings -- one of a cabbage that sprouts a sunflower and then other flower 
species -- have been created from botanical prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Szymanski concerns herself with phonemes, basic units of sound. Her two 
sculptures represent visually the "i" and the "u." Because both pieces are 
drums, they allow viewers to experience how those characters sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The interdisciplinary approach "is not new, it's just a way of thinking," 
Spaid said. "All of the artists (in the show) take different kinds of subject 
matter into consideration. There is a way to make art without even studying 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists represented in the show are Lynn Aldrich, Sally Elesby, Kenneth 
Goldsmith, Michael Miller, Jorge Pardo, John Souza and Kevin Sullivan / Jan 
Tumlir. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Interdisciplinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Woodbury University Art Gallery, 7500 Glenoaks Blvd., Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Noon to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Ends June 3. Also: Artists 
panel discussion, 4 to 6 p.m. May 16.

COVER STORY; THEY'RE DOING ALL THAT JUST TO GO TO THE; PROM; EFFORTS TO KEEP 
COSTS LOW OFTEN CLASH WITH STUDENTS' CRAVING FOR A RITZY EVENT.

 With rock music as a backdrop, students suited up in formal finery are 
strutting across gym floors and auditorium stages in many local high schools 
this spring. Striking runway model poses to the cheers of their classmates, 
they are dressed in tuxedos and gowns supplied by merchants, dolled up by area 
cosmetics consultants and makeup artists and have dos swept to gravity-defying 
heights by hairstylists. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly a prom pep rally and in some cases a fund-raiser for the school, the 
fashion shows also serve as a showcase for the finery that can be bought or 
rented for the big event of senior year, the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been decades since the days of a simple corsage, powder-blue suit and 
dancing across a gymnasium floor. Today, girls wear sophisticated gowns, 
students rent limousines and the proms -- held from now until June -- are at 
L.A.'s finest hotels. But prom night, the highlight of the high school social 
season, carries a hefty price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proms are an important rite of passage," said Cari Meadows, senior class 
adviser at Glendale High School. "But the expenses make them horrible. Mostly 
the parents pay for it, and they are spending $70 -- times two -- for prom 
tickets plus the clothes and everything. So the cost winds up being several 
hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Hidalgo, 18, a senior at Granada Hills High School, expects to spend 
around $600 to attend the prom May 21. His parents will split the cost if he 
puts in his share from his job at Chuck E. Cheese in Granada Hills, he said. 
"The closer prom gets, the more stressed out we get," Miguel said of the 
pressure students place on themselves to spend this kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have a tendency to spend too much money," said Bob Vincent, Associated 
Students Board director at Canyon High School in Canyon Country, whose prom 
role, he said, is to help students cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Donna Wyatt, assistant principal at Chatsworth High School, said she is 
"constantly telling students they don't have to do all this," in reference to 
the pressures of going all out for the prom, "but they want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Huntsman, a senior at Glendale High School, said he will spend 
$140 for tickets, about $25 for a corsage, and split the cost of a limousine 
and hotel rooms, where he and five other couples will have their own 
after-prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can afford it, you should do it," Christopher said. "It will be the 
last chance to see your friends and classmates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher is getting his tuxedo free through a Glendale tuxedo company's 
novel promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 All he has to do is wear a different tuxedo to school a handful of times and 
the company will give him a free tuxedo rental for his prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends were going to do it, but they all chickened out," 
Christopher said. "I was like, dude, it's free." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole Labrow, 17, a senior at Granada Hills High School, said students 
don't have to go all out for the prom. "It's not a fashion show. Just wear a 
nice suit. You can just treat it as a nice evening out," said Nicole, adding 
that she and her boyfriend are splitting the costs and have a "prom can" they 
have been saving money in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie Bobertz, a parent of four in Woodland Hills who last year saw two sons 
through the prom and this year has a daughter attending one at Taft High 
School, said the expenses are usually big, but her kids pay for about half of 
them. "They need to realize the expense, and it does add up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting on the Prom  
</P>
<P>
 Just the cost of putting on the prom is an enormous one that is planned for 
years ahead of time. Glendale High's Meadows and other advisers said the cost 
can range from $30,000 to $40,000, with a high proportion of that going toward 
the prom dinner and facility rental. Students begin raising money for their 
proms when they enter high school. Ticket sales, which can run as high as $140 
a couple, complete the payment for the actual prom. 
</P>
<P>
 The prom ticket cost for most schools includes dinner, entertainment, a 
souvenir such as a videotape of the event, and in some cases, a school-planned 
after-prom party held at a church or YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prom pays for itself -- people don't realize that," Meadows said. "But this 
whole hotel business is just crazy. I think personally that the prom should 
come back to the school or the community for a site and lower the price to $25 
or $30 a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High School in Glendale broke away from its tradition of having the 
prom at a hotel and will have its senior prom May 28 at Glendale Civic 
Auditorium. John Moe, a teacher who helps plan the prom, said having the event 
there will lower the total cost by 50%. This year's ticket price is $85 per 
couple, compared to last year's $120. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Zigler, a teacher and the senior sponsor at Granada Hills High School, 
said the school selected the Torrance Marriott for its prom because the cost 
was lower than other Los Angeles locations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We get everything, including a steak dinner, for $38 per person," Zigler 
said. Other schools' individual ticket prices average $50 to $70 a person. 
Besides getting a lower-cost location for the prom, Zigler said the school also 
hired a disc jockey for $600 instead of a band, which cost $1,500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Spiro, Student Council adviser at El Camino Real High School, said his 
efforts to keep costs low are often countered by the students' demands to have 
a ritzy event.  
</P>
<P>
 "The school would like to hold the prom in the gyms like we used to have them, 
but the kids are adamantly opposed to that," Spiro said. "Kids argue for the 
higher-priced bids, and I argue for the lower, and we try to meet somewhere in 
the middle." El Camino's prom is Saturday night at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiro said every year he tries to reduce prom costs so that kids won't have to 
pay more than $100 a couple for a pair of tickets. While proms may pay for 
themselves, it is students -- and parents -- who may go in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation  
</P>
<P>
 Renting limousines to take to the prom has almost become de rigueur. Limousine 
rental costs -- often with five- to eight-hour minimum rentals and 15% to 20% 
in gratuities -- range from $45 to $80 an hour, and are usually split among 
several couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's splurging to get a limo, and some people have even rented helicopters -- 
that's ridiculous," said Nicole Labrow of Granada Hills High, who hadn't 
decided whether she would rent a limousine this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Hon, 18 of Granada Hills High, said she would not be renting a limo to 
go to her prom. "Last year my boyfriend and I took his car. It's not that fancy 
a car, but it got us there," said Jessica, who will take her boyfriend's wheels 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Hidalgo said the limo cost is the biggest financial pressure he faces. 
"All my friends want to rent a limo. The limo companies are all about the same 
-- they have a six-hour minimum, and we don't need one that long." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools have enforced a policy that eliminates the limo worry altogether. 
Two years ago, Hart High School in Newhall made taking a school-leased bus 
mandatory, which squelched limousine rentals while upgrading safety and cutting 
costs for the students, said Dale Basey, activities director at Hart. The bus 
also helps control attendance of students who may leave the prom after only a 
short time because of the high cost of limousine rentals -- the earlier they 
leave, the less they pay. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, two other Santa Clarita Valley schools, Saugus and Canyon high 
schools, will use bus transportation to their proms this month at the Sheraton 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We prefer to call them 'luxury motor coaches,' " said Bob Vincent, Associated 
Students Board director at Canyon High. "It's just safer and easier all the way 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Renting a nice car is one twist on the limousine expense. Crystal Bailey, 17, 
a senior at Granada Hills High School, plans to rent an emerald-green Lexus to 
match her green dress. "It's much cheaper because you are renting it for the 
day rather than by the hour," Bailey said. (One car rental company put the cost 
at about $100 for the day.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's also another alternative, Vincent suggested: "Borrow the car from 
Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes  
</P>
<P>
 Adam Krisan, 17, a senior at Granada Hills High School, is trying to keep his 
prom expenses to a minimum, so he may wind up borrowing his dad's tuxedo -- if 
it fits -- rather than renting one, which can cost from $30 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
 But boys attending the prom also have the option of wearing a suit and tie 
that they may already own. Those who wear suits tend to be dates, not members 
of the senior class, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls don't quite have it that easy. Not only must they find the right dress 
at the right price, but also pray they have a dress no other female classmate 
is wearing. For fashion advice, they can turn to such magazines as Sassy, 
Seventeen and YM (Young & Modern), which herald the prom on their covers, some 
publishing separate issues with a prom focus. Other publications, such as Your 
Prom, published once a year by Modern Bride, are devoted entirely to the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce dress expenses, Frank Mendez, co-owner of Here Comes the Bride in 
Thousand Oaks, suggests shopping the sale rack at bridal and formal wear 
stores. "These dresses are discontinued from last season. Some are 50% off. 
They can get a beautiful gown for anywhere from $30 to $150," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less expensive options include renting or making one's prom dress. 
</P>
<P>
 One Nite Affair in Westwood offers 900 different styles of designer gowns -- 
from Gianni Versace to Bob Mackie -- for anywhere from $40 to $150, said Sharon 
Gilchrist, the shop's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Schein, 18, will attend her Chatsworth High School prom June 4 at the 
L.A. Hilton near the airport in a rented dress from One Nite Affair that she 
said resembles the gown Sharon Stone wore to this year's Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Bill Blass dress, floor-length with black sequins and a halter top," 
said Sharon, who said the cost of $180 for the dress and gloves was less than 
she expected to pay to buy a gown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting to keep the dress, but I would probably only wear a dress I 
bought once anyway," she said. "Why not spend a little less and make a great 
impression?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Bobertz, 17, senior class president at Taft High School in Woodland 
Hills, found two positive aspects to having her mother make her prom dress: 
cost and originality. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of girls here are having their dresses made," Tracy said. "There's just 
not a great selection in stores. By having the dress made, I'm keeping the cost 
under $200." Tracy's dress will be a black velvet gown with a halter top with 
purple and teal sequins -- the school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanira Carrillo, 17, also a senior at Taft, is trying to custom design her 
dress in a colonial/medieval style for her May 21 prom, also at the airport 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to waste a lot of money; I'm paying for it myself," said Yaniro, 
who works at 2 for 1 Pizza in Los Angeles. In addition to cutting costs on her 
dress, Yaniro plans to have a friend who is a makeup artist do her makeup for 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair and makeup costs can add up. Marie Brown, a senior at Taft, said she will 
spend $60 on a haircut and style, $25 on a manicure and $25 on makeup. Sid's 
Hair Salon in Newhall offers a popular prom "day of beauty" that takes five 
hours and includes a facial, massage, manicure, pedicure, hair styling and 
makeup for $141. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Hon of Granada Hills High is saving money by having a private party 
make her prom dress. "It's cheaper than bridal shops. The total cost is under 
$100, and my parents are paying for the dress as a birthday present." A Dash of 
Flash 
</P>
<P>
 Black is still big in tuxedos for boys, but more flashy accents in vests, 
suspenders, cummerbunds and ties spice up the look, said Marilyn Spiegel, vice 
president of marketing and sales for Gary's Tux Shops in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vests are really big. One in particular has a pattern in colors that's sort 
of an optical illusion," Spiegel said. "Another L.A. trend is having the bow 
tie, cummerbund and pocket square match the girl's dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackets take on a variety of shapes and styles, Spiegel said. Everything from 
a black, double-breasted gangster-look jacket to a Humphrey Bogart off-white 
dinner jacket to fanciful shawl collars on jackets to jackets with tails for 
the adventurous types offer a number of options, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Rico of Tuxedo Gent in Woodland Hills said the double-breasted jacket 
and baggier pants are two trends for guys this year. She agreed that printed 
vests add a new and more versatile aspect to tuxedo dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the guys more of a chance to get more dressed up," Rico said. 
"Instead of just a red tie and cummerbund, they can have a red polka-dotted 
vest. The vests give more pizazz."

AND A LITTLE HELP IN THE DATE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the chalkboard in Bob Vincent's classroom at Canyon High School in Canyon 
Country are about 40 different names of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who need dates to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 What started out as an agenda for one student grew until Vincent became 
responsible not only for advising students in planning their May 14 prom, but 
helping them find dates as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who didn't have dates put their names on the board, and every once in 
a while students come by and peek in to see who's up there," Vincent said. "I'm 
not sure how many have found dates yet. I tried to match them up, but they 
wouldn't go with who I picked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the host of this dating game warns his students: "I tell them the person I 
took to my prom in June of 1971 is the woman I married," Vincent said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Part accountant, part confidante, part fashion consultant, the role of high 
school staff members who help students with the prom is a multifaceted one. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Krohn, senior class adviser and physical education instructor at 
Burbank High School, has assisted with the school's proms on and off for the 
last 10 years. She has helped classes with fund-raisers, provided budget and 
planning advice and helped select prom sites, which sometimes need to be 
reserved a year ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start raising money their freshman year. But it doesn't really sink in 
until their junior year that they've got to put on a prom," Krohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The juniors last year had $800 at the beginning of their junior year. By the 
end of their junior year, we had raised that amount to $8,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Spiro, Student Council adviser at El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills, has helped students from ninth grade through their senior year put on 
such fund-raisers as candy sales and lip-syncing contests to earn money for a 
trust account to lower prom costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Spiro's goal is to keep costs -- institutionally and individually -- 
low, many students want to go all out. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one challenge he faces in helping coordinate the prom is being labeled 
the "bad guy" in terms of spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some mom may call and want to know why she has to spend $800 on the prom," 
Spiro said. "They want to blame me and say I was the one who told a student to 
buy an expensive dress. It is the student who wants to buy the expensive, fancy 
dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Zigler, senior sponsor and teacher at Granada Hills High School, said a 
prom adviser should be sensitive to the financial and emotional needs of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have busloads of students here from poverty-stricken neighborhoods," 
Zigler said. "Girls lost their dresses in fires during the riots. This year, we 
have a lot of students who are no longer in their homes. Financially and 
emotionally, it's been a tough year."

 Some of the boys were struggling with cuff links; another had trouble lacing 
his patent-leather shoes. In a dressing room, the girls primped amid a cloud of 
hair spray, and one complimented another: "You look babe-ish," she said. 
Another girl admitted this would be the first time other students would see her 
in makeup.

 They were all readying for a prom fashion show in April at Saugus High School, 
where the latest fashions, hair and makeup transformed the teens from grunge to 
glamour. High glamour seemed to translate to high hairstyles accenting long, 
slim-fitting gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us will be wearing our hair up in French twists. It fits with the 
more elegant, sophisticated styles," said Amanda Cresap, 16, a junior at Saugus 
High School who participated in and helped coordinate the fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Walling, 17, of Saugus High wasn't sure she'd wear the same hairdo to 
the prom that she sported for the fashion show. Through the miracle of "lots of 
pins and lots of hair spray," a mound of large, stiff curls sprouted 
majestically from the top of Annie's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what the hairstylist calls this style, but he saw it at a show 
and wanted to try it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fashions, one trend appeared to be the fabric of choice for this year's 
prom: Velvet seems to have staying power past winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Velvet is hot this year -- long, fitted velvet dresses. It breaks all the 
rules," said Adriana Farrell, manager of Cruz's Boutique & Bridal in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Brey, 17, a junior at Saugus High School, modeled a long, 
tight-fitting green velvet dress with a choker collar complete with long green 
gloves during the recent prom fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't bought my dress yet, and I may get this one. I like this one a lot 
-- this is my style," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other velvet dresses at the Saugus show included a burgundy floor-length gown 
with spaghetti straps, a royal blue, long gown with short, puffed sleeves, and 
black gowns with white accents. Frank Mendez, co-owner of Here Comes the Bride 
in Thousand Oaks, said the most popular dress at his store is a straight velvet 
sheath with a white kick train by Loralie for $256. 
</P>
<P>
 Black is in big demand at Melissa Bridal in Tarzana. "They want mostly black, 
mostly long, mostly velvet," said the store's owner, Melissa, who wouldn't give 
her last name.  
</P>
<P>
 While lengthy dresses of subdued hues seem to be au courant , Farrell said the 
girls and their dresses fall into three basic categories year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are the girls who like the sequins; the girls who like poufy, frilly 
dresses, and the girls who want the sophisticated, straight, black look," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course one of the biggest fashion concerns for girls is getting a 
one-of-a-kind dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Brown, a senior at Taft High School in Woodland Hills, said her fuchsia 
satin dress is being made because "all the prom dresses in the stores are the 
same style, and this way, I have no alteration problems."  
</P>
<P>
 And there's always shopping early at some distant mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some girls start looking in September for the perfect prom dress," said 
Christine Krohn, senior class adviser at Burbank High School. "They go to other 
towns like Laguna and San Diego. It's amazing." REBECCA HOWARD

NATURE'S TREASURE ISLE; * A TRIP TO SANTA BARBARA ISLAND OFFERS A GLIMPSE OF 
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE COMPLETELY IN THE WILDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Now this is a place far from the madding crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 A day trip to Santa Barbara Island is a seagoing adventure and a challenging 
trip to a relatively untouched part of California. The excursion takes three 
hours each way and demands enough energy once there for either a five-mile, 
ranger-guided nature walk or independent exploration of the plateaus, steep 
cliffs, snorkeling and diving areas, and many hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The island, 48 miles southwest of Ventura, is the southernmost of five islands 
that make up Channel Islands National Park. The 640-acre area offers 
spectacular views and a chance to see an array of plants and animal habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, there has even been a one-room Visitors Center on the island, 
with a large canvas mural depicting marine life in the underwater kelp forests, 
a three-dimensional diorama by Southern California artist John Iwerks, a 
20-minute "Treasures of the Sea" video and other exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real draw of the place is its starkness, said park ranger Beth Fulsom, 
who works on the island and leads nature walks along the 5.5-mile trail around 
the island's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors love to watch the huge northern elephant seals and sea lions pupping 
-- taking care of their newborns -- and are always impressed with the 
unmatchable view of the coast and Catalina Island from 735-foot-high Signal 
Peak, the island's tallest spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors are particularly fascinated with Fulsom's ranger lifestyle, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have no idea what it's like to be on an island with no one else 
around. I get a lot of questions about that. They're amazed," she said. 
"Mainlanders cannot imagine life without video stores and take-out." 
</P>
<P>
 But the untouched beauty makes the conveniences that most visitors take for 
granted in their everyday lives seem less precious, Fulsom said. There are 
almost endless fields of bright wildflowers in the spring, pelican rookeries 
and fascinating tide pools. There are also rare nocturnal sea birds -- the 
hard-to-see Xantu's murrelet -- which are found almost nowhere but Santa 
Barbara Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can land on the island by private boat, without a permit, or can take 
the trip through Island Packers, the park concessionaire. Heather Wagner of 
Island Packers recommends that island-goers bring several layers of warm 
clothing, especially for the long ocean trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom also suggests that visitors bring plenty of bottled water, lunch and 
snack food; wear comfortable shoes, and bring a hat and sunglasses for sun 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom said she thinks that the somewhat strenuous trip is not feasible for 
children younger than 10. It requires climbing a ladder to get to and from the 
Island Packers boat. But, she said, older children enjoy the day and definitely 
get a sense of what true adventure can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Camping on the island is also available, with a free permit from the Visitors 
Center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The camping area is primitive -- no water, three outhouses and no trash 
containers (so all refuse has to be packed out), although Fulsom said plans are 
in the works to renovate the area. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a unique national park experience, probably diametrically opposed to a 
visit to such crowded destinations as Yosemite or Yellowstone. No cars or 
buses, no trinkets for sale, no food concessionaires. It's a walk on the wild 
side, too far to make it easy, but close enough to make it do-able. WHERE AND 
WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Day trips to Santa Barbara Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Through Island Packers, adjacent to the Visitors Center at Channel 
Islands National Park, 1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $49 round trip for adults, $39 for children 12 and under.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FIT FOR A KID; * CHILDREN'S APPAREL STORE SEEKS TO KEEP 
THE MARKUP DOWN ON CLOTHES FROM EUROPE, CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gloom and doom seem to prevail among local retailers these days. Many are just 
hanging on and praying for an upturn in the economy. So it was refreshing when 
speaking with Steve Miller, owner of a children's apparel store, For Kids Only, 
to hear these beautiful words: "Business has never been better." Obviously, to 
achieve this glorious state, Miller is delivering what the consumer wants -- 
quality at a good price. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating formula at For Kids Only is to buy the best merchandise at the 
lowest possible prices (paying cash helps achieve this) and keep the markup 
low. Basically, the prices here reflect a discount of 40% to 60% below retail. 
</P>
<P>
 To do this, Miller buys excess inventories from American and European 
manufacturers. About 40% of his purchases are made in Europe, chiefly France 
and Italy; the other 60% is made up of children's apparel from boutique 
manufacturers in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Upscale shoppers already know many of the labels selling here and will 
recognize more when they visit the store. However, were I to divulge many of 
the labels available at For Kids Only at discounted prices, the relationship 
between Miller and his sources could be jeopardized. So you won't read them 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 All areas of children's apparel are covered, including socks, shoes, casual 
and special-occasion clothes, for infants to preteens. Dress clothes for the 
preteen crowd are a particular blessing for parents. Since these are seldom 
worn, who wants to spend the price a quality garment runs? At For Kids Only, a 
beautifully made boy's suit from Italy on the racks for $139 sells elsewhere 
for $280 -- very high for an outfit so rarely worn. Some all-wool suits for 
boys are tagged $99 instead of the original $180 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparel for boys makes up about 40% of the inventory; the rest is for girls. 
The store has a wide array of colors and designs in leggings that retail for 
$16 but sell here for $9.99. Mothers and grandmas will adore the detail and 
embroidery work (and the prices) on some classic Italian dresses that retail 
for $250 but are marked here for $69 to $79. 
</P>
<P>
 If the classic look isn't what you're seeking, you'll probably love a very 
trendy and very fashion-forward line for girls (sizes 6 to 18) called Sputnik 
that I've never seen anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 An exciting and artistic line for infants is called Trotinette. It appeals to 
the ultra-selective shopper who really appreciates uniqueness of design. The 
prices are not cheap, however, falling in the $50 to $79 range for an outfit, 
but they are about 60% below retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says his top sellers are the cotton jersey long johns (often worn as 
pajamas) from sizes for babies up to 10- or 11-year-olds: $16.99 for short ones 
to $19.99 for the longer version. These sell elsewhere for $25 to $32. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimwear runs $9.99 to $16.99; T-shirts start at $6.99 and go up to $15.99 
(retail $38) for a top European line. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a pleasant continental ambience here -- hardwood floors, etc., so the 
bargain shopper can enjoy the luxury of upscale shopping without the prices.

RAVIOLI: CHECK YOUR ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Friday nights, Ravioli Restaurant & Bar in Northridge attracts a big dance 
crowd. The club is open from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. with a $5 cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: No hassle at the door. Inside, the main dance floor fills up by 
10:30 p.m. A second floor offers more elbow room, a bar with no line and a 
place to cool down. Either way, you don't need a partner to dance -- groups of 
women hit the floor together. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Mostly college age. Lots of guys wearing T-shirts and jeans, with 
an occasional vest for effect. Same with the women. Almost everyone has a beer 
in one hand and a cigarette in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Hip-hop, early '70s funk and retro. Everything from "Shoop" to 
"Atomic Dog" to "Brick House." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "You can wear jeans," said Kymm Soden, 25, of Encino. "The music is 
good, and you can dance without feeling intimidated, because no one really has 
an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "I wish there were a better mix of races," complained Mark Richards, 
24, of Chatsworth, surveying a crowd composed of mostly Caucasian and Latino 
dancers, with few African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Oh God. That girl's in my class," one woman said. "I can't stand 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli Restaurant & Bar, 18711 Devonshire St., Northridge. Call: (818)

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; SHORT IS THE MANE ATTRACTION; * THE 
CUTTING-EDGE LOOK FOR THE SUMMER IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE BOB AND THE GOMER 
PYLE CRAZE. BRAIDS ARE AN OPTION FOR THOSE WHO KEEP IT LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes regularly about fashion and 
beauty for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pop open any fashion magazine and most of the girls look like boys from the 
neck up. Short, even buzzed hair is the rage in hip, ultra-urban areas. But 
actually persuading the majority of Valley girls to go in for the Gomer Pyle 
look is something else again. While some take the plunge and opt for the 
newfangled pixie, most local trendsetters are striking a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing the really short cuts for about six months, and women are 
still coming around for them, but the cutting-edge look for summer moving into 
fall is a great compromise between the bob and the really short cuts," explains 
Daniel Combs (yes, that's his real name), stylist at Syndicate in Encino. 
Combs, who recently trimmed Paula Abdul's hair in this new vogue cut, says the 
look is somewhat akin to the shag but with unruly, "fringe" style ends that may 
be directed upward or tucked under the hairline for the desired unkempt 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 When Combs' clients do decide on a really short style, the look is more 
rounded and face-framing than the waif cuts seen earlier this spring. "It's 
really more Deauville than anything," he says. Think Mia Farrow as F. Scott 
Fitzgerald's Daisy in "The Great Gatsby." 
</P>
<P>
 At Studio City's Chayo, Maria Casillas says she too is seeing an influx of 
really short hair, but says she is relieved that the long tresses that once 
typified the Valley girl look are finally disappearing from Ventura Boulevard 
-- and not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't as attached to their long, full hair as they used to be," she 
maintains. Still, there are trends available for those who keep long -- but not 
necessarily over-voluminous hair. Two single braids, cascading delicately on 
each side of the head, are making headlines, Casillas says. "It's the 
Pocahontas look," says Lori Cola, stylist at M.J.F. Salon in Sherman Oaks. 
While only a few early trendoids are wearing them now, she predicts a bonanza 
of braids for summer. What better 'do to wear with the warm weather midriffs 
already in stores before June gloom even hits the skies? 
</P>
<P>
 IN STYLE LIKE FLYNN: Getting Nick Nolte's autograph is a much more daunting 
prospect than getting a shirt off of his back, thanks to Studio Wardrobe 
Services in (where else?) Studio City. This treasure trove of a shop serves as 
a liaison between the public and television and film studios anxious to unload 
wardrobe and accessories to recoup some of their initial investment. The 
store's merchandise spans the movie-making decades of the 20th Century. There 
is the waistcoat Errol Flynn wore in the 1948 film "The Adventures of Don 
Juan," with a price of $1,500. And the wearables from 1994's "Blue Chips," 
Nolte's latest film. A wide variety of television series apparel also ends up 
here, including fashions from ABC's "Roseanne" and HBO's "Dream On," says 
Elaine Vollmer, one of the shop's co-owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest surprise inside the shop is the incredible deals on 
designer clothing that is gently worn. A Claude Montana jacket and pant 
ensemble sells for just under $300, which would cost four or five times as much 
new in a department store. Unlike consignment stores, where merchandise may be 
worn for an entire season and could be a couple of years old or more, the stock 
is more current and less worn.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the bargains that really bring people in," Vollmer says. Basketball 
players may beg to differ. One of Studio Wardrobe Services' few permanent 
exhibits is the uniform worn by basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal in the 
aforementioned Nolte film. So long is the 7-foot, 1-inch player's jersey that 
Vollmer had to drape it over a balcony to fully display it. 
</P>
<P>
 FAKE BAKE: The hardest thing about getting a faux tan is applying the tanning 
cream evenly without getting it all over towels and clothes. If you simply 
can't be bothered, leave it to the professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 At Skin Spa in Encino, where bronzing services have been offered for about 
five years, employees "tan" about six to seven clients a day. Three levels of 
service are available: an application of tanning milk, combined with 30 minutes 
of massage, is $35. Add the "salt glo" (exfoliating treatment) and an extra 30 
minutes, and the fee is $75. A three-part miniseries of treatments, for $120, 
extends over a three-day period. The series consists of a single "glo" and 
massage with tanning milk on the first day, followed by two days of additional 
tanning milk massages. As with any self-tanning preparations, results are best 
when hair removal procedures precede the treatments. Maintenance is needed 
every three to four weeks, to keep that "just vacationed" look fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who'd rather self-tan, there is a crop of self-tanning products that 
are much improved over what you may remember about them from the '60s. For 
starters, you can now choose a formula that will deliver the level of color you 
want, in shades ranging from light to medium. Many are oil free, some come in 
mousse or spray form and others are formulated specifically for either face or 
body. Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Clarins and Chanel are just a few 
department store cosmetic vendors who offer sunless tanning preparations 
designed for home use. Expect to pay between $12.50 and $27.50 for these. 
Drugstore brands such as Neutrogena, Physician's Formula, Coppertone and Bain 
de Soleil are among the popular -- and somewhat less expensive -- costing on 
average between $6 and $10.

LOOK LIKE A MILLION FOR FREE; * AVOID HIGH BEAUTY SALON PRICES BY LETTING 
MAKEUP ARTISTS AND HAIR STYLISTS EXPERIMENT ON YOU. OR YOU COULD GET A 
BARGAIN-BASEMENT CUT AT A SCHOOL. 
</P>

<P>
 Looking good has its price. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, it's difficult to walk out of a beauty salon without popping $100 
or so. Even a simple trim can set you back $50 -- plus tips. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to go broke to look great. You can get a complete make-over 
for free. Of course, there's a catch -- you have to let someone practice on 
your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair product and cosmetic manufacturers, such as Redken in Canoga Park and 
Sebastian International in Woodland Hills, are always developing new cuts, 
colors and chemicals, and their cadre of professional stylists and makeup 
artists needs a never-ending supply of models to experiment on. 
</P>
<P>
 You may even get paid for being a good sport. Sebastian, for example, throws 
in a slew of free products and up to $50 in cash, depending on how much you let 
them do. When you add in your free 'do, that's not a bad deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is suited to be a model. If you are not ready to give up your 
signature style or you just want your scraggly ends cleaned up, this gig is not 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for people who don't have a lot of limitations," said Sebastian's 
research and development manager, Paula Malloy. "You are not going to come here 
and get a trim. You will walk out with a different look -- but you will always 
look as pretty or prettier than when you came in." 
</P>
<P>
 If you just can't see yourself succumbing to the latest layers and hippest 
highlights, how about a bargain-basement cut and curl? Beauty schools offer a 
full range of services, from cuts, perms and color to makeup, facials and 
manicures. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are certainly right. Most schools charge $5 for a cut -- including 
shampoo and blow-dry. Perms go for as low as $15. Touch up your roots for $11. 
Have a manicure for $2, a pedicure for $5. Get your makeup applied (bring your 
own) for $3. Throw in some eyebrow shaping for another $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it up. A complete head-to-toe make-over for under $50. 
</P>
<P>
 The caveat is that all services are performed by students. Before taking the 
exam for their professional license, students must spend at least 1,600 hours 
practicing on real people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these novice stylists are adept at only the most simple styles and 
classic cuts, according to West Valley Occupational Center student Nawal Ahmad, 
who with 1,500 hours under her belt already has a steady clientele. "We learn 
the basics," she said. "We learn sanitation, how to use chemicals, how to perm, 
how to mix colors. But we do not learn cuts and styles that change from season 
to season, unless we attend workshops on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired teacher Helen Niparko of Woodland Hills is a 15-year patron of the 
West Valley Occupational Center beauty school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had a bad cut here," she said as her short silver hair was 
trimmed and styled. "I have had worse luck in regular salons that charge $25 to 
$30. They are so kind here and, when I walk in without an appointment, they 
always find time for me. The students care." In Search of Style

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CATCHING THE SPIRIT OF ITALY; * THE CA' DEL SOLE OFFERS 
ATTRACTIVE WINE AND APPETIZER LISTS, BUT THE PASTAS ON THE HUGE MENU ARE 
HIT-OR-MISS.

<P>
 An evening at Ca' del Sole is drenched with the spirit of Italy, from the 
valet parking to your after-dinner shot of grappa. Yes, right from the valet 
parking. When we thanked our valet on handing over our keys, he instantly 
replied, " Prego! " and winked, in the true Italian style. What makes this 
great is that the valet was actually Salvadoran. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd never recognize North Hollywood's old Maison Robert -- it's now a softly 
lit, luxurious restaurant of a style you can actually find in Italy. The walls 
are soft yellow brick, hung with unadorned pottery, framed photos of Venetian 
carnival masks and antique Italian playing cards (a particularly nice touch). 
Seating is mostly at elegantly upholstered booths or on richly hued wooden 
chairs. There is also a snazzy wooden bar where on busy evenings hungry diners 
often stand three deep to order Camparis while they wait for their tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Ca' del Sole belongs to the gifted Antonio Tommasi, who also runs the 
well-known restaurants Locanda Veneta, Ca' Brea and Il Moro on the other side 
of the hill. At times, when the service clicks and you've chosen a really fine 
dish, everything at Ca' del Sole is engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 But not always. Tommasi is a wonderful chef, but he's floating among four 
restaurants these days. This may explain why some dishes are lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem may simply be that the menu, based on the cooking of Venice, 
is huge. One wonders how the kitchen can produce such a diversity of dishes 
well, and indeed, it may not be possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, order judiciously and you will probably become an instant fan. The 
appetizer list has a lot of attractive choices, many of which, so far as I 
know, appear for the first time on a Valley menu. Baccala di San Pietro alla 
Vincentina is a captivating fish hash made with John Dory, potatoes and capers, 
served with two rounds of perfectly grilled polenta.  
</P>
<P>
 Pomodori appassiti are even better: San Marzano tomatoes baked with a crust of 
garlic, oregano, olive oil and basil, accompanied by slices of prosciutto 
imported from Carpegna, Italy. Only polpettine di tonno stufate is an actual 
disappointment, though these rather insipid tuna cakes are nearly redeemed by a 
wonderfully delicious bed of sauteed lentils.  
</P>
<P>
 The pastas are more hit-or-miss, which is a shame, because they tend to look 
so good written down. Bigoli alla Ca' del Sole, actually a dish straight out of 
Venice, is made with a thick sort of spaghetti that might be confused with 
Japanese udon noodles, were it not for the topping: a generous mix of lobster, 
clams, mussels and crab. The sauce and seafood in this dish are both fine, but 
bigoli need to be cooked carefully. Mine were gummy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemelli ai vegetali arrostiti , described as cuff-link shaped pasta with mixed 
vegetables, comes out even less appealing. The pasta is an oddball one, 
consisting of two strands twisted together; it's like eating a plate of 
gigantic DNA. Even if that doesn't bother you, there's the problem that the 
pasta is mixed with mushy beans and overcooked vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, gnocchi and risotto -- both notoriously hard to prepare 
right -- are two shining stars on this pasta list. The bite-sized potato 
gnocchi, served in a delicate duck ragout, are feathery light and meltingly 
tender. And the risotto is impressively firm and grainy, cooked with lobster 
tail and perhaps even a slight overabundance of sliced porcini mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also several meaty entrees. The best, by far, is stufato di anatra 
alla Veneta , a magnificent Venetian stewed duck. The kitchen marinates Barbary 
duck in red wine and serves it in a rich sauce based on aromatic herbs and wild 
berries. Like most of the meat dishes, it comes with good, garlicky steamed 
spinach and workmanlike roasted potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken is a treat here too, served whole in a huge cast-iron skillet, juicy 
and redolent of lemon zest and rosemary. Osso buco, the classic braised veal 
shank, comes with soft polenta. A good free-range veal loin has fresh asparagus 
tips in place of spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not wild about any of the desserts. The rice pudding is mushy, the apple 
tart soggy; even the reasonably good pear tart tastes more like apple than 
pear. But I do like the fact that the restaurant serves a mean espresso, offers 
intelligently priced Italian wines and has a good selection of grappas and 
digestivi waiting for you in the bar after dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 And I wasn't let down when, on retrieving my car keys, I got a hearty 
arrivederci from the valet. As the Italian salutation implies, I will see these 
people again. And next time, I'll be expecting really big things. WHERE AND 
WHEN

 RETURNING FAVOR: Vladimir A. Yakovlev, deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia, 
told officials he saw something on a recent Orange County trip that he'd rarely 
seen in Russian local government: a woman, specifically Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder, sitting in a position of political prominence. . . . Impressed, 
Yakovlev gave Wieder a medallion recognizing her "courage to participate in 
local government." The medallion bears the image of Catherine the Great, 
Russia's empress in the late 1700s. The only rub: the county's gift ban forced 
her to give it back. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST LAUGH: Students at Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove have 
decided to give their teachers a break. . . . In honor of next week's national 
Day of the Teacher, a student group persuaded the comedy club Brea Improv to 
give all 100 of the school's teachers and staffers free tickets to a 
performance there. Quips Lynn Hamtil, a school district trustee: "Is this 
supposed to mean teachers do or do not have a sense of humor?" 
</P>
<P>
 NAME GAME: Author Sue Grafton titles her mysteries with letters from the 
alphabet ("A is for Alibi"); Neil Albert uses months. Fountain Valley author 
Earlene Fowler, above, is taking another tack: quilt patterns. . . . Her latest 
book, "Fool's Puzzle," is the first of many she plans on naming after patterns 
well-known to quilters. Says the author, "I used to quilt; now I write." 
</P>
<P>
 ON TARGET: Speaking of writers, Huntington Beach author Robert Peters -- who 
wants to start a workshop for local gay and lesbian writers (E1) -- once met 
his literary hero William Burroughs on the legendary author's Kansas farm. . . 
. At the time, Burroughs was painting canvases, which he shot full of bullet 
holes and then sold to art galleries. After watching Burroughs unload his 
pistol that day, Peters picked up the empty shells and later wrote a memoir of 
his Kansas encounter, 15 copies of which were reproduced "complete with spent 
bullet casings" glued to their title pages.

 ROBBING PETER: County elections officials are recruiting volunteers to staff 
the polls for free this June election to help save money (B1). . . . But now 
county library officials want their own volunteers to work the polls so that 
the $55-per-worker stipends can be diverted to the library budget. The Friends 
of the Library and other booster groups have 2,000 members, according to a 
library statement, adding that "if only 20% of these volunteers . . . 
participate in the Tuesday, June 7, election, this would translate into $20,000 
for the library." 
</P>
<P>
 FULL EMPLOYMENT: Last year, county Supervisor Maria VanderKolk cut the salary 
and hours of her aides by 10% to avoid staff cuts suffered by most county 
departments. Last week, she reinstated their salaries in full. At the same 
time, she volunteered her aides to help out with the workload of county 
administrators. "Since they are short-staffed, I'm saying that my staff can 
help out," VanderKolk said. . . . She wants to keep her staff busy as she winds 
down her term in office in coming months. "I didn't want them to be bored. I 
wanted them to be challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW BRASS: In change-of-command ceremonies this morning, Capt James L. Delker 
will relieve Rear Adm. David J. Nash as commanding officer of the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. . . . With the command change, 
neither of Ventura County's Navy bases will have an admiral to look out for 
local interests in endless budget battles. The admiral's job at Point Mugu was 
transferred to China Lake base last year. 
</P>
<P>
 SAYONARA: When seeking delays in criminal cases, some defendants might ask a 
judge to grant them a week or two or perhaps even a month. . . . But this week, 
Bruce M. Alexander of Port Hueneme persuaded the judge to postpone his felony 
drunk-driving case until Jan. 5, 1995. Alexander, a Seabee, immediately shipped 
out for a seven-month tour of duty in Okinawa; budget-strapped prosecutors 
could ill afford to spend the $1,000 for a plane ticket to fly him back.

SHOCKED BY TAPE OF KING BEATING, GATES TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, testifying Thursday in Rodney 
G. King's lawsuit against Gates and 14 other current and former officers, 
recalled his shock when he first saw the videotape of King's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked his opinion of King's beating, he said, "We are not in business to beat 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought King deserved to be beaten, he said, "I don't think anyone 
deserves a beating. Only that force which is reasonable and necessary should be 
used." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, one of King's lawyers, suggested to Gates that if there had 
been a policeman's report instead of the videotape of the beating, no officer 
would have been disciplined for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, who was continuing first-time testimony about the beating incident, did 
not answer but agreed that the report written by Officer Laurence M. Powell, 
which blamed King for the beating, would not have been sufficient grounds for 
punishing the policemen involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had not been fortunate enough to have the videotape of the Rodney King 
beating, is it fair to say the officers would not have been disciplined?" asked 
attorney Milton Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Gates and the other defendants in King's suit objected that the 
question called for speculation, and the judge barred an answer. Grimes asked 
if Gates agreed that Powell's arrest report "did not accurately reflect the 
beating of Rodney King." Again, the question was ruled objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes then turned to Powell's arrest report, reading his description of King 
charging at officers, kicking and swinging his arms, resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you discipline your officers after reading a statement like that?" 
asked Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, just based on that report, no," said Gates. "If I were a captain, it 
would cause me to look into that arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 "And if all the other officers who stood by essentially supported that 
description, it would be a closed case?" asked Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Gates. " I don't see anything wrong with that arrest 
report. But the captain would seek additional information and medical reports 
would be very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are trying to decide whether King should receive punitive damages from 
Gates and the other defendants. They already have awarded King $3.8 million 
from the city in compensatory damages for his videotaped beating by white 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' 43-year law enforcement career, including 14 years as chief, ended with 
his 1993 resignation following harsh criticism over the King case and the Los 
Angeles riots that followed the acquittals of four officers on state charges in 
the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Sgt. Stacey C. Koon were convicted of violating King's civil rights 
in a federal trial last year and are serving 30-month prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 While reiterating his view that the beating was an "aberration," Gates 
tempered his criticism of the officers involved by saying that they should not 
have been limited to using a baton to subdue King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opposed the use of the baton," he said. "In this country, that is so 
technically advanced, it's amazing we couldn't provide to an officer anything 
other than a Stone Age weapon -- a club." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his sarcasm and shoot-from-the-lip style, Gates appeared subdued and 
professional on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with one of his comments that blacks react differently to 
chokeholds than do "normal people," Gates said he was not being racist but 
acknowledged: "That was probably an inelegant choice of words." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he said casual drug users should be shot to death, he replied, "I 
said casual drug users ought to be shot -- not to death. That was a bit of 
hyperbole." 
</P>
<P>
 The former chief's appearance followed 1 1/2 days of haggling by attorneys 
over which parts of a Christopher Commission report on racism, sexism and 
excessive force in the Police Department should be admitted as evidence against 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, a panel appointed after King's beating, was headed by Warren 
Christopher, then a private attorney and now U.S. secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies ruled that some parts of the massive report 
can be used against Gates but that other portions do not meet court tests of 
reliability since they are based on hearsay.

 DIRTY WATER: Tony Valentino made the charts in 1966. These days, he makes the 
cappuccino. Valentino played guitar for the Standells, who recorded the hit 
"Dirty Water." The band broke up in 1971. But he's never lost his passion for 
music, so this week, he opened a new Tarzana coffeehouse called, naturally, 
"Dirty Water Cafe." Said Valentino: "I've wanted to do this for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 DERBY DAY: Saturday, of course, is the biggest day of the year in horse racing 
-- the running of the Kentucky Derby. It will also be a big deal at Paradise 
Ranch Racing School in Castaic, where owner Bill Davis and his 14 student 
jockeys will watch the action on TV. . . . Among the school's alums is Corey 
Nakatani, who has raced in two Derbys. 
</P>
<P>
 PRICEY PROMS: The prom hasn't been a cheap date in years, and this season is 
no different. Teen-agers shell out hundreds of bucks for the big event (above). 
"It will be the last chance to see your friends and classmates," said a 
Glendale senior . . . Schools try to cut costs, but many students prefer to go 
all out. (Valley Life! Page 10). 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL CHOICE: The era of open enrollment is about to begin. On May 16, under 
a new state law, parents can apply to send their youngsters to schools of their 
choice, as long as it doesn't upset the racial balance and there's enough 
space. . . . There is certainly plenty of space at Taft High in Woodland Hills 
-- 600 openings -- but also plenty of demand. Taft has received a lot of calls 
since winning another academic decathlon last month. 
</P>
<P>
 CLUB SCENE: Who needs Hollywood? After all, the Valley is filled with 
attractive nightclubs, and starting today, The Times will run an occasional 
series covering local spots. . . . One option is the Ravioli Restaurant & Bar 
in Northridge, a popular Friday night hangout for college students. See Valley 
Life! Page 31. Michael Arkush

 Federal prosecutors revealed details for the first time of an alleged 
international conspiracy that links three of the men convicted in the World 
Trade Center blast to the murder of radical Rabbi Meir Kahane.The government 
released previously confidential information in a 100-page document ahead of 
the trial in New York of radical Islamic Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman and a group of 
others charged with conspiring to wage a war of urban terrorism against the 
United States through bombings and assassinations. The papers, which provide a 
preview of the government's case, include excerpts from tapes in which Abdul 
Rahman was told of and advocated Islamic paramilitary camps in the United 
States. The trial is scheduled for September.

COURT UPHOLDS NEW YORK ABORTION RESTRICTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state law that excludes abortions from health care services for thousands of 
poor working women was upheld Thursday by New York's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Court of Appeals said critics of the state's Prenatal Care Assistance 
Program failed to prove that it unconstitutionally forced some women to have 
babies that they don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's 6-0 decision, written by Chief Judge Judith Kaye, overturned two 
lower court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is wonderful," said Kathleen Gallagher, spokeswoman for the New 
York State Catholic Conference. "It's a marvelous Mother's Day present for 
hundreds of poor and near-poor pregnant women and their unborn children." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's rights groups had considered the case New York's most important court 
case over abortion in two decades. They pronounced the decision a disappointing 
setback that will intensify battles in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many needy women will now be foreclosed from obtaining services that they 
need," said Donna Lieberman, director of the reproductive rights section of the 
New York Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded prenatal care program, or PCAP, was established in New 
York in 1990 and helps pay for prenatal care for poor women who are just above 
the Medicaid eligibility threshold. About 15,000 women use the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though New York is one of 12 states that pays for abortions through 
Medicaid, the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo agreed to exclude abortions 
from the list of services paid for by PCAP.

PUERTO RICO STARTS WATER RATIONING

<P>
 The Puerto Rican government began rationing water in this Caribbean island's 
capital city Thursday because of a severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
 The key reservoir serving San Juan was down to 35% of its capacity, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to share the sacrifice," said Emilio Colon, executive director of 
Puerto Rico's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. "We don't want to have to go to 
more extreme measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of San Juan will be without water for 12 hours at a time, officials 
said. The cutoffs will be rotated through different neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Colon said other reservoirs were also drying up, and the water shortage may 
soon spread throughout the island of 3.6 million people.

 The collapse of salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest sparked an agreement 
under which Native Americans will exercise fishing rights for the first time in 
50 years at historic Willamette Falls. The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission 
agreed to let tribal fishermen harvest 2,500 salmon at the popular Oregon City 
sport-fishing spot, using dip nets, which have been part of their culture for 
thousands of years. The fish, mainly spawned at hatcheries, will make up for a 
disastrous decline of wild salmon that has forced regulators to close most 
regional waters to salmon fishing this season.

 A federal appeals court panel sided with white firefighters in a reverse bias 
claim, dealing a potential blow to hiring and promotion goals based too rigidly 
on race in Birmingham, Ala. The three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit 
Court of Appeals unanimously found that the Fire Department's promotion system 
illegally uses harsh racial quotas in the name of eliminating past 
discrimination.Birmingham, once a hotbed of racial violence, had no black 
firefighters until 1968. With the help of a 1981 consent decree that allowed 
race-based promotions, about one-third of the department's 680 employees are 
black. There are more than 50 black supervisors, including one chief. But the 
appeals court struck down the formula that led to many of those promotions, 
saying it resulted in promotions being made "woodenly and reflexively in rigid 
adherence to a quota system."

 Members of a Mississippi-based white-supremacist group face arrest if they 
defy authorities and stage a march in Boston on Saturday, city officials said. 
Taking a tough stance against the plan by the Nationalist Movement, Boston 
authorities have denied the group a permit to march through the mainly working 
class district of South Boston, citing public safety concerns. But the group's 
leader, Richard Barrett, vowed that his group will march without permission, 
setting the stage for a confrontation with police.

HARRY BIEDERMAN; ECONOMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Robert Biederman, chief economist for Lockheed Corp. for 35 years and 
the founding editor of the Trendlines economic forecasting newsletter, has 
died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Biederman, who retired in 1987 but continued to serve Lockheed as a 
consultant, died of heart failure in Tarzana on April 28. He had suffered a 
severe stroke in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Often consulted by news media on the global and national economies, Biederman 
served as a key prognosticator of the impact federal defense spending cuts 
would have on California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a flat market soon. I mean right away," he told The Times 
in 1986, predicting a loss of at least 10,000 jobs in the state's defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught economics at USC and frequently appeared as a guest speaker for 
public affairs and business conferences and television programs. He also wrote 
commentary and book reviews on economic subjects for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Biederman was head of the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Assn. of 
Business Economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Athens, Ohio, he grew up in St. Louis and was educated at Washington 
University, Shrivenham in England, UCLA, Columbia University and Loyola. During 
World War II, he served in the Army in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Esther; three children, Danny, Jerry and Debbie; a 
sister, Dorothy Kaufman, and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the American 
Diabetes Assn.

JUDGE CHARLES LITWIN; OKD DISPUTED BLUE LINE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Litwin, a retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who helped 
clear the route for the Blue Line light-rail system between Los Angeles and 
Long Beach, has died. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwin died Sunday of pancreatic cancer at his Long Beach home, his son Dave 
Leddel said.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, a group of merchants and property owners organized as No Slo Transit 
sued to prevent the Blue Line from traveling along Long Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwin denied their request, however, deciding that the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission (now the Metropolitan Transportation Authority) had 
properly considered the economic impact and other environmental factors of 
building a two-mile segment on the busy thoroughfare. His ruling was upheld by 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Hamilton, Canada, Litwin moved to Los Angeles in 1930 and graduated 
from Los Angeles High School and Southwestern Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 After private law practice, he was named to the Long Beach Municipal Court 
bench in 1966 by Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. Ten years later, Brown's son, 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., elevated Litwin to the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his four sons, Kerry Litwin and Dave, Mike and Ed Leddel; a 
sister, Kay Horowitz, a brother, Leslie Litwin, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for noon today at Hillside Memorial Park, 6001 
Centinela Ave.

BALLOT SPONSORS TO BE CREDITED IN BID TO RAISE FUNDS; POLITICS: INNOVATIVE 
PROGRAM GARNERS PRAISE BUT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT COMMERCIALIZING DEMOCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ventura County voters go to the polls June 7, they will find for the 
first time that corporations are helping to underwrite the local democratic 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of a large cable television company, a giant title company and the 
nation's largest home insurer will be displayed at 405 polling places for about 
100,000 voters to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants, hotels, travel agents and banks have also expressed interest in a 
novel county program that invites businesses to pay $250 each to sponsor 
polling stations in exchange for recognition on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they expect to save $25,000 on the June election through 
corporate sponsorships, the free use of polling sites and the labor of hundreds 
of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the three-pronged "Count Me In" program is so innovative that it was 
honored last week by the California secretary of state's office as the best new 
government plan to increase community participation in local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But use of corporate sponsors -- especially a written declaration proclaiming 
that support at polling places -- has raised questions about whether the 
program might commercialize elections. It also creates a possible conflict of 
interest if a ballot initiative directly affects polling-place sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 But county elections officials say they do not expect complaints because no 
polling place will bear the stamp of just one company's support. Rather, all 
sponsors will be listed on a single sheet of paper at each polling site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like, 'This polling place is brought to you by Denny's,' " said 
Georgia Dennehey, the county's assistant elections chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the issue of the propriety of corporate sponsorships was one reason 
that Santa Barbara County abandoned a similar program after the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with this is people have such varying agendas," said Bob Smith, 
head of elections in Santa Barbara. "Somebody doesn't care for this company or 
doesn't like the product of that company. With (sponsorships), it almost gives 
the impression that we're supporting the company." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the secretary of state said the office favors recognition of 
sponsors only after an election is over, not on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to create any impression of possible conflict," said John 
Mott-Smith, the state chief of elections. "We don't want any big flashing 
lights at the polling place, saying '25% off on democracy,' or 'Sale today,' or 
'Eat at Joe's.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Mott-Smith said he knows Bruce Bradley, head of the Ventura County 
elections division, and is certain that Bradley will credit sponsors in an 
appropriate manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley's "Count Me In" program, in fact, is a model for both saving money and 
community involvement that is being monitored by many other cash-strapped 
counties, Mott-Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce Bradley really went beyond anything anyone has seen in the country," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said he will respond to sponsorship problems if they arise but that 
such concerns are premature. "I'll wait until I get 100 sponsors before I worry 
about it," he said. "Right now, I'm just working to keep the program above 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 The elections division absorbed a $100,000 cut over the summer out of a total 
budget of just $1.4 million and had to find ways to do the same work with less 
money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County first tried its new program in November, when 201 election 
workers donated their time instead of being paid from $55 to $68 for it. Six 
corporate sponsors also enrolled, and the county saved about $19,000, Dennehey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county publicly thanked sponsors in a post-election newspaper ad but 
decided to acknowledge them at polling stations this time because some sponsors 
did not re-enroll, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the June election, 250 volunteers have offered to donate their time so 
far, owners of 133 of the 405 polling sites have waived their $25 to $75 rental 
fees, and 10 corporate sponsors have expressed a strong interest, Dennehey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has solicited support from 75 companies over the last two weeks, 
she said. Checks of $250 have arrived from State Farm Insurance of Westlake 
Village, Chicago Title Co. of Ventura, Jones Intercable of Oxnard and Ventura 
Appraisal Consulting Corp. of Ventura, she said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 For information about sponsoring polling activities June 7, call the county 
registrar of voters office at 654-2733. Ask for Georgia Dennehey.

ADVISORY GROUP CRITICIZES FIRE DEPARTMENT; REPORT: ALTHOUGH THE PANEL'S 
EVALUATION ECHOES A 1993 COUNTY AUDIT, IT IS NOT AS CRITICAL. SUPERVISORS WILL 
CONSIDER STUDY NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A citizens advisory group studying problems in the Ventura County Fire 
Department criticizes the agency's overtime policies, sick pay procedures and 
vehicle maintenance costs in a report to be considered by the Board of 
Supervisors next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's evaluation echoes a county audit last year that found the 
department is top-heavy with managers, overly generous with overtime and sloppy 
with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But the seven-page report is not as critical as the county audit and, on 
several issues, it disagrees with the audit and sides with Fire Department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Fox, a captain in the Los Angeles Fire Department who headed the citizens 
group, said the county audit was "overly critical," adding that the citizens 
panel sought to offer positive recommendations for improving the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the citizens study is too soft on the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it really has little value," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, 
who said he believes that the panel should be disbanded because it's a puppet 
of the Fire Department. "I won't pay much attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire and union officials said they were pleased with the mellower tone of the 
panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was as bad in comparison to the auditor's report," said Ken 
Maffei, president of the firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Fire Chief Bob Haloway said: "They looked at it more from an 
operational standpoint, rather than just a financial view." 
</P>
<P>
 The report will be discussed by the Board of Supervisors at its Tuesday 
meeting. Some of the report's recommendations and the audit's conclusions are 
expected to be implemented in a long-term strategic plan that fire officials 
are developing and are scheduled to unveil late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials said no significant changes are expected at the 
433-member department until a new fire chief is appointed. Ventura County Fire 
Chief George Lund resigned in March, saying he was frustrated by the criticism 
leveled at his department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-member citizens committee was formed at the urging of Fire Department 
officials in November, in part to help Lund respond to the audit report. 
</P>
<P>
 About two months ago, Chairman Bill Esty resigned in protest after the Board 
of Supervisors decided to exclude the Fire Department from Proposition 172 
funding. Several supervisors said this week that they plan to reverse that 
decision and give the Fire Department some of the special sales tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's study agrees with the audit that about $600,000 in annual overtime 
could be saved by having workers fill in for higher-paid employees when they 
are out, instead of paying overtime to workers at the higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, an additional $270,000 could have been saved in the 
fiscal year 1992-93 if workers were not allowed to collect overtime and sick 
pay during the same pay period. But unlike the audit, the citizens report found 
no evidence that sick leave is abused. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also recommends replacing Fire Department vehicles and equipment 
sooner to decrease maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the dispatch centers to the same facility as the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department and shifting the department's headquarters to the County 
Government Center would also slice operational costs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report sided with fire officials on staffing issues, although the audit 
had recommended paring some firefighters at less busy stations. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, whose office prepared the audit, 
said he stood by his report, but did not want to argue with the work that the 
citizens committee had done. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was glad to see that the citizens group agreed with him that a 
long-term strategic plan for the department is needed. The citizens group also 
seems to have had a mellowing effect on fire officials. Now, Mahon said, fire 
officials seem more willing to consider some of the recommendations in both 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like they're starting to move down the road toward change," he said.

NEW AIRPORTS CHIEF FACES A WEIGHTY ISSUE; AVIATION: THE RECENTLY NAMED 
ADMINISTRATOR MUST DECIDE WHETHER A RESTORED, 72,000-POUND TRANSPORT IS TOO BIG 
TO USE THE CAMARILLO RUNWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When newly named Ventura County Airports Administrator Rod Murphy arrives on 
the job Monday, one of his first decisions will be whether an aging warhorse of 
an airplane, now lovingly restored to fighting form, is too heavy to take off 
from Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 If he makes the wrong call, a catastrophic accident could occur, endangering 
crew, airplane and the airport's runway, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who was appointed to the $68,562-a-year post by the Board of 
Supervisors last month, must determine not only whether the runway is strong 
enough to permit the newly restored Lockheed Super Constellation military 
transport to leave the airport, but also whether it should regularly fly in and 
out of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge, four-engine aircraft -- known as the Boeing 747 of its day and one 
of three left in the world -- weighs more than 72,000 pounds. Because of the 
plane's weight, county officials fear that the runway might collapse during 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who has been director of the Riverside Department of Airports, 
declined to comment on the issue Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials' fears were allayed somewhat April 29 when a consultant's 
report tentatively said the runway could support the plane. A final report on 
the condition of the runway is due today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole issue has become very emotional, and people have said a lot of 
things back and forth," said Michael Musca, an administrative officer with the 
Department of Airports. "But our concern has been on safety. We were very 
concerned that the runway would fail underneath this aircraft. Until we know 
for sure, why take chances?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Jerry Doyle, general manager of the Constellation Historical Society, a 
nonprofit group that has overseen the aircraft's three-year restoration, 
discounted the official's concerns. Doyle said his big plane does not pose a 
danger to the runway, initially built to handle a variety of military aircraft 
when it was the former Oxnard Air Force Base before 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have spent thousands and thousands of volunteer hours preparing this grand 
old lady for flight again. Now that she's nearly ready, all we have encountered 
is red tape," Doyle said. "They talk about safety like it was something foreign 
to us. We want to stay here, but how much more of this stuff we will take is a 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, with its 150-foot wingspan, was successfully towed April 29 along a 
taxiway from its storage site on the airport's eastern edge to the western 
side. But during a trial run of its four engines, one of the power plants 
incurred a small electrical fire and had to be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was a minor glitch," Doyle said. "It's the fact that we towed her 
across the airport without a problem should be evidence enough that she can use 
this airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said the small engine fire will delay the plane's readiness for flight 
by about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Mikels, chairman of the Ventura County Aviation Advisory Commission, 
said many pilots in the county support the Constellation project but remain 
concerned about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the consensus among most of the pilots in the county is that we would 
like to see the Connie stay here," Mikels said. "The preliminary look at the 
runway (by the consultant) would seem to support a limited number of operations 
for the Constellation." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Mikels said he understands airport officials' desire to leave the 
decision to Murphy, Hal Geer, a fellow commission member, thought that the 
delays have been unfair to the historical society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand their reluctance to stick their necks out until Rod arrives," 
Geer said. "But I also think that, in some cases, the bureaucracy just doesn't 
listen to common sense. I think this may be one of those cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Historical society officials also say the delays have prevented the 
Constellation from being part of the national air show circuit -- a critical 
source of funding for the restoration, upkeep and flight operations of the 
aircraft. Doyle estimated that if the Constellation could have been at last 
weekend's El Toro Air Show, the event could have raised as much as $100,000 for 
the society. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said the society's C-121C Super Constellation, once again spit-polished 
to a high shine and replete with military markings, first saw service in the 
1950s as part of the U. S. Military Air Transport Service, the U. S. Air Force 
and finally the Mississippi Air National Guard. It was used during the Korean 
conflict and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 After being retired from military service in the early 1970s, the society's 
plane changed owners a few times, eventually ending up as a crop duster in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the plane was placed in storage, where it remained until late 1982, 
when it was purchased by historical society President Daryoush (Benny) Younesi 
of Van Nuys. In 1984, the aircraft was flown to Camarillo Airport and placed in 
storage until the society's restoration project began in 1991.

PROPOSED CONTRACTS ANGER UNION; COLLEGES: CRITICS SAY PLAN WOULD BURDEN THE 
DISTRICT WITH DEBT AND INSULATE TOP MANAGEMENT FROM BUDGET CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to award multiyear contracts to two top community college administrators 
have angered union leaders, who say the deal would burden the district with 
unneeded debt and further insulate upper management from budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin wants to offer his top aides three-year deals to 
reward their loyalty and entice them to remain with the three-campus district. 
</P>
<P>
 He scheduled the matter for closed-door discussion at each of the last two 
board meetings, but the item was delayed while the district's lawyer determines 
whether the issue should instead be decided in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts, which will probably come before the Board of Trustees again 
next month, would be worth about $500,000, including salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials complain that the contracts are unnecessary and that the 
district is already locked into multiyear deals with Lakin and three college 
presidents that approach $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has been expressing such extreme concern about money, but here they 
want to commit (long-term) funds to administrators," said Barbara Hoffman, 
president of the local American Federation of Teachers chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grant a multiyear contract, the rationale is you need to do that to 
entice good people to stay," said Hoffman, a counselor at Ventura College. "But 
in times of real tight budgets, it doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, teachers just this week agreed to a 1% pay raise after three years 
without a salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
 An in-house report issued last month concluded that the college district may 
lose up to 5,000 students -- roughly 20% of the district's enrollment -- 
because it cannot afford to adequately staff the financial aid offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The district stands to lose as much as $1.3 million in state funding next year 
if enrollment continues to dip, according to the district. Its annual budget is 
about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the union that represents the district's secretaries and 
support staff also spoke out against the proposed long-term contracts for vice 
chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classified employees don't like it," said Leanne Colvin, a secretary at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees feel that it's (being considered) because of the possibility of 
a new board coming in," Colvin said. Lakin "might get a new board that won't 
listen to him as much as this board does." 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats on the board are up for election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, who signed a four-year pact in February that pays him $119,000 annually 
plus perks through the 1997-98 school year, refused to comment on the specifics 
of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be inappropriate to discuss details of any issue that has not yet 
been formally presented to the governing board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the proposal, his two vice chancellors, Jerry Pauley and Jeff 
Marsee, would be granted multiyear contracts that would ensure that they would 
remain in Lakin's service through the length of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauley also declined to discuss the multiyear contract proposal, except to say 
that "it's going to wind up being a philosophical discussion" among the 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee is in Lake Tahoe at a conference and is unavailable for comment, his 
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the governing board, who will make the ultimate decision, seemingly 
are ambivalent or undecided on the issue. Several trustees said they had not 
yet made up their minds, and others said they see merits to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 One trustee, however, said he is "totally opposed" to the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "As public employees, those positions already have extensive statutory 
protections," said Trustee Timothy Hirschberg, who is an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also isn't fair to the numerous other classified employees and managers to 
give just these two (vice chancellors) additional contract rights," Hirschberg 
said. "It ties the hands of future boards in making personnel decisions and job 
assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 Other trustees were not so quick to derail the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am somewhat partial to it because when I worked as an administrator, I had 
a three-year contract," said board President Allen W. Jacobs, who said he is 
undecided about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But "if you're in a very high-level administrative position where you have to 
take unpopular positions, you need some protection," he said. "It's also a way 
of signifying support for top-level managers." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Pete E. Tafoya, a member of the board of directors of the California 
Community College Trustees Assn., also said he has not yet made up his mind on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm leaning more against it," said Tafoya, who said he will seek 
reelection this fall. "We have tried to maintain a sense of flexibility in our 
management so, if necessary, we can downsize." 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya said the state trustees group opposed long-term pacts with most junior 
college administrators at a meeting of the directors earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory P. Cole and Karen Boone, whose seats will also be up for election, 
said they do not have enough information about the plan to make an informed 
decision. Boone says she will run again, and Cole will instead seek a seat on 
the Thousand Oaks City Council this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cole indicated that he may support multiyear agreements for Pauley and 
Marsee. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our certificated (teaching) personnel have tenure," he said. "So 
unless they do something egregiously wrong, they have lifetime contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In business, industry and government, employment contracts are becoming quite 
the norm now."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STATE'S 1ST LADY TO BE AT YOUTH 
SUMMIT

 Gayle Wilson, wife of Gov. Pete Wilson, will join Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) this morning at the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, where local high 
school students will discuss their concerns about crime at a Youth Crime 
Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, scheduled to run from 9 to 11:30 a.m., is geared toward 
teen-agers because Takasugi is sponsoring a bill this year that affects 
juveniles and is interested in hearing their concerns, said Jaylene Hobrecht, 
Takasugi's field representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Student representatives from 11 high schools in Port Hueneme, Camarillo, 
Oxnard, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi's bill calls for disclosing the names of juveniles who have committed 
or are suspected of a violent crime, Hobrecht said. Under the present law, the 
names of juvenile crime suspects are withheld by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Wilson was invited because she has expressed interest in the issue, 
Hobrecht said. Crime is one of the governor's main themes in his reelection 
campaign. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CINCO DE MAYO FESTIVITIES ARE HELD AT 
COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To historians, May 5 is the anniversary of the Mexican army's triumph over 
invading French forces in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some Mexican-American students at Oxnard College, the annual Cinco de 
Mayo celebration is a chance to reminisce about their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings me memories of Mexico," 19-year-old Gloria Arredondo said as she 
sat on the college lawn watching the school's Grupo Folklorico Mestizo dance to 
traditional Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Grupo Folklorico, the daylong event Thursday included performances by 
mariachi and quebradita dance troupes, and a chance for youngsters to break a 
toy-filled pinata. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like having a little bit of Mexico right here," said 21-year-old 
Salvador Hermosillo, who moved from Mexico to Oxnard five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the MEChA club that sponsors the college's Cinco de Mayo 
festivities said the main purpose of the event is to remind Mexican-American 
students where they come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being assimilated further and further from who we are," said Demetrio 
Silva, president of the student government and a member of the college's 
Movimento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or MEChA. Through Cinco de Mayo, "we 
can identify with our cultural roots." 
</P>
<P>
 But some people at the event wondered whether certain performances truly 
represented Mexico's cultural roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the afternoon, about a dozen young people dressed in jeans 
and T-shirts packed the small stage for a quebradita dance, a sort of 
fast-paced version of country-Western. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," said Ingrid Munguia, a student who sat with her two young 
children near the stage. "I don't know if it's appropriate for Cinco de Mayo. 
It's a modern kind of dance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Enrique Luna, one of the leaders of the dance troupe, said the quebradita 
is a very old dance that was once popular among farmers in Mexico's poor rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance had been dying out until recently, Luna said, when it became trendy 
among young people in Mexico and the United States. And the revival of the 
quebradita shows, Luna said, "that our roots are not dying." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; JURY DEADLOCKS IN MAN'S MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury was dismissed Thursday without reaching a verdict on a 
manslaughter charge against an Oxnard man accused of the Christmas Day slaying 
of his former girlfriend's son. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch to release the jury ended 
Jose Jimenez's two-week trial.The jury had been deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Jimenez with murder for the stabbing death of Isaias 
Guerrero Morales, 21. Guerrero was knifed in the yard of his family's Campbell 
Way home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the same jury acquitted Jimenez of second-degree murder, the 
charge on which the prosecution had sought a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said the prosecutor's office will 
probably ask to have Jimenez retried in the case. The judge would have the 
option of granting the new trial or dismissing the charge against Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 100% positive Judge Storch won't dismiss this case," Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Joseph Villasana, who represented Jimenez, could not be 
reached for comment. He has said Jimenez acted in self-defense. Kossoris said 
he was disappointed that the jury did not reach a guilty verdict. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2ND MAN CHARGED IN '92 RAPE-SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A second man has been charged in connection with a 2-year-old Oxnard murder in 
which the first defendant has been sentenced to die in the gas chamber, 
prosecutors announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Lee Jackson, 26, faces charges of murder, rape and kidnaping in the 
Jan. 26, 1992, slaying of 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales, a mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder charge against Jackson includes a special allegation that Gonzales 
was shot while being kidnaped and raped. If convicted of the special 
allegation, Jackson could be sent to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher James Sattiewhite, 24, was sentenced April 25 to die in the gas 
chamber for his role in Gonzales' death. A jury convicted him of the same 
charges that Jackson faces. 
</P>
<P>
 However, prosecutors acknowledge that their case against Sattiewhite was 
stronger than the case against Jackson. Sattiewhite admitted to being the 
triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that fact, "95% of the evidence is the same," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donald C. Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said a decision on whether to seek the death penalty against Jackson 
will not be made for at least a month. Jackson is serving a 28-year sentence in 
an unrelated rape case. DWAYNE BRAY

 The Ventura Police Department will hold its annual block party Saturday, 
hoping to teach residents about public safety issues and give demonstrations on 
everything from pepper spray to fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a mini street fair, but it's all geared toward public 
safety," Ventura Police Lt. Steve Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual block party will feature about 180 booths and exhibits on 
crime prevention, personal safety and other public safety issues. The event is 
free and will be held at police and fire headquarters at 1425 Dowell Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is intended to foster community support for the Police Department 
and encourage residents to talk to officers, Bowman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Festivities will begin at 8 a.m. with a pancake breakfast sponsored by the 
Ventura Suburban Kiwanis Club and opening ceremonies start at 8:30 a.m. The 
event is scheduled to last until 5 p.m. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO BUILD 552 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over objections from the state Department of Fish and Game, the Moorpark City 
Council has unanimously approved a developer's plan to build 552 homes in 
southeast Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the council's vote Wednesday, Fish and Game officials continue to 
argue that the project threatens a rare seasonal wetland found last year at the 
site that is home to two endangered plants. Mary Meyer, a plant ecologist with 
Fish and Game, said the agency will decide in the next 30 days whether to sue 
the city over its approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to avoid going to court as much as possible," she said. "We could 
pursue a legal challenge, but we're looking at our options." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Fish and Game's longstanding objections to development near the site, 
council members said they believed that Carlsberg Financial Corp.'s plan would 
protect the wetland, called a vernal pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley said it would be financially prohibitive to 
set aside the 50 acres that Fish and Game has requested as a buffer zone around 
the wetland. The City Council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the development company has pledged to keep about 15 acres around the 
pool free of homes. In addition, it plans to create a new water source for the 
wetland, which is fed from the surrounding hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic considerations have driven us to this point more than anything 
else," Mayor Paul Lawrason said before casting his vote to approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said it would be several months before the first building 
permits could be issued for the 500-acre development. Tankersley said it could 
be much longer before anything is built. 
</P>
<P>
 "After eight years of working on this plan, I've learned not to speculate on 
that sort of thing," he said. "I can't say when (building would start). You 
don't know what will happen next on this." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REPORT ON POLICE ACCIDENT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley police officer was driving at speeds of 67 to 83 m.p.h. last 
month just before his cruiser slammed into a nurse's station wagon in front of 
the Metrolink station, a report released Thursday showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the California Highway Patrol said Officer Rick Rinehart had 
braked for one to two seconds and slowed to about 53 m.p.h. just before his 
police-issue Chevrolet Caprice slammed into a Honda driven by Peggy Sphar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar's car was moving about 4 m.p.h. as she left the Metrolink parking lot, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also includes a computerized diagram of the accident showing that 
the impact spun Sphar's compact car around several times before it came to 
rest. It also notes that Rinehart's cruiser left no skid marks because it is 
equipped with anti-lock brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not state whether Rinehart's emergency flashers and sirens were 
on when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar, 45, of Simi Valley, who was thrown from the car, suffered major head 
injuries and was left in a coma by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman said Thursday that Sphar had not awakened but her 
condition "is progressing." 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Sphar's family has told the city that the family intends to file 
a lawsuit over the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar's family and lawyer could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials declined to comment on the report, which Simi Valley 
police commissioned from the CHP's Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation 
Team on April 13, the day of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Simi Valley city attorney's office issued this statement: 
"The city has received a letter from an attorney representing Mrs. Sphar and 
her family indicating the accident may result in litigation. Given that fact, 
there will be no comment on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted Monday to install a light at the Metrolink entrance on 
Los Angeles Avenue -- a plan drafted a year ago to help control increasing 
traffic there. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the April 13 accident was the first one at that 
intersection. MACK REED

CAREER FAIR EXPLAINS YOUTH JOB OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley teen-agers looking for a summer job will have a chance Saturday to 
meet with prospective employers and learn about career options. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two employers from eastern Ventura County are expected to attend the 
city's eighth annual Youth Employment Service Job and Career Fair from 10:30 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at Mountain Gate Plaza at Los Angeles Avenue and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 1,000 people between the ages of 16 and 22 participated. 
Organizers expect at least the same turnout this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the businesses that will be represented are retail stores, insurance 
companies, modeling agencies, fast-food restaurants, the military and law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Sandra Thompson said about half the businesses are recruiting for 
summer and full-time positions, while the others offer information on career 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who haven't already lined up summer work, Thompson said the job 
fair is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always have a big rush of people calling us the day school's out saying, 
'I want to work this summer,' but then it's too late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For best results, Thompson said teen-agers should come prepared to fill out 
applications that ask for previous job experience, Social Security number, 
school information and personal references.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PRAYER DAY SPEAKERS URGE HEALING U. S. ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of Ventura County residents took time out from their busy schedules 
Thursday to gather at the Government Center in Ventura for an hour of prayer as 
part of the National Day of Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 With a theme of "Heal Our Land," many speakers talked of urging public leaders 
to accept religion and religious activities as a way to help solve the 
country's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our country can get better without God," said Margaret Ely, a 
Santa Paula city councilwoman. "We are not wise enough to do it on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely was among several city leaders on hand to read proclamations supporting 
the sixth annual National Day of Prayer, designated by Congress as the first 
Thursday in May. Declarations supporting a day of prayer were also presented by 
the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Ojai, Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, and the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people watched as Pastor John Huffman of the South Coast Fellowship 
Church in Ventura led the prayer session. The gathering included religious 
songs and short speeches by leaders of various churches in Ventura and Oxnard, 
followed by Bible readings and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Ron Holt of Pacific Coast Community Church in Ventura spoke of the need 
for religion to be a part of America's dialogue on such problems as crime, 
homelessness and decay of the nuclear family. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pastor Roland Niednagel of Bible Fellowship Church in Ventura urged 
participants against passively watching the quality of life in their 
communities disintegrate. Ventura County is not immune from the crime that 
plagues inner cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westlake has its own home-grown gangs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in attendance brought young children, who squirmed through the ceremonies 
while their mothers tried to keep them quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Morter, 31, held 4-year-old Brett in her arms, while 1-year-old Luc 
watched quietly, ensconced in her backpack. Morter said she learned about the 
prayer gathering from announcements on Christian radio station KDAR. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to be here with two kids," she admitted. "But I think it's a good 
example for them. I want them to grow up knowing the importance of prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stettler also found out about the prayer meeting from KDAR. The 
electrician took time off from his job to be a "prayer warrior" for a day, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just praying for our government, for our leaders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But especially for our parents, because they are the ones who are responsible 
for raising children in a right and just way." KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MUSICIANS TO BE ALLOWED TO UNIONIZE

<P>
 After three months of negotiations and the threat of a possible strike, the 
board of the Ventura County Symphony signed an agreement Thursday allowing its 
musicians to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will begin negotiations to achieve a collective bargaining agreement that 
will be recognized by the American Federation of Musicians," said Steve 
Thiroux, spokesman for the Ventura County Symphony Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians had threatened to strike this weekend, when the symphony is 
scheduled to perform its final season concert at Oxnard Civic Auditorium, 
unless management allowed them representation by Musicians Union Local 581. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 people are expected to attend the concert Saturday, said Karine 
Beesley, the symphony's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Beesley said the symphony's board of directors had not agreed to allow the 
musicians to unionize prior to Thursday because the board needed to clarify 
some portions of the agreement. CHRISTINA LIMA

GREEN LIGHT GIVEN TO FLOOD BASIN WORK; NEWBURY PARK: THE COUNTY MUST MONITOR 
THE EFFECTS OF THE PUMPING ON A NEARBY WETLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The excavation of a flood control basin in Newbury Park can continue, state 
and federal resource officials said Thursday, but only if the county limits the 
amount of water it pumps out of the basin and promises to monitor the effects 
on a nearby wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal agreement came during a meeting Thursday morning that included 
representatives from the state Fish and Game Department, the U. S. Army Corps 
of Engineers, the U. S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Ventura County 
Flood Control District, which is building the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had initially intended to remove ground water from the basin by 
continuously pumping it into a storm drain for up to five years without 
studying the impact on the neighboring wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid protests from members of the Thousand Oaks City Council and concerns from 
environmentalists, the resource agencies intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 The basin is being built to catch hillside debris that could clog flood 
channels. Once vegetation has returned to the fire-scarred hills, it will be 
converted to a water-detention basin, which would slow the flow of floodwater 
during a major storm. Its cost is estimated at $878,453. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Thursday's interim agreement, the county can continue to pump 
ground water that collects in the basin as a result of its excavation. Once the 
ditch is completed, probably within six weeks, pumping will resume only when 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be opposed to pumping the ditch on a long-term basis," said Ken Wilson, 
an environmental specialist with state Fish and Game. "But we can allow them to 
pump, even into the storm drains, for the time necessary to complete the 
project. It shouldn't have an impact on the wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Works Director Art Goulet agreed. "It will only need to be 
pumped if we've heard a long-range forecast calling for heavy rains." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the county also tentatively agreed to look for ways to rechannel 
the water it pumps into a nearby stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the county will drill 40-foot monitoring wells once construction is 
complete to study the impact of the basin on local ground water. The wells will 
provide information on water levels and direction of flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is make the ground-water regime continue as it was 
doing before," Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both the county and resource agencies said the meeting was 
amicable and fruitful, despite a week of heated debate over the ditch. A final 
plan on how to handle the basin will be developed within the next month, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very certain they (county officials) recognize the importance of 
protecting those wetlands," Wilson said. "They were receptive and listened to 
our ideas, and we were receptive and listened to their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the problems we've had were because there just wasn't 
complete communication," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still not certain is the project's funding. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency had agreed to pay 75% of its cost, but last week froze the funds over 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said he believed that the county will eventually get the FEMA funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never going to get the FEMA money until the work was done anyway," he 
said. "FEMA wants Soil Conservation Services to do an environmental impact 
report. That's fine. They can use the data flood control has already been 
gathering."

SEMINAR BACKERS HOPE TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF CRIME; THOUSAND OAKS: DAYLONG 
SESSION SATURDAY WILL INCORPORATE SUGGESTIONS ON MAKING THE CITY SAFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merging an old-fashioned town meeting with high-tech electronic gadgetry, 
Thousand Oaks' Crime Prevention Task Force will hold a daylong brainstorming 
seminar Saturday to consider how to keep the city safe. 
</P>
<P>
 About 170 people have registered for the session, which will feature a dozen 
workshops focusing on such topics as school violence, family responsibility and 
the media's role in combatting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the day will be taken up with talking -- speeches by sheriff's 
deputies and community activists, and discussions in small focus groups. Yet 
organizers insist that all the gabbing will yield concrete results, in the form 
of an action plan to be presented to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will rank their priority concerns -- and favorite solutions -- by 
punching small electronic key pads wired to a vote-tallying computer. The 
system will be able to count votes and display results on a television screen 
within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 By synthesizing hundreds of opinions, the futuristic technology should help 
organizers identify participants' common goals. Backed by community consensus, 
the action plan might earn City Council approval more swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Council members who support public safety will choose to put first the 
programs that the public has identified as priorities," said Mayor Elois 
Zeanah, who heads the Crime Prevention Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks was recently ranked the nation's third-safest mid-sized 
city, politicians and residents alike say they feel threatened by rising crime 
and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied with third," said Otto Stoll, co-coordinator of Saturday's 
session. "This symposium will be an excellence effort, not a feel-good effort." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, planning for the session has generated few good feelings, at least 
among City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zeanah requested city permission to televise the seminar, her rivals on 
the council voiced fears that the symposium might degenerate into a political 
showcase. They worried that Zeanah, who is running for reelection in November, 
might seize the forum to grandstand or campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If doing something about crime is political, I would love to be guilty," 
Zeanah responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the council approved televising the event on the government cable 
station. Every council member except Alex Fiore, who will be out of town, has 
agreed to attend the seminar for at least a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bickering has continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah complained two weeks ago that she has had trouble getting help from 
city staff members to organize the symposium and send mailers. When pressed by 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar to give specific examples, Zeanah said she "chose to 
handle that privately." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that council infighting would detract from the long-planned symposium, 
Stoll felt compelled to note in an interview that "this is not a political 
event, not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Thousand Oaks residents who plan to attend the workshop agreed, saying 
they are willing to give up nine hours of weekend leisure because they believe 
that the symposium will prove an effective crime-fighting tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they now feel safe in Thousand Oaks, many said they worry about the 
future. Gang violence has marred several parties in the past year, and a recent 
melee that left two Westlake High School football players wounded shook up some 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in such a wonderful community that when a small group of (criminal) 
people become visible, we're shocked," said Brad Baker, principal at Walnut 
School who will attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some wake-up calls recently," he added. "There is a problem and we 
need to be proactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply by drawing together a diverse crowd -- including teen-agers, senior 
citizens, social workers and religious leaders -- the symposium might boost 
community awareness of the city's crime-fighting efforts, several participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have such a great number of people coming together, there has to be 
some result, because someone will get up and say, 'This has to be done,' " said 
Katie Petrick, a junior at Newbury Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as insurance agent Ron Wetzel said: "Any time you can get people off their 
duffs to do something about crime, that's good." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks crime symposium will take place from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Saturday at Westlake High School, 100 N. Lakeview Canyon Road. Free breakfast, 
lunch and a snack will be provided. To register, call co-coordinator Jimmy 
Sloan at 493-4953.

WOMAN ADMITTED STRIKING DAUGHTER IN FACE, DEPUTY TESTIFIES; COURTS: CHARLOTTE 
RUSSO, ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE, ALSO REFUSED TO PROMISE NOT TO STRIKE THE GIRL 
AGAIN, JURY IS TOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three years ago, Charlotte Russo told a sheriff's deputy and child social 
worker that she badly bruised her daughter's right cheek but refused to promise 
them that she would not strike the girl again, the deputy testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told us that there was nothing wrong with hitting her daughter in the 
face. That that was the best place to hit her," Deputy Barbara Anderson 
testified in Russo's child-abuse trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was one of two occasions when authorities went to the Russo home 
on complaints that the girl was being abused, but left the teen-ager in the 
Westlake house, according to testimony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo, 52, was eventually arrested in May, 1993, and charged with two counts 
of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time that social workers were called to the Russo residence, an 
anonymous tipster complained that the mother was forcing her daughter to live 
in a locked room of the family's back-yard racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Munson, an investigator with the county's Public Social Services Agency, 
responded to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson testified that the girl seemed sad and frightened, but she insisted 
that she was not being abused. Munson decided to close the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said nothing happened," Munson told the Ventura County Superior 
Court jury. "I believed I wasn't going to be able to break through the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo's lawyer, James M. Farley, has acknowledged that his client locked the 
girl in the racquetball court's adjoining bathroom and a dressing room, and 
that she once bit her on the forearm. But the girl was unruly and in need of 
discipline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call to authorities came in September, 1990. Anderson said she went 
to the principal's office at La Reina High School in Thousand Oaks to see the 
teen-age girl, who then had a deep bruise on her right cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that she had been struck by her mother," Anderson testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said she and a social worker then accompanied the teen-ager to the 
Russo home. The mother met them in the front yard, Anderson said, and she was 
"confrontational and angry with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother acknowledged striking the girl, who was 13 at the time, and 
bruising her. She also said she was a registered nurse and knew what was best 
for the girl, Anderson testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also testified that she asked Russo to refrain from hitting the girl. 
The mother said "she couldn't guarantee she would not do that again," according 
to the deputy. Anderson and the social worker left the girl in her mother's 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Blesener, head of children's services within the Public Social Services 
Agency, could not be reached for comment late Thursday on policies regarding 
removing children from suspected abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time authorities were called, Munson said he went to the family 
home Oct. 29, 1992, on a tip that the girl was being kept in a room in the 
racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman answered the door through an intercom, but instructed him to wait, 
Munson testified. She returned five minutes later and claimed that both the 
girl and Russo were not at home. Munson said he told the woman that he would be 
back the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl has testified that about the same time Munson started visiting, her 
mother for no apparent reason stopped forcing her to live in the racquetball 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came back the next day, Munson said he interviewed the girl, Russo, 
her husband Richard, and several sisters and brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson said the teen-age girl made very little eye contact with him and seemed 
sad, but denied being forced to live outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, I said, 'Were you ever locked in the racquetball room, the 
racquetball court?' " Munson said. "And she said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Charlotte Russo told him that the teen-ager was having problems 
with her salt-free diet, her demeanor and her ability to make friends with 
children her age. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson said he then tried to find the anonymous tipster. The girl has 
testified that it was her mother's sister-in-law. But Munson said that the 
tipster made the report through Los Angeles County social workers, and that he 
had no luck tracking the person down.

 Magnolia took advantage of five Savanna errors to upset the first-place 
Rebels, 5-2, in an Orange League softball game Thursday at Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia (10-7, 5-3 in league) also committed five errors, but they proved 
less costly.The Sentinels moved into a second-place tie with Western. Savanna 
(10-9, 6-2) remains in first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels scored three runs in the first, with one out. Barbara Carlson 
tripled to drive in Shannon Carlson and scored when Sophia Garcia reached first 
on a throwing error by third baseman Crystal Zaleski. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia scored on an error by second baseman Jaque Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna's Larina Baker started the third inning with a line drive to left that 
fell in for a single and rolled away from left fielder Maria Levario for a 
two-base error. Pitcher Tiffany Mercado struck out the next batter, but Chrissy 
Vega singled Baker home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, Savanna Coach Bob Aguilera was ejected for arguing a call from 
the previous inning. His team then loaded the bases with two outs but Baker 
grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia took a 5-1 lead with two unearned runs in the bottom of the inning. 
With one out, Nicole Faircloth reached on an error, moved to second on a single 
by Nadine Hart and scored when third baseman Zaleski committed an error on 
Maria Levario's grounder to third. Hart attempted to capitalize on the error 
but was thrown out at home for the second out. Levario took third on the throw 
and scored on Mercado's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna scored one in the seventh and loaded the bases with two outs, but 
Zaleski fouled out. HEATHER STEVENS

 Los Alamitos 2, El Dorado 0 -- Two infield singles and Michelle Schneider's 
two-run triple provided the offense for second-ranked Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, batting .411, had two hits as the Griffins (19-4, 8-0) beat El 
Dorado pitcher Heather Hamer (9-4) for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Wilson (13-1) matched Hamer with a six-hitter and was tough with 
runners on base; the visiting Golden Hawks (17-7, 6-2) had a runner in scoring 
position four times and had a runner at third in the last three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos clinched a share of the league title with two games to play. 
Second-place El Dorado played its third game in three days, including a 2-0 
victory over fifth-ranked Cypress on Wednesday. MARTIN HENDERSON

PIERCE TORPEDOED BY CLUTCH DOUBLE; COLLEGE BASEBALL: VALLEY'S GONZALEZ DRIVES 
HOME TWO IN THE EIGHTH, DENIES BRAHMAS THE SOUTH TITLE, 7-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All Teddy Gonzalez wanted was to climb out of that one-ball, two-strike hole 
he had fallen into. And with one swift swing, he went from being taken care of 
to taking care of. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a backup sophomore infielder, lined a two-out, two-run pinch double 
in the bottom of the eighth inning Thursday to give Valley College a 7-5 
victory over Pierce in a Western State Conference South Division game at 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball, hit on a pitch from Pierce relief ace Chris Frith-Smith (2-4), 
rolled to the fence and broke not only a 5-5 tie but Pierce's back in a game 
the Brahmas needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was working me outside, so I was just trying to hit it that way (to 
right field)," Gonzalez said. "I took the first two fastballs and then he threw 
me a curveball and then he gave me one right there. I don't think he wanted to 
get it that close."  
</P>
<P>
 For Pierce (25-15, 17-8 in conference play), the loss puts them at playoff 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas finished tied for first place in the South Division with 
Bakersfield but the Renegades will be named champions because of the conference 
tie-breaking procedures and will play North Division winner Cuesta in a 
one-game playoff Saturday for seeding purposes at the Southern California 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas, on the other hand, will face the North runner-up -- either 
Moorpark or Ventura -- on Saturday at Pierce to determine the third- and 
fourth-seeded teams in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only the top two seeded teams qualify automatically for the regional, 
with the No. 3-seeded team having only an outside chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce could have secured an automatic bid with a victory over Valley. But the 
defeat, coupled with Bakersfield's 15-1 victory over Santa Monica, put the 
tie-breaking wheels in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tie-breaker was head-to-head competition between the Brahmas and 
Bakersfield, but the teams split their four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The second was their record against opponents within the division, but both 
teams were 14-6 in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came head-to-head results against the team with the next-best record in 
the division, in this case Glendale, but both won three of four games against 
the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought everything down to Valley, which Bakersfield swept in their four 
games and Pierce defeated three times. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs (14-20-1, 12-13) pulled the plug on Pierce with a four-run 
rally in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, trailing, 5-3, and not being able to muster much offense against 
right-hander Jason Warren for seven innings, chased Pierce's starter in the 
eighth after he walked Ozzie Areu to open the inning and gave up a single to 
David Stevenson that sent Areu to third.  
</P>
<P>
 That brought in submariner Frith-Smith, but Marlon Hamilton greeted him with a 
sacrifice fly to right field that scored Areu. Designated hitter Jamie Zeichick 
and catcher Amani Smith hit back-to-back singles and, after Vic Seper flied to 
right, Gonzalez connected to drive in both runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gonzales) clutching up like that was awesome," Valley Coach Chris Johnson 
said. "To end it like that, after such a disappointing season, is nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce built a 4-2 lead in the fifth against starter Doug Rubin, who went 7 
1/3 innings, when catcher Brian Sturges (two for two) hit a two-run home run to 
left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Juan Velazquez (2-4) held the Brahmas hitless over the final 1 
2/3 innings.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; CYPRESS CLINCHES TIE FOR CONFERENCE BASEBALL TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress clinched at least a tie for the Orange Empire Conference baseball 
championship with a 17-4 victory over Golden West Thursday in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory keeps Cypress (33-10, 18-5 in conference) one game ahead of 
Riverside with one left.But because Cypress holds a 3-1 advantage over 
Riverside in head-to-head meetings, the Chargers are assured of being seeded 
first in the playoffs. Riverside beat Rancho Santiago, 16-4, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough (conference) to win," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "I 
was telling (assistant coach) Bill (Pinkham) I thought we would battle for 
third place." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress led, 5-0, going into the eighth but the Chargers added 12 runs, nine 
coming after two were out. Andy Gonzales capped the inning with a three-run 
home run. Jason Hodges had an RBI double and a two-run single also in the 
eighth for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress got a solid pitching performance from starter Aaron France, a 
sophomore right-hander who has signed to attend Miami next fall. France (10-3) 
gave up four hits and struck out five in seven innings. France walked three but 
none after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress plays host to Saddleback and Rancho Santiago is at Riverside at noon 
Saturday in conference-ending games. STEVE KRESAL

VERDUGO HILLS ANSWERS THE BELL IN FIRST ROUND; HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL: DONS GET 
ONLY ONE HIT, BUT DEFENDING CITY SECTION 3-A CHAMPIONS PREVAIL, 1-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was the worst offensive performance of the year for the Verdugo Hills High 
softball team, defending City Section 3-A champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dons certainly didn't let that stop them in their quest to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryann May's waist-high drive into center field was the Dons' only hit -- a 
triple -- Thursday against Bell, but it was the difference in Verdugo Hills' 
1-0 victory in a first-round 3-A playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out in the third inning, May ripped a liner up the middle. As she was 
rounding second, the ball bounced past center fielder Isabel Sosa for an error. 
May scored easily for the game's only run. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills (16-3), the division's second-seeded team, will face Lincoln, a 
6-3 winner over South Gate, in a quarterfinal-round game Tuesday. Before facing 
Bell (7-6), an at-large team that finished third in the Eastern League, Verdugo 
Hills had scored no fewer than six runs in a game, Coach Dan Balkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were nervous and anxious today because they are so used to 
scoring so many runs," Balkey said of his team. "We try to tell them it's a new 
season, but I think now they know they can be beat and outhit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is like a wake-up call for them." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing particularly special about the delivery of Bell right-hander 
Yvette Serrano (7-6), who walked four and hit one batter. But she certainly had 
the Dons baffled, enticing them to pop up or fly out 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bell had three hits off junior left-hander Shannon Schoonover 
(13-0), who struck out three and did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely outplayed them, no doubt about it," first-year Bell Coach Mario 
Caldevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dons' center fielder Melanie Wood kept the Eagles from scoring in the top of 
the third with a fine defensive play. Serrano, who reached base on an error 
with two out, tried to score from second two batters later on a hit by 
Magdalena Soto. Wood scooped up Soto's hit and threw a one-hop strike to 
catcher Jodi Kent, who blocked the plate and tagged out Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills, which has hit 16 home runs this season, stranded six runners, 
five in scoring position.

CHATSWORTH'S LACOUR OFFERS RESEDA A HAND, GETS FIST IN RETURN; HIGH SCHOOL 
BASEBALL: ALL-CITY SHORTSTOP PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH AND KNOCKED DOWN DURING 
POSTGAME CEREMONY.

 Chatsworth High shortstop Bryan LaCour, an All-City Section 4-A Division 
selection, was punched in the stomach and knocked to the ground by a Reseda 
player during postgame handshakes Thursday after the Chancellors' 7-2 victory 
in a West Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour was punched by Reseda third baseman Alonzo Arreola, who also was 
involved in an emotional incident when the teams played Tuesday. On a play at 
third base, Arreola tagged Chatsworth's Brandon Murphy in the face. Several of 
Murphy's teeth were chipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Mike Stone, who said Arreola was provoked by Chatsworth bench 
jockeys, said he will suspend Arreola for the remainder of the season.  
</P>
<P>
 "It started Tuesday and it carried over and continued today," Stone said. 
"He's a very quiet kid and it just built up inside. He knew right off the bat 
it was uncalled-for, and it was 100% out of his character. I felt sorry for the 
Chatsworth kid. But to be honest, I feel more sorry for Alonzo." 
</P>
<P>
 Also during Tuesday's game -- an 18-6 Chatsworth victory -- a Reseda player 
was ejected after he attacked Chatsworth pitcher Jim DeBiase, who applied the 
final tag during a rundown play. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour's father, Jeff, said the family is considering filing assault charges 
against Arreola. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think something has to be done," Jeff LaCour said. "It was totally 
uncalled-for." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn and Stone said the exchange was an isolated 
incident and there was no threat of a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our guys did a nice job keeping their poise, and the rest of their 
guys did a good job, too," Meusborn said. "Brian's OK. He just got the wind 
knocked out of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone called the incident inexcusable, the "ugliest" postgame exchange in his 
22 seasons as a City Section baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against the postgame handshake, because it just presented the opportunity 
for something like this to happen," Stone said. "But (Arreola) does not deserve 
to be blasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth improved to 21-3 and 12-0 Northwest Valley Conference play with 
pitcher Oscar Bocanegra (2-0) going the distance.  
</P>
<P>
 Rod and Ray Daryabigi each had two hits and scored a run as the Chancellors 
won their 14th consecutive game. They have a three-game lead with five games 
remaining. Reseda fell to 6-11-1, 2-10. STEVE ELLING and DANA HADDAD

POLICE RETURN BABY KIDNAPED FROM MOTHER'S HOSPITAL ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day-old baby boy who had been stolen from his mother's bedside by a woman 
who slipped past a Los Angeles hospital's elaborate security system was found 
late Thursday less than a mile from the hospital and was returned unharmed to 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Liborio Gonzalez Jr., the child of Guadalupe Villar, 33, was recovered by Los 
Angeles police acting on a telephone tip 14 1/2 hours after the swaddled baby 
was snatched from Villar's first-floor room at White Memorial Medical Center 
about 8:30 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the mother and child had been asleep when the baby was silently lifted 
from his bassinet and spirited out of the room in a pink and blue receiving 
blanket, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the baby at a local address in the Hollenbeck Division, just a few 
minutes before 11 p.m.," said Lt. Mike Felix of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected abductor -- a Latina about 45 years old, who had been recorded 
on a hospital security videotape -- was with the baby at a residence in the 
1100 block of Marietta Street in Boyle Heights when police arrived and 
surrendered calmly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's name was not immediately available; Felix said she had been 
arrested on suspicion of kidnaping. Details of the arrest, however, were 
sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, though, we're trying to piece it all together," Felix said. "From 
what we can tell, it may be that the suspect knew at least some of the family 
members, and may be a relative." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken hospital officials said the abductor apparently eluded guards as she 
entered the medical center, located in the 1700 block of Cesar E. Chavez 
Avenue. Once inside, she passed through a card key-controlled doorway to the 
maternity ward by following an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse discovered the infant missing "an extremely short time later," said 
medical center spokesman Mark Newmyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were uncertain whether Villar's private room was locked at the time 
of the abduction, Newmyer added. There are about 20 rooms in the maternity 
unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 Los Angeles police officers were sent to the hospital to interview 
patients and employees. "I don't know how that person got in here," said the 
child's father, Liborio Gonzalez Sr., a 39-year-old Eastside truck driver who 
was not in the room at the time of the abduction. "Things happen because 
they're going to happen sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 But he urged hospital officials to tighten security around newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 Newmyer said the medical center is investigating the apparent security breach. 
He said hospital employees are required to wear badges and visitors must have 
passes displayed on their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The card key lock system -- which requires employees to use 
computer-controlled access cards to unlock doors -- was installed about a year 
ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said hospital guards questioned the apparent abductor as she left the 
medical center with the infant beneath a blanket positioned over her shoulder. 
The woman said she had been visiting her sister, then strolled out and climbed 
into a car driven by a Latino man, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Thursday's abduction had some similarities to an attempted 
kidnaping at the same hospital six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, a 39-year-old woman was arrested after taking a 6-month-old 
baby who was being treated in the facility for diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses noticed a woman hanging around the newborn ward and asked her to leave, 
according to officials. She did, but she returned the next day and took the 
baby from a second-floor pediatric ward room. 
</P>
<P>
 An alert nurse grabbed the baby and shouted for co-workers to call guards. 
Security officers seized the woman on the third floor in the June 10, 1988, 
incident.

COUNTY LIFEGUARDS, FIRE SERVICES MERGED; BUDGET: ACTION ALLOWS USE OF FUNDS 
FROM FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. BUT SUPERVISORS INTEND TO KEEP SEEKING MONEY 
FROM CITIES AND THE STATE FOR A PORTION OF SAFETY COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to preserve regional control of services at area beaches, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Thursday to merge its lifeguard 
operations with the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The action will allow the lifeguards to tap into a steady source of funds 
provided through the Fire Protection District, which levies tax assessments on 
communities served by county firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance services would remain under the jurisdiction of the county's 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. Funding for these services, however, is less 
certain because the department is faced with budget cuts for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's actions were hailed by beach supporters and civic leaders, who had 
warned that a recommendation to disband the county lifeguard system would 
jeopardize public safety and harm Southern California's multibillion-dollar 
tourism and recreation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a giant step forward for the citizens of Los Angeles county and people 
who use the beaches," said Jim Boulgarides, secretary of the Los Angeles County 
Lifeguards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash-strapped county had threatened to relinquish lifeguard and 
maintenance services at beaches it does not own unless the state and beach 
cities such as Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Hermosa Beach contributed more to 
beach-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard and maintenance services cost the county about $20 million annually, 
less than half of which is recouped through parking and concession revenues. 
The county had been seeking an additional $5 million from the state and cities 
in exchange for continuing its services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Deane Dana, who drafted Thursday's proposals, warned that it 
would be a mistake for the county to dissolve a regional responsibility it has 
worked decades to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety at the beaches is at jeopardy if we cannot maintain our current 
level of lifeguarding, as well as beach maintenance," he said in a motion 
introducing the proposals. "The 60 to 70 million people a year that come to our 
beaches cannot and should not be subjected to unsafe conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action did little to resolve the issue of who is responsible for 
paying for beach services and in what share. Of the 19 beaches the county 
services, only areas of Malibu, Palos Verdes, Marina del Rey and the 
unincorporated portion of Santa Catalina Island fall within the Fire Protection 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The board signaled its intent to continue pressing the state and beach cities 
to pay a portion of the costs for lifeguards at the remaining beaches and to 
considerably increase their contributions toward the upkeep of those beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will try to get cities to provide a portion of their Proposition 
172 public safety funds to help pay for services, among other options. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had already given notice to the state that it would end lifeguard 
and maintenance services at seven state beaches by July 1, and has sent similar 
notices that it will sever services April 1 at city-owned beaches in Los 
Angeles, Santa Monica, Avalon and Hermosa Beach. The board voted Thursday to 
leave those notices intact while it negotiates additional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman, who cast the lone dissenting vote Thursday, had argued 
that the county should be more aggressive in securing cooperation from the 
state and cities and contended that in shifting lifeguard operations to the 
Fire Department, it lost its most effective bargaining chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Druyun, a legislative analyst with the city of Los Angeles, said after 
Thursday's hearing that the city will consider resuming its own lifeguard 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will do is review what the county's costs are and how that changes by 
moving the lifeguards to another jurisdiction," Druyun said. "But we would also 
figure what the costs are of starting up our own operation again -- and 
determine which is least costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance workers meanwhile expressed concern that their role in maintaining 
first-class beaches has been slighted and worried that the transfer of 
lifeguards to the Fire Department makes them more vulnerable to budget cuts. 
County maintenance crews remove more than 8 million pounds of trash annually 
from beaches and construct more than seven miles of sand berms during an 
average winter to prevent damage from high surfs and tides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel a little shortchanged," Melvin Knowles, a 30-year beach maintenance 
worker, said after the hearing. "We wanted to see the lifeguards and 
maintenance crews stay together because we come in contact with them so much 
every day. I believe we might get the cities to pay up a little more, but the 
state can be very stubborn. If we have to depend on them for our jobs it looks 
a little slim."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 28TH SENATE DISTRICT; EVEN AT 84, DILLS ISN'T THE 
RETIRING KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Well past an age when most politicians are content to retire and spoil their 
great-grandchildren, 84-year-old state Sen. Ralph C. Dills is battling for his 
political survival in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to the Assembly in 1938, Dills is the kind of entrenched career 
politician voters undoubtedly had in mind in 1990 when they imposed term limits 
to breathe new life into the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Democrat seeks to buck the anti-incumbent tide and win one 
final, four-year term in the Legislature, where he boasts he has served longer 
than any lawmaker in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 37 years of combined service in the Senate and Assembly, the 
onetime professional musician and former judge is facing the longevity and age 
questions head-on. Dills has sprinkled the newly created 28th Senate District 
with billboards featuring a photograph of him playing the saxophone and 
emblazoned with the message, "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dills' critics, including several Democratic primary challengers, say that 
he is out of tune with the everyday worries of voters: rising gun violence, 
unemployment and an endangered environment. Among them is George Nakano, a 
Torrance city councilman who seeks to become the first Japanese American to 
serve in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 To win reelection, Dills must appeal for the first time to voters in a 
district stretching from coastal Venice to blue-collar precincts in Long Beach. 
Many of them don't know him or care about his accomplishments, such as helping 
establish Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the legislative old guard and its mutual loyalties, Dills easily 
enlisted the backing of all but one of his Senate Democratic colleagues, 
including new Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph is effective. He works hard," Lockyer said in an interview, adding that 
Dills remains vital despite his lengthy service. At 84, Dills is 1 1/2 years 
younger -- but has been a legislator longer -- than the Senate's oldest member, 
Democrat Alfred Alquist of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 In betting on Dills, Lockyer is backing one of the most flamboyant figures in 
the Capitol. Still something of a night owl, Dills once earned his living 
playing sax in honky-tonks. His ties are loud.  
</P>
<P>
 Dills' hair commands particular attention around the Capitol. Carefully 
groomed to conceal a receding hairline, it regularly alternates between shades 
of blue and black. "It varies from week to week," Dills admits. "It depends on 
what day we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 With his raspy voice, tinged with the drawl of his Southwestern roots, Dills 
paints a vivid portrait of sweltering Sacramento in the days before air 
conditioning, television and political reform. He recalls lobbyists offering to 
wine and dine lawmakers "day and night" and organizing special gambling trains 
to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a wistfulness in his voice as Dills describes those "days of 
camaraderie," but he does not dwell on the past. Dills is an active chairman of 
the Governmental Organization Committee, which handles gambling and liquor 
legislation. He frequently presides over Senate debates and says he has no 
intention of easing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the retiring type," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent roast in his honor, Dills poked fun at his own attempt at 
timelessness, saying, "I may not be here forever, although I'm trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even rock-solid Republicans acknowledge that Dills remains fit to serve and is 
considered a living legend. "He outlasts most of us on the floor," Senate 
Republican Caucus Chairman William Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard maintained that Dills is vulnerable because his New Deal, pro-labor 
liberalism is out of touch with voters in the district. Nonetheless, Leonard 
said, the GOP won't be ready until Labor Day to decide whether to pump money 
into the fall campaign of Dills' Republican rival, expected to be David B. 
Cohen, 34, a Redondo Beach lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats contend that the district is as liberal as Dills' traditionally 
blue-collar turf around Gardena, which is excluded from the new district. In 
his old seat, Dills was so unbeatable that former Sen. H. L. Richardson 
(R-Glendora) once quipped: "They could put a lily on his chest and give him the 
last rites, and he'd win four years later." 
</P>
<P>
 Reapportionment scrambled the political landscape so much two years ago that 
Dills considered running for Congress. But he stayed put and decided to launch 
another state Senate bid. In the process, he was forced to move his voting 
residence from his Gardena-area condominium, which is outside the new district, 
to a rented apartment in El Segundo -- a switch assailed by his opponents as 
showing he has no real ties to the new district. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the move, Dills, known as a friend of oil companies, appears to be 
making other switches. He has uncharacteristically embraced several 
environmental proposals, including a controversial ban on offshore oil drilling 
in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my (new) district and I'm voting my district," said Dills, conceding 
that in the past he wasn't always a perfect environmental vote. In fact, 
environmentalists have assailed the Governmental Organization Committee he 
chairs as a graveyard for air quality legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills likes to remind voters he has consistently fought for the underdog, from 
poor people in the 1930s to gay men and lesbians in the 1980s. His challengers 
say that Dills' portrayal as a liberal friend of the downtrodden masks cozy 
ties to such vested economic interests as oil refiners, card room operators and 
alcoholic beverage distillers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the California League of Conservation Voters has put Dills at the top 
of its hit list of incumbents to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Schuchat, the political action group's executive director, characterized 
Dills' campaign contributions as reflecting "a veritable who's who of 
polluters." 
</P>
<P>
 Rival Nakano calls Dills a Johnny-come-lately on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "One who runs for public office ought to have conviction," said Nakano, who is 
endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters. "You don't change because it's 
politically popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Nakano, 58, Dills' Democratic rivals are Mike Sidley, 32, a Venice 
lawyer, and Joanne Rodda, 53, a Manhattan Beach real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 They seek to end one of the longest-running political sagas in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a young man 60 years ago, Dills cut his political teeth as a leader in 
writer Upton Sinclair's left-leaning End Poverty in California movement. Four 
years later, Dills, then a Latin teacher, captured a seat in the state 
Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, he resigned to become a Justice Court judge. Dills served on the 
bench for 17 years, qualifying him for judicial retirement pay of $71,400 a 
year. Along with his $52,500 annual salary as a lawmaker, Dills gets another 
$4,500 a year in Social Security and $1,800 annually in teachers retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1960s, Dills was ready to return to Sacramento. His chance came 
after the U.S. Supreme Court's "one-man, one-vote" decision prompted the 
establishment of 14 1/2 state Senate seats in Los Angeles County, which until 
then only had a single district. In 1966, Dills captured one of the seats and 
has been easily reelected ever since.

HOMICIDE DOWN 30% FROM 1993; CRIME: ALL OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES EXCEPT RAPE ALSO 
SHOWED DECLINES IN LOS ANGELES COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, LAPD 
STATISTICS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' homicide rate dropped 30% and most other serious crime declined 
in the city during the first quarter of 1994, compared with the first quarter 
last year, according to statistics released Thursday by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicides in the city totaled 176 from January through March of this year, 76 
fewer than the 252 during the same period in 1993. There were similar declines 
in all other serious crimes except rape, which increased from 386 in the first 
three months of 1993 to 387 in the first quarter of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The general decrease here reflected a nationwide trend, according to the FBI, 
which said serious crimes reported to police throughout the United States 
dropped 3% last year, after increases of 1% in 1992, 5% in 1991 and 11% in 
1990. The FBI's figures show a 7.6% decrease in reported serious crimes in Los 
Angeles in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a period of time, the best efforts of not only the police, but the 
community and the individuals in it, have finally turned the tide against 
crime," Cmdr. David Gascon, an LAPD spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody recognizes that violent crime is an enormously important issue, and 
we are all focusing on that, even though we may not always agree on the 
possible solutions," Gascon said. "I think what is important is that people 
don't jump to any short-term, erroneous conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistics don't tell the whole story," he said. "There may be a lot of crime 
out there that is not reported. The fact that the figures are down is a 
favorable trend, but each homicide is still a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD statistics released Thursday show the following declines between the 
first three months in 1993 and the same period in 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 * Robberies -- a drop from 9,605 to 7,999. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aggravated assaults -- from 10,061 to 9,152. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burglaries -- from 12,911 to 10,777. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burglaries and thefts from cars -- from 17,854 to 16,304. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thefts from people -- from 839 to 653. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other thefts -- from 12,329 to 10,340. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto thefts -- from 17,935 to 14,081. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD reports reviewed last week by The Times identified dozens of pockets of 
crime in the city, including corridors along certain thoroughfares that account 
for large portions of the violent crimes reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those corridors are stretches of Broadway, Vernon Avenue and Central 
Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles, an area surrounding the Northridge Fashion 
Center and a long stretch of Roscoe Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports reflected the LAPD's frustration at its inability to curb certain 
types of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of arrests for rape seems to have no impact on the numbers of 
crimes committed," the LAPD said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTURY CITY; FAYE 
DUNAWAY OFFERED LEAD IN 'SUNSET BOULEVARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faye Dunaway has been offered the role of Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard" 
at the Shubert Theatre, a spokesman for producer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If negotiations are completed as planned, Dunaway will replace Glenn Close in 
the hit musical after June 26, when Close is scheduled to leave in order to 
begin rehearsals for the role in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Not known for her singing, Dunaway reportedly had intensively prepared for her 
audition, which Lloyd Webber conducted this week. Asked whether she can sing, 
Lloyd Webber spokesman Peter Brown, who had not attended the audition, replied, 
"Andrew's happy with her. And it's his music." 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Moreno and Diahann Carroll also auditioned for Lloyd Webber this week, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be her debut as a singer," Dunaway's manager Bob Palmer told The 
Associated Press, "and she's ready." 
</P>
<P>
 (This announcement was made after today's Liz Smith column on F2 had gone to 
press.)

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTWOOD; UCLA DROPS 
CHARGES AGAINST STUDENT PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA on Thursday dropped criminal misdemeanor charges against one student and 
agreed not to prosecute six others in connection with $27,000 worth of damage 
done to the Faculty Center during a protest last year over the school's Chicano 
studies program. 
</P>
<P>
 The school agreed to stop plans for prosecution after Los Angeles Chicano 
artist Gronk donated a painting -- entitled "The Mug" and worth between $15,000 
and $18,000 -- as partial reparation for the damage.A second gift from Chicana 
artist Elo, valued at $7,000, was also accepted by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were among 99 arrested last May after activists stormed the 
Faculty Center to protest Chancellor Charles E. Young's announcement that UCLA 
would not create a separate Chicano studies department. The protests and a 
hunger strike led to a compromise -- the Cesar Chavez Chicano Studies Center -- 
which has an interim director but no permanent faculty to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronk's gift, which is part of his "Hotel Senator" series, now hangs in the 
Faculty Center.

LIFE FOR KILLING OF ARMORED CAR GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole for murdering an armored car guard during a hardware store robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury recommended the life term for Sean Darnell Slade, and 
Judge Ronald S. Coen imposed it. The guard, Edwin Maldonado, was shot to death 
July 29, 1992, at a Home Depot in San Fernando. Slade, convicted of 
manslaughter in a 1987 shooting, had been on parole for 25 days at the time of 
Maldonado's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas said several accomplices remain at large.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $10,000 
REWARD OFFERED FOR CLUES TO CELES KING ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the attackers who severely beat Celes King III, a bail 
bondsman and prominent civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 70, was kidnaped, robbed and assaulted, then released on Ardmore Avenue 
near Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown before dawn on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles Police Department has not identified a suspect in this case, 
and no further leads appear to be forthcoming," Councilman Nate Holden's motion 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 King, a longtime Republican activist, served previously as president of the 
Los Angeles Human Relations Commission and the local chapter of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. He suffered severe head injuries 
and other wounds in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest of a hit-and-run driver who killed Marcy Lewis, 27, in a Hancock Park 
collision March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis died and her husband was critically injured when a van broadsided the 
newlyweds' car, sending it crashing up a sidewalk and into a tree. Witnesses 
said the van was traveling about 65 m.p.h. and ran a stop sign. The van's 
driver and passengers abandoned the vehicle after the accident and fled.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ROSEANNE 
ARNOLD SUED BY FORMER MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roseanne Arnold's former manager has filed a $40-million lawsuit against her 
former employer, saying the actress fired her without justification and then 
defamed her in the recent autobiography, "My Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlyne Rothberg, who said she represented Arnold exclusively from 1988 until 
the actress's marriage to Tom Arnold in 1990, said in the Los Angeles Superior 
Court lawsuit filed Tuesday that "My Lives" contained passages in which Arnold 
accused Rothberg and others of claiming they "created" her and are growing 
"fatter and fatter off my sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothberg also said the book contained another passage that indicated that she 
was busy planning her own career instead of looking after Arnold's. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the offending passages had damaged her reputation and her 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold and her spokespersons could not be reached for comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WOMAN DIES 
AFTER BEING ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who was accidentally shot in the head last week by her 6-year-old son 
has died after she was disconnected from a life-support system at the request 
of her family, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyang Ja Jung, 36, who had been in critical condition at County-USC Medical 
Center, was pronounced dead Wednesday afternoon.Her husband, father and son 
were at her bedside when she died, hospital spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just six days before the April 27 shooting, Jung and her son had arrived in 
Los Angeles from Korea to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. The father was 
a security guard at the Koreatown apartment building where he lived. He fell 
asleep before going to work, detectives said, allowing the boy to pull the gun 
from his waist belt and accidentally fire one shot. The man had put the gun in 
his belt to keep it from the boy, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Thursday that they planned to file a report with the district 
attorney's office today. Under the Children's Firearm Accident Protection Act, 
an adult can receive up to three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine for 
keeping a loaded weapon that is accessible to a minor.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
DISTRAUGHT MAN BARRICADES HIMSELF IN CAR AT CEMETERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A distraught fugitive, brandishing a gun and driving a stolen station wagon, 
barricaded himself in a San Gabriel Valley cemetery for three hours Thursday 
before surrendering peacefully, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erikson said James Dale Parker, 30, of Moreno Valley, 
had entered Forest Lawn Memorial-Park Covina Hills shortly before 3 p.m., 
careening around the cemetery until a worker reported him. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies and officers from the California Highway Patrol drove to the cemetery 
and chased the stolen gray 1988 Toyota over headstones and floral wreaths, 
eventually forcing the car into a bank of flowers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker allegedly barricaded himself inside the vehicle and yelled that he 
would not surrender until he could call his wife in Las Vegas. Later, as news 
helicopters circled overhead and SWAT team members closed in, the man 
threatened suicide, explaining that he was in despair over ongoing criminal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Erikson said Parker was wanted in Las Vegas for suspected forgery, and a 
warrant had been issued for his arrest. The car he was driving had been stolen 
in Norwalk on Tuesday, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5:45 p.m., the SWAT team fired two "flash bang" grenades at Parker's 
car. He surrendered about five minutes later, and was booked on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, grand theft auto and felony 
vandalism, Erikson said.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; SHOULD 'INMATE BILL OF 
RIGHTS' BE MODIFIED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 52-word "inmate bill of rights" in the California Penal Code has come under 
attack by politicians and others who claim it allows state prison inmates 
undeserved privileges such as access to hard-core pornography, conjugal visits, 
marriage and the right to wear their hair any length. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, passed in 1968 and expanded in 1975, states that inmates have the 
same rights as other residents and any narrowing of those rights must be 
directly related to the security of a prison. Two bills to repeal the measure, 
by state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) and Assemblyman Dean Andal 
(R-Stockton), have passed their respective legislative houses and are awaiting 
further action. 
</P>
<P>
 What changes, if any, should be made to the state's "inmate bill of rights" 
and why? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Katz, Democratic state assemblyman, 39th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a combination of symbolism and substantive (aspects need to be 
eliminated). The substantive includes things like weekend visitation that the 
inmates enjoy while in prison, combined with the symbolism of the fact that 
prison is not supposed to be easy or fun. It's punishment for crimes against 
society. There is a sense that the rights of the inmate or the rights of the 
accused take greater precedence than the rights of the victim or of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hill, a private attorney in Woodland Hills who has represented 17 
defendants facing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'd answer the question (as to changes) in the negative, except for 
provisions I'm not completely familiar with, such as making periodicals 
available to inmates. "I think the political response has been somewhat naive, 
but it has been well accepted given the public's attitude. Giving these rights 
to inmates is, number one, humanitarian. I don't think the public wants a 
system where people are chained to walls. Second, people in control of the 
facilities will tell you these rights are vital in creating a (tolerant) 
attitude in institutions, not only among inmates, but for those responsible for 
guarding them. To limit these rights can do nothing but increase violence among 
these inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ratelle, warden of the California State Prison in Lancaster, which houses 
3,977 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest issue . . . is inmates can get magazines and articles that are 
just atrocious and nasty. A rapist can get it, a child molester can get it. . . 
. Sen. Presley's bill has the same rights that are under the civil 
constitution, but can limit (publications received), and that's what we 
currently support.  
</P>
<P>
 "Restricting the right to marry (is appropriate). The way it is now, male 
inmates can meet women through correspondence, or a female inmate can meet a 
male, and marry them while in prison. All they do is use the person. I think 
there should be some restrictions. . . . If they met before the person went in 
prison, that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 John Spillane, head of the Antelope Valley branch of the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public perception is that we 'coddle' prisoners and, although that is not 
the case, they are given certain privileges such as television, magazines and 
conjugal visits that many people feel, depending on the circumstances of the 
crime committed, the inmates do not deserve. I can see where some of the 
Department of Corrections officials feel we need these privileges as 
inducements to good behavior . . . (but) rather than giving them to everyone, I 
would like to see them given to prisoners right before they go out. The last 
year of their incarceration, perhaps, or as a reward for good behavior."

RON HARRIS: PROVIDING THE KEY TO UNLOCK HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the second day of the looting, I stood in front of a video-stereo store in 
a shopping center at the corner of Slauson and Crenshaw not far from my house. 
I had gone down to take a look, partly as a reporter, mostly out of curiosity. 
People were pouring out of the store, loaded down with stacks of movie videos 
and stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched them leaving with their bounty, larceny crept into my heart. 
There were no police around. It would have been nothing for me to walk in and 
take something. But then "morality" kicked in. With my luck, I thought, 
somebody would capture me on videotape and I'd end up on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 I would be publicly disgraced. A reputation that I had earned over years would 
be flushed down the drain for one rash, stupid act. I'd lose my job. With no 
income, I could lose my house and my car. There would be no money for movies 
and concerts and expensive dinners. A vacation would be out. There would be no 
money for my son's college education. 
</P>
<P>
 And all because of a video tape or stereo equipment that I could easily 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 I was relating this story a few months ago to a friend, Donovan Green, a 
manger for Pacific Bell, active USC alumnus, and father figure to many of the 
young men he coaches on his summer league basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Ron," he said. "I had the same experience. For a split second it 
entered my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 What, I asked Donovan, was different about us and the people who looted. We 
weren't necessarily any more moral or honest than they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't worth it for us," Donovan said. "We had something to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Tracey Davis, a high school dropout who was "just hanging out," 
was one of the people who didn't feel like he had anything to lose. So he took 
something, "a sweat shirt, some jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 That was before he ran into the Los Angeles Urban League Automotive Training 
Center. The center, funded for three years by Toyota, trains men and women in 
automotive mechanics and puts them to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the center celebrated its first year in business and its 
100th graduate. Davis, 19, graduated with honors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marion McGee first saw Davis in February, he didn't have high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like a 'banger, his pants sagging, his hair a certain way," McGee 
said. "But he did everything I asked him to do, and more," including going back 
to school to get his high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Davis is concerned, the program saved his life, and maybe even 
somebody else's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 10 of us who were supposed to come down, but only four of us did," he 
recalled. "One guy didn't pass the test. The rest of them are now either dead 
or in jail. If it hadn't been for the program, I'd probably be just like them. 
If I hadn't gotten something right then, I probably would have started doing 
something else, like robbery or selling drugs, anything to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 He's now working at Toyota Lexus Service, an automotive repair shop in 
Gardena. The first real job he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 Working alongside him is Carlos Noyes, 19, another graduate of the Automotive 
Training Center. Noyes probably would have been in the streets looting two 
years ago as well, but he was in jail that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Noyes' vocation had been armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have no job or nothing," said Noyes, who finished high school while 
in jail. "I tried a number of times, but I just kept on getting denied, and I 
got tired of it, so I did the little 'jacks' for quick money." 
</P>
<P>
 He stumbled onto the program when he took a friend down to apply and decided 
to take the entrance exam himself. He passed and was accepted. And now, he's in 
a different world. Gone are most of the homies, replaced by a new set of 
friends, the striving graduates of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my old friends can't accept the fact that I'm working," he said. "A 
lot of them say things like, 'He's a punk now.' The ones that call me a punk, I 
just ask them, 'Are you going to pay me for kicking it out here on the streets? 
You going to pay me for claiming this hood or claiming that hood?' I don't want 
to go back out there. There's nothing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 60 graduates attending the anniversary celebration. The vast 
majority had never been gang members, had never been in jail, had never been in 
trouble. They were just men and women searching desperately for the key that 
would unlock the doors to opportunity. They praised the school, the 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inspiring ceremony. Men and women who had been lost had suddenly 
found something special -- themselves. And they told me that no matter the 
adversity, that was something they would never again lose.

EXPLOSIVE SITUATION; WHEN BOMB SQUAD IS CALLED, POLICE CAR LOT IS NO PLACE FOR 
A BRIEFCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The next time you leave your briefcase lying around a police station, make 
sure it's labeled -- otherwise it might get blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what happened Thursday when Sgt. Horace Frank of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division spotted an unmarked briefcase in 
the station's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous computer messages went out to squad cars and no one claimed the 
nondescript brown case, the LAPD's bomb squad was called in. 
</P>
<P>
 Two houses and part of the police station were evacuated for more than an hour 
while the three-person bomb squad figured out what to do with the briefcase, 
which happened to be sitting on top of a block wall next to the watch 
commander's parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a special rifle, they shot the case, leaving a hole the size of an 
apple. That is common practice, they said, when suspicious objects are found at 
or near police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat it as if it's an explosive or a bomb, until we determine it's not," 
said Lt. Steven Allen, a member of the bomb squad.  
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the briefcase belonged to an LAPD traffic officer who had 
gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not identify the officer because they said he might be 
disciplined for not appropriately labeling his briefcase. All personal 
possessions must bear the officer's name, Lt. Winthrop Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. David Twitchell recalled a similar incident last Christmas when the bomb 
squad was called out to investigate a tin can discovered sitting on the hood of 
a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb squad determined the can was harmless and opened it, finding a batch 
of cookies from neighbors who wanted to show their appreciation for two 
officers who had helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 That tense situation could have been avoided if the neighbors had simply left 
a note of thanks, Twitchell said.

JUDGE REDUCES SPYING SENTENCE OF FBI AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only FBI agent ever convicted of spying has had his sentenced reduced, and 
his lawyer said he will try to get him out of prison soon. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi on Wednesday reduced the sentence of 
Richard Miller from 20 years in prison to 13.Miller was convicted in 1986 of 
trading secrets for sex in a romance with a Soviet emigre. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, issued in Los Angeles, said Miller should serve no more than 
two-thirds of his sentence, and because he has spent nine years behind bars he 
will soon be released, said Miller's lawyer, Joel Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said his client will be released as soon as the judge's order is 
processed. Miller, 57, is being held in the minimum-security federal prison in 
Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings to reduce the sentence, Levine said that Miller was depressed in 
prison and that his weight had swelled to 350 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had said his weight problem was part of the reason he entered into the 
affair with Svetlana Ogorodnikov that led to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogorodnikov pleaded guilty to luring Miller into espionage and was sentenced 
to 18 years in prison. Her husband, Nikolai, also pleaded guilty. He was 
released from prison on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In his third trial Miller was convicted of trading a secret document for sex 
and promises of $65,000 in cash and gold.  
</P>
<P>
 The court proceedings spanned more than six years. The first trial ended with 
a hung jury. Miller was convicted in the second trial, but the conviction was 
overturned because of the admission of polygraph evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's request for parole was denied because the parole board said his 
crimes had compromised national security.

WORKERS UNEARTH BODY IN SAN MARINO YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers digging a hole Thursday for a back yard pool in San Marino unearthed 
the skeletal remains of a person whose body had been dismembered and buried in 
three plastic bags, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains were uncovered behind the Lorain Road home about 1 p.m., said 
Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives could not immediately determine the age or sex of the body. They 
said they would return to the home today to look for clues.  
</P>
<P>
 The nine-year resident of the home was not considered a suspect in the case.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: BOTH SIDES OF ASSAULT WEAPON ISSUE HAD MCKEON IN THEIR 
SIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 BUCK ON THE FENCE: Conservative U.S. Rep. Howard P.(Buck) McKeon(R-Santa 
Clarita) has owned guns since he was 16 years old. He voted against the Brady 
Bill to create a national five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, McKeon wavered just enough over the hotly debated measure to outlaw the 
purchase of 19 assault weapons to be considered a crucial undecided vote. No 
other San Fernando Valley-area representative was considered on the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon was lobbied by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the author of the bill 
to ban the manufacture, sale and possession of such rapid-fire weapons as the 
Uzi and the Street Sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is attack the criminal," said McKeon, who ultimately voted 
against the measure. "If someone uses a gun in a crime, they should be hit hard 
and fast with a severe penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 He said criminals will "get guns one way or another" and that banning the sale 
of assault weapons "will be more restrictive on honest, law-abiding gun 
owners." Assault weapons already in private ownership would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon cited other reasons: He owns two guns that use ammunition clips that 
carry more than 10 rounds, which puts them among those weapons that would be 
barred; as a Mormon, he recalled that early Mormons in Missouri had to give up 
their firearms and were then chased from the state by gun-toting settlers; and 
he said that those who currently own the weapons that would be banned would 
"feel like now they're doing something against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said that his $5,450 in campaign contributions from the National Rifle 
Assn. had nothing to do with his vote. Whichever way he went, he said, "there's 
going to be some people unhappy" but he acknowledged that gun owners are most 
likely to be single-issue voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), who got $1,000 from the NRA in 1992, 
also opposed the ban. Democratic Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland Hills, 
Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles voted for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban passed, 216-214. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE HEAT OVER FIREARMS: A staple of the Valley Industry & Commerce Assn.'s 
annual trip to Washington is a Capitol Hill breakfast or lunch with Southern 
California lawmakers. The sessions are usually low-key and congenial. Not so 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the business and civic activists saw sparks fly between Moorhead and 
Beilenson. The issue was gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead derided the five-day waiting period, named after James Brady, the 
press secretary to former President Ronald Reagan who was critically wounded in 
the 1981 assassination attempt. Brady and his wife, Sarah, spearheaded the 
successful fight to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead called the measure "a turf war between the NRA and the Brady bunch" 
and said, "The Brady Bill will do nothing to stop crime." The veteran lawmaker 
said he doesn't "believe even in shooting rabbits" but maintained that most 
criminals buy their weapons on the black market, not from licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to those who commit crimes with firearms, Moorhead said: "If they 
didn't have guns, they'd do it with knives," to which one VICA member muttered: 
"Did you ever hear of a drive-by knifing?" 
</P>
<P>
 This was more than Beilenson could stand. "We do things in incremental, modest 
ways," he said. He added that he and other Brady Bill supporters had sided with 
law-enforcement officials because "they are being outgunned by criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Under rhetorical fire, Moorhead said Congress is likely to prohibit minors 
from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big deal," Beilenson shot back. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MISSING IN ACTION: Sang Korman, the Newbury Park Republican who is running for 
Congress for the fourth time, is the invisible candidate in the 24th District 
GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Korman, a Korean-American immigrant who plowed more than $750,000 of his own 
money into three previous unsuccessful primary races and campaigned vigorously, 
does not appear to be doing anything this time. No appearances, no mailers, no 
news releases, no fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 And the normally talkative businessman has failed to return reporters' calls 
for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sang hasn't been doing anything," said Bob Lavoie, who ran Korman's first two 
campaigns and remains a friend. "He's consulting and doing a lot of traveling." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavoie said he did not know why Korman had filed to run again. A campaign aide 
for one of his opponents speculated that Korman was trying to raise money to 
repay funds he had loaned his campaign. (Lavoie called that interpretation 
incorrect.)  
</P>
<P>
 Korman has defied political logic before. This time, at least, the price 
doesn't seem to be so high. 
</P>

<P>
 NOT-SO-UNITED WE STAND: An active group of Ross Perot supporters from Thousand 
Oaks apparently oversold its standing when its members announced their 
endorsement of an independent candidate for the 24th Congressional District, 
which includes part of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the members of the small group were acting on their own when 
they decided to seek to place newcomer Rhett Wooden, a Thousand Oaks cameraman 
and grip, on the ballot. Contrary to a report in this column, the individuals 
were not acting on behalf of, or in conjunction with, the Conejo Valley chapter 
of United We Stand, America. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the coterie that sought an independent candidate to oppose Beilenson 
was rebuffed by the chapter when it requested formal support for Wooden. 
Support is divided primarily among various Republican candidates, said chapter 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The small band of Wooden backers is continuing to pursue its goal as 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those most active in the independent candidate effort was Verne Balman, 
who was chairman of the 24th District for United We Stand. He has since 
resigned his post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Verne and his group took it upon themselves to run a candidate, which is 
completely against the bylaws of United We Stand," said Edmund Barnes, a 
Newbury Park retiree who became chairman of the Conejo Valley chapter last 
month. "We can't endorse any candidate.

 "Most of the members of the Conejo Valley chapter did not want to run an 
independent candidate. And that is where the friction came in." 
</P>
<P>
 Balman could not be reached. But Sue Gerds, another mover behind the 
independent candidacy, maintained that Balman's resignation had nothing to do 
with this issue. She said she also stepped down as Conejo Valley membership 
chair because she was disillusioned by the Perot organization's top-down 
leadership style from its Dallas headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not what we were sold, that it would be as grass-roots," Gerds 
said. "The national (United We Stand, America) definition of grass roots is 
'out of sight and in the dark.' The only time grass roots is dusted off is when 
they need to dig a grave."

AROUND TOWN: WE'RE JUST ONE GIANT BOOT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John McFarlane's practiced eye zeros in on a quartet of teen-age girls on a 
Melrose Avenue spree. With a nod, he dispatches Rory Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you can say combat boots , Rooney intercepts: "We're from England and 
we're doing a (ad) campaign for Doc Martens. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, his giggling hostages are being laced into gold and silver Doc Martens. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls are photographed, unlaced, paid -- in shoe key chains -- and sent on 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney, jaywalking on Melrose with abandon, brings back more willing victims. 
Eyes peeled for a black-and-white, a member of the entourage mumbles: "I can't 
wait to see him talking the police into putting on Doc Martens." 
</P>
<P>
 A tattered-looking chap strolls by. McFarlane tells Rooney: "We'll give him a 
pair. He looks like he could use them." But the man must be the only person in 
greater L.A. who thinks that Doc Martens is a practicing surgeon. Thanks, but 
no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney shrugs, figuring one in three will demur. Told that they'll star in a 
glossy magazine spread, some are eager to pose, although confiding that the 
clunky boots are really ugly. Others, such as Olga Munoz, 16, of Montebello -- 
who sported her own Doc Martens and a blond brush cut -- are big-time fans: 
"Even my grandma has a pair." (Forty percent of the British firm's shoe sales 
are in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 Director McFarlane, 31, and his merry young London crew of five were winding 
up a monthlong adventure that had begun in New York, which in itself was quite 
an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission: to buy a vehicle to transport them and their cache of classic unisex 
Doc Martens on their 10,000-mile journey to L.A. via Central America and 
Mexico. First stop: a used car lot in Queens to take a van for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engine seized on the freeway," McFarlane recalls. They abandoned the car. 
"There we were, walking through Queens with $8,000 in our pockets. . . ." 
Eventually, they made a deal with the owner of a Chinese restaurant to buy his 
delivery van, a 1989 Dodge Ram, for $4,000. "It was like a wok inside," says 
McFarlane -- but it ran. 
</P>
<P>
 At trendy Club USA in Manhattan, they photographed transvestites in boots. 
Stumbling on a gang fight in Harlem, they filmed that, too. "We couldn't put 
them in Doc Martens," McFarlane says. "They were shooting each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading south -- way south -- they wound up in strife-torn Chiapas, Mexico. 
"We did all these revolutionaries in the boots . . . we managed to infiltrate 
their ranks by talking about the (Northern) Irish" -- they could relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Mexicans know about Doc Martens? They do now. The Brits gave away 15 
pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guatemala, McFarlane and company found themselves in a Holy Week 
stations-of-the-cross procession. "Five thousand Mayan Indians and six 
gringos," recalls McFarlane, "and none of us speak Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they left with photos of the faithful in ethnic dress -- and Doc 
Martens. Later, "We got a guy walking down the road to market with his wild 
boar." 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador, they put farmhands in Doc Martens. In Mexico City, it was 
ladies of the night. In Arizona, they posed residents of a retirement complex 
in Doc Martens a la "American Gothic." 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, they recorded a model emerging from the surf in bikini -- and Doc 
Martens.  
</P>
<P>
 The crew -- Rooney, 22, production assistant; free-lance photographer Eddie 
Monsoon, 27; producer Paul McPadden, 30; stylist Lisa Traxler, 27, and 
cinematographer Haris Zambarlouks, 24 -- had also been commissioned by English 
TV to do a documentary on the Americas as they traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Martens, which advanced them about $15,000, plans to build a print 
campaign around the photos. 
</P>
<P>
 When McFarlane pitched the idea, he says, "The board didn't really understand 
it at first." But, then, another of his quirky ideas had proved a smash ad 
campaign in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "We walked 400 miles over the Himalayas wearing these really expensive suits 
and Doc Martens. We had 30 Sherpas in Doc Martens," McFarlane says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to do workers of the world, people in all the industrial capitals, 
at their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Doc Martens. 
</P>
<P>
 Natch. 
</P>
<P>
 Reel Goes Retail: When Western Costume Co. cleans out its closet, now, that's 
entertainment! 
</P>
<P>
 The 82-year-old costumer to the stars has gone retail with the recent opening 
of an outlet store adjacent to its huge warehouse at Vanowen and Vineland in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeted by a waving gorilla and a mannequin in armor, shoppers picked their 
way through an eclectic 2,000-item inventory, including World War II WAC 
oxfords, Carmen Miranda-esque headgear and Revolutionary War soldiers' tunics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the biggest walk-in closet can hold only 5 million items, company 
president Eddie Marks explained of his decision to open this off-the-wall 
thrift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 And, frankly, he added, "Some of the stuff just doesn't rent that much 
anymore." He mentions leftovers from '50s and '60s films -- "Summmer-time 
back-yard swimming pool parties. Sandra Dee. The Elvis pictures. The gowns went 
from one film to another." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he says, they're just a little "too tired, like some of the actors 
and actresses." 
</P>
<P>
 Western veep Donna Roberts has pulled from the warehouse saloon girl dresses, 
flapper gowns, even a handsome pair of rabbit ears. "At Halloween, some guy is 
going to want to be a Playboy bunny," she reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 There are feathery, mega-glitter numbers from long ago Hollywood musicals. 
"It's over," she says -- no demand. For garage sale prices ($1 to $20), fans 
may buy a piece of "Brigadoon" or "Flower Drum Song." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Thursday-through-Sunday store catches on, Marks says, he may open 
satellites. "If we take a $75 rental item to Rodeo Drive and put a $2,000 price 
tag on it, someone will buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: During a USC panel discussion, English professor-poet-critic Carol 
Muske-Dukes told of going to an industry party with her actor husband, David 
Dukes, soon after they moved here from New York. Inevitably, someone asked, 
"What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I'm a writer' and they said, 'Half-hour or hour?' "

GOP ASSEMBLY CONTENDERS COME OUT SLINGING; CAMPAIGN: AS THE PRIMARY NEARS, THE 
CANDIDATES FOR THE 70TH DISTRICT NOMINATION ARE INCREASINGLY ON THE OFFENSIVE 
-- AND THE DEFENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a month still to go before the June 7 primary, the three-way Republican 
contest in the 70th Assembly District would already seem to have had more than 
its share of political intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion, bankruptcy, a threatened lawsuit and even the knifing of one 
candidate by a homeless man have already been floated as potential "Gotcha!" 
issues designed to knock any one of the candidates out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the three GOP candidates, Marilyn C. Brewer, Barry J. Hammond and 
Thomas G. Reinecke, are still firmly in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Republican-dominated Orange County, where intraparty warfare is not 
uncommon, there is one guarantee in this otherwise uncertain race: The attacks 
are only going to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just starting, it's just starting," Brewer's political consultant, 
Harvey Englander, said while trying to duck during a recent exchange of 
political gunfire between the Reinecke and Hammond camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high because the GOP nominee in the state's most Republican 
Assembly district will be heavily favored to win the November general election 
against the only Democrat in the race, attorney Jim Toledano. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, all three candidates claimed during their first forum in March 
that they had not done research into the private lives of their opponents and 
pledged not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the background checks had already been done, in some cases by 
"free-lance" supporters or by those backing candidates who eventually dropped 
out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the candidates continue to promise not to engage in mudslinging, the 
"whisper campaigns" are getting louder, and all three expect that someone 
else's organization will fill voters' mailboxes with hit pieces in the final 
week before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad state when politics is decided in the last three days by who can 
put out the nastiest hit piece," said Reinecke, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, an Irvine city councilman, said he believes the harsh campaigning got 
off to a quick start because there is little difference between the candidates 
on fiscal and regulatory issues, although Hammond and Reinecke oppose abortion 
rights while Brewer advocates them. 
</P>
<P>
 The early cross-fire means "someone is trying to make something happen," 
Hammond added. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer agreed, saying the race "is certainly beginning to heat up." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first two months of the campaign, the contest was highlighted by 
numerous attacks that the three candidates said were not unfair tactics but 
valid efforts to show the differences between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not hit pieces," Reinecke said of recent mail sent out on his 
behalf. "These are on issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke became the first "victim" when an unsigned mailer accused him of 
being sued for non-payment of an abortion allegedly performed on his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke himself brought the allegation out into the open and vehemently 
denied it. He said a court document accusing him of non-payment was the result 
of a mix-up with his insurance company over a bill related to an orthopedic 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, another anonymous mailer labeled Reinecke as a member 
of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., which is largely viewed by conservative 
Republicans as being anti-business. Opponents used as evidence Reinecke's 
half-page "personal injury" advertisement in the telephone business directory. 
Reinecke responded that he was erroneously listed on the trial lawyers' roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, a businesswoman and former aide to Board of Supervisors Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley, has been targeted by the most conservative factions of the 
local GOP because of her stand on abortion. The Reinecke camp has warned in its 
mailers that Brewer could win if the conservative vote splits between Reinecke 
and Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 One Reinecke letter by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) begins: "Dear 
protector of the pre-born." Another letter signed by Reinecke's father, former 
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, who served with then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, criticizes 
Brewer for being a former Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer responded that Reagan, as well as other prominent Republicans, were 
once Democrats and that the GOP would become "even more segregationist than it 
is now" if it tries to limit participation to only those "born into the party." 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, the Orange County Coordinating Republican Assembly, which 
has endorsed Reinecke, recently sent a letter to Hammond urging him to withdraw 
from the race. The group's chairman, Douglas H. Thomson, alleged that the 
Brewer campaign was about to derail Hammond's candidacy by releasing 
information about his "dubious financial dealings." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter referred to a 1991 personal bankruptcy filed by Hammond as well as 
a workers' compensation claim Hammond recently submitted to the city of Irvine 
after suffering a gash on his leg in an attack by a homeless man in Sacramento, 
where Hammond was testifying before a legislative panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, who said he discussed the letter with Reinecke before mailing it to 
Hammond, questioned whether the knifing actually occurred because Hammond did 
not file a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke, however, said Thomson did not discuss the letter with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said he does not think Hammond's bankruptcy should be an issue in the 
campaign, but he criticized Hammond for taking advantage of the workers' 
compensation system by filing the injury claim. Workers' compensation, Reinecke 
said, "is one of the problems facing small businesses. Mr. Hammond should lead 
by example and not automatically file a claim." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond denied he had abused the workers' compensation system and said the 
bankruptcy had resulted from a combination of major medical emergencies that 
beset his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hammond campaign responded with a press release this week, claiming that 
Reinecke's campaign was in "disarray" and that Reinecke's political consultant, 
Steve Presson, had resigned after the Thomson letter was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke denied that Presson had resigned, but Presson confirmed that he quit 
the Reinecke campaign on April 29, the same date the Thomson letter was 
distributed. Presson would not elaborate, but he said his departure was 
unrelated to the attack letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Englander acknowledged that he had gathered the same information against 
Hammond but said he had not done anything with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewer camp has not been sitting idly on the sidelines. It has accused 
Brewer's opponents of preparing to use false information against her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter delivered Wednesday to Hammond and Reinecke, Brewer's attorney 
threatened them with a lawsuit if they disseminate information about a tax lien 
having been filed against Brewer and her husband in 1985. The letter, from 
attorney Christopher L. Blank, stated that the lien was filed in error and 
immediately withdrawn.

FIGHTING HER WAY BACK; TERESA ARGUELLO GOES INTO THE RING WITH NEW CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dreaded flashbacks begin for Teresa Arguello the moment she climbs into 
bed. They always start with the same haunting scene -- her live-in boyfriend 
holding a gun to her head and firing two bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember all the blood on my face," she says. "It's like a movie that won't 
go away." 
</P>
<P>
 One bullet missed, but the other grazed her forehead. Arguello did not suffer 
any serious permanent damage in the shooting in August, 1992, but it steeled 
her resolve to resume an unusual career that her boyfriend-turned-assailant 
made her give up: professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six weeks after I got out of the hospital, I was back at the gym, training. 
If I had still been in training, maybe I could have defended myself," she said. 
"I can't let him ruin my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguello is the only professional female boxer in Orange County and one of 
just 50 in the country, according to her trainer. She will have her fourth 
professional fight tonight at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguello, 32, raises three children by herself in La Habra, but boxing isn't 
paying the bills. She figures she'll be fighting only a few times a year at up 
to $500 a match, and she relies on her day job with a local moving company to 
support the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's bout is a rematch, pitting Arguello against Helga Risoy, who beat 
her twice before. At their previous fight in December, the fight judge stopped 
the bout when Arguello got a bloody nose. Without a trainer at the time, 
Arguello did not know how to stop the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed, but I know I'm going to win this time," said Arguello, 
who at 5 foot 2 and 137 pounds fights in the welterweight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in San Antonio, Arguello's first teachers in the sweet science were 
her eight brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were always beating me up," she said. "I had to fight for everything, 
for food at the dinner table. But I learned a lot from them. It made me 
aggressive and strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother and aunt began a campaign to turn the young tomboy, the only girl 
in the family, into a young lady when she hit puberty, but that failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My aunt sent me an apron for my birthday when I was 12. I guess she thought I 
was going to cook or something," Arguello said. "I wore it to play baseball 
with my brothers for when I was sliding." 
</P>
<P>
 If she had stayed in Texas, Arguello said, the disapproval from family members 
and friends would have been too strong to take up such a sport as boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have had eight or nine kids and for sure would have never 
started boxing if I stayed there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arguello moved to California 12 years ago with her then-husband. Away from 
her family for the first time, she decided to take boxing lessons to learn how 
to defend herself. Afraid to let her husband or anyone else know what she was 
doing, Arguello would tell him she was working late -- and then go to the gym 
to train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he wouldn't like it, but I figured I wasn't hurting anybody so I'm 
going for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, she boxed -- mostly for fun and fitness. It wasn't until 1990 
that she first put on the gloves professionally in a Las Vegas bout, beating a 
woman from New Mexico, and even then, she didn't return to the ring for money 
for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But her pro career was derailed fairly abruptly after she met the man who 
ultimately shot her. The boyfriend, whom Arguello declined to name, wanted her 
to give up boxing -- mostly because he was jealous of the idea of her training 
around so many men, she said. She complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the night of the shooting in August, 1992. It left Arguello in the 
intensive-care unit at Whittier Presbyterian Hospital for five days and her 
boyfriend in prison for 12 years on an attempted-murder conviction, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of her release, Arguello had a new goal: to box again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sport has become popular with women at fitness clubs as an 
alternative to aerobics, Arguello trains in a male enclave at the La Habra 
Boxing Club, surrounded by men and boys of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they didn't take her seriously," said Dave Martinez, Arguello's 
trainer. "Then they saw the way she warms up, her advanced style, and now she's 
accepted as one of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguello's training regimen is the same as the other professional boxers whom 
Martinez trains. 
</P>
<P>
 She's up every morning by 6 a.m. to run the three miles to La Habra High 
School. When she gets to the school she goes through a series of jumping 
exercises and sprints, and then she runs the three miles home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, Arguello spends 90 minutes at the gym. Because there are so 
few female boxers, Arguello spars with men. And her trainer says she fights 
like them too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really a problem because she weaves and slips; she fights like a 
man," Martinez said. "When she puts on the headgear, you can't tell she's a 
lady." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Rivera, who trains at the gym and has sparred with Arguello, said 
sparring partners who underestimate Arguello do so at their own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised at how hard she punched," Rivera said. "She looks like 
a girl, but she fights like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny afternoon earlier this week, Arguello wrapped up her last day of 
training before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ring with Jose Lopez, a 17-year-old amateur, Arguello sparred for 20 
minutes. The quick jabs and combination punches the two traded appeared to be 
equal, and if Arguello has less upper-body strength than Lopez, it didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of her children, 13-year-old Pearl, and Dragon Anthony, 11, sat near the 
ring, watching their mom take a series of blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me watching her get hit," Pearl said. "I know she'll be 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 After sparring, Arguello spent about 20 minutes shadowboxing around the ring 
to cool down. When trainer Martinez hollered for her to stop, Dragon Anthony 
jumped up to give his mother a drink from a water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried boxing, but I don't like it," he said. "I like watching my mom, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Pearl and Dragon Anthony accompany their mother to the gym every 
afternoon. Her third child, 12-year-old April, usually stays home to finish 
cooking the meal that Arguello starts before she leaves for the gym at 4 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the night Arguello left for Las Vegas fight, the four sat down for 
a dinner of barbecued chicken, rice and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Just an hour after trading jabs at the gym, Arguello was all mother at home, 
grilling April about her homework, Pearl about boys and the phone, and Dragon 
Anthony about his next haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 "A buzz no, a step cut, yes," Arguello told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising three kids by herself is a far tougher challenge than stepping into a 
boxing ring, Arguello said. In the ring, at least, you have only one opponent 
at a time, and you get a break every two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising kids today takes a lot out of you," Arguello said. "They need so much 
of my attention. If it isn't one of them, it's another one. They're good kids, 
though. They always keep after me to stay in training, to eat right and to get 
enough sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having one trainer at the gym and three more at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she played more traditional women's sports such as softball and 
volleyball in high school, Arguello said boxing offers a different athletic 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a puzzle or a chess match," she said. "There's all these different 
pieces to put together. You have to be one step ahead of your opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps most critically, mastering a sport long dominated by men has 
boosted her self-confidence and redefined her self-image from that of a victim 
to that of a victor.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel better since I started training again," she said. "I feel stronger and 
happier. There is a whole world out there and I can do anything if I just reach 
for it."

KEY DISNEYLAND EXECUTIVE WILL RETIRE IN AUGUST; BUSINESS: RONALD K. DOMINGUEZ 
STARTED HIS CAREER AS A TICKET TAKER. HIS FAMILY HOME WAS WHERE PARK NOW 
STANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald K. Dominguez, who climbed the ranks over 39 years from Disneyland 
ticket taker on opening day to one of the park's most visible top executives, 
said Thursday that he plans to retire Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 By retiring, Dominguez will become the third leading executive to leave the 
forefront of the $3-billion Disneyland Resort project. Dominguez, executive 
vice president in Disney's West Coast attraction's division, has been the 
company's primary liaison in building support for the project in the Anaheim 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 He follows Disneyland President Jack Lindquist, who retired in November, and 
project director Kerry Hunnewell, whose departure was announced in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominguez, 58, said his leaving had nothing to do with the project, and 
that he plans to remain in Orange County and continue his community work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be available for any support I can give on that project," Dominguez 
said. "We have reached a point where we can bring this to a conclusion sometime 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 With City Council approval expected over the summer on the financial 
arrangement between the city and Disney, the company will be able to decide by 
the end of the year whether it wants to build the massive theme park called 
Westcot and 5,000 hotel rooms around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez's photo has appeared in newsletters sent to Anaheim residents about 
the project, and he often is seen at charitable and other events throughout 
Orange County. He has appeared in Spanish language television commercials for 
Disneyland, even though he concedes he is not fluent in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to travel and relax as a retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm in good health, I want to enjoy life," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is a descendant of the pioneer Yorba family, whose family had sold off its 
part of the old Spanish land grant over the years, leaving them with a 10-acre 
grove where Disneyland now stands. The Dominguez home was on the present site 
of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez went to work at Disneyland as a 19-year-old, collecting tickets on 
the problem-plagued opening day in July, 1955. He later dressed up as 
frontiersman Davy Crockett at the park when actor Fess Parker had the TV show 
of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Davy Crockett was at the peak of stardom," he said. "I could hardly walk 
through the park" without being mobbed by boys in coonskin caps. 
</P>
<P>
 He started moving through the management ranks at the park within a year. He 
became director of the operations in 1970 and vice president of the Disneyland 
division in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, a Villa Park resident, became an executive vice president 10 years 
later, and when Disney acquired the Queen Mary in Long Beach in 1988, he took 
charge of it as well. When Lindquist retired, his duties were split between 
Dominguez and another executive, Norman Doerges. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials said Dominguez's departure marks the loss of yet another 
veteran at a park that nurtured long-term relationships with the city over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney in the last year has lost several people that I have had very high 
regard for," Councilman Irv Pickler said. "They are going to be sorely missed."

VASQUEZ GOT 94 GUESTS INTO FUNERAL FOR NIXON; PROTOCOL: OTHER SUPERVISORS 
ATTENDED BUT DID NOT BRING GUESTS. VASQUEZ SAT WITH DIGNITARIES, UNLIKE 
COLLEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the hottest political event in town, the recent funeral of President 
Richard Nixon, access was no problem for at least one local official: 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor was able to score 94 admissions for his staff, close friends 
and political associates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vasquez's guest list for those admissions did not include the other four 
county supervisors, who managed to get invitations of their own if not for 
guests. Some of those supervisors already have publicly expressed their dismay 
with Vasquez's guest list preparations and their exclusion from a high-profile, 
post-funeral reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who was turned away at the reception door 
following the funeral, said Thursday that he didn't know about Vasquez's 
private guest list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish this thing would go away," Stanton said, declining further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez released his list of guests Thursday, but refused to discuss the 
matter further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supervisor Vasquez will not be offering any comment on questions regarding 
invitations to the memorial service or the reception that followed," stated a 
memo from the supervisor's office. "To do so, in his opinion, would be 
disrespectful to the memory of President Nixon and highly insensitive to the 
Nixon family." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the supervisor's funeral invitations and his special access to the 
reception has not set well with Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and William G. 
Steiner, who arrived at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace along with 
Stanton and board Chairman Thomas F. Riley only to be escorted to distant seats 
while they watched Vasquez take his place among the dignitaries. Following the 
ceremony, Vasquez was the only member of the board with security clearance high 
enough to attend the reception hosted by the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder and Steiner have said they ultimately were able to slip in. Meanwhile, 
Stanton was left at the door and Riley headed for home. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials declined to comment about the reception arrangements or 
Vasquez's invitation list, but it was believed that no others in Vasquez's 
party attended the exclusive reception. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written invitation to his guests, Vasquez said: "The family of 
President Nixon has asked me to cordially invite you to join them for memorial 
services. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the invitees were officials from the cities within Vasquez's 3rd 
District, current and former staffers in his county office, members of the 
clergy, Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne and Ben Davidian, director of the state's 
Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Diemer, Orange County Building Industry Assn. director and Vasquez 
colleague in the administration of former Gov. George Deukmejian, said Thursday 
that she received one of the invitations and gladly attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Diemer said Vasquez has enjoyed a close relationship with the Nixon family and 
had been a supporter in the development of the Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a generous gesture (by Vasquez) to give the tickets to true 
friends rather than to use it for political leverage," Diemer said. "I felt 
like, 'Gee, I really have a good friend in Gaddi.' He wasn't running around 
cashing in political chits." 
</P>
<P>
 Diemer said she did not attend the reception and was happy to sit in the 
bleachers for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just very happy to be there."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HUNDREDS OBSERVE NATIONAL PRAYER DAY 
</P>

<P>
 Hundreds of county residents took part Thursday in the National Day of Prayer, 
which was marked by a day-long prayer festival at the Santa Ana Civic Center 
and a variety of special events at churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The event brought together people from different denominations who spent the 
day listening to sermons and praying for the nation's health. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer Day began at 7 a.m. at Plaza of the Flags in Santa Ana with the first 
of nine hourlong services. Each hour's prayer dealt with a different issue and 
was presented by a different church. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Curtis of Calvary Chapel Christian Center of Brea led a prayer entitled 
"For Justice and Against Lawlessness in America." A prayer entitled "Mass Media 
and the Family" was presented by Community Christian Church Youth of Anaheim. 
Presentations were also made by Westminster's Vietnamese Baptist Church and the 
Filipino-American Church of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, nine churches were scheduled to host special ecumenical 
"Concerts of Prayer." The events were designed to draw parishioners from 
various, mostly Christian denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming together for a common cause," said Phyllis Page of Community 
United Methodist Church in Huntington Beach. "We are praying for our country." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Concerts of Prayer" incorporates music and singing into a service that 
calls upon participants to worship both individually and in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme is praying for our country and healing our land," said David 
Halliburton, assistant pastor at the Newport Vineyard Christian Fellowship in 
Costa Mesa. "We are praying for God to revive our country and awaken the 
church."SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAGIC KINGDOM WILL MAKE TICKETS APPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 low-income preschoolers whose planned trip to Disneyland 
appeared to be fizzling because they couldn't sell enough chocolates to pay for 
it got word Thursday that Disneyland will donate the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Thomas, spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said 
children from the Head Start program had raised $6,000 from candy sales, enough 
to pay for 490 parents and students. But that was 206 short of the group's 
number.  
</P>
<P>
 The children who would have been excluded were told Thursday that Disneyland 
would give them the extra 206 tickets for the May 20 trip.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana school district administers the federally funded Head Start 
program.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SUSPECT HELD IN RAPE ATTEMPT ON GIRL, 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man was arrested after he allegedly tried to lure a 7-year-old girl from her 
front yard and attempted to rape her, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was unharmed in the Tuesday night attack, told police she 
managed to free herself from Emilio Solares Paz, 22, shortly after he pulled 
her behind some bushes next to her house near the intersection of Myra Avenue 
and Rodeo Court. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Paz, who was riding a bicycle, stopped in front of her house about 9 
p.m. and tried to talk her into going behind the bushes. When she refused, Paz 
grabbed her, dragged her behind the bushes, and tried to pull her clothes off, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said that when Paz attempted to pull her clothes off, she escaped and 
ran home to tell her parents, who then notified police. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a short search, we found him about a quarter-mile from the incident 
hiding behind a trailer," Police Lt. Jim Weuve said. Weuve said the girl, who 
had been playing in her front yard before the incident, identified Paz as her 
attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping, child molestation and attempted 
rape, police said. He was being held at Orange County Jail on $50,000 bail.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SCHOOL-TRESPASS LAW GETS INITIAL APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ordinance prohibiting trespassing by non-students on school campuses was 
tentatively approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Richard M. Tefanksaid state law is inadequate because it allows 
authorities only to warn first-time trespassers and to prosecute if they return 
within 72 hours.The city ordinance allows officials to cite or arrest a 
first-time trespasser. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us more latitude to make an arrest for trespassing," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park High School Principal Tom Triggs said that the high school has not 
had a serious problem with trespassers but that the ordinance will "assist us 
in assuring that we just have our students on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggs said it will also be helpful during evenings and nights to prevent 
vandalism and graffiti at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Senior Officer Richard Pena, who is also the high school's resource 
officer, agreed that the new ordinance gives police and school administrators 
another tool "to better assure that everybody at school will be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is expected to receive final council approval on May 16 and 
would become effective 30 days later. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL BOARD GETS NEW UNION PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Orange Unified School District are expected to decide today 
whether to reopen discussions with the district's classified employees union, 
which has been on strike since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the California School Employees Assn., Chapter 67, delivered the 
second half of a union proposal to district officials Thursday afternoon in 
hope of persuading the district to revise a school board-imposed contract that 
cuts health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the district to 
unilaterally lay off or reduce the hours of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither district nor union officials would comment on the substance of the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 400 non-teaching employees, including bus drivers and child-care, 
food-service and custodial workers, are striking to protest the contract.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed there was a strike in the first place," said board 
member Bob Viviano, one of six trustees who voted for the controversial 
contract. "But I'm guardedly hopeful that there will be an early end to the 
strike so we can restore services to the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, district officials reported that about 30 students from El Modena 
and Villa Park high schools walked out of class in support of the strikers. 
District officials said the students will be regarded as truant and will be 
subject to detention. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike has caused logistics headaches for the district, which is providing 
bus service only to special education students. About 7,000 of the district's 
26,000 students normally rely on bus transportation. The job action has also 
shut down or caused staffing shortages at the district's 24 child-care 
facilities. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; POLICE HONOR FIVE FALLEN COLLEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filled with grief and pride, Mary Dallies wept as she watched a ceremony 
Thursday in honor of her late husband and four other Garden Grove police 
officers killed in line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pain involved because it's still an open wound and it still 
hurts," said the 29-year-old widow of Officer Howard E. Dallies Jr., who was 
slain March 9, 1993. "But I'm very proud and it feels good that people honor 
him, remember him, and miss him as much as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made no arrests in connection with the slaying of Howard Dallies, 
who was shot to death by a motorcyclist during a nighttime traffic stop. 
Dallies was remembered warmly by his colleagues at the seventh annual memorial 
service, held under gray skies in front of police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 officers, family members, friends and local residents attended 
the solemn, hourlong ceremony, which is held each May. Family members of four 
of the five officers killed were present.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is very good for us," said 73-year-old Rita Reed, whose son, Donald, was 
shot to death in 1980 while trying to serve an arrest warrant on a suspect in a 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me realize that they haven't forgotten our beautiful son," Reed 
said. "Family never forgets, but you never know about outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed died in the arms of Sgt. Paul McInerny, who began organizing the annual 
memorial services in 1988 as a tribute to his slain colleague. McInerny was the 
only one of four police officers sent to the bar that day who was not shot. Two 
reserve officers were wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fact that I wasn't shot combined with the fact that my brother 
and I went into the Army together and he was killed in Vietnam and I made it, 
played a big part in my wanting to do this memorial," McInerny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in attendance was 32-year-old Lori Rainford, whose husband, Michael, was 
killed by a drunk driver in 1980 as he attempted to issue a ticket to a 
motorist he had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her husband's death, Lori Rainford was six months pregnant with 
the couple's only child, Michael Rainford Jr., who is now 13 and plans to 
become a police officer, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still hard to come to this every year, but it's nice that they do 
something," said Rainford.  
</P>
<P>
 Also remembered at the ceremony were officers Andy R. Reese and Myron L. 
Trapp. Reese was killed in 1970 while directing traffic during the city's 
annual Strawberry Festival Parade and Trapp was shot to death in 1959 while 
responding to a report of an assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Stanley L. Knee spoke glowingly of the five fallen officers, then 
expressed his dismay over the deaths of nine Southland police officers, 
including Dallies, killed in line of duty since February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is unfortunate that we have a society where police officers are 
subject to the violence that occurs," Knee said. "It makes the job of 
protecting the community that much more difficult." GREG HERNANDEZ

 Enrique Ramirez gets around with the help of a couple of battered crutches 
that someone gave him after he was hit by a car while crossing a street a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With his badly injured right leg, Ramirez -- who has no job, insurance or 
government assistance -- limped into the basement of the First Presbyterian 
Church in Santa Ana on Thursday in search of some comfortable loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I'm sleeping in a garage. Tomorrow, I'll be on the streets. I don't 
have anything," Ramirez said, hunching over as he tried on a pair of worn-out 
gray tassled shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have these," he said, lifting his new loafers by the heels and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, 37, was one of about 300 people who received used shoes at the Orange 
County Podiatric Medical Assn.'s second annual shoe giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who belong to the association collected nearly 5,000 pairs of used 
footwear this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jeffrey R. DeSantis, an association board member, said many poor people 
suffer from serious foot injuries and diseases because they have cannot afford 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 members of the podiatric association collected boxes full of used 
shoes in their offices, as did the Walking Store in several malls throughout 
the county and the Sisters of St. Joseph in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members and volunteers from the Episcopal Service Alliance 
distributed the shoes at the church and will continue to give them away until 
they are gone, DeSantis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are wearing shoes, it's like preventive foot care," said DeSantis, 
a foot surgeon. "Instead of having them come in with lacerations on their feet, 
they won't have to see doctors."  
</P>
<P>
 Kevin W. Berry, who is homeless, picked out a pair of shiny black dress shoes. 
"OK, these are just what I needed," the 30-year-old man said. "I needed black 
shoes for my job I just got as a security guard."  
</P>
<P>
 Maria Andrade, 42, scooped up 10 pairs of shoes including slippers, boots, 
sandals, pumps and sneakers for herself, her husband and three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any money to buy new shoes," Andrade said. "This is so great 
because nobody's shoes last." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL MOVES TO SCREEN AID RECIPIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Councilman Jim Silva decried "giving tax dollars to illegals," the 
Huntington Beach City Council directed its staff to study possible guidelines 
for preventing tax-supported aid to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came Monday night, as the City Council discussed its annual 
block-grant allocation of federal money earmarked for community-improvement 
groups.This year, the federal government gave Huntington Beach $1.6 million in 
community development funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The council allocated that money to 18 charitable agencies Monday night, 
following the recommendations of a citizens committee. But during the council 
debate, Silva asked how the groups were screened to make sure they are not 
giving U.S. tax money to undocumented immigrants. He was told that there is no 
official questioning of charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva responded that the city should have a policy of funneling tax dollars 
only to legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a problem in Orange County," said Silva, who is a candidate for 
county supervisor. "I really have a problem with money going for illegal 
purposes." Silva said that tax dollars that are used to help undocumented 
immigrants tend to encourage more illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Victor Leipzig said, "I agree there is a problem." Councilman Dave 
Sullivan added, "It's time to deal with this problem of illegal aliens. It's 
sapping our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, who also is a candidate for county supervisor 
this year, said she agreed that "illegal immigration is a problem . . . I'm 
tired of people saying you're a racist if you try to address it." 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the council spoke against the proposal that the city staff develop 
and bring back guidelines on keeping tax aid geared to legal U.S. residents. 
The staff was told to produce the report within the next two months. BILL 
BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; POLICE ASSN. ALTERS EFFORTS AGAINST DALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anaheim Police Assn. has decided not to launch a recall effort against 
Mayor Tom Daly, backing away from a threat that it made last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The police organization has clashed with Daly over contract negotiations, and 
it has also criticized the mayor for concentrating too heavily on city issues 
such as lease negotiations with the Rams and not enough on public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But union representatives said this week that they will campaign against Daly 
in upcoming municipal elections instead of seeking his immediate ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Mayor Daly has his priorities, which we think are wrong," said 
Edward Thaete, vice president of the Anaheim Police Assn. "We have candidates 
that we are going to back that are more conducive to our interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly has defended his commitment to law enforcement, pointing out that the 
police budget has grown from $37 million to $51 million during his five years 
on the council. He could not be reached for comment this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Daly is up for reelection as mayor in November. Three council seats will be 
open as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thaete said that with the election only a few months away, union officials 
reconsidered their strategy in recent weeks and decided that, despite last 
month's threat, it was not worth their time and money to pursue a recall effort 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union, which represents about 335 officers, has about $6,000 in its 
political action account to spend on campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions flared between the police union and the mayor during recent salary 
and benefit negotiations. Police staged several demonstrations, including a 
"blue flu" strike, before an agreement was eventually reached. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; NO ONE AT OCC TESTS POSITIVE FOR ACTIVE TB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 None of the nearly 100 Orange Coast College students, staff and faculty 
members screened for tuberculosis tested positive for active cases of the 
disease, college officials said Thursday, a month after TB was diagnosed in a 
21-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 98 students screened by the Orange County Health Care agency, 25 had 
positive skin test results, but subsequent chest X-rays showed that the disease 
was not active, according to college spokesman Jim Carnett. 
</P>
<P>
 One student, who previously tested positive for TB, needs further follow-up 
screening to determine if the disease is active, Carnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the student who reported her private physician's 
diagnosis of active tuberculosis in April is at home taking medication and will 
not be permitted to return until she is no longer communicable. In all, 122 
students, staff and faculty were exposed to the student, who was enrolled in 
four classes. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are still trying to locate the remaining 22 people exposed to 
the student, said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's chief medical officer and 
director of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of tracking them all down," Stallworth said. "In a 
school setting -- especially a large campus like OCC -- it's difficult to get 
everyone on the first salvo." MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; RESIDENTS FIGHTING FAST-FOOD PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents who live on the Balboa Peninsula are plotting to torpedo 
what they call a "Big Mac Attack."  
</P>
<P>
 About 15 people rallied this week against a proposal to build a McDonald's 
restaurant on a vacant lot on 28th Street and Newport Boulevard, a short walk 
from residential areas. The protesters said they fear that the high-volume 
business will disrupt their beachfront neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the traffic, the trash and the loitering," said Juli Cook, 54. 
"They are probably the biggest corporation on Earth and they can go elsewhere. 
There are probably a million places they can go."  
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials are aware of those concerns and have spent thousands of 
dollars in recent weeks to completely redesign their plans in deference to 
residents' demands, said Sharon Collins, real estate representative for 
McDonald's Corp. in La Jolla. The restaurant has agreed to live without its 
trademark yellow arches and drive-through speakers, to reduce its signs from 25 
feet tall to 10 feet and to shorten store hours.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have even changed the color from gold and red to muted grays and blues," 
Collins said. "And you know how strongly McDonald's feels about its corporate 
logo." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said she is frustrated that despite those concessions, residents are 
making them feel unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be part of the community and address our neighbors' concerns," 
Collins said, adding that she tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting between 
residents and corporate officials to work out differences. "But they won't even 
talk to us on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said even a toned-down McDonald's is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can make modifications, modifications and more modifications," Cook 
said. "And maybe they can find something we can live with, but I don't think 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other protesters said that they would prefer to see a hardware store 
or a pharmacy because those stores would not aggravate the traffic problem on 
Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic worries everybody," said Gary DePerine, a resident. "It is 
already a nightmare down here." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on the project at its May 19 
meeting. BOB ELSTON

COUNTY HOUSING AGENCY GETS GRAND JURY CRITICISM; GOVERNMENT: PANEL'S REPORT 
CITES PROBLEMS RANGING FROM INEFFICIENCY TO RUDE EMPLOYEES. BUT IT LAUDS 
STAFF'S 'COMMITMENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury on Thursday criticized the county Housing and 
Redevelopment Department for a range of inadequacies, including an inefficient 
system of paying contractors and sloppily dressed and rude employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also dinged the department for a painfully slow internal mail service 
that recently took seven days to route correspondence several blocks, from 
grand jury members to the office of Housing Assistance Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The report characterized the problems as "disruptive weaknesses" within the 
department that could probably be cured by a reorganization of office 
management and simple displays of leadership by top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing and Redevelopment Director Dhongchai (Bob) Pusavat was unavailable for 
comment Thursday, but County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the 
findings were already being addressed by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reports of employees being sloppy and rude to the public were 
disturbing," Schneider said. "It is my understanding that some of the problems 
have already been solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents generally come in contact with the Housing and Redevelopment 
Department while applying for low-income housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is an agency of the county Environmental Management Agency and 
receives no county funds but is supported by federal and states grants that 
total about $60 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The department provides a number of housing services and distributes millions 
of dollars from the federal Community Development Block Grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report found that in some offices, "persons are attired in 
dirty or sloppy clothing. Some wear torn clothing. . . . Personnel working 
within the offices appear apathetic toward visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accounting procedures were confusing; mail delivery was slow; telephone 
services were poor; wearing apparel and personnel attitudes were not 
professional," the five-page report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, jurors commended the department staff of about 100 
workers for their "commitment to assigned tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most critical problems, according to the grand jury report, were 
the lengthy delays in providing payment to contractors for work done on housing 
and redevelopment projects. Frequently, payments have been held up by six weeks 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said some of the delays have been caused by "too many oversight 
approval" requirements before the payments can be made by the county 
auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those delays can be devastating to small contractors," the report stated. 
"How long a payment authorization sits in the auditor-controller's office 
cannot be determined." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the jury has called for the creation of new accounting procedures 
that allow for prompt payment to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Management Agency Director Michael M. Ruane said the report has 
the potential to "create a negative impression" of the department since many of 
the problems were already being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the jury's finding that too much oversight in the accounting system 
had delayed payment, Ruane said that past audits had been critical of the 
department for having "too few" controls over how money was managed within the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruane also said the mail service problem has already been resolved.

LOCAL RELIEF EFFORT TO AID RWANDANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 An international nonprofit organization is launching an Orange County-based 
relief effort through local churches to provide food, medicine, shelter and 
other assistance to Rwandan refugees forced to flee the tiny Central African 
country into neighboring Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoebus Foundation President Michael van Hoye met Thursday with 
representatives from Methodist churches to discuss the logistics of the effort. 
He said he is also in the process of sending out letters to Orange County 
churches seeking funding, food and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've ever seen anything like this," Van Hoye said, referring 
to the nearly 250,000 refugees who have fled ethnic warfare in Rwanda that may 
have claimed as many as 200,000 lives since April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we'd like to show what can be done when it is done in a positive and 
well-thought-out way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Stewart Kriess, pastor of First United Methodist Church in Orange and 
one of six church leaders who attended Thursday's meeting, said he hopes other 
local churches will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still in the preliminary stages but we're hoping to get things fleshed 
out over the next couple of weeks," Kriess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoebus Foundation is an international organization headquartered in 
Geneva. Its U.S. offices are located in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hoye, an engineer who spent more than 30 years in Africa, said the 
foundation plans to create "life tubes" -- capsules containing enough supplies 
to sustain eight people for a day. Each unit would include dried beans or rice, 
medicine, water and purification tablets. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the foundation plans to airlift the supplies to a refugee camp in 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoebus officials are looking for volunteers with medical, engineering and 
other vital skills who would be willing to accompany them to the refugee camp 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be sent to the Rwandan Refugee Relief fund, c/o Phoebus 
Foundation, Bank of America, 5640 E. Santa Ana Canyon Road, Anaheim, Calif.

ACCUSED MADAM GETS 3 YEARS' PROBATION; COURT: INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT THE 
WOMAN, WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO LIVING IN A HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION, WAS NOT THE 
RINGLEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old woman accused of being the madam of an Anaheim prostitution 
ring pleaded guilty Thursday to one misdemeanor count of living in a house of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Cera Rauda Sanchez, who originally faced 20 counts of felony pimping and 
pandering, was placed on three years' probation and released. Although 
prosecutors initially called her the leader of the ring, which recruited young 
women from Mexico and operated out of an Anaheim hotel, officials later said 
that further investigation indicated she was not running the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was extremely less culpable than she was thought to be," said Rauda's 
court-appointed attorney, Deputy Public Defender Ronald E. Klar. "She wasn't 
the ringleader." 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda was one of 11 women and teen-age girls arrested in a police sting 
operation at the Granada Inn, 2375 W. Lincoln Ave., on April 7. Authorities 
said the ring recruited poor, young women from Mexico to be prostitutes in 10 
rooms on the hotel's first floor. Police said that each room had a case of 
condoms and that the women and girls worked from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew S. Anderson, said the original 
charges against Rauda were dropped because evidence later gathered by 
authorities showed that someone else probably organized the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police are still investigating the ring, which they said began 
operating in December. The ring advertised "a good time at the hotel" in Asian- 
and Spanish-language newspapers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six other women arrested with Rauda also pleaded guilty to one 
count of living in a house of prostitution and was put on three years' 
probation. Anderson said that the four juveniles' cases were adjudicated on 
April 22 but that he could not release details on their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said that Rauda had cooperated with authorities since her arrest but 
that aiding police was not a condition of her release. 
</P>
<P>
 Klar said Rauda will return to Mexico, where, she said, she had worked as a 
maid for $5 a day and where she had left a 10-month-old son with her 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a jailhouse interview three weeks ago, Rauda said she was "just one of the 
working girls" in the ring. She said she believed that the ring's operator, 
whom she called Ellie, had set her up the night of the sting by leaving her in 
charge of showing the prostitutes' photographs to prospective clients and 
collecting the $70 or $80 fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda also described how she was recruited by a woman in her home state of 
Guerrero, Mexico. She was told she could make up to $6,000 in three months as a 
prostitute in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda said she was smuggled across the border near San Ysidro and began work 
at the hotel on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragi Patel, president of Sugandh Inc., which owns the 80-room hotel, said 
Thursday that neither he nor the hotel manager was aware of the prostitution 
activity.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; SPECIAL DISTRICTS SET TO MERGE NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the oldest special districts in the county will merge to create the 
Beach Cities Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors for each of the districts this week voted unanimously to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old Capistrano Beach County Water District and the 65-year-old 
Capistrano Beach Sanitary District will officially combine on Jan. 1, and 
temporarily keep a 10-member board, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within four years, the board will shrink to five. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors Addison DeBoi, representing the water district, and Bill Morison, of 
the sanitary district, praised the merger, which they have been pushing for 
several years. A recent study by a consulting firm estimated about $250,000 a 
year would be saved by combining the districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's vote came as a county commission is studying the reorganization of 
six of the water-related special districts that serve Dana Point.  
</P>
<P>
 "I ran a merger campaign when I was elected to this office," said DeBoi, a 
Southern California Edison engineer who is running for City Council. "I thought 
it was important . . . that we control the process, rather than have an outside 
agency do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Morison had been pushing the merger from the sanitary district side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been on the lead of this thing since I got on the board in December of 
1990," said Morison, a retired administrator for the Orange County district 
attorney's office. "I feel it's in the best interest of the city . . . 
basically because we'll be saving some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be determined is what will happen to Larry Montoya, a director of the 
sanitary district who works for the water district. He might have to resign his 
seat, said Ron Van Blarcom, the water district attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 "There could be a potential for an incompatible office," Van Blarcom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the merger is complete, it must still be approved by the county's Local 
Agency Formation Commission, which is considered only a formality since the 
vote was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Both districts serve residents and businesses in the Capistrano Beach section 
of Dana Point and a small part of northern San Clemente.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PROPOSED THEATER GETS COUNCIL'S OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A fiercely contested plan to build a theater in an abandoned bank building at 
the south edge of town was approved by the City Council after a three-hour 
public hearing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from the Three Arch Bay community, located next to the proposed 
theater site, pleaded with the council to keep the 250-seat Second Stage away 
from their homes. But most of the overflow crowd of about 150 favored the 
project, an offshoot of the Moulton Theatre on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Cox, chairwoman of the city's arts commission, told the council the 
theater would provide "an entrance to the arts" for South Laguna. "Replacing a 
vacant building with an arts-contributing enterprise is a very noble effort," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn, a Three Arch Bay resident, voted against the 
theater. Blackburn said she took part in the vote after concern about possible 
conflict of interest was relieved when realtors told her the playhouse would 
have no affect on the value of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission granted a conditional-use permit for the theater in 
March after attaching a list of conditions. That approval was appealed to the 
City Council by a Three Arch Bay property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents there said the project at 32356 South Coast Highway will increase 
noise and traffic in the neighborhood. They said their sleep will be disrupted 
by car doors slamming in the playhouse parking lot and that the additional 
traffic will make it even more hazardous for children to cross Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the day, it comes out to, 'Why here?' " Peter Laszlo asked. 
"The playhouse needs to be somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Stein, executive director of the Laguna Playhouse theater group, 
which operates out of the Moulton Theatre and is promoting this new project, 
said studies have shown that the Second Stage would have "minimal, if any, 
impact on the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Before endorsing the project, the council added conditions to the development 
as a way of softening the impact for area residents. For example, the theater 
parking lot must be dotted with canopy trees that Mayor Ann Christoph said will 
serve as a "psychological buffer" for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn had lobbied for additional constraints, including restricting the 
theater's operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Laguna Playhouse, officially called Laguna Community Players Inc., 
have dreamed for a decade of expanding their operations by creating a second 
theater where more experimental plays could be staged. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group bought the 7,300-square-foot Bank of America building in 
February after deciding last year that it was the ideal site. The building has 
been vacant for almost four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Stage is expected to open early next year.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; RECLAIMED SKILLS ARE THE CATCH OF THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Afraid of the dark, Pat Dalton gradually shut herself out from the world as 
eye disease slowly eroded her vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, 37, found herself making excuses not to pursue an active life -- 
avoiding the chance to swim in the ocean, take classes at a local college or 
even ride a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I isolated myself," said Dalton, who suffers from macular degeneration, an 
eye disease that can eventually cause blindness. "I was cutting more and more 
things from my life, saying, 'I can't do this, I can't do that.' I was afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no fear in her eyes on Tuesday during a fishing expedition with 
30 other blind or partially sighted people, part of a three-day series of 
events for the visually impaired held at the Dana Point Harbor this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught some seaweed, then snagged the bottom of the boat," said Dalton, who 
began resuming an active lifestyle just a few years ago with the help of the 
Braille Institute's Orange County center. "Then I caught a calico bass. This 
was the first time I've ever been fishing, and it was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the sixth year that the Braille Institute and the Dana Point Harbor 
Assn. have given blind students a chance to experience the wonders of the 
harbor -- despite their visual handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you can't experience the harbor with your eyes, you can still hear 
the birds, smell the sea breezes, hear the listing of the boats," said Brent 
Sewell, 43, who is nearly blind from diabetic retinopathy. "I have a good 
imagination and can draw a very good picture of how things are in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 students participated over three days ending Thursday. In addition to 
the fishing expedition, students were led on a walking tour of the harbor and 
made up the first group to ride the Orange County Marine Institute's new 
70-foot floating laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Local harbor merchants pooled their resources to make the tours possible. A 
sportfishing charter provided boats and employees free of charge, and a seafood 
restaurant in the harbor offered up food to the students all three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like me, they're all in love with the harbor, and we want to share it with 
everyone," said Dee Bower, a spokesperson for the Harbor Assn., who started the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Braille Institute, the tours highlight its mission to give students 
back some or all of the skills lost to eye disease or accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let our students know that their lives aren't over," said Wanda 
Graziani, director of the institute's Orange County center. "You can still go 
fishing, you can still take walks."  
</P>
<P>
 Dalton took the message to heart after joining the institute a few years ago. 
For the first time in decades, she braved the ocean and felt the waves slap 
against her body. Then she took up roller-skating and snow skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of the outside world for a blind person is enormous," Dalton said. 
"There are physical realities to accept, but it doesn't stop me from trying new 
things."FRANK MESSINA

ON THE NEXT 'GERALDO': SUSPECTS CAUGHT WHEN APPEARING ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A panelist at a taping of the "Geraldo" television show was arrested Thursday 
after a Westminster police department employee at the taping recognized him as 
a suspect in a pizza parlor robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The police employee, who was on his day off, remembered 23-year-old Glen Allen 
Bouscher from a photo lineup of robbery suspects he had put together just 
Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee called Westminster detectives investigating the robbery and said, 
"Your suspect is on 'Geraldo,' " according to Westminster Police Lt. Bill 
Lewis. "That's the guy I put in the line-up."  
</P>
<P>
 The detectives contacted Los Angeles police in the Wilshire Division who 
arrived at the Los Angeles studio before the show was over. They arrested 
Bouscher of El Centro after the taping. No one was injured in the February 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouscher is in the Orange County Jail.

HAYDEN ASSAILS UC SYSTEM POLICIES, ATTRACTS HECKLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Fee increases and budget cuts at California's public universities constitute 
"the breakdown of a covenant" between generations, gubernatorial candidate and 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) told an audience at UC Irvine Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He likened the University of California system to the Roman Empire, which he 
said was laced with privileged groups and "disintegrated of its own weight."  
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said the state is "underfunding the schools in order to pay for 
'Three Strikes You're Out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1991, vast multimillions of dollars have gone from education in 
California to prisons in California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden is campaigning for governor, primarily on a platform of reforming the 
political system, which he says serves moneyed interests more than the general 
public. He suggested limiting contributions to candidates to $250 and limiting 
expenditures as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see this is an affluent audience, so I want to ask you all for money," 
he said, asking for a maximum of $94. Hayden volunteers passed around a plastic 
bag with folded dollar bills and quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 people attended the talk by Hayden, which was spotted occasionally by 
catcalls from about 10 members of the conservative student group Young 
Americans for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, Ron Unz is gonna win!" the students yelled at the 
beginning of the meeting, referring to Republican gubernatorial candidate Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden responded, "Gee, you learned this in school?" 
</P>
<P>
 YAF members pelted Hayden with questions about his past as a radical student 
activist and questioned his stance against a bill to lock up three-time felons 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, 54, was a Vietnam War resister and prominent student protester, who by 
the 1980s and '90s joined the system by gaining a seat in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 When a YAF member asked about Hayden's statement in the 1970s upon return from 
a trip to North Vietnam that American prisoners of war were not tortured, 
Hayden conceded he had been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't tricked (into saying it); I said what I wanted to believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Shields, a member of a campus Democrats group, said many students are 
frustrated with the college system and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of anger out there, and tonight it was directed at him," 
Shields said, motioning to Hayden, "I guess because he's a different kind of 
candidate."

PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL TROOPS SHARE SENSE OF LIBERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers traded pistols and rifles for brushes and brooms on Thursday, 
scrubbing down jail cells emptied of their last Palestinian prisoners just 
hours before, as the sprawling command center that anchored 27 years of 
Israel's military occupation here became a powerful symbol of the liberation 
now at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a land that has become free on paper alone, the scene at the downtown 
fortress here also underscored one of the most powerful driving forces behind 
the historic agreement for Palestinian self-rule: It is a liberation as much 
for the occupiers as the occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, Israeli commanders were as anxious to hand over their 
headquarters to the Palestinians they jailed and ruled for decades as the 
Palestinians in the streets were to see them go. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian youths, just beyond the base's barbed wire, erupted in cheers and 
jeers when soldiers started dismantling the last of the towering roof antennas 
that Israeli commanders used to control this desperate, violent strip of land. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of them saw the young Israeli soldier inside take off a flak vest 
inscribed "No one gets out of here alive" as he helped load a flat-bed truck 
with dozens of desk-top fans. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the two sides met. A large group of Palestinian children formed 
near a rip in the wall. They touched hands with several soldiers in full combat 
gear, and this dialogue began: 
</P>
<P>
 "So when are you all leaving, anyway?" one of the young Palestinians shouted 
in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask the PLO," the soldier replied. The Palestine Liberation 
Organization negotiated the autonomy accord that was signed Wednesday but then 
requested several more weeks for the transition from an army of occupation to 
the Palestinian police force now mandated to run Gaza's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should get out of there now!" the young Palestinian persisted. "That base 
is ours now." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," the soldier replied with a pained yet patient smile. "For now, it still 
belongs to us." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a quieter corner of the 60-year-old colonial complex that served as the 
Gaza Strip military command headquarters for the Israelis -- as it did for the 
Egyptians and British before them -- a young veteran of Israel's occupation 
force paused for a moment to reflect. He then echoed the views of so many of 
his colleagues who have served on this front line in an impoverished, angry 
land that most Israelis now wish to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, my wife, my family, especially me -- we are the happiest of all 
the whole world about leaving this place," the young Israeli soldier said. 
"Really, we don't need them. And they don't need us." 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare, official briefing an hour later at the future border between Gaza 
and Israel -- where work began this week on a 38-mile electronic fence -- a 
senior Israeli military commander insisted that the army is in the business of 
missions, not emotions. But as he sat in the shade of an army tent at the Erez 
border crossing, even Col. Shuki Shichrur conceded that Israel's military 
mission in Gaza is one that any soldier would prefer to leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here and there, you will find soldiers who are happy or anxious to go out of 
here -- each for their own reasons," he said. "When you're acting as a military 
force within a civilian population, you sometimes find yourself doing what is 
really a police mission. And I believe every soldier would rather not do 
missions like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But just when this mission -- which has claimed scores of Israeli soldiers' 
lives in ambushes by armed Palestinian extremists through the years -- will 
come to an end was among the many questions Shichrur could not answer Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It depends, he said, upon the Palestinian leadership, which requested three to 
four more weeks to implement the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were up to Israel alone, Shichrur and other senior Israeli commanders 
said, the Israeli army would -- and could -- be out within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, the Israeli military has been packing all but the most essential 
equipment from its dozen or so major bases throughout Gaza. They have moved the 
equipment into Israel or onto new bases inside the Jewish settlements that will 
remain under Israeli military protection even after autonomy begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to give any facility (to the Palestinians) right now -- at 
that very moment they ask for it," he said. "It all depends now on the other 
side, and their ability to take it over." 
</P>
<P>
 The colonel insisted that Israeli troops are leaving military bases in the 
best condition possible. They're even leaving behind a $1-million computer at 
one such facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were few signs of such largess on Thursday at the command 
headquarters here, where soldiers were packing and moving out everything that 
could be moved -- everything, in fact, except the plumbing, the walls and the 
kitchen sinks. Even the Israeli military spokesman at the scene, when asked for 
examples of what the troops were leaving behind, replied, "We're leaving the 
showers, the sinks, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The decrepit, steel-barred cells, the interrogation rooms and the stark 
visitors' hall will remain behind in a prison facility so feared and hated by 
the Palestinians who will inherit it that they nicknamed it "The 
Slaughterhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevi Kahanov, an Israeli army reserve sergeant overseeing the base evacuation, 
said he witnessed and sympathized with the outpouring of emotion that greeted 
the last 180 Palestinian prisoners released from the facility within hours of 
the signing ceremony the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them, it is momentous," he said in the first-ever press tour of the 
command center's prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it as momentous for you and the other soldiers?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it really is," he replied. "It's a moment of hope and of peace for us, 
as well. Whether it will be that, only time will tell."

NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS MAY BOYCOTT CLAS TEST; EDUCATION: MOST BOARD MEMBERS FIND 
SOME OF THE READING AND WRITING SEGMENTS TO BE OBJECTIONABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a move that would defy state law and intensify a growing chorus of 
complaints about California's new standardized tests, the Newport-Mesa Unified 
school board may vote this morning to not test the district's eighth- and 
10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 During an emergency closed session, Newport-Mesa trustees will consider 
violating the state mandate to administer the California Learning Assessment 
System. The board is concerned that the CLAS test itself breaks a separate 
state law requiring parental permission to question children about moral 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the CLAS tests Wednesday and Thursday, most board members said 
they believe the eighth- and 10th-grade reading and writing segments are laced 
with objectionable material and probably will vote against giving the tests, 
which are scheduled to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test is ridiculous . . . I thought the stories were very inappropriate 
for the students," Trustee James de Boom said. "I don't particularly see them 
as anti-religious or anti-family, I just see them as anti-common decency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to hurt her to take the test," de Boom said of his daughter, a 
10th-grader at Newport Harbor High, "but it's not the kind of values I'd like 
to have promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees said they are upset with several questions on the tests that 
probe students' personal values, as well as with stories that are weighted with 
race and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 If they vote to withdraw from the upper-grade tests, Newport-Mesa will become 
the first district in Orange County, and the largest of five statewide to 
reject the tests. All could face legal action from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Thursday, Newport-Mesa Board Members Edward H. Decker, Sherry 
Loofbourrow, Martha Fluor, Forrest K. Werner and Roderick H. MacMillian, along 
with de Boom, said they found some of the eighth- and 10th-grade test material 
disturbing, though only de Boom said he definitely will vote against giving 
CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith A. Franco, the seventh trustee, could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 The six others all said they want to either suspend administration of the 
exams, remove the most controversial portions or cancel them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Werner and Loofbourrow cannot attend this morning's meeting, the board 
is likely to vote to delay the exams until after its regularly scheduled 
meeting Tuesday night, when all trustees are expected to be present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am angry and frustrated at being broadsided (by the state Department of 
Education)," said Loofbourrow, who also serves as president of the California 
School Boards Assn. "We had been so reassured that the questions in the test 
didn't go near the edge that I expected to read those tests and be completely 
comfortable . . . what I found was that there were (sections) that made me very 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Given for the first time last year, CLAS evaluates students' thought processes 
as well as their ability to derive correct answers, and measures achievement 
against tough statewide standards. At a cost of $26 million, more than 1 
million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders are scheduled to take the 
reading, writing, math, science and social studies exams in some 7,500 schools 
statewide this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After protests by the school boards association, state education officials 
decided last week that school board members would be allowed to read the exams, 
which until then had been kept secret. Newport-Mesa trustees signed promises of 
confidentiality before reading the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing her colleagues sentiment, Loofbourrow said Thursday that she believes 
the problems with the tests could easily be remedied and do not undermine CLAS 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange said plans are already 
in place to broaden the review of materials in the future and that test 
developers are open to feedback. Refusing to administer the test is going too 
far, Lange said, suggesting that concerned districts acquire parental 
permission rather than cancel the exams altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a little presumptuous for boards to make that decision. They're 
a legal body. They take an oath of office. They're supposed to uphold the law 
and the law says the test shall be given," she said, promising to fight the 
district in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do they account for the parents that want (the exams given). Even if they 
only have one parent in the district that wants their kid to have it, that 
parent has a right to have their kid take the exam. The law is the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Supt. Cloyde McKinley (Mac) Bernd said the district chose this 
course because it would be impractical to now seek permission from all parents 
since testing is set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will be difficult, Bernd said, because board members believe they 
would be breaking state law either way. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the privacy question is Education Code Section 60650, which says 
that parents must give their permission in writing before children take any 
test concerning their "beliefs or practices in sex, family life, morality and 
religion." In opposition is Section 60603: "The State Department of Education 
shall annually require that each district administer a statewide test to all 
pupils in grades 4, 5, 8 and 10." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District was the first in the state to 
vote against giving the exam, and was scheduled to reconsider that decision 
last night. Other districts that are not giving the exam are Monterey Peninsula 
Unified, Soledad-Agua Dulce Union elementary, and an 18-student district in 
Tehama County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed in the CLAS test," Newport-Mesa Board President Decker 
said. "I want to meet with my colleagues. It's important for all of us to hear 
each other's comments regarding what we read."

ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN CLEARS HOUSE BY SLIM MARGIN; CONGRESS: LAST-MINUTE 
DECISIONS BY LAWMAKERS PRODUCE DRAMATIC 216-214 OUTCOME. VOTE IS SEEN AS 
VICTORY FOR CLINTON AND MAJOR DEFEAT FOR THE NRA. 
</P>

<P>
 Gun-control forces won a come-from-behind victory Thursday as the House voted 
by a narrow margin to prohibit the manufacture, sale and possession of 
combat-style assault weapons, virtually ensuring that the ban will become law 
soon as part of broader anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, approved on a cliffhanger 216-214 vote, came as many lawmakers defied 
the politically potent National Rifle Assn. for the first time. They joined 
instead with the Clinton Administration, major law enforcement organizations 
and other gun-control advocates whose vigorous, coordinated lobby in recent 
days rescued the legislation from expected defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 As happened with several crucial bills in this session of Congress, the fate 
of the legislation was in doubt until the last moment, with the tally favoring 
one side, then another as the votes were counted. If even a single supporter 
had switched sides, the bill would have died on a tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome marked the second big defeat in Congress for the NRA, which last 
year failed by a much larger margin to block the Brady bill, the law that 
imposes a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases so police can make 
background checks to prevent ex-convicts and the mentally ill from purchasing 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, the gun lobby appears to have run into an angry public, 
with several polls over the last year showing that respondents overwhelming 
want a ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last year there has been a sea change in the crime debate," a jubilant 
President Clinton said after the vote. In 1991, the House defeated an earlier 
version of the ban by a 70-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thursday's voting took place, congressional advocates and opponents jammed 
the floor to watch the electronic tally and to persuade undecided members. With 
tension rising in the closing moments and opponents ahead, 214-213, Rep. Andrew 
Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.) switched his vote, putting the ban ahead by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.) and Doug Applegate (D-Ohio), who had not voted 
yet, were besieged by colleagues on both sides of the issue, pleading for 
support. Murphy voted "no" and Applegate voted "yes," while another 
foot-dragging member, Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) also voted for the bill to 
produce the final result, 216-214. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis of the voting showed that, in general, House members from urban and 
suburban areas tended to favor the bill while most representatives from rural, 
Western or Southern districts voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments of many lawmakers who voted for the ban indicated that they had 
exercised a "conscience vote" and many predicted that they would suffer 
politically as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he first thought the ban would pass when Rep. Bob Carr 
(D-Mich.), a longtime ally of the NRA, announced that he would vote for it as 
the roll call vote began. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other surprises as well. Retiring Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) quietly cast his vote for the bill, along with 37 other Republicans, 
177 Democrats and one independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard many arguments over the past several days, but in the end this was a 
personal decision based on nothing but my own conscience," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side were 137 Republicans and 77 Democrats, including Rep. Jack 
Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alluding to the intensity of the issue among Texas gun owners, Rep. Charles 
Wilson (D-Tex.) said that "if I voted for it, I wouldn't be physically safe 
when I go home this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The California delegation split mainly along party lines. All 30 Democrats 
voted for the ban, as did Republican Reps. Steve Horn of Long Beach and Michael 
Huffington of Santa Barbara. The other 20 California Republicans voted against 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who has a long history of opposing 
gun-control measures, presided during passage of the bill but did not cast a 
vote, saying that he wanted to let House members decide the controversial 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the ban have had an uphill fight in the House. Foley's opposition 
deprived them of the leadership organization to line up votes. They formed an 
ad hoc task force instead. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno working the phones from the outside, 
advocates worked one-on-one with their colleagues to persuade them to support 
the ban. A wave of telephone calls from hunters and other gun owners was 
mounted in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a hard-liner on criminal-justice matters, gave 
the proponents a boost when he voted for the bill in the Judiciary Committee, 
crediting Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) with persuading him of its merits. 
In turn, Hyde influenced Michel and other GOP fence-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Amo Houghton (R-N.Y.), who had been undecided, drew cheers from 
proponents of the ban when he announced his support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a member of the NRA," Houghton said. "It's going to hurt me politically 
-- no question -- but I think it's the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it has passed the House, the ban is certain to be added to the final 
version of the comprehensive crime bill that will be fashioned in the next two 
weeks by a Senate-House conference committee. The Senate previously had adopted 
a similar ban on a vote of 56 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Senate and House legislation also would put tens of thousands more 
police on the streets and allocate billions for prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill would bar the future manufacture, sale and possession of 19 
specific assault weapons, such as the Street Sweeper and a modified AK-47, as 
well as look-alike models and magazines carrying more than 10 rounds of 
ammunition. At the same time, however, the measure would allow the current 
owners of such guns to keep their weapons. It also specifically exempts 670 
guns used for hunting or target-shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors said the conference committee's product is expected to be ratified 
and sent to Clinton before Congress leaves for its Memorial Day recess at the 
end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The House debate on assault weapons repeated familiar arguments on both sides 
of the contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates said the ban was narrowly drawn and would not affect the right of 
hunters and gun enthusiasts to bear arms. Opponents said the legislation 
amounted to symbolism that would not affect crime rates because criminals would 
acquire guns illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric became heated during the five-hour floor debate that climaxed 
weeks of campaigning for and against the ban by Administration officials and 
NRA lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), a supporter of the ban, put it this way: 
"Members of Congress can stand with the gun lobby or stand with the police." 
</P>
<P>
 In rebuttal, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said: "The real issue is not 
repeating rifles but repeating offenders. . . . We have no business passing 
this sham, and that's exactly what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argued that "assault weapons" is a misleading label since military 
weapons used for assaults fire automatically with one pull of the trigger. In 
contrast, they said, the semi-automatic weapons that are covered by the House 
bill fire only a single bullet for every trigger pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the ban, however, said the weapons targeted by the ban are used 
only for killing, without any sporting or target-shooting purpose. Vote on 
Assault Weapons Ban 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how members of the California delegation voted Thursday on a measure 
to ban 19 types of assault-style weapons: 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats for -- Becerra, Beilenson, Berman, Brown, Condit, Dellums, Dixon, 
Dooley, Edwards, Eshoo, Farr, Fazio, Filner, Hamburg, Harman, Lantos, Lehman,

KING VIDEOTAPE SHOCKED HIM, GATES TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, testifying Thursday in Rodney 
G. King's lawsuit against him and other current and former officers, recalled 
his shock when he first saw the videotape of King's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized clearly this was an incident that could be misinterpreted by the 
public, that this would be a great media event and the department would be in 
crisis, and these officers would be part of that crisis," Gates said of the 
incident that toppled him from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, wearing a blue pin-striped suit, seemed to deflect efforts by King's 
attorney, Milton Grimes, to make him appear personally liable for the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You let excessive force get out of hand, didn't you?" Grimes asked at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not,' Gates said. "I would not tolerate excessive force by any 
officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the department during his tenure had "elements of racism," Gates said 
that although there were officers with racist leanings, he did not feel the 
department was racist as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be foolish to say there was not racism in the department," he said. 
"There's racism in our country, and in the Los Angeles Police Department. I 
would say it's minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' testimony in the civil trial was his first about the March 3, 1991, 
beating. The 10-member jury hearing the case will determine whether Gates and 
10 other current and former officers should pay King punitive damages. The same 
panel awarded King $3.8 million from the city during the first phase of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of defendants in the lawsuit was reduced by four when Grimes, 
without explanation, asked U.S. District Judge John G. Davies to remove a 
police captain and three bystander officers from any potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates took the stand Thursday after attorneys argued for more than a day over 
which parts of the Christopher Commission report on racism, sexism and use of 
excessive force in the Police Department should be admitted as evidence. The 
commission, appointed after King's beating, was headed by attorney Warren 
Christopher, now U.S. secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davies ruled that some parts of the report could be used, very little 
of its contents wound up in evidence before Gates concluded his testimony 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, Gates reiterated his view that the beating was an aberration, 
and softened his criticism of the officers involved by saying that they should 
not have been limited to using a baton to subdue King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opposed the use of the baton," he said. "In this country that is so 
technically advanced, it's amazing we couldn't provide to an officer anything 
other than a Stone Age weapon -- a club." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he held the title of police chief, Gates said he was accountable 
to the Police Commission, which had the final word on departmental policy. He 
also said he relied on commanders under him, some of whom were not doing their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Grimes, the former chief refused to say that bystander 
officers were guilty of misconduct for not reporting the beating. And he said 
it might have been politically correct to fire or chastise the officers 
involved in the beating, but he felt they deserved due process of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his sarcasm, Gates seemed subdued on the witness stand. He backed 
away from a series of inflammatory comments that critics had pointed to as 
examples of his racist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 When reminded that he had said blacks react differently to chokeholds than 
"normal people," Gates responded that he was not being racist. But he 
acknowledged, "That was probably an inelegant choice of words." And Gates said 
he probably was guilty of "a bit of hyperbole" when he said that casual drug 
users ought to be shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked Gates about the Jan. 3, 1979, police shooting of Eulia Love, a 
39-year-old African American woman who threw a knife at officers and was shot 
eight times. The shooting, which involved a dispute over an unpaid gas bill, 
was justified under departmental policy, Gates said, but he added that he felt 
it could have been handled better. 
</P>
<P>
 After testifying, Gates offered other comments about the most famous police 
beating victim in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he's not a model citizen," Gates said of King, who was evading 
police at the time of his arrest and has had several run-ins with the law. 
"He's demonstrated that over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates described King as an ex-convict and questioned the jury's decision to 
award him the damages from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a terrible tragedy for everyone, the city, the Police 
Department." he said, adding that he even has the utmost sympathy for the 
officers whose involvement in the beating eventually cost him is job. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had any sympathy for King, Gates snapped: "I don't think about 
Rodney King." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the police officers at the scene of the beating, Laurence M. Powell and 
Stacey C. Koon were convicted of violating King's civil rights in a federal 
trial last year and are serving 30-month prison terms. They and Timothy E. Wind 
and Theodore J. Briseno, who were acquitted in that trial, are among the 
defendants in King's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropped as defendants Thursday were Capt. John Mutz, supervisor of the Police 
Department's Foothill Division at the time of the beating, and Officers Timothy 
Blake, Susan Clemmer and Danny Shry.

BALLOT FRAUD CASTS SHADOW ON S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whoever stuffed the ballot boxes in the Zulu strongholds of northern Natal 
last week did a good job -- too good perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were sealed ballot boxes in which there were 3,000-odd votes, and all 
the ballots were neatly stacked up inside," explained John Wills, a lawyer and 
election observer in Empangeni. "It's physically impossible if people are 
voting one by one." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills also found "widespread indications" of voters casting ballots under the 
legal age of 18, and scores of full ballot boxes "coming from polling stations 
that didn't officially exist," he said in a telephone interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing evidence of other polling abuses, compounded by computer sabotage, 
communications snafus and mind-boggling confusion, has begun to tarnish the 
golden glow of South Africa's historic all-race election. Six days after the 
counting began, there are still no certified results to back African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela's claim of victory Monday as the nation's first 
black president. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, counting and reporting of returns -- which stopped for 32 hours 
Tuesday and Wednesday -- stalled again all day Thursday as outside auditors and 
computer experts swarmed into offices of the Independent Electoral Commission 
in hopes of sorting out what increasingly appears a case of poor planning, 
chaotic administration and inadequate safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Johann Kriegler, the electoral commission chairman, told reporters Wednesday 
that someone had "tampered" with the computer program used to tabulate the vote 
totals, causing what he called a "trivial difference" in tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said a fallback "manual system" -- handwritten accounting books used at 
each counting station -- would provide an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extraordinary measures have been taken to ensure the integrity of the results 
from the manual system are as trustworthy as human precautions can make them," 
he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't good enough. The manual system turned out to be riddled with 
mistakes from people filling out forms incorrectly, electoral commission 
spokeswoman Nikki Moore said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They discovered discrepancies that didn't make sense and couldn't be 
explained," she said. "So everything ground to a halt again." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said she is sure that the problem is not deliberate fraud, but 
"monumental incompetence" within her own organization. And she accused top 
electoral commission officials of "trying to cover up" the problems by refusing 
to provide accurate information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's so much rumor and speculation," she complained. "I stopped 
talking to the press because even I didn't believe the IEC." 
</P>
<P>
 No one here doubts that Mandela's ANC has won. The questions are by how much 
and where. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tallies, released late Thursday and based on 72% of the estimated 
23 million votes cast, pushed the ANC landslide to 64.7% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the ANC is within reach of its goal of winning two-thirds of the 
vote, enough for a veto-proof majority to rewrite the interim constitution 
without compromising with other parties in the new coalition government. Even 
Mandela has said he is uneasy about a potential "tyranny of the majority."  
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party had fallen to 20.6% 
of the vote. Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party had 
8.1%, while the Freedom Front, which demands a separate white homeland, was in 
fourth place with 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler said he was confident that the electoral commission will finish 
counting and certify the results by Monday night, the legal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Much rides on the timetable, because the new National Assembly must convene 
Monday to formally elect Mandela president. He is due to be inaugurated the 
next day in ceremonies in Pretoria before scores of international dignitaries 
and more than 100,000 South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the greatest worry is the power struggle in the volatile 
KwaZulu-Natal area, still under a state of emergency from heavy pre-election 
violence. The vote for the provincial legislature is now a matter of fierce 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC swept seven of the eight other provinces, losing only the Western Cape 
to the National Party. That was expected because the province holds a majority 
of mixed-race voters sympathetic to De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ANC apparently has lost the heavily populated KwaZulu-Natal area as 
well. In latest returns, Inkatha led the ANC, by 50.8% to 31.6%. That reverses 
pre-election polls. It is especially startling because Inkatha did not formally 
join the long campaign until a week before voting began. 
</P>
<P>
 The two rival parties have accused one another of extensive cheating. The 
electoral commission announced Wednesday that it found no evidence of "any 
coordinated so-called wide-scale fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 But an ANC spokeswoman in Johannesburg, Baleka Kgositsile, said Thursday that 
the congress had renewed its complaints to the electoral commission that voting 
in some areas was obviously rigged and should be discarded. Barring that, she 
said, the ANC was prepared to demand a new election in the KwaZulu-Natal area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't believe these figures," Kgositsile said. "They are obviously not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has complained that Inkatha set up 54 "pirate" polls without 
international observers or electoral commission authorization. In other areas, 
they said, tribal chiefs essentially hijacked the polling stations and forced 
out all independent observers and ANC workers. In all, the ANC said, about 
250,000 votes were potentially fraudulent.  
</P>
<P>
 But Inkatha's political director and spokesman, Ziba Jiyani, complained that 
the ANC was simply being "irresponsible and mean-spirited," because it was 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have evidence of massive fraud on the part of the ANC," he said. "But in 
the interest of peace, we said 'OK, let the counting continue.' Then they 
tampered with the computer. . . . They've been taking our votes away." 
</P>
<P>
 He said ballot boxes from several Inkatha strongholds in Natal and other 
provinces disappeared en route to counting stations, or were later found 
stuffed with straw. Many polling stations never got ballots, he said, or 
special stickers to add for the late-registering Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, he added, ballots already marked for the ANC were handed to 
voters waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in some cases, people's hands were not inked, so they could vote many 
times over," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Electoral commission officials said it was impossible to confirm many of the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials said the impasse in Natal will not delay the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 The real worry is longer term. The bitter rivalry between the ANC and Inkatha 
has claimed thousands of lives in the last decade and violence could explode 
again if either side is convinced that the election was stolen. Inter-party 
fighting, which subsided during the voting, has already resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Matuna, director of the independent Institute for Multi-Party Democracy in 
Durban, the provincial capital, warned of "large-scale problems" if current 
results are overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have democracy, but when it comes to really running Zululand, it would 
be difficult to have anybody but a Zulu from Inkatha," he said.

U.S. YOUTH IS CANED; DOCTOR SAYS HE'S OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two months of anguished, international debate about crime and effective 
punishment, American teen-ager Michael P. Fay was lashed with four strokes of a 
rattan cane in a prison here Thursday for the crime of spraying paint on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although widely expected since Fay's clemency appeal was turned down 
Wednesday, the execution of his sentence provoked outrage from his parents, and 
the State Department called in S. R. Nathan, the Singaporean ambassador to 
Washington, to express its displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a mistake," President Clinton told reporters in a brief 
appearance in the Rose Garden, "not only because of the nature of the 
punishment related to the crime but because of the questions that were raised 
about whether the young man was in fact guilty and involuntarily confessed." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief statement by Singapore's penal department said 10 inmates, including 
Fay, were caned at the Queenstown Remand Prison on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said Fay, an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, 
received four strokes of the four-foot cane. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was examined by a prison doctor after the caning and found to be in 
satisfactory condition," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fay case has drawn extraordinary interest worldwide, becoming the subject 
of countless talk shows and newspaper editorials fueled by rising concern in 
the West about crime and the best way to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Americans wrote to the Singaporean government urging it to go 
ahead with the punishment, and Fay unwittingly became a symbol of a culture 
clash between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinary attempt at compromise, the normally unyielding government 
announced that the Cabinet had ordered President Ong Teng Cheong to reduce 
Fay's original caning sentence from six strokes to four as a goodwill gesture 
to the United States. Fay is also serving a four-month jail sentence and has 
paid a $2,230 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the flogging was carried out in private, a description published by 
the government on Sunday said Fay would be strapped to a wooden trestle and his 
back covered with pads to prevent damage to the kidneys and spine. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department has contended that caning leaves permanent scars and is 
an "excessive penalty" for a youthful first offender in a case where the cars 
were not permanently damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 It also maintained that Fay received unusually harsh treatment because 
Singapore's vandalism laws were never used in a case involving private property 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have accomplished is to show how petty and narrow-minded a 
dictatorship they are," said George Fay, the youth's father, in the Dayton 
suburb of Kettering. "This reinforces my resolve to fight them and prevent 
others going through the same process." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's mother, Randy Chan, who lives in Singapore with her second husband, an 
executive at a courier company, said she was too overcome to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was carried out after a visit Thursday afternoon by Fay's 
Singapore lawyers, who told reporters at the prison that he had no idea when he 
would be caned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared nervous, agitated," said Dominick Nagulendran, a member of his 
defense team. "He said, 'Tell everybody I'll be home soon.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With time off for good behavior, Fay could be released from jail as early as 
June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the facts of the case are still shrouded in controversy. Fay admitted 
in court that he had spray-painted 18 cars. But his father released a document 
written five months earlier in which the youth claimed that he was innocent and 
confessed only after being slapped, punched and threatened by police during 
nine days of interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another youth, a Hong Kong national, has been sentenced to eight months in 
jail and 12 strokes of the cane for his part in the case. A Malaysian youth who 
was under age 16 at the time of the vandalism has been sent to a reform school 
for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Another American, Stephen Freehill, and another Malaysian still face trial in 
the case. But a report in the government-controlled Singapore press on Thursday 
suggested that the vandalism charges -- with their possibility of caning -- 
might be reviewed because of a lack of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's parents had argued that he should be spared caning because he suffers 
from attention deficit disorder, which his doctors said might lead him to 
despair and even contemplate suicide if he is caned.

MALIBU BLAZE SUSPECTS TAKEN OFF ACTIVE DUTY; ARSON: THE TWO FIREFIGHTERS HAVE 
NOT YET BEEN CHARGED. SHERIFF SAYS INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT 
MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Reeling from revelations that two Southern California firefighters are 
suspected of setting last year's deadly Malibu-Calabasas blaze, fire officials 
announced Thursday that both men have been taken off active duty but stressed 
that no charges have been leveled against either one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been charged with nothing," Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning 
said of the suspect who works for his department. "He has been found guilty of 
nothing. But he has a very big cloud hanging over his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning would not disclose the identities of the two suspects, but sources 
have told The Times that they are Steven R. Shelp, 29, a rookie firefighter 
with the Los Angeles City Fire Department, and Nicholas A. Durepo, 24, a 
part-time volunteer firefighter with the Manhattan Beach Fire Department. Both 
have denied any wrongdoing and have been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, Fire Marshal Steve Age said Durepo was placed on 
administrative leave pending completion of the investigation. Durepo had 
previously worked as a volunteer firefighter in Culver City but lost that post 
when his supervisors were told that he was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was here for about four shifts," Culver City Capt. Roy Hendricks said. 
"But basically when the department found out he was being investigated, they 
let him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide investigators, who are leading the arson probe because it 
resulted in three deaths, forwarded their completed case to the Los Angeles 
County district attorney five months ago. But the district attorney's office 
still has not decided whether to charge the two, and sources say the inquiry 
has pitted investigators against prosecutors in a tense standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At a packed morning news conference, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block 
acknowledged that the case is a complicated, circumstantial one and said he 
believes that prosecutors are carefully reviewing it. But Block also stressed 
that investigators believe they have the right men. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did not believe we had a case that was appropriate for requesting a 
criminal complaint, we would not have submitted this to the district attorney," 
Block said at the briefing at Sheriff's Department headquarters in Monterey 
Park. "It is our belief these are the persons responsible for the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 That belief is based upon a number of alleged inconsistencies in the version 
of events provided by Shelp and Durepo during interviews with sheriff's 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said, for example, that the two suspects said they had attached a garden 
hose to a nearby hydrant to douse the flames as they ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions was how do you hook a garden hose up to a fire hydrant?" 
Block said. "The answer that was given to our investigators was that this 
unidentified plumber happened to be passing by who had the appropriate 
connection and they borrowed it from the plumber, who went on his way. We were 
never able to locate the plumber." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities say that other accounts provided by Shelp and Durepo 
did not check out and that both men have failed polygraph examinations, which 
are generally not admissible in court because of their unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Marvin Braude, who chairs the council's Public Safety 
Committee, echoed Block's confidence in the case and urged the district 
attorney's office to take the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no reason to think that the sheriff does not have substantial 
evidence," Braude said. "I think those charges should be vigorously pursued. I 
cannot imagine any crime more reprehensible than this one. We must vigorously 
prosecute serious suspects."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Block declined to discuss the motive for the alleged crime, he said 
investigators do not believe the fire was maliciously set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot look into their minds," Block said. "But we do not believe the 
intent was one to cause great destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources have said investigators believe that Shelp and Durepo set the 
fire so that they could put it out and be hailed as heroes. Both men have long 
wanted to be firefighters, and investigators think their plan was intended to 
bolster their professional standing.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Thursday that the district attorney's probe is 
stalled partly by prosecutors' inability to determine exactly what each of the 
two men did while they were at the scene where the blaze broke out along Old 
Topanga Canyon Road. Durepo and Shelp have acknowledged that they were in the 
area when the fire began on the morning of Nov. 2.  
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators believe Shelp and Durepo are being untruthful, one 
source said detectives have been unable to pinpoint which of them allegedly 
started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 That evidence, the source said, would prove critical in obtaining a conviction 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any jury wants to know the role played by each individual," said the source, 
who requested anonymity. "That's where this investigation is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 The slowness of Los Angeles County prosecutors to conclude their investigation 
also has raised questions about whether federal authorities might intervene and 
review the case. Arson is punishable under both state and federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Cornelison, who heads the arson task force of the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said his group is assisting investigators on the 
Malibu fire, but added that "nothing at this point" suggests that federal 
prosecutors will be called in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that would draw this into the federal arena would be if the 
district attorney and the sheriff feel it belongs there," Cornelison said. 
Officials at the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo and Shelp have been instructed to appear before a Los Angeles County 
grand jury later this month, and the case against them will not be settled 
before then, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the suspects, Shelp, has told friends that he believes the 
fire was ignited by a downed power line. Investigators have concluded that it 
was arson. 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends, Shelp and Durepo met at Santa Monica College and share a 
passion for firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Stein, a division chief of the Santa Monica Fire Department and part-time 
fire technology instructor at Santa Monica College, taught Shelp and Durepo in 
several classes and remembered both as among his finest students. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students just come and give lip service, but these guys went after 
their jobs hard," Stein said. "I would have loved to have hired both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he believed either of the young men could have started the Nov. 
2 fire, Stein responded: "My gut feeling: Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
 Yumi Sakaida, a close friend of Shelp, said: "I know he didn't do anything 
like that. I know him very well. When he is ready to give his story, I'm sure 
he will." 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Okazaki, another friend of Shelp who also knows Durepo, said the two men 
should be treated as heroes for trying to stop the fire, not as suspects for 
allegedly igniting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, they were the first two heroes of the thousands of firefighters 
who were heroes in that blaze," Okazaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Fire Chief Manning said Block had told him on Jan. 5 
that his employee was one of two men suspected of setting the fire, which left 
three people dead and caused more than $375 million in damage. Shelp had 
entered the Fire Department academy just two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was literally shocked that a member of the fire service, any fire service, 
would be thought to be a suspect because the firefighters had performed so 
heroically during those firestorms," Manning said, stressing: "He is innocent 
until proven guilty. I have no thought of dismissing him." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief also said that when he told his employee of the transfer to 
administrative duties, he took it well: "I believe he said something like 
'That's fine. I'll be glad to do that until we get it all straightened out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles officials grappled with the news that a city firefighter might 
be implicated in the devastating blaze, some questioned how Shelp could have 
been placed on duty at a time when he was a suspect. One City Hall official 
said several council members were anxious to discuss the matter with Manning, 
but that same official said Manning and the department were generally held in 
high regard. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Manning said his office had not taken any action against Shelp 
when he first learned of the investigation because there had been no resolution 
of the case. In addition, Shelp had already been hired and begun attending the 
academy by the time Manning was informed that he was under investigation by the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to investigate, we would have to do our own arson investigation of a 
fire outside the city," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, meanwhile, urged residents not to rush to judgment in 
the case and to avoid blaming firefighters generally for the alleged actions of 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot let their work and bravery be overlooked by the possible 
involvement of people who were volunteer firefighters," said Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, a member of the council's Public Safety Committee. "The firefighters I 
know and have met are hard-working and committed individuals who care about our 
public safety and do not deserve to be painted with a broad brush."

COLUMN ONE; DOING TIME IN A JAIL FOR OLD-TIMERS; 'OLD MAN'S DORM' INMATES ENJOY 
CAMARADERIE, BINGO AND FREE NURSING CARE. COST OF THEIR CONVALESCENT HOME 
BEHIND BARS RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAVE OF ELDERLY PRISONERS EXPECTED UNDER 
'THREE STRIKES.'

<P>
 Every time S. M. Cohen takes a pill, visits a doctor, has a blood test, 
receives a shot of insulin or undergoes surgery, Californians pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, 67, an inmate at the California Institution for Men, has cancer and 
diabetes and takes 11 pills a day. He has blood tests twice a month and sees 
three specialists. His medical bills are more than $125,000 a year. His recent 
heart bypass cost $76,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who is doing nine years for grand theft, is housed in a unit inmates 
call "Old Man's Dorm," a cavernous hall filled with grizzled prisoners who mill 
about using canes, walkers, wheelchairs and crutches. The highlight of their 
week is the Wednesday night bingo game. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the state's population of geriatric prisoners will increase dramatically 
because of the new "three strikes" law, which is aimed at putting three-time 
felons behind bars for life. And there will be many more facilities such as Old 
Man's Dorm -- the only unit in the state designed for low-security, geriatric 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians will have to decide how long elderly offenders should be kept 
behind bars. This decision will highlight a philosophical divide between those 
who believe society's need for justice is paramount, and others who argue that 
many elderly prisoners should be given early release because they no longer are 
dangerous and it is expensive to imprison them. 
</P>
<P>
 The predicted wave of elderly "lifers" will "create an economic disaster for 
the state," said Dr. Armand Start, a national expert on prison medical care. 
Funding eventually will have to be siphoned off from other state programs such 
as education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 California will not be able to build prisons fast enough to keep pace with the 
influx of elderly prisoners, said Start, a professor at the University of 
Wisconsin Medical School. Dangerous first-time offenders eventually will have 
to be paroled early, he said, to make room for older, less violent prisoners 
serving mandatory life terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 2% of the state's prisoners are over 55. And Old Man's Dorm -- 
officially known as Elm Hall -- has long been viewed as a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Elm Hall, which is essentially a convalescent hospital behind bars, 
offers a glimpse into the future of the state prison system. There are some 
younger, disabled inmates, but most of the 150 prisoners are elderly men with 
bifocals who never miss the weekly meetings of their senior citizens' group. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no cellblocks because the prisoners need wheelchair and ambulance 
access. And despite chronic prison overcrowding, there are no bunk beds because 
most of the old-timers do not have the strength to climb to the top bed. Many 
are recovering from strokes, heart attacks or crippling bouts of arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 Elm Hall is a large cinder-block dormitory with rows of cots and lockers. A 
nurse is on duty until 10 p.m., to make sure no one slips in the shower or 
cannot get out of bed. Dorm living is better than the hard time of a cellblock, 
but most prisoners share one great fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is terrified of dying here," said Cohen, who has a pencil-thin 
mustache and neatly trimmed gray hair. "That's what bothers us the most. We've 
seen people die in here, and it's the loneliest death in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elm Hall was designed in the early 1960s -- with wheelchair ramps, bathtubs 
and a heating system -- to house the state's small population of elderly 
prisoners. At that time the old-timers mingled easily with the mainline 
population. But during the 1980s, when young gangbangers began pouring into the 
prison system, the clash of generations created friction. 
</P>
<P>
 Many old-timers say they have only contempt for the young prisoners. 
Old-timers call themselves convicts, and refer contemptuously to the young 
prisoners as inmates. The inmates, the old-timers complain, "don't know how to 
do time." They snitch on each other; they steal out of lockers; they cut in 
front of people in chow lines. One elderly prisoner said that if, in his day, 
you cut in front of someone in line you would get a shiv in the belly. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ross, 81, a bald, diminutive man with a faint resemblance to George 
Burns, is the dean of Old Man's Dorm. Ross, who is serving a two-year sentence 
for check kiting, looks out of place amid the young, tattooed prisoners pumping 
up at the weight pile. 
</P>
<P>
 One night last month, Ross was walking from the canteen, after buying cream, 
coffee and sugar. Two young inmates ran up behind him and tried to rip off his 
bag of supplies. But a few elderly prisoners, who were tailing him, began 
shouting for a guard. Ross held tight to the bag and the thieves were scared 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We old-timers stick together," said Ross, squinting through thick glasses. 
"When we head out to the yard we try to go in groups. If somebody has to go out 
alone, the others try to keep an eye out for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, in the days when it was not so smoggy and they could see Mt. Baldy, 
prisoners founded the Mountain View Senior Citizens Group. Members still 
collect aluminum cans and sometimes sell candy and doughnuts to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 If an old-timer is about to be released, but does not have enough money to get 
home or needs a new suit of clothes, group members will chip in with the cash. 
The family of one man who died in prison wanted to give him a proper burial, 
but they did not have the money. The group raised $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One Elm Hall inmate had such a long criminal history, officials say, he 
started out robbing stagecoaches. When he was released, he was 91 and still 
chain-smoking unfiltered Lucky Strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another renowned resident was Ronnie Fairbanks, whom officials listed as 90 
when he last entered prison. But they could not be sure. Fairbanks had given 
authorities 21 birth dates since he was first arrested for larceny in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had used 88 aliases during his criminal career, which included more 
than 40 arrests. Fairbanks often boasted that he never committed a violent 
crime. He was last arrested for stealing a suitcase at Los Angeles 
International Airport and was released from Chino in 1988. He has not been 
back. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may have been 90, but he was in great shape," said Diana Smith, program 
administrator for Elm Hall. "He jogged every day and kept himself in top 
physical condition. He was a very charming guy, very genteel, always polite." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not every prisoner is eligible for Elm Hall, Smith said. When Charles Manson 
becomes a senior citizen, she said, he will not be welcome. Prison officials 
will not admit notorious criminals, child molesters or anyone with a violent 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Building more facilities such as Elm Hall is not the best way to deal with 
aging inmates, many prison experts say. When criminals hit middle age they 
begin burning out, said Start, who heads the National Center for Correctional 
Health Care Studies. Criminals in their 40s and 50s -- like the rest of the 
population -- are affected by aging. They become less impetuous, less hostile, 
less prone to violent behavior, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal Bureau of Justice Statistics report found age to be the single most 
reliable indicator in predicting recidivism. About 22% of prisoners ages 18 to 
24 return to prison within a year of their release; for prisoners over 55 the 
rate is less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 new prisons that are planned in California will not keep pace with the 
deluge of new inmates generated by the "three strikes" law, said Jonathan 
Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. In other states with 
"three strikes" measures, Turley said, officials had to release violent 
first-time offenders early because of overcrowding. They needed to make room 
for the growing population of elderly prisoners with life sentences. Turley 
predicted that California prison administrators eventually will have to do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, which has a "three strikes" measure and a number of other mandatory 
sentencing provisions, inmates last year served an average of only 11% of their 
sentences. (California inmates serve about 50% of their sentences.) The Texas 
law recently has been changed, requiring inmates to serve a higher proportion 
of their terms. But young violent offenders will still have to be paroled early 
to make room for older prisoners serving mandatory life sentences, Texas prison 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system makes no sense," said Turley, who heads a Washington project that 
evaluates the parole status of elderly prisoners. "We'll be keeping in prison 
the inmates who are at a point in their life when they are least likely to 
commit another crime. And we'll be releasing those young offenders who are most 
dangerous. This system works against everything we've learned about 
recidivism." 
</P>
<P>
 Geriatric prisoners cost institutions about $60,000 a year -- three times more 
than younger inmates, according to recent studies. On average, inmates over 55 
suffer three chronic illnesses while incarcerated. Some do most of their time 
in prison infirmaries. Others run up huge bills at private hospitals because 
most prisons contract with outside facilities for major medical work. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Beatty, a spokesman for the National Victim Center, said victims' 
rights advocates are more concerned with the "human cost" of releasing repeat 
offenders than "the financial cost" of keeping them in prison. Even if the odds 
are slim that a geriatric prisoner, if released, would commit another crime, 
Beatty said, "most victims aren't willing to take that chance. They feel more 
comfortable with these kind of people locked up forever." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the Department of Corrections can predict how many elderly prisoners 
to expect in coming years. Prison officials say they have been preoccupied with 
other problems such as AIDS, tuberculosis and gangs. They plan to research the 
issue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 California's "three strikes" measure calls for a minimum of 25 years to life 
for any felon who has committed two prior violent or serious felonies -- crimes 
that range from murder to home burglary. In today's political climate, 25 years 
to life often is the equivalent of life without possibility of parole, said 
Heather MacKay, a staff attorney for the Prison Law Office, a Bay Area prison 
reform group. The parole board, she said, "because of the prevailing political 
climate, often is reluctant to grant any paroles at all." 
</P>
<P>
 While California gears up for a deluge of geriatric prisoners, many states are 
moving in the opposite direction. They are involved in "compassionate release" 
programs for elderly prisoners who do not appear to be a threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Law professor Turley heads the Project for Older Prisoners, which lobbies 
parole boards in dozens of states on the issue of early release for elderly 
prisoners. Of all the prisoners evaluated, the project has only recommended 10% 
-- about 60 -- for early release. Not a single one the project has helped free 
has returned to prison, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the project five years ago when he represented Quenton Brown, a 
Louisiana man with an IQ of 51. Brown had robbed a bread store of $117 and a 
cherry pie. When police arrested him he was crouched beneath a house across the 
street, eating a piece of pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Turley heard about Brown's case after he had served 18 years of a 30-year 
sentence. Brown, then 67, was suffering from emphysema and bleeding ulcers and 
was released after Turley argued his case before the parole board. It did not 
make sense to continue to incarcerate inmates like Brown, Turley argued, when 
young, violent prisoners were being released under a court order to ease the 
overcrowding in Louisiana prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with law student volunteers, Turley evaluates the criminal histories 
of prisoners and rejects those who were convicted of sex crimes or violent 
offenses. Many elderly prisoners, he said, belong behind bars for the rest of 
their lives. But how much of a threat is an inmate who is recovering from a 
stroke, has only a few months to live and wants to spend his final days with 
his family? 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of Medicare dollars are spent in the last two weeks of a patient's 
life. Because some prisoners' families have insurance, Turley said, it makes 
more sense to release some of them than to stick taxpayers with exorbitant 
medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly prisoner who costs the state $60,000 a year could be housed in a 
private nursing home for much less. Yet California will be building 20 prisons, 
at a cost of about $100,000 per cell, to accommodate a new wave of prisoners, 
many of them senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Turley said he does not recommend "wholesale release of older prisoners." What 
he does advocate is legislation that will allow states, through special parole 
laws, to give consideration to low-risk, high-cost elderly inmates. But few 
California politicians are willing to support any measures calling for early 
release of prisoners -- regardless of their age. 
</P>

 "Politicians are now running the prison systems by sound bite," Turley said. 
"The truth of the matter is, by the time we interview inmates who are in their 
60s, 70s and 80s, most of them are statistically less dangerous than the law 
students I drive to the prison with."

GHASTLY ACCIDENT TESTS SKILL OF DOCTORS, VICTIM'S PLUCK; MEDICINE: PATSY 
BOGLE'S HAIR SNAGGED IN AN INDUSTRIAL BLENDER. SURGEONS TOOK FIVE HOURS TO 
REATTACH HER SCALP. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a horrifying accident. Remarkably, Patsy Bogle remembers it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old mother of three was on the job at a Monrovia packaging 
company, cleaning sticky red silk screen residue off the blades of a giant 
industrial blender when her long brown ponytail snagged in the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 She felt her head smash into the metal and in an instant, her scalp was gone 
-- torn off in a single piece, from her eyelids to the nape of her neck, 
including two-thirds of her right ear. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Tuesday morning. By the evening, in a delicate and extremely rare 
surgery, a team of doctors at USC University Hospital had sewed the woman back 
together. They say her prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing suture thinner than human hair and working with a microscope, the 
doctors stitched together arteries and veins to bring back circulation to the 
woman's scalp, keeping the tissue alive. Finding them was not easy; nine of the 
12 major vessels that bring blood to the scalp were destroyed in the accident.  
</P>
<P>
 The five-hour procedure was testimony not only to the wonders of modern 
microvascular surgery, but also to the remarkable calm of a woman whom friends 
describe as a "down-to-earth Kansas farm girl." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Bogle kept her wits throughout her ordeal, up to the moment 
she went into surgery. When her husband arrived on the scene, as paramedics 
were preparing to take her to the hospital, she looked up at him and said 
simply: "I'm all right, Timmy. I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, she told one of her surgeons about the accident. It was the first 
time she could recount what happened Tuesday morning to anyone other than her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember hitting my head," she said from her bed in the hospital's 
neurosurgical intensive care unit. "I yelled at my boss, 'Help me! Help me!' I 
think I knew it was pretty bad. . . . I was afraid I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 For doctors on the highly specialized microvascular surgical team, this kind 
of surgery is why they have spent entire careers in training. Over the last 12 
years, a review of the medical literature shows, only 18 scalp replantations 
have been performed worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bogle, the meaning was much simpler: a chance to look the same as she 
always has. 
</P>
<P>
 Even had the surgery failed, she would have survived. But she would have 
required extensive grafting operations, where doctors most likely would have 
taken muscle from her back to cover her exposed skull. She would have been 
permanently disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lose a finger or a thumb, there are other options," said Dr. John 
Gross, one of two surgeons who performed the operation. "You have other fingers 
that work, or we can take a toe to make a thumb. For her injury, it is so 
catastrophic, it would be impossible to reconstruct her scalp to make eyebrows, 
an ear, or for her to have any more hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross' partner, Dr. Bala Chandrasekhar, predicted that Bogle would "have a 
very nice outcome. I think we made a big difference in her quality of life, a 
big, big difference, and that cannot be done by any other technique." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Bogle never thought of her job at Ross Technical Associates as a career, 
and she wasn't planning to stay there. The job didn't pay enough, and she 
didn't like being, as she says, "just a laborer."  
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband had moved to Kansas, where they had gone hoping the 
environment would be better for her three children, but moved back to the Los 
Angeles area two months ago. Their two oldest children, 12 and 14, are 
finishing out the school year in Kansas, living with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Bogle had given notice to Ross Technical that this week would be her 
last. Next week, she was going to Kansas to pick up the kids and bring them 
back home to Arcadia. Then she would start a job as manager of a pizza parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for me to talk about it," says Larry Boehm, Bogle's 
supervisor at the packaging plant. Just after the accident, he was the one who 
comforted her. Instinctively, he sat her down and rested his hands on her 
shoulders so that she would not fall. He looked closely at her scalp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most incredible, bizarre thing I have ever seen in my life," he 
said. "First she had hair and plenty of it. And then she had no hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Bogle, the scalp was in one piece. Paramedics removed it from 
the blendingmachine, put it in a plastic bag, kept it on ice -- a move that was 
crucial to keeping the tissue alive. Then they took Bogle to Huntington 
Memorial Hospital, but doctors there felt they were not expert enough to treat 
the extraordinary injury. 
</P>
<P>
 They sent her to USC University Hospital, a private facility affiliated with 
the university's School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as they saw Bogle, doctors there knew that time was crucial. In the 
cumbersome language of medicine, she had suffered a "scalp avulsion." Scalp 
tissue will survive for 12 to 18 hours after being removed from the skull; 
Bogle's operation began about five hours after the accident occurred and lasted 
into the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 First, surgeons attached the lone remaining artery on the left side of Bogle's 
head, making microscopic stitches to permit blood to flow once again to her 
scalp. When they removed their surgical clamps, her right ear began bleeding. 
This was a good sign, Gross said. "We knew we had blood getting in." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came two veins, one on the left and another on the right. Once all three 
vessels were reattached, the surgeons had one final task -- to sew the scalp 
back on her head. They sutured muscle, cartilage and skin, including the 
woman's ear. Her hearing was not damaged in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate operation cost an estimated $20,000. Although Bogle's family has 
no health insurance, they have barely given a thought as to how to pay the 
bills. They hope the state's workers' compensation system will pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Bogle has not looked in a mirror yet; she says she is not ready to see 
herself, and for now, her family believes that is wise. 
</P>
<P>
 What she would see bears little resemblance to Patsy Bogle of a few days ago: 
a pretty, round-faced woman with clear skin and thick reddish-brown hair. Her 
eyes are swollen almost shut now, and stitches travel across her eyelids, 
underneath her right ear and around to the nape of her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The right side of her head is badly bruised and her ear bleeds profusely. All 
this is to be expected. In fact, doctors say the bleeding is crucial in order 
to drain Bogle's wound. To assist in the process, they applied leeches to her 
injured ear. The leeches -- flown in from New York -- secrete a chemical to 
keep blood from clotting. One doctor described them as having "magical 
properties." 
</P>
<P>
 Although major obstacles have been overcome, Bogle still faces a few more 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 She is likely to need minor plastic surgeries over the next few weeks, 
including an operation on her right eyelid, where skin is missing. And there is 
still the chance that the newly reattached blood vessels could close up, a 
threat that diminishes each day.  
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, her swelling was starting to go down, and she ate her first 
breakfast -- lime Jell-O and chicken broth. She is doing so well, doctors say 
she may go home next week. And in what her family sees as the most promising 
sign of all, her hair is starting to grow back. Reattaching the Scalp 
</P>
<P>
 With microvascular surgery, a team of surgeons at County-USC Medical Center 
successfully reattach Patsy Bogle's severed scalp. The unusual procedure took 
more than five hours to complete. Here is what they had to do: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Emergency personnel places Bogle's scalp on ice, giving the surgical team 
12 to 18 hours to execute the delicate surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 2. In surgery, the doctors locate reattachable arteries and veins. They find 
three; the left superficial temporal artery and vein and the right supraorbital 
vein. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The artery and veins were reattached. This is the most delicate part of the 
procedure. The entire procedure is done under a microscope because arteries and 
veins are about a millimeter in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The scalp is then sewn back to the patient's head.

FUROR CONTINUES TO BUILD OVER STATE'S CLAS EXAMS; SCHOOLS: CRITICS INSIST TESTS 
INVADE PRIVACY AND CONVEY INAPPROPRIATE IDEAS. BUT SUPPORT REMAINS GENERALLY 
STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago California's pioneering new system of student testing was 
widely hailed as a key step forward in education reform. Its critics were 
dismissed as vociferous but few, mostly strongly religious parents who objected 
that the exams espoused offensive values. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the California Learning Assessment System exams, currently being 
given to more than 1 million public school students, continue to enjoy strong 
support among educators and legislators, the voices of the critics have risen 
in volume and fed a growing furor across the state.  
</P>
<P>
 Bipartisan support in the Legislature for the exams has shown signs of eroding 
in the face of an organized campaign by conservative and religious 
organizations. At least four school districts have decided not to administer 
the tests, and several others suspended testing until board members could 
review the exams' contents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the dispute are complaints by some parents and activists that 
materials used in the exams -- reading selections, questions that probe 
students' reactions and essays about students' lives -- invade privacy and 
expose youngsters to inappropriate ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials and supporters such as the PTA insist that the tests 
neither violate privacy of families nor promote controversial ideas -- and 
instead are the best tools ever used in California to measure how well students 
learn and to improve the quality of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much more academic than anything we had before, I think it's 
really good and I'm glad my son is taking it," said Suzie Swartz, whose son 
attends fourth grade at Del Cerro Elementary in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's insistence that actual tests remain confidential -- at least while 
they are being given in public schools statewide -- has fueled the controversy. 
Some parents say they are suspicious that the state is keeping the tests under 
wraps -- except for samples of previous exams -- to avoid scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the secrecy, my trust has really been shaken," said Mission 
Viejo parent Lana Simning, who asked to have her eighth-grade son exempted from 
the testing after disliking what she read in the sample questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grade sample asks students to read about Albert Einstein, then 
discuss and write about what they read. Among the assignments based on the 
passage are to "write about a person you listen to and respect" and to "write 
about a friend." State officials say these are proven methods to help determine 
how well a youngster has understood the reading and can connect it with 
real-life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing scheduled today in Los Angeles Superior Court is expected to help 
resolve the privacy issue. A suit brought by a conservative legal organization 
on behalf of parents seeks to require that Los Angeles schools get parents' 
written permission before administering the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests, authorized by the Legislature in 1991 as part of a 
comprehensive effort to improve public education, are a dramatic departure from 
traditional testing. Students are asked to read stories, poems or essays and 
write about them as well as respond in writing to real-life math problems. They 
are graded against high statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach is heralded by education reformers and business leaders, who say 
the standards will help schools improve. But critics say the new methods fail 
to test academic skills and attack traditional values by encouraging students 
to think about controversial topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have packed local school board meetings, petitioned the state to 
eliminate test items, urged parents to boycott the exams and circulated 
documents they say are leaked portions of this year's tests.  
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest concern is that I don't know enough about it, and what I have 
heard has me worried," said Paula Nafziger of Diamond Bar, who kept her 
fourth-grade daughter home this week while Maple Hill Elementary administered 
the exams. She and a few other parents also picketed outside the school, urging 
other parents to keep youngsters home so the school would lose state funding 
based on attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they believe no copyrighted tests have "fallen into 
unauthorized hands." Other school officials say the opponents are circulating 
early copies of tests that have been abandoned or questions that were never 
intended to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to defuse some of the criticism, state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara), author of the legislation that created the CLAS program, has proposed 
creating an independent review panel to ensure that no question relates to 
personal beliefs in family life, sex, morality or religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the broad political support enjoyed by the CLAS tests has begun to 
slip as legislators hear from critics, endangering future funding. Sen. Bill 
Leonard (R-Big Bear) recently awarded the education department his monthly 
"Golden Fleece Award," calling CLAS an "inappropriate test" that wastes 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit bewildered by the intensity of the feelings," Hart said. 
"Here is a test that does not determine whether you get an A or an F . . . or 
whether you get into Berkeley or Stanford. . . . It's meant to tell us 
something about school performance and to encourage teachers to reach for 
higher levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some CLAS supporters have joined in criticizing the state Department of 
Education's handling of the exams. The most vocal is the California School 
Boards Assn., which issued a statement Thursday saying the department is 
jeopardizing the future of the exam process. 
</P>
<P>
 School Boards Assn. President Sherry Loofbourrow, while noting that the 
organization continues to support the "basic philosophy and direction of the 
CLAS test," said several school board members who have seen this year's tests 
"have serious questions about portions of the reading and writing sections." 
</P>
<P>
 Loofbourrow's district, Newport-Mesa Unified in Orange County, is scheduled to 
vote today on whether to cancel the test for its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other districts -- Antelope Valley Union High, Soledad-Agua Dulce Union 
Elementary, Flournoy Union Elementary in Tehama County and Monterey Peninsula 
Unified -- have refused to administer the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, local school board members "were put in the position of 
having to defend something we had not seen, and people thought there was 
something to hide," said Barbara Ryan, president of the Santee Elementary Board 
of Education in San Diego County. Santee trustees were the first to look at the 
exams, and then voted 4 to 1 to give the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Further stirring some parents' concerns is an addition to the scoring 
guidelines that tells school officials they have a duty under the state penal 
code to report possible child abuse. The guidelines also warn scorers that some 
children may use the exam to write about sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines require test scorers to send state officials "any essays 
containing information about sensitive issues, such as child abuse, threat of 
suicide and violence. . . . The appropriate child protective agency and/or 
school district or school site personnel will be notified about the sensitive 
issue presented in the assessment."  
</P>
<P>
 The education department, and many CLAS supporters, say the real object of the 
CLAS critics is to destroy the exam system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hate this kind of testing and want to see it destroyed," said Susie 
Lange, spokeswoman for the education department. "I'm talking about the 
instigators of this who have behind them a well-organized, well-financed effort 
to destroy this test." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has all along been about efforts of the religious right to undermine 
public education rather than just about the CLAS test itself," said Jean 
Hessburg, California director of People for the American Way, a liberal group 
that monitors the critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hessburg said groups leading the fight against CLAS in California are also 
involved around the nation in anti-textbook fights, battles against school 
health clinics and efforts to have creationism taught in science classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who are active in the campaign against CLAS are the Rutherford 
Institute, based in Charlottesville, Va., a religious liberties defense 
organization that has argued for students' rights to pray at school and fought 
against condom distribution at public campuses. The United States Justice 
Foundation, headquartered in Escondido, said it provides conservative attorneys 
nationwide to battle for individual rights. More than two dozen suits aimed at 
halting the CLAS exams have been brought by one or the other of these two 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle Forum of Washington, founded by conservative author and activist 
Phyllis Schlafly, has also been active in the effort. The organization has 
campaigned against a widely used new reading textbook. Its California director, 
Carolyn Steinke, is a leader in opposing the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Dacus, western regional coordinator for the Rutherford Institute, which 
also filed suits in Michigan and Texas over exams, said his organization views 
the fight over the exams as part of a much bigger cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CLAS test is a part of a bigger picture in which parents all across the 
nation are having to be challenged with . . . efforts by the state and federal 
governments to usurp their fundamental rights as parents," Dacus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren, Sandy Banks and Beth Shuster contributed to 
this story. Sample Test: 10th-Grade Language Arts 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents have voiced doubts about the content of the California Learning 
Assessment System tests. Questions on this year's tests are confidential, but 
the state Department of Education has released samples of past tests, saying 
they reflect the current material.  
</P>
<P>
 Below is a complete sample test in reading and writing for 10th-graders. 
Students write their responses in pencil in test booklets, which are scored by 
trained teachers. Scorers are told to evaluate how well students understand 
what they read and their ability to communicate through writing.  
</P>
<P>
 In the sample, students begin by reading an approximately 1,900-word excerpt 
from "Black Boy," Richard Wright's autobiography of growing up African American 
in the South in the 1920s. The excerpt deals with Wright's attempt to check out 
books from a segregated public library. Section One: Reading 
</P>
<P>
 * What is your response to the excerpt from this autobiography? Take a few 
minutes to write any thoughts, questions or opinions you may have. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose one of the following quotations from the reading selection to write 
about. Explain what it might mean in the selection, what it means to you, how 
you feel about it, or any other comments you may have. 
</P>
<P>
 A. "He was using words as weapons. . . . Could words be weapons?" 
</P>
<P>
 B. ". . . I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 * An "open mind" is an outline of a head that lets you show what a character 
might be thinking or feeling. In the "open mind" below use symbols, images, 
drawings and/or words to show what Richard Wright might have been thinking or 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 * What were Richard Wright's reactions to the books he read? 
</P>
<P>
 * At the end of the story, Richard Wright speculates about the kind of future 
he will choose to have. What do you think he will choose? Why do you think he 
will make these choices? 
</P>
<P>
 * This is your chance to tell anything else you want about your understanding 
of this autobiographical selection -- what it means to you, what it reminds you 
of, how it relates to your own life or whatever else you think is important 
about this reading selection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Section Two: Group Work (Students break into groups of four to discuss the 
reading, then respond to test items . )  
</P>
<P>
 * Draw or sketch one image or idea that you remember from the reading 
selection. When you are finished, share your image or idea with the rest of 
your group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Wright says, "It was not a matter of believing or disbelieving what 
I read, but of feeling something new, of being affected by something that made 
the look of the world different." In your group, talk about what you think 
Wright means by this statement. Write down the ideas from each group member. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recall the thoughts that you had in Section One as you speculated about 
Richard Wright's future. Share the ideas with your entire group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think about two changes that have occurred in your own life. List or draw 
them in Column One. In Column Two, write what happened as a result of the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Now share these changes and their effects on your life with your group. Take 
notes as the members of your group discuss the changes that occurred in their 
lives.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sometimes major changes in our lives are caused by an encounter with a 
person. Think of a person who has triggered a change in your life. Discuss this 
person with your group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Section Three: Writing (Students work independently)  
</P>
<P>
 This is a test of your writing ability. You will be able to do a better job if 
you spend a few minutes planning. You may use the notes and ideas you wrote 
down for Section Two of this test when you worked in your groups. Writing 
Situation 
</P>
<P>
 "Obstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off the goal." An obstacle 
is something that gets in the way of your achieving a goal. In "Black Boy," you 
read about the obstacles in Richard Wright's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Your English teacher has asked you to write an essay reflecting on how people 
respond to obstacles in their lives. Think about specific occasions in your 
life when you faced obstacles, or when you observed someone else dealing with 
an obstacle. Think about obstacles faced by characters in books or movies. You 
may look back at the notes from your group discussion to help you get started. 
Directions for Writing 
</P>
<P>
 Write an essay reflecting on how people deal with obstacles. You might use 
your own experience or observations as a specific occasion for reflecting on 
your ideas. In your essay, explore whatever ideas occur to you about this 
subject. You do not have to convince your teacher that your ideas are "right," 
but your comments should be presented in a thoughtful way.

how well a youngster has understood the reading.  
</P>
<P>
 A hearing scheduled today in Los Angeles Superior Court is expected to help 
resolve the privacy issue. A suit brought by a conservative legal organization 
on behalf of parents seeks to require that Los Angeles schools get parents' 
written permission before administering the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests, authorized by the Legislature in 1991 as part of an effort to 
improve public education, are a departure from traditional testing. Students 
are asked to read stories, poems or essays and write about them as well as 
respond in writing to real-life math problems. They are graded against high 
statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach is heralded by education reformers and business leaders, who say 
the standards will help schools improve. But critics say the new methods fail 
to test academic skills and attack traditional values.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics have packed local school board meetings, petitioned the state to 
eliminate test items, urged parents to boycott the exams and circulated 
documents they say are leaked portions of this year's tests.  
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest concern is that I don't know enough about it, and what I have 
heard has me worried," said Paula Nafziger of Diamond Bar, who kept her 
fourth-grade daughter home this week while Maple Hill Elementary administered 
the exams. She and a few other parents also picketed outside the school, urging 
other parents to keep youngsters home.  
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they believe no copyrighted tests have "fallen into 
unauthorized hands." Other school officials say the opponents are circulating 
early copies of tests that have been abandoned or questions that were never 
intended to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to defuse some of the criticism, state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara), author of the legislation that created the CLAS program, has proposed 
creating an independent review panel to ensure that no question relates to 
personal beliefs in family life, sex, morality or religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the broad political support enjoyed by the CLAS tests has begun to 
slip as legislators hear from critics, endangering future funding. Sen. Bill 
Leonard (R-Big Bear) recently awarded the education department his monthly 
"Golden Fleece Award," calling CLAS an "inappropriate test" that wastes 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit bewildered by the intensity of the feelings," Hart said. 
"Here is a test that does not determine whether you get an A or an F . . . or 
whether you get into Berkeley or Stanford. . . . It's meant to tell us 
something about school performance and to encourage teachers to reach for 
higher levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some CLAS supporters have joined in criticizing the state Department of 
Education's handling of the exams. The most vocal is the California School 
Boards Assn., which issued a statement Thursday saying the department is 
jeopardizing the future of the exam process. 
</P>
<P>
 School Boards Assn. President Sherry Loofbourrow, while noting that the 
organization continues to support the "basic philosophy and direction of the 
CLAS test," said several school board members who have seen this year's tests 
"have serious questions about portions of the reading and writing sections." 
</P>
<P>
 Loofbourrow's district, Newport-Mesa Unified in Orange County, is scheduled to 
vote today on whether to cancel the test for its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other districts -- Antelope Valley Union High, Soledad-Agua Dulce Union 
Elementary, Flournoy Union Elementary in Tehama County and Monterey Peninsula 
Unified -- have refused to administer the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, local school board members "were put in the position of 
having to defend something we had not seen, and people thought there was 
something to hide," said Barbara Ryan, president of the Santee Elementary Board 
of Education in San Diego County. Santee trustees were the first to look at the 
exams, and then voted 4 to 1 to give the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Further stirring some parents' concerns is an addition to the scoring 
guidelines that tells school officials they have a duty under the state penal 
code to report possible child abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 The education department, and many CLAS supporters, say the real object of the 
CLAS critics is to destroy the exam system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hate this kind of testing and want to see it destroyed," said Susie 
Lange, spokeswoman for the education department.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has all along been about efforts of the religious right to undermine 
public education rather than just about the CLAS test itself," said Jean 
Hessburg, California director of People for the American Way, a liberal group 
that monitors the critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who are active in the campaign against CLAS are the Rutherford 
Institute, based in Charlottesville, Va., a religious liberties defense 
organization that has argued for students' rights to pray at school and fought 
against condom distribution at public campuses. The United States Justice 
Foundation, headquartered in Escondido, said it provides conservative attorneys 
nationwide to battle for individual rights. More than two dozen suits aimed at 
halting the CLAS exams have been brought by one or the other of these two 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle Forum of Washington, founded by conservative author and activist 
Phyllis Schlafly, has also been active in the effort. The organization has 
campaigned against a widely used new reading textbook. Its California director, 
Carolyn Steinke, is a leader in opposing the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in Yorba Linda Wednesday night, about 200 people crowded in to 
hear Steinke assail the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of garbage are they filling our kids minds with?" Stienke asked the 
crowd, reading items she said teachers had told her were on the test. "Contact 
your principal, your superintendent, take it to the district board. They serve 
us, we pay their salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Equitz, a mother of two elementary schoolchildren who helped organize 
the meeting, said she was "appalled." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they're asking us to let our kids read this," she said. "All 
these questions seem like a real invasion of privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Dacus, western regional coordinator for the Rutherford Institute, which 
also filed suits in Michigan and Texas over exams, said his organization views 
the fight over the exams as part of a much bigger cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CLAS test is a part of a bigger picture in which parents all across the 
nation are having to be challenged with . . . efforts by the state and federal 
governments to usurp their fundamental rights as parents," Dacus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren, Sandy Banks and Beth Shuster and 
correspondent Danielle Fouquette contributed to this story. Sample Test: 
10th-Grade Language Arts 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents have voiced doubts about the content of the California Learning 
Assessment System tests. Questions on this year's tests are confidential, but 
the state Department of Education has released samples of past tests, saying 
they reflect the current material.  
</P>
<P>
 Below is a complete sample test in reading and writing for 10th-graders. 
Students write their responses in pencil in test booklets, which are scored by 
trained teachers. Scorers are told to evaluate how well students understand 
what they read and their ability to communicate through writing.  
</P>
<P>
 In the sample, students begin by reading an approximately 1,900-word excerpt 
from "Black Boy," Richard Wright's autobiography of growing up African American 
in the South in the 1920s. The excerpt deals with Wright's attempt to check out 
books from a segregated public library. Section One: Reading 
</P>
<P>
 * What is your response to the excerpt from this autobiography? Take a few 
minutes to write any thoughts, questions or opinions you may have. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose one of the following quotations from the reading selection to write 
about. Explain what it might mean in the selection, what it means to you, how 
you feel about it, or any other comments you may have. 
</P>
<P>
 A. "He was using words as weapons. . . . Could words be weapons?" 
</P>
<P>
 B. ". . . I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 * An "open mind" is an outline of a head that lets you show what a character 
might be thinking or feeling. In the "open mind" below use symbols, images, 
drawings and/or words to show what Richard Wright might have been thinking or 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 * What were Richard Wright's reactions to the books he read? 
</P>
<P>
 * At the end of the story, Richard Wright speculates about the kind of future 
he will choose to have. What do you think he will choose? Why do you think he 
will make these choices? 
</P>
<P>
 * This is your chance to tell anything else you want about your understanding 
of this autobiographical selection -- what it means to you, what it reminds you 
of, how it relates to your own life or whatever else you think is important 
about this reading selection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Section Two: Group Work (Students break into groups of four to discuss the 
reading, then respond to test items . )  
</P>
<P>
 * Draw or sketch one image or idea that you remember from the reading 
selection. When you are finished, share your image or idea with the rest of 
your group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Wright says, "It was not a matter of believing or disbelieving what 
I read, but of feeling something new, of being affected by something that made 
the look of the world different." In your group, talk about what you think 
Wright means by this statement. Write down the ideas from each group member. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recall the thoughts that you had in Section One as you speculated about 
Richard Wright's future. Share the ideas with your entire group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think about two changes that have occurred in your own life. List or draw 
them in Column One. In Column Two, write what happened as a result of the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Now share these changes and their effects on your life with your group. Take 
notes as the members of your group discuss the changes that occurred in their 
lives.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sometimes major changes in our lives are caused by an encounter with a 
person. Think of a person who has triggered a change in your life. Discuss this 
person with your group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Section Three: Writing (Students work independently)  
</P>
<P>
 This is a test of your writing ability. You will be able to do a better job if 
you spend a few minutes planning. You may use the notes and ideas you wrote 
down for Section Two of this test when you worked in your groups. Writing 
Situation 
</P>
<P>
 "Obstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off the goal." An obstacle 
is something that gets in the way of your achieving a goal. In "Black Boy," you 
read about the obstacles in Richard Wright's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Your English teacher has asked you to write an essay reflecting on how people 
respond to obstacles in their lives. Think about specific occasions in your 
life when you faced obstacles, or when you observed someone else dealing with 
an obstacle. Think about obstacles faced by characters in books or movies. You 
may look back at the notes from your group discussion to help you get started. 
Directions for Writing 
</P>
<P>
 Write an essay reflecting on how people deal with obstacles. You might use 
your own experience or observations as a specific occasion for reflecting on 
your ideas. In your essay, explore whatever ideas occur to you about this 
subject. You do not have to convince your teacher that your ideas are "right," 
but your comments should be presented in a thoughtful way.

HUFFINGTON URGES NEW TAX BREAKS FOR CHARITABLE GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to "encourage America's remarkable spirit of giving," Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) unveiled legislation Thursday that he said would 
provide tax breaks to people of all income levels who contribute to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, supported by several charity groups, including the United Way of 
America, would amend the federal tax code to remove limits on charitable 
deductions for the wealthiest taxpayers while extending relief to lower-income 
workers who do not itemize their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Several tax experts said the major beneficiaries of the bill would be 
millionaire philanthropists like Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a strange piece of legislation," said Michael Ettlinger, tax 
policy director for the Washington public-interest group Citizens for Tax 
Justice. "The bottom line is you're helping out a few very rich people who give 
a lot to charities . . . and a few low-income people who give a surprisingly 
large percentage of their incomes to charity." 
</P>
<P>
 These experts also said it does not provide tax incentives to people at all 
income levels, as Huffington contended. This gap would include about 30 million 
taxpayers who itemize their deductions and earn less than $100,000 a year, 
according to an IRS spokesman. Those taxpayers already can deduct much of their 
charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 
June, said the measure is much more than a simple tax relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a call to community and service," said Huffington, 46, who acquired an 
estimated $70 million fortune after working at his father's oil company for 13 
years. "It is a call for Americans to join together and build a greater and 
nobler nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the legislation dovetails with the theme of volunteerism central 
to Huffington's Senate campaign as well as a new book by his wife, Arianna 
Stassinopoulos Huffington. The Huffingtons threw a party at the Capitol on 
Thursday evening to celebrate the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's primary opponent, former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, called the 
tax legislation a credible idea. But Dannemeyer criticized Huffington for 
offering a bill that would cost the U.S. Treasury an estimated $6 billion a 
year without finding a way to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, flanked by two administrators of Washington-area nonprofit 
agencies, announced the proposal -- his second original piece of legislation in 
16 months -- at a late morning news conference on the Capitol lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in my heart and in my mind that more and more people will give money," 
Huffington said. "My guess is you are talking about tens of billions of dollars 
going into nonprofit groups on a yearly basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that the legislation had virtually no chance of passing this year, 
Huffington said he would introduce it again next year if he is elected to the 
Senate. The bill is supported by 34 members of Congress, all Republicans but 
for three. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah M. Hawkins, founder and director of Children of Mine Center, an 
after-school community recreation facility in Washington, said the proposal 
would boost the number of donations from lower- and moderate-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some who would donate but they need a nudge, and this bill, my 
brothers and sisters, would fully give that nudge," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he believes the bulk of the increased contributions generated 
by his legislation would come from taxpayers who do not itemize their 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people who earn $30,000 yearly to have that opportunity to give," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, a married couple making $30,000 a year who gave $1,000 to 
charity would get a $102 tax break, according to an IRS spokesman. A couple 
earning $40,000 who contributed $2,000 would receive $252. 
</P>
<P>
 Three tax experts contacted by The Times said they doubted that lower- to 
middle-income taxpayers who do not own a house or pay enough in taxes to 
itemize their deductions would take advantage of such incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill would be a boon to the exceedingly wealthy who give a substantial 
amount of money to charities without claiming other large deductions, said Don 
Roberts of the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal revives a tax incentive for charitable giving by the wealthy that 
was eliminated by Congress in 1990. Huffington cited an independent research 
study that found charitable giving dropped 18% for people making $100,000 or 
more between 1989 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who donates his $133,644 annual salary to children's charities in 
his district, said he has not even thought about how the proposal would affect 
his tax return. He said that since 1990 he has given millions of dollars to 
charity.

JUDGE SEEN AS A CONSERVATIVE -- USUALLY; SUPREME COURT: NOMINEE KATHRYN 
WERDEGAR IS EXPECTED TO FIT IN WITH THE STATE'S JUSTICES BUT OCCASIONALLY GO 
HER OWN WAY, ESPECIALLY ON WOMEN'S ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Supreme Court nominee Kathryn M. Werdegar is expected to follow a 
largely conservative course on the high court but also show flashes of 
independence, particularly on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar, selected by Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday, has voted on one abortion 
case, joining a conservative and a liberal on the Court of Appeal in ruling for 
a Planned Parenthood clinic that had won an injunction against anti-abortion 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after taking her seat on the Supreme Court, Werdegar probably will be 
called to help decide a case testing whether minors can be compelled to obtain 
a parent's consent for an abortion. Though her views on the case are unknown, 
colleagues and friends describe her as a strong supporter of women's rights.  
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of enforcing a woman's right to privacy," said a state Court of 
Appeal justice who knows Werdegar, "I don't think (women's groups) have 
anything to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 In tapping Werdegar, Wilson turned to an old friend who has contributed $4,000 
to his campaigns, including $500 after the court's vacancy was announced in 
early September. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about pressure to appoint a woman or minority in an election year, 
Wilson said he based his appointment on "the best possible qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
 But in secret ratings by a California State Bar commission, another candidate, 
Court of Appeal Justice Ming Chin, received the most votes as "exceptionally 
well-qualified" among the six finalists, according to two knowledgeable 
sources. One of them said Werdegar placed third in the number of votes for the 
highest rating, behind Court of Appeal Justice Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar, whose nomination has been widely praised, still scored high in the 
ratings, and the commission's evaluations tend to be pivotal only when a 
candidate is found not qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob White, Wilson's chief of staff, said he was "shocked" that "rumors" are 
being spread about the closed evaluation process and refused to discuss any of 
the candidates' ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar also declined to discuss her ratings, saying only that she had been 
highly pleased with the rating she received from the bar commission when Wilson 
appointed her to the Court of Appeal in San Francisco three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her scant experience as a judge, it is difficult to assess 
Werdegar's philosophy on a wide array of issues. She is considered conservative 
but independent, more concerned about being viewed as a thoughtful, 
accomplished jurist than about promoting a conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Werdegar believe she will be more sympathetic to abortion 
rights and other women's issues than her predecessor, retired Justice Edward 
Panelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has told reporters that Werdegar had trouble finding a job in a private 
law firm after law school because of sex discrimination, even though she 
graduated first in her class at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I know her position on any particular issue," said San Francisco 
attorney Jill Schlichtmann, "but in my personal relationship with her I have 
found her to be a strong advocate for women's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 As former president of the Queen's Bench, established in 1921 to expand 
opportunities for women in the legal profession, Schlichtmann became acquainted 
with Werdegar when she gave a speech to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar was characteristically careful in her February speech. She talked 
about whether female judges would "fundamentally transform" traditional 
jurisprudence but declined to state her views. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that female judges are more sensitive to issues affecting women, 
she said, including sexual assault, the parent-child relationship and equal 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also quoted Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, confessing that 
she was troubled by generalizations about the differences between male and 
female judges. 
</P>
<P>
 California Supreme Court Justice Joyce Kennard, the only woman now on the 
court, was considered to be in the same conservative mold as Werdegar when Gov. 
George Deukmejian appointed her in 1989. But Kennard has steered a moderate 
course, irritating her conservative colleagues with her frequent dissents. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Werdegar, Kennard had been a judge for only three years when Deukmejian 
elevated her to the Supreme Court, and there was little in her record by which 
to assess her views. 
</P>
<P>
 But court analysts and judges believe Werdegar is less likely than Kennard to 
separate herself from the conservative majority. Werdegar worked as a research 
attorney for six years for Panelli, a conservative who recommended her for his 
seat when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly don't think she is going to be as independent as Kennard," said 
University of Santa Clara law school Dean Gerald Uelmen, who follows the state 
high court closely. "If there were similar dispositions, it would be very 
surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelli, appointed by Deukmejian, said Werdegar almost always produced 
research that supported his views. He could recall her challenging his legal 
analysis of a case but never the ultimate disposition he favored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never really had any violent disagreements over issues, but she would tell 
me if she disagreed. . . . " Panelli said. "She would say, 'After the research 
I have done, I don't think we can write it the way you suggest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The affable Panelli was considered a skilled conciliator on the court, capable 
of swaying other members. Wilson's advisers said he was looking for someone 
with similar skills. Werdegar, however, is reserved and guarded, a strong 
contrast in temperament to the justice she would replace. Judges disagree over 
how influential she would be on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been so new and so inexperienced," said a judge who knows her, "and 
dealing from that position makes her very insecure. . . . I find her very 
pleasant but always defensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Court of Appeal Justice Marc Poche, however, recalled that as a researcher for 
his court, Werdegar was persuasive in supporting her views. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not a person who thumps on the table," Poche said, "but she is a 
person who, once she has researched something and thought about it, can look 
you in the eye and be pretty devastating with her logic." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that the conservative majority on the court is pro-business 
and pro-insurance-company, more concerned about the outcome of individual cases 
than in applying the law to the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 In opinions Werdegar wrote on insurance disputes, she ruled against insurance 
companies two of three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court later decided to decertify one of her rulings 
against the insurance industry, prohibiting its use as precedent.  
</P>
<P>
 In that case, a woman was injured by an airport transport service. She sued, 
and the company neglected to tell its insurance carrier. A default judgment was 
entered against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company then learned about the default and tried to set it 
aside. A Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the insurance company, but 
Werdegar reversed the lower court. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar's ruling in the case "would worry insurance companies," Uelmen said, 
"and the Supreme Court probably got a lot of petitions from insurance companies 
in response."  
</P>
<P>
 Kennard, indicating she agreed with Werdegar's decision, voted against 
reducing its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But the insurance cases "don't tell us much except there is not a knee-jerk 
reaction for an insurance company," said Oakland appellate lawyer Peter Davis, 
who represents insurance companies and other businesses before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate attorneys who represent interests at odds with big business and the 
government generally favored Werdegar or Chin over more conservative candidates 
for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is nebulous enough that a judge's personal views can shape decisions 
in 75% of his or her cases, said San Francisco criminal appellate attorney 
Dennis Riordan. But if judges are truly applying the law, about one-quarter of 
their decisions will "go against their philosophical grain," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled Werdegar's willingness to reverse herself in a criminal case after 
her ruling triggered furious protests from legal scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that may be saying is that she is intensely concerned about her image as 
a judicial craftsman and thinker," Riordan said. "If that is the case, she is 
cut from a different stripe than most of the members of the (California 
Supreme) Court." 
</P>
<P>
 William Veen, a San Francisco personal injury attorney, remembered his 
apprehension when she sat on the case of a young man he represented who had 
become a paraplegic in an equipment accident at his job. "I was scared because 
I thought a conservative court might rewrite the law," Veen said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Werdegar, hearing the case on appeal, upheld a $3.5-million judgment 
against a subcontractor who had been hired to repair the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Werdegar heard the case, voters had approved a ballot measure that 
limited such damages. The accident, however, occurred before the proposition 
was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Veen: "She came up with the conclusion the law is the law and applied it 
appropriately."

UC OFFICIALS LOOK FOR WAY TO SAVE REDWOOD GROVE; LAND USE: UNIVERSITY WILL 
INVESTIGATE LEGALITY OF REJECTING ALL BIDS ON THE 410 ACRES IT HAS PUT UP FOR 
SALE. THE MOVE COMES IN RESPONSE TO CRITICISM OF PLANNED TRANSFER TO TIMBER 
COMPANY.

<P>
 University of California officials are looking for a way to save a grove of 
ancient redwoods near Santa Cruz that the school tentatively agreed to sell to 
a timber company last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC spokesman said Thursday that university President Jack W. Peltason and 
Karl Pister, chancellor of the Santa Cruz campus, began discussing whether 
there is a way to keep the trees after an outpouring of public concern over the 
proposed sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Debley, assistant director of the university's news service, said one 
option under review was to reject all bids on the 410 acres the university put 
up for sale. But Debley said legal issues first had to be resolved. Since bids 
on the land already had been received, it was unclear whether state law 
required the university to accept the highest offer -- $2.38 million from a 
Northern California timber company. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed sale of the redwoods marked the second time in recent weeks that 
UC had opted to sell environmentally valuable land to ease the school's budget 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials insist there is no concerted effort under way to sell 
environmentally sensitive property, one member of the Board of Regents has 
requested a report on all such land owned by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know what we've got and why it's valuable, so we can do a better 
job of protecting it," said regent Roy Shults, a Los Angeles lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shults became concerned after a majority of the regents voted in March to sell 
a 1,200-acre ranch in Sonoma County over the objections of university 
researchers. The researchers said the property contained a unique ecosystem 
that is home to more than 400 plant species and several rare freshwater 
invertebrates. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 200 members of the faculty had voted to put it in the university's 
natural reserve system," Shults said. "It is a unique ecosystem encompassing 
mountains, grasslands, desert and marsh land right down to the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 The university's 140,000-acre natural reserve system encompasses land around 
the state that is valued for research because it includes habitat or species 
unique to California. The university manages all the land in the reserve system 
but owns only about 12%.  
</P>
<P>
 Those reserves will grow smaller if the university ends up selling the land 
near Santa Cruz. According to UC officials, the property contains the largest 
and oldest redwoods, some of them more than 1,000 years old, in the 
university's reserve system.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sonoma County property, known as the Button ranch for the family who 
donated it to the university in 1974, had been a candidate for the reserve 
system for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, we didn't know the university owned it," said Elizabeth 
Riddle, assistant director of the reserve system. "Had we known, we would have 
expressed interest sooner than we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby city of Santa Rosa also had designs on the property, seeing it as a 
potential site for a 3-billion-gallon waste-water reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bagley, a regent who once represented Sonoma County in the 
Legislature, went to bat for Santa Rosa, recommending that the ranch be 
optioned to the city. Bagley, who grew up in the area, was not impressed by the 
property's environmental assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fallow, overgrazed, wild oats and bay tree piece of land," said 
Bagley. "It's got a canyon in it, which apparently has some interest, but to me 
it's no different than any other pleasant canyon in west Sonoma County." 
</P>
<P>
 But faculty members and local environmentalists objected to the sale, 
contending the waste-water reservoir would flood the most ecologically valuable 
section of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Another regent, Roy Brophy of Fair Oaks, proposed the university put the 
property up for sale and dedicate the proceeds to student assistance. Brophy's 
motion carried and the land is expected to go on the market soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The regents, meanwhile, insist they are not in the process of selling off the 
university's natural resources as a way of meeting current financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would resist efforts to sell off seed corn," Brophy said. "There are some 
parcels of land needed for research. I don't think we are looking at that 
inventory to meet short term needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we have land out there of no particular value for research or other 
uses by the university, we might take a hard look at it."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / ALAN C. MILLER: MARKET RESEARCH CONGRESSIONAL STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you read your mail carefully, you've probably seen them. If you're 
politically inclined, you may have answered them. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, you've definitely paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 They are congressional questionnaires, a staple of taxpayer-funded newsletters 
for California lawmakers as well as their colleagues. These newsletters are 
approved by a congressional commission to limit political content, but the 
surveys are given wide latitude. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually arrive in a slickly produced mailing replete with photos of the 
lawmaker and prose touting a stellar voting record or heroic efforts to combat 
drugs or curb illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaires purport to be an effort to find out how constituents feel 
about crime or health care or other major issues. But don't confuse them with 
legitimate polling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, some members of Congress do learn more about the feelings of those 
they represent. Almost all say they do. But, for many, the questionnaires 
fulfill other, more self-serving, purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 One is political persuasion, masquerading as polling. What else is one to make 
of the first question on a "Crime in America" survey sent out by conservative 
Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin)? 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you support legislation to end unlimited, frivolous appeals that have 
clogged federal courts and delayed the finality of state sentences?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, when you put it that way, Congressman, who could possibly say no? 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Bill Mueller, Doolittle's spokesman, said: "This survey was the 
barometer by which the congressman developed legislation on crime. This is a 
very good, very important way for us to get feedback from our constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, consider this query-cum-commentary from Rep. Tom Lantos 
(D-Burlingame). Please answer yes or no to the following: 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals convicted of three violent crimes should serve prison sentences 
without any possibility of parole until they reach a certain age when they no 
longer have the ability to commit violent crimes (emphasis his). This will 
prevent our prisons from becoming nursing homes for aging criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, other questionnaires are worded more straightforwardly. But 
pollsters say that even then, the small, self-selecting pool of respondents is 
unreliable as a cross-section of a district's sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 These professionals seek a response rate of at least 60% to 70% -- with 50% 
considered rock bottom -- for a survey to be statistically valid. Even 
lawmakers who run up 15,000 or more replies still hear from no more than 5% to 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sample, biases are likely. Constituents who disagree with a lawmaker may 
be prone to toss the newsletter. Those with more time and interest are most 
likely to reply. 
</P>
<P>
 The results therefore may suggest that an official is in tune with his core 
supporters or with likely voters, especially if the responses reinforce other 
forms of communication. Or they could yield ammunition, however specious, to 
claim the official is in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real purpose may have nothing to do with the views of voters in the 
district. Rather, some members use them to collect data about constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual replies are punched into a computer -- also at taxpayers' 
expense -- and deployed to do more narrowly targeted mailings. Officials are 
prohibited from transferring this information to election campaigns, but the 
congressional offices sometimes use the same kind of technique favored by 
political professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do lawmakers learn respondents' views on issues, but some ask for 
demographic information such as sex, age, marital status and occupation. This 
can become the basis for a personal profile to be used in subsequent customized 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional challengers decry this political marketing as an unfair 
incumbent election advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most direct approach is to ask constituents which issues matter most to 
them. Freshman Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Petaluma) posed such a query in a 1993 
newsletter. She quickly put the answers to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate your taking the time to let me know which issues are important 
to you," began a February, 1994, letter to selected constituents. "Because you 
indicated that deficit reduction is a top priority, I wanted to take the 
opportunity to update you on my activities in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 She did lots of updating. She sent individually addressed letters to those 
concerned about education, political reform, welfare reform, women's equality 
issues, AIDS/HIV, crime, Central America, developments in the Middle East, 
environmental protection, the gay and lesbian community, aid to senior citizens 
and veterans issues. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that such mailings are helpful. The question, one not likely 
to be found in any congressional newsletter, is: to whom?

SENATE REBUKE OF CLINTON ON BOSNIA LIKELY; POLICY: A DOZEN DEMOCRATS ARE READY 
TO SUPPORT A GOP MEASURE LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO ON THE MUSLIM-LED GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just two days after President Clinton went on worldwide television to defend 
his conduct of foreign policy, the Senate appeared ready Thursday to rebuke him 
over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Democrats said they will support legislation to lift the Bosnian 
arms embargo unilaterally, despite the Clinton Administration's insistence that 
it cannot break ranks with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and 
take such a major step on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 With the issue now expected to come to a head as early as today, Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) sought support for an alternative 
that would allow restive Democrats to express their growing unease over Bosnia 
without challenging the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But several senior Democrats said they still plan to back a bill sponsored by 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to end U.S. participation in the embargo 
regardless of opposition by Britain, France and other NATO member nations that 
have peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's alternative, which would merely instruct Clinton to seek allied 
consent to supply arms to Bosnia's Muslim-led government, "is not going to be 
enough for me or a lot of other Democrats to support," said Sen. Joseph I. 
Lieberman (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee 
that oversees foreign aid, added: "The majority is not going to be satisfied 
with anything less than the lifting of the embargo." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 12 Democrats have indicated that they will vote for the GOP measure, 
which would mandate an end to U.S. compliance with the U.N.-imposed embargo so 
Bosnia's lightly armed government forces could obtain antitank weapons and 
other armaments they need. All but a handful of Republicans are expected to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the measure passes the Senate, it is considered unlikely to win 
approval in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell argued that forcing Clinton to lift the embargo will jeopardize the 
United States' relations with the United Nations, NATO allies and Russia. His 
plan, crafted in cooperation with the Administration, is similar to a 
non-binding resolution adopted by the Senate last January during the Bosnian 
Serb siege of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The different approaches show that the Senate remains as deeply divided as it 
was in January over what the U.S. role in Bosnia should be and whether, by 
action or inaction, the United States is running the risk of becoming enmeshed 
in another Vietnam or closing its eyes to another Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, two subtle but significant differences are propelling the 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is an emerging consensus that the U.N. peacekeeping mission in 
Bosnia has failed and that it is time, in Lieberman's words, "to get out of the 
way" and give the Bosnian Muslims a chance to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still fearful of air strikes or other military action that could drag the 
United States into a ground war in Bosnia, yet frustrated and embarrassed by 
their own inaction in the face of continued Serbian defiance, more lawmakers 
now see an end to the arms embargo as a low-cost way of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ending the embargo allows a lot of people to go home and say they have done 
something -- but not something that is going to come back and haunt them 
politically when Americans are killed or U.S. planes are shot down," Leahy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second significant development is a further erosion of confidence in 
Clinton's handling of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his handling of these issues in an internationally televised meeting 
in Atlanta on Tuesday, Clinton conceded that he initially had underestimated 
the difficulties of achieving an allied consensus on Bosnia. He said he had 
done "the best I could" by seeking to confront rather than avoid difficult 
problems.

U.S. COMPLETES POLICY ON PEACEKEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, chastened by its flawed efforts to make or keep 
peace in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti, has completed a long-delayed, 
oft-revised policy governing U.S. participation in peacekeeping operations 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy sets numerous, stringent conditions, with U.S. involvement in 
international peacekeeping to become "more selective and more effective" as a 
result, according to White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by President Clinton earlier this week, the policy marks the first 
comprehensive effort by the government to specify the conditions under which 
the United States will intervene in foreign conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the document, known as Presidential Decision Directive 13, spells out only 
the questions -- not the answers -- for policy-makers to consider when faced by 
a difficult political or humanitarian crisis such as those now facing Haiti or 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study is not a crystal ball," Lake said. "It is a road map." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is the result of a yearlong policy review. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department and the Pentagon took months to resolve the issue of who 
will pay the U.S. share for various types of peacekeeping missions. It was 
finally determined that the Pentagon would pay for operations involving 
substantial numbers of U.S. troops and the likelihood of combat, such as 
Somalia. The State Department will underwrite more traditional peacekeeping 
duties where no U.S. combat troops are dispatched, such as operations in the 
Golan Heights and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will result in a shift of about $500 million from the State 
Department budget for multinational organizations to the Pentagon, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, U.S. military forces will never come under foreign 
command, although troops on occasion may be assigned to the temporary 
operational control of a U.N. commander. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be cases in which U.S. troops may serve "for a specific time 
frame, for a specific mission, in a particular location" under a military 
commander from another U.N. country. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the United States agrees to participate in a U.N. operation, these 
conditions must be met: There must be an identifiable U.S. interest at stake; 
the mission must be clearly defined in size, scope and duration; there must be 
sufficient resources and political will to carry out the mission, and there 
must be an identifiable "exit strategy" for ending U.S. involvement. Clear 
lines of command must be in place, and Congress and the American people must 
support U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said an important goal of the new policy is to lower the cost of 
U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. The Administration has said 
it wants to pay no more than 25% of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. It now 
contributes almost a third and is $1 billion behind in its payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake said that the new policy reflects the limits of U.S. ability to solve the 
world's problems as well as constraints on the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's campaign proposal for a standing U.N. peacekeeping force has now 
evolved into a plan to create a computer database of forces that could be 
enlisted on short notice to enforce U.N. resolutions.

BOSNIA DEMANDS U.N. ENVOY QUIT, ALLEGING HE AIDED SERBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian leaders demanded Thursday that the top U.N. official in the former 
Yugoslav federation resign, accusing him of helping Bosnian Serbs redeploy 
tanks around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar threatened efforts by international envoys to restart peace talks 
and undermined the United Nations' credibility in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute involved at least five Serbian tanks that arrived late Wednesday 
and on Thursday at the protected zone around Sarajevo. Even though heavy 
weapons are forbidden in the area, U.N. soldiers allowed them to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Eric Chaperon said in the Bosnian capital that the chief U.N. 
envoy, Yasushi Akashi, had made a "verbal agreement" with the Serbs allowing 
them to move tanks through the protected zone under U.N. escort. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.N. headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, Akashi defended his decision, saying 
the Serbian tanks "were to adopt a posture which is non-threatening so far as 
their capability to attack Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's collective presidency said it was "shocked by the information" and 
demanded Akashi's resignation. The Muslim-led government accused Akashi of 
"practically taking part in the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, speaking in Geneva, said Akashi 
"continues to have my full confidence. There's no question of any kind of 
replacement." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, six U.S., Russian and European negotiators arrived here Thursday on 
a special military flight for a second effort at brokering a cease-fire for all 
of Bosnia.

 An American employee at Germany's main nuclear research center has been 
arrested for spying for Communist East Germany from 1977 to 1989, authorities 
said. The expatriate, identified as Jeffrey Schevitz, is a former anti-Vietnam 
War activist at UC Berkeley who later taught sociology at Washington University 
in St. Louis and the State University of New York at Buffalo before moving to 
Germany in 1975. Schevitz's wife, Beatrice Altman, is also under investigation 
for espionage, her attorney said.

 Although it was the first time in 15 years that a Taiwanese president had 
arrived on U.S. soil, Lee Teng-hui stayed in his plane when it landed in Hawaii 
this week on the way to a visit to Nicaragua. Despite congressional protests, 
Lee was limited by the Clinton Administration to only a short refueling stop in 
order not to offend the People's Republic of China. The United States broke off 
diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979.

PALESTINIANS FEELING MONEY SQUEEZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinians have gathered only about half the money needed over the next six 
months to field a police force in Jericho and Gaza Strip, the single most 
important element in asserting Palestinian power under the new autonomy plan, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid coordinators meeting here said they had amassed about $20 million of the 
estimated $90 million a year needed to operate the 9,000-member force. That 
immediately raised questions about how the Palestinians will sustain the 
institution responsible for guaranteeing order and security in the turbulent 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Terje Larsen, the Norwegian diplomat heading the fund-raising effort, said the 
contributions collected so far, along with donations of equipment and materiel, 
"are about to reach a level where at least the minimum requirements are met." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 50% available now compares favorably to late March, when 10% of 
the first six months' operation costs had been pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, diplomats and Palestine Liberation Organization officials are 
alarmed at the slow fund raising, particularly for deployment of Palestinian 
police who will require housing, weapons and communications equipment if the 
newly signed Palestinian autonomy agreement with Israel is to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need the money, they need it now, and they don't have all they need," a 
Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the PLO has sent envoys to capitals around the world seeking donations 
to cover the $13.4 billion it says it will need to fund the first five years of 
autonomy, pledges have been slow. Actual contributions have been almost nil in 
the weeks preceding the autonomy pact's signing. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials say most nations indicated a willingness to help but were 
reluctant to commit cash before seeing if Israel and the PLO would reach their 
accord on Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 With the agreement signed Wednesday in Cairo, Thursday's meeting to update 
donations for the police force indicated that the world even now is not rushing 
to finance even the most critical elements of the self-rule program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have an effective, well-trained police force on the ground as 
quickly as possible if you want this to work at all," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear the police deployment will be slower than envisioned, though PLO 
officials blame that primarily on problems with logistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The first major influx of officers, instead of arriving Thursday as planned, 
will not be deployed until Monday -- at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, PLO chief negotiator, said it is taking longer than expected to 
get the Palestine Liberation Army forces from six Arab countries into a staging 
camp on the Egyptian border at Rafah for deployment as police in the Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage of the game, the most urgent need is for cash that will go 
directly in smoothing the transition and making things happen fast, which is 
what we require," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the PLO is emphasizing the need to equip the police force with modern 
communications and computer equipment in the belief that technology can help 
avoid the human rights abuses that occur in many underdeveloped countries. 
</P>
<P>
 To help spur fund raising, the United States announced that it was raising its 
$4-million pledge of aid to the police force by $5 million more, hoping other 
nations would follow. The U.S. aid will cover any needed start-up costs -- 
except weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has also donated several hundred vehicles for the 
Palestinian force; they were being shipped into Gaza last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cash contributions include $2 million from Norway, $11 million from the 
European Union and an undisclosed amount from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nations have pledged equipment and in-kind support. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia, for example, is donating flights to transport equipment, worth 
about $1 million. Russia has pledged armored vehicles, Germany a police academy 
building, Britain riot gear, and Norway will supply police uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel on Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa outlined plans 
to provide $50 million for police housing and to train workers on modern 
construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan overall is expected to give about $200 million in the next two years for 
housing, refugee aid and health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank last week announced a $1.2-billion program to create 
institutions and rebuild infrastructure in Gaza and Jericho, with $570 million 
available in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- for which the EU, the United States and Japan would be the 
biggest donors -- includes about $300 million to support private-sector 
investment in housing, telecommunications, agriculture and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $300 million will go toward building a central Palestinian 
administration.

PLO APPEARS UNPREPARED TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY NOW; MIDEAST: OFFICIALS HAVE NOT 
YET BEEN NAMED TO RUN ESSENTIAL SERVICES. IT WILL BE WEEKS BEFORE PALESTINIAN 
POLICE ARE DEPLOYED.

 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho entered their 
long-awaited period of self-government Thursday only to find that the Palestine 
Liberation Organization was unprepared to exercise the authority it won in 
months of tough negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, 22 senior Palestinian police commanders began preliminary 
talks on assuming control of the area from Israeli forces that have occupied it 
for nearly 27 years, but they said that it will take three weeks to fully 
deploy 6,000 rank-and-file police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, the Israeli general commanding the West Bank declared the city a 
"closed military area," surrounding it with combat troops and allowing only 
residents to enter, as Jewish settlers continued to protest the planned Israeli 
withdrawal from the ancient town. 
</P>
<P>
 And Israeli officials here expressed their fears that essential services -- 
health care, water supplies and electrical power, among others -- will collapse 
unless the PLO quickly designates officials to take charge of Gaza and Jericho 
as 700 Israelis in the military government pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are leaving, and we are eager to do so and implement this agreement on 
autonomy," said Uri Dromi, director of the Israeli government press office. 
"But we just can't walk away and let chaos reign. There must be at least 
someone there to whom we can hand the keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel fears that the PLO will ask for a delay in the withdrawal beyond May 
25, Dromi said, as it tries to organize itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have to ask, 'Are we sure of anything?' " he replied when 
asked whether previously announced transition timetables still held. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Palestinian politicians on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, the mood 
was bleak -- not only because of the poorly planned assumption of power but 
because of the intense infighting in the PLO's top ranks at its headquarters in 
Tunis, Tunisia, that has compounded the problems here. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath counseled patience, 
promising that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat would appoint a 24-member council 
next week to administer Gaza and Jericho and that the Palestinian police will 
be deployed within three weeks, arriving before the Israeli withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very obvious as we are getting into Gaza and Jericho that this is the 
first opportunity the Palestinian people have had after long years of 
occupation to have their own government on their own land," Shaath said. "This 
means that not everything can go as smoothly as one would want to. But the 
delays are really within the agreement itself. We are not delaying the 
implementation beyond the three weeks in the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 But measured against Palestinian hopes, the immediate changes were largely 
symbolic, not the sweeping moves envisioned in the autonomy agreement signed by 
Israel and the PLO in Cairo this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel on Thursday freed about 800 Palestinian prisoners and in the process 
emptied the main prison in Gaza City, long a symbol of the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number freed was 400 fewer than planned. At least 3,400 more prisoners 
are still to be released under terms of the accord.  
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian police commanders, 17 of whom arrived only Wednesday, talked 
with their Israeli counterparts for more than five hours in their first 
meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 The first contingent of a 160-member international observer force arrived to 
take up positions Sunday in the West Bank city of Hebron, where a Jewish 
settler massacred about 30 Muslim worshipers at a mosque in February. The 
observers, who will be unarmed, come from Norway, Denmark and Italy. Observers 
will later be stationed in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The deployment of the new Palestinian police, who will eventually number 
9,000, is a key political move, for it replaces the Israeli occupation with an 
accepted Palestinian authority, as well as preserving order during the 
transition. Palestinians not only in the Gaza Strip but the West Bank have 
looked toward the force's arrival as their day of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interim, as Palestinian commanders prepare to take charge of the 
region, Israeli forces will continue to follow the same orders they have had 
throughout the occupation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still responsible in the area, and we will continue to be until the 
last day, including action against those who continue to oppose the peace 
agreement -- especially those who continue to make terror acts against us," 
Col. Shuki Shichrur said.

TRIBAL LEADERS MEET, VOICE SOVEREIGNTY CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstered by last week's historic meeting with President Clinton, Native 
American leaders from Alaska to Florida met here Thursday with senior White 
House officials to press for strengthened sovereign status. 
</P>
<P>
 American Indian nations are not used to speaking with one voice about 
anything, but they are united over concern about confusing and often volatile 
overlap between tribal government jurisdictions and federal Indian policies. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 tribal leaders began unprecedented meetings Thursday with Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt by discussing ways to 
resolve conflicts over the management of tribal natural resources and the power 
of tribal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day National American Indian Listening Conference concludes today with 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros joining similar talks 
about gaming disputes, religious freedom, health, housing and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "For so long the doors of the White House were closed. Now, the gates are 
open," Reno said in her opening remarks. "This listening conference is a step 
toward doing away with the old, closed way of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
 The federally sponsored event at the Albuquerque Convention Center was billed 
as an opportunity for Cabinet officials to hear Indian concerns in detail, 
leading to more talks over specific questions of jurisdiction over Native 
American lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming into the conference, Native American leaders pointed out that every new 
Administration vows to do better on Indian lands, but rarely lives up to the 
promises. For their part, Administration officials feared that the Native 
American leaders would come to the table with fiery rhetoric rather than 
practical recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt urged Native American leaders to seek out the 90 federal officials in 
attendance and make their concerns known, close up and personal. And Navajo 
nation President Peterson Zah, who, along with Cherokee nation Principal Chief 
Wilma Mankiller, helped arrange the meeting, told the gathering that "the 
long-winded should cut it short and the shy should get aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, that approach seemed to be working. Although specific concerns 
differed from one reservation to the next, the common denominator was a desire 
to be treated as sovereign entities. Most of the tribal leaders wanted help to 
develop their own economies, free of interference from outside agencies or 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boyd Graham, chairman of the Duckwater Shashone Tribal Council, about 260 
miles north of Las Vegas, that means being able to expand his reservation 
boundaries for farming and a dude ranch. For Arcadio Gastelum, chairman of the 
Pascuayaqui Tribe near Tucson, it means getting additional federal law 
enforcement officers to safeguard a gaming operation and curb delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, "part of the problem is that reservations used to be 
way out in the sticks where nobody paid attention to them," said Michael 
Connolly, an engineer with the Campo Band of Mission Indians in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, urban areas border them and jurisdiction disputes are cropping up 
everywhere over such things as water rights and gaming centers," Connolly said. 
"And while the San Diego Assn. of Governments has an observer on its board from 
Tijuana, it does not have one (Native American) representative from the 17 
reservations in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what we need to solve our problems -- we have the solutions," added 
Keller George, a representative of the Oneida Indian nation in New York. "We 
just need the tools to make them work." 
</P>
<P>
 Few American Indian leaders here were as lucky as Julia Demott, 67, a 
fisherwoman from the village of Eyak near Cordova, Alaska, who wrangled a seat 
beside Babbitt during a roundtable discussion. When it came her turn to tell 
about the lingering effects of the Exxon oil spill of 1989 on her village of 
500 people, she at first could barely speak above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretend you're shouting it across the Bering Sea," Babbitt said with a smile, 
placing a friendly arm around her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Demott did just that, reading a prepared statement in her trembling hands. 
"Every day there are reports of reduced fish harvests! Exxon says it is because 
of disease! It is not!" she blared out. "We desperately need assistance in this 
matter from the Administration!"

ABORTION CLINIC ACCESS BILL CLEARS HOUSE; LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE, PASSED IN 
WAKE OF ATTACKS, WOULD MAKE IT A FEDERAL CRIME TO BAR ENTRY OR TO USE VIOLENCE 
AGAINST STAFF OR PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Alarmed by a rising wave of abortion-related violence, the House on Thursday 
approved legislation that makes it a federal crime to block access to abortion 
clinics or to use violence to injure or intimidate clinic staffs or their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion foes used a series of parliamentary tactics to delay passage but they 
could not stop the House from approving the measure, called the Freedom of 
Access bill by its sponsors, on a 241-174 vote. It now goes to the Senate, 
where it is expected to win final congressional approval next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right to choose is meaningless without the access to choose," said Rep. 
Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) in a statement that seemed to reflect the 
prevailing sentiment in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final approval of the measure was never in doubt, opponents forced 
several procedural votes to delay the outcome and underscore their displeasure 
with what they described as a one-sided and possibly unconstitutional measure 
restricting demonstrations outside abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was "designed not to prevent violence but to discourage pro-life 
protests" by making an "individual's pro-life convictions a thought crime," 
Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) charged. It puts "a congressional stamp of approval on 
the pro-abortion side of the debate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters denied that the legislation would prevent abortion foes from 
staging peaceful protests outside clinics and said the need for the measure was 
underscored by a sharp rise in serious attacks aimed at abortion providers last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 These included several acts of arson, one bombing and the murder in March last 
year of an abortion doctor in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Differences honestly held, though deeply in conflict, cannot be allowed to 
violate the rights of others," Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.) said in support 
of the measure. "My right to swing my arm ends at your nose." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which President Clinton is expected to sign as soon as the Senate 
acts, imposes penalties of up to 18 months in jail for people who use force or 
the threat of force to injure or otherwise prevent anyone from entering an 
abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiffer sentences, ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment, would be 
imposed in the event of serious bodily injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress had approved slightly different versions of the 
legislation last November. A compromise version then was worked out by Senate 
and House negotiators and sent back for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The House originally passed legislation that contained tougher penalties than 
the Senate version. House negotiators in the conference committee agreed to a 
Senate provision that would exempt from the new federal penalties parents who 
try to prevent their teen-age children from obtaining abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups hailed the result as the most significant piece of abortion 
rights legislation to win approval in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help us fight clinic violence and, most importantly, provide 
jurisdiction for the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate acts of 
clinic violence," Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal said.

GUN BILL APPROVAL ENRAGES MANY VALLEY FIREARMS ENTHUSIASTS 
</P>

<P>
 San Fernando Valley gun enthusiasts said they were shocked, scared for their 
safety and disappointed by the House of Representatives passage of a bill 
banning assault weapons Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shane Wehunt, 28, of Lancaster, did not just talk about his outrage, he 
took action. Even though he was on crutches -- the result of a recent sports 
accident -- he drove to North Hollywood to pay a visit to one of the most 
prominent gun shops in the area, B & B Sales. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered an Auto Ordnance brand .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, among 
those that would be banned if the bill becomes law, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that I want to be able to give to my children," said Wehunt, 
who already owns four rifles, which he said he collects for target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just taking our rights away," he said. "First, it was the seat belt 
law, and then it was the helmet law and now this." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the gun lobby's nemeses -- state Sen. David A. Roberti -- took action 
too. He called a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by signs reading, "Roberti: The Man Who Banned Assault Weapons," 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) commended the House for "standing up to the gun lobby." 
</P>
<P>
 "This recent attempt to block a ban on assault weapons failed miserably 
because the state and the nation are tired of seeing kids and cops mowed down," 
Roberti said at the news conference at Burbank Airport shortly after he arrived 
on a flight from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, author of the state's controversial 1989 ban on assault weapons, 
easily fought off a recall campaign last month that had been funded largely by 
gun lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When some nut gets a hold of one of these guns . . . the potency of these 
weapons is so enormous that when someone uses one, the tragedy is enormous," 
Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Kahn, owner of the B & B Sales gun shop in North Hollywood, disagreed. 
The ban, he said, simply disarms the law-abiding public and does nothing to 
prevent criminals from acquiring more powerful weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding and aiming a Benelli semiautomatic rifle -- also targeted by the ban 
-- Kahn said he resents that the gun is grouped with assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "An assault weapon is a machine gun that is fully automatic," he said. "To 
shoot these guns you have to pull the trigger for each round. That is not an 
assault rifle. It's just a bunch of B.S." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the ban would prohibit more than 200 different makes and models of 
guns now on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will hurt business in the long run," said Kahn, who has been in the gun 
business for 25 years. "It will increase the value of the product in stock, but 
I will end up with fewer employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn said most of his customers are upset about the ban, which is virtually 
assured of becoming law as part of broader crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think they are being sold out and a lot of guys aren't going to give up 
their firearms," he said. "There is going to be a whole new brand of outlaws by 
this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdinand Aguinaldo, 29, of Glendale came into the shop. He said that after he 
had been assaulted and robbed of his cellular phone in West Los Angeles two 
months ago, he bought a Beretta pistol for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to B & B Thursday to purchase a type of high-capacity magazine for the 
gun that would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The ban) worries me because it will be hard to defend myself against people 
who have higher-powered weapons," Aguinaldo said, looking at a 15-round 
magazine. "There is no guarantee that they won't have more bullets than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all customers at B & B believed they needed an assault rifle to defend 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not really interested in those types of guns," said first-time gun buyer 
Jaime Moran, 36, of San Fernando, who was shopping for a revolver with his 
10-year-old son, Jimmy. "I want to get a gun for my wife for protection."

 When asked if the new ban would stop the public from using the outlawed guns, 
Kahn replied: "A man just came in and bought 150 30-round magazines. What does 
that tell you?"

NEWS ANALYSIS; CAN-DO PRESIDENT UNDER A CAN'T-WIN CHARACTER CLOUD; PERFORMANCE: 
CLINTON'S POLICY ACHIEVEMENTS ARE HIS BEST WEAPONS AGAINST QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
PRIVATE ETHICS. BUT THE PAST KEEPS INTRUDING ON THE PRESENT. 
</P>

<P>
 On the floor of the House of Representatives and in the clerk's office of the 
Little Rock federal courthouse, Thursday was a day that encapsulated the 
central reality of Bill Clinton's presidency: It is becoming a race between his 
achievements in Washington and his past in Arkansas.  
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Clinton won a narrow but dramatic vote to ban the sale and 
manufacture of assault weapons, a signal victory over one of the most fearsome 
lobbies in Washington. In Little Rock, meantime, a throng of 100 reporters 
awaited the filing of a lawsuit by a former Arkansas state employee who has 
publicly accused Clinton of sexually harassing her during his tenure as 
governor -- a suit that her attorneys indicated they will file this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The House vote highlighted Clinton's strongest claim on the public: his 
success at moving key elements of his domestic agenda into law, despite the 
intense opposition of such powerful foes as the National Rifle Assn., which 
went all-out against the assault weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The incipient lawsuit, on the other hand, underscores the apparently 
inexorable accumulation of questions about his character and ethics which 
represent the gravest threat to the President's public standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, events 1,000 miles apart on a single day framed the question that may 
ultimately settle Clinton's political fate: Will the voters' verdict on him 
turn on assessments of his private character or his public actions? 
</P>
<P>
 Across the political spectrum, few analysts are certain how voters will answer 
that question in 1996. But there is broad agreement that Clinton's best hope of 
overcoming the persistent doubts about his character lies in continuing to deal 
successfully with the problems that Americans want government to address. 
</P>
<P>
 "If achievement isn't the answer to the questions about his character," says 
Democratic pollster Alan Secrest, "then there is no answer." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Secrest and others note, questions about Clinton's character and 
record appear to be bound together in intimate complexity. In different ways, 
both supporters and critics argue that Clinton's record on public issues 
reveals as much about his private character as the accusations about his 
personal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing arguments made by presidential candidate Gary Hart after he faced 
accusations of marital infidelity in 1987, Clinton's supporters maintain that 
he demonstrates his character by taking on tough fights and winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing you can do is to keep proving your character by delivering on 
the things you promised in the campaign," says Paul Begala, a White House 
political adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 That contention clearly carries some weight with many voters. When Clinton 
wins legislative fights, it forces into focus the personal characteristics 
voters like best about him: his empathy, doggedness and commitment to 
confronting difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens by pulling off major legislative victories is it shows his 
effectiveness, and the sense that he is doing something about the agenda people 
care about," says Democratic pollster Peter Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 But while those sentiments can offset the deeper anxieties about Clinton's 
character that are rooted in questions about his past, they appear incapable of 
erasing them. In a poll Hart conducted for NBC and the Wall Street Journal this 
week, 64% of those surveyed said that they were only somewhat or not at all 
confident that Clinton had "the right set of personal characteristics to be 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is far from the first President to be dogged by allegations of 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as historian Arthur M. Schlesinger recently noted, Clinton may be the 
first to have his presidency so clouded by allegations concerning behavior that 
preceded his tenure in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Some allegations arising from the Whitewater controversy concern the White 
House response to charges of wrongdoing. But the vast majority of questions 
about the Whitewater real estate investment surround actions by Clinton and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during their years in Arkansas. Mrs. 
Clinton's controversial commodities trading also took place about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Paula Jones, a former employee of the Arkansas Industrial Development 
Commission, accuses Clinton of making an improper sexual advance in 1991 -- 
more than a year before he won the presidency. Clinton aides have flatly denied 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 People do not entirely shed their past when they ascend to national office: 
Spiro T. Agnew was forced to resign as vice president in 1973 in the face of 
evidence that he accepted kickbacks stemming from his previous government 
service in Maryland during the 1960s. But generally, there was less enthusiasm 
in the past than there is now about excavating a President's actions before he 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about Harry Truman and the Pendergast machine or Lyndon Johnson and his 
radio and television properties," says Robert Dallek, a presidential historian 
at UCLA. "In the past, once the President got into office there's been a 
tendency to pull a curtain down over his earlier career." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's narrow legislative victory on assault weapons was another brick in 
the wall his advisers are trying to build against the seemingly relentless tide 
of questions about the past. But they understand that if, as expected, Jones 
files her lawsuit today, those waves will grow higher -- and the need for new 
bricks will be more urgent.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 'WON'T BE LONG,' CLINTON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Selection of a new Supreme Court justice to replace the retiring Harry A. 
Blackmun "won't be long," President Clinton said Thursday, as aides predicted 
that the announcement would come early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As has usually been the case, Clinton's selection process has taken somewhat 
longer than his aides had predicted. Shortly after Blackmun announced his 
resignation last month, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler told reporters that 
a decision would be made before the end of April. But since then, White House 
officials have told reporters that Clinton feels "no time pressure" on the 
selection as he continues to mull over a short list of prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one or two other things going on here, but we're working on it," 
Clinton told reporters after a White House event designed to drum up support 
for legislation banning some assault weapons. "We're spending a good deal of 
time on it. It won't be long." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about one leading candidate, federal appeals court Judge Richard S. 
Arnold of Arkansas, Clinton offered warm praise. He also sought to counter 
those who argue against selecting Arnold because the Administration already has 
too many Arkansas appointees, several of whom have been involved in politically 
embarrassing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any American would expect someone to be disqualified because 
they happen to come from my state," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he was first in his class at Harvard and Yale, he's the chief judge 
of the 8th Circuit and he's been head of the appellate judges association," he 
said. "So I don't think anyone would question -- it would be difficult to find, 
just on terms of those raw qualifications, an appellate judge with equal or 
superior qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton decides not to appoint Arnold, he has several other candidates on 
his list, including federal appeals court Judge Amalya Kearse of New York, who 
is black, and federal district Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut, who would 
be the first Latino nominee for the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.

THE CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM EXAMS: A GROWING FUROR; TEST'S METHOD 
GETS STUDENTS TALKING -- AND THINKING; EDUCATION: UNLIKE MOST EXAMS, CLAS RULES 
PERMIT SHARING OF ANSWERS AND OPINIONS. DESPITE INITIAL NERVOUSNESS, SOME SOUTH 
GATE EIGHTH-GRADERS EVEN CALL IT FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The routine at South Gate Middle School was a shambles: longer classes, fewer 
periods, a sense of dread. On select classroom doors, hot-pink flyers announced 
the reason: CLAS Test, Do Not Disturb. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind one of those doors, 31 eighth-graders tore open the secret envelopes 
and pulled out the booklets, preparing to put their reading and writing skills 
to the test in one of the most rigorous standardized exams they have ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in Bungalow 719 are the 1994 graduates of the California Learning 
Assessment System, year two. Since April, as many as 1 million California 
students have been hunching over their desks answering questions the likes of 
which they have not seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only remnants of past standardized tests were the No. 2 pencils and 
the teacher's instruction to "please clear your desks." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids talked and laughed during one portion of the test. At times they shared 
their work, even copied from each other. They got to use notes as they wrote an 
essay. When they finished, most looked invigorated, not bedraggled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of fun. In a way, it was pretty easy," said Vanessa Garcia, 13. 
"But you have to think a lot when you do this test. It makes you a little 
nervous, but at least it's not boring like other tests." 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of their reading and writing test, which spanned about eight 
hours over four days, the buzz in the classroom wasn't about the essay at hand 
but about another daunting test later in the day: the physical education final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gotta run the mile today," said Colber Lopez, 13. "Everyone's pretty 
nervous. We have to do our personal best." 
</P>
<P>
 At the sound of the 8:04 a.m. bell, before the test began, teacher Mark 
Lawrence, a nine-year veteran of eighth-grade English, shut the door and 
silenced his chattering students, all from the working-class town of South 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he said, the class would work for 45 minutes in groups, discussing 
readings from the previous day. One student in each group would have to 
volunteer to be the discussion leader and make sure that everyone contributed 
and that the discussion stuck to the reading topic.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to take notes because you will be able to look at them later," 
Lawrence read from the instruction manual.  
</P>
<P>
 Once in their groups, the students murmured, yawned and looked uncomfortable 
and a bit lost over how to proceed. To refresh their memories, they were 
permitted to refer to the stories they had read. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we do?" asked one boy. "OK, so what do you remember most?" read one 
girl. "Nothing," quipped a boy. The group chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, the leader in another group introduced a question: "What 
don't you understand about the story?" One girl came up with a short answer and 
everyone wrote it down. A boy copied the sentence from another's answer 
booklet. These exchanges are perfectly acceptable under CLAS test rules. 
</P>
<P>
 As the students moved through the test, at first they were met with questions 
asking them to interpret the stories they read -- to describe relationships 
between characters and also give their own feelings about the story.  
</P>
<P>
 The goal is not only to test the students' general understanding of the story 
they read, but to gauge their critical thinking and ability to connect the 
passages to their own experiences. It was clear in Bungalow 719 that even 
understanding a few of the questions was difficult for some students. 
</P>
<P>
 Up shot one boy's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are impressions?" he asked Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence said they are thoughts or ideas. Another hand shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's an excerpt?" another student asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of earshot of his students, Lawrence said other classes have asked the 
meaning of excerpt. "That's not a common word for junior highers," he said. 
"It's not our kids' fault for not knowing that. It's a fault in the test 
design." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hand darted up and a boy asked if ice cream "is separate or together 
as a word?" Lawrence wouldn't answer that one. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes into the group work, discussions became animated -- loud 
talk, laughter, occasional gestures to amplify a point. One group described 
what it felt were the important moments in the story, another discussed the 
relationship between two characters in the reading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final discussion exercise, one group was asked to list some things that 
lead to conflicts between parents and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boyfriends," said one girl, prompting giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do your parents know you have a boyfriend?" another asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, mine comes to my house," said a third. "They know him real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Another girl appeared amazed at this revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents would hang up the phone when my boyfriend calls," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group leader interrupted the conversation, asking what this had to do with 
their test. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one girl announced an idea that everyone scribbled down in their 
booklets: "Parents and kids need to communicate better." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence ended the discussions in the 45th minute, stopping students cold in 
the middle of their now-lively conversations. Most were smiling. After all, 
they did just get to spend an entire period talking. 
</P>
<P>
 The class spent the next 45 minutes putting their pencils to the paper, 
churning out the final writing exercise. Some instructions called for students 
to speculate on an issue, others to write an autobiographical statement or 
solve a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy finished in seven minutes, closed his book and put his head down to 
nap. Most finished in about half an hour. One boy wrote feverishly to the 
bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience in Bungalow 719 appears to have been a textbook example of how 
the CLAS test is supposed to work, said Jill Wilson, one of the State 
Department of Education's architects of the reading and writing exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to talk about problems and solutions, it helps if it is in a 
domain they are familiar with," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the exam, many students gave rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't boring like other tests," said Ronny Rivas, 14. "You get to share 
thoughts and opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to the essay, the writing came easier than it usually does to 
13-year-old Michelle Lorenzana. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work with other people and get all their opinions, you have more 
ideas to help you write," she said. "I think I did OK."

WHITE HOUSE TO GIVE FISKE ALL FILES ON FOSTER; WHITEWATER: SPECIAL COUNSEL IS 
SAID TO BE FOCUSING ON ACTIONS OF CLINTON AIDES IN AFTERMATH OF DEATH. SUBPOENA 
ALSO INCLUDES EX-AIDE NUSSBAUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House agreed Thursday to turn over to Whitewater special counsel 
Robert B. Fiske Jr. all of its documents connected to Vincent Foster, the 
deputy White House counsel whose death last July has been ruled a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy White House Counsel Joel Klein said that he believes Fiske now is 
investigating the actions of White House officials, including then-White House 
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, in the aftermath of Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein told reporters that he believes Fiske, who has a broad mandate to 
investigate the Whitewater scandal and related incidents, already has completed 
his investigation into Foster's death and has agreed with the U.S. Park Police 
that it was, in fact, a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive subpoena received by the White House on Thursday covers all 
documents, memos, computer disks and any paging device or beeper used by Foster 
or related materials held by his assistant, Deborah Gorham. It also asks for 
documents relating to Foster that may have been kept in a safe in Nussbaum's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein made it clear that he believes Fiske wants the documents as part of a 
review that "deals with the distribution of Mr. Foster's files by Nussbaum." 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy has swirled around the actions of Nussbaum and other White House 
officials since it was revealed that White House officials had removed files 
from Foster's office shortly after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have raised questions about a search of Foster's office on the 
night of his death conducted by Nussbaum and White House officials Margaret A. 
William, the First Lady's chief of staff, and Patsy Thomasson, a longtime 
Clinton associate. Secret Service officials secured Foster's office the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2 1/2-hour session that took place two days after the death raised concerns 
as well. At that time, Nussbaum sorted through his deputy's papers in the 
presence of officials from the U.S. Park Police, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the Justice Department. Nussbaum sorted the documents into 
three piles -- files related to official government business, Foster's private 
papers and the Clintons' personal documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House later turned over Foster's personal materials to his family 
attorney, Jim Hamilton, and the Clintons' papers, including documents related 
to Whitewater, to the Clintons' attorney, David Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall has since turned over Whitewater-related documents to Fiske's office 
but has not yet received a broader order covering all the Clinton personal 
papers given to him after Foster's death. Hamilton refused to comment Thursday 
when asked if he had received a new subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's actions during the investigation of Foster's death brought 
allegations that the White House was trying to hold back relevant information 
from law enforcement investigators, charges that the White House denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum resigned under fire in March. Klein said that all of Nussbaum's files 
are still at the White House and that relevant materials from them would be 
turned over to Fiske. It is not known, however, if Nussbaum will receive a 
separate subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster was a close friend of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. He handled some of their personal legal affairs, including the sale of 
their interest in Whitewater Development Corp., the failed Ozarks real estate 
venture that is at the heart of the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said that "there is nothing in the subpoena suggesting that (Fiske) is 
looking at the question of Foster's suicide." He added that "I believe the 
forensic evidence on Foster's suicide has been dealt with separately." 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Police conducted the initial investigation after Foster's body was 
found in a park in Virginia outside Washington. The White House has strenuously 
denied unsubstantiated, but widely circulated, rumors that Foster may have been 
murdered.

SENATE MOVES TO CURB GIFTS FROM LOBBYISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, in an election-year effort to refurbish the image of Congress, 
paved the way Thursday for sweeping reform legislation that would ban most 
gifts, meals, entertainment and trips paid by lobbyists and other special 
interests.  
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 59 to 39, senators beat back an amendment by Sens. Mitch 
McConnell (R-Ky.) and J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) to water down a near-total 
ban on gifts by allowing lawmakers to accept free meals from lobbyists and 
gifts totaling less than $150. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakening amendment mainly drew support from Republicans and conservative 
Democrats who claimed that the far-reaching restrictions would be degrading to 
honest members. But Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chief sponsor of the ban, said 
that drastic measures are needed to correct "a lack of public confidence" in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said that the Levin-sponsored proposal was the strictest 
gift-reform measure ever approved by either house and it could severely alter 
the dining, night life and traveling habits of many lawmakers. Members and 
their staffs would be barred from accepting almost anything from lobbyists 
unless they were verifiable longtime friends or relatives acting in an 
unofficial capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Levin bill had contained a $20 limit on meals and other gifts 
that lawmakers could accept from non-lobbyists. But senators voted, 90 to 3, to 
drop that exemption on an amendment offered by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect was to place non-lobbyists as well as lobbyists in the same 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 Final action on the gifts issue by the Senate is not expected until next 
Wednesday. The measure then would go to a joint Senate-House conference 
committee, which must consider it along with a similar but slightly less 
restrictive bill passed by the House in March. The House-passed bill generally 
bars benefits from lobbyists but allows some controversial practices to 
continue, such as free travel to charity golf tournaments and free meals from 
lobbyists' clients.  
</P>
<P>
 Senate debate focused on the public's perception of Congress, with Levin 
declaring that "people believe we are simply too cozy with paid lobbyists." 
Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), a supporter of Levin's bill, urged his 
colleagues to "deal with that perception out in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to free meals and entertainment provided by lobbyists, Wellstone 
asked: "Why do we need that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) said that the benefits furnished by 
lobbyists and other special interests give them extraordinary access to 
lawmakers. "Ordinary folks will never be able to spend a weekend on the beach 
with their congressman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the theory that most frowned-upon "wining and dining" takes place in 
Washington, the measure generally would allow members to accept meals and 
entertainment from business people or other constituents in their home states, 
as long as the gifts are not from a registered lobbyist. 
</P>

 And members could accept some trips if the travel were related to official 
duties and did not include free recreational activities, proponents said. Trip

 "We have to deal with perceptions -- a perception that we are somehow not to

ROSTENKOWSKI CHARGES COMPILED

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. has sent to the Justice Department an outline of 
proposed charges against House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) in the House post office investigation, sources said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder may seek a grand jury indictment of Rostenkowski as early as the end of 
this month, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe of the House post office was expanded last year to include 
allegations that Rostenkowski misused his official accounts for postage, 
personnel, office supplies, leased cars and office space in his Chicago 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who previously has denied wrongdoing, said Thursday night he had 
no knowledge of the latest development. "I didn't have any idea," he said.

LAWMAKERS PROTESTING HAITIAN REPATRIATION ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three members of Congress were arrested Thursday in front of the White House 
in a protest against the U.S. policy of forcibly returning Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps.Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), Alcee L. Hastings (D-Fla.) and Nydia M. 
Velazquez (D-N.Y.) were handcuffed and taken into custody for refusing a police 
order to move. They were later released. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were protesting the U.S. policy of forcibly returning Haitians who 
flee their homeland by sea, a policy that President Clinton earlier had said he 
wanted to change but ultimately embraced to stem the flow of refugees to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this Administration has dragged its feet," Waters said. "The 
people continue to die. They continue to take to the high seas, and we're here 
to say we're prepared . . . to go to jail in defiance of this Administration's 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said U.S. policy had not changed 
toward returning the refugees. She said the policy was directed at changing 
circumstances within Haiti to make the conditions there livable. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said this week that he could not rule out the use of force against 
Haiti's military rulers if new economic sanctions fail to persuade them to 
allow the return of the country's democratically elected president, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, black activist Randall Robinson was in the 24th day of a hunger 
strike against Clinton's Haiti policy. He was taken to a local hospital 
Wednesday to combat severe dehydration.

FIRE VICTIMS STUNNED BY ARSON ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It just couldn't be true: Firefighters?  
</P>
<P>
 That was the stunned reaction among Malibu fire victims to reports that two 
area firefighters are suspected of setting last fall's destructive blaze -- one 
more confusing twist thrust upon residents who have spent the past six months 
trying to put their lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to see these people caught because of the devastation. But, my 
God, not firemen," said Mike Caggiano, a onetime City Council member whose 
rented home on Big Rock Drive was burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they're innocent," Caggiano said. "It would devastate the public trust 
in a profession where trust is so important. . . . It would overshadow the 
bravery (of other firefighters) at a time when they should be honored." 
</P>
<P>
 The men, Steven R. Shelp, 29, and Nicholas A. Durepo, 24, are suspected by 
investigators of having set the fire in order to put it out and be treated as 
heroes. The men have said they were merely driving past when they spotted the 
fire and stopped to fight it with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
 For dislocated Malibu residents still getting used to living in cramped 
converted garages or staying with friends, the news loosed a flood of anger, 
tempered by a desire to give the suspects the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are innocent until proved guilty," said Madelyn Glickfeld, a state 
coastal commissioner whose Las Flores Canyon home was burned. "It's beyond my 
comprehension that a firefighter could have chosen to put this many people 
through this much pain. . . . My better side hopes that maybe these are the 
wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials have long attributed the fire to arson, Paul Mantee, an actor 
and writer who lost his home in Las Flores Canyon, said he had been in "total 
denial." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to think about compounding the disaster with an arsonist," he 
said. "I chose to believe that it just sort of started. Until today." 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard the news, "I got sick to my stomach," Mantee said. "I just took 
it viscerally." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents first heard the news from a television reporter during a weekly 
get-together of victims Wednesday night, as rolling cameras captured their 
reactions. Some shook their heads in disbelief. A few cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shocking it would be firefighters. But I'm not ready to jump to 
conclusions yet," said Arnold York, a Malibu newspaper publisher who lost his 
hillside home and later founded Operation Recovery, the support group where 
residents get rebuilding tips and cry on each other's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Activist Susan Shaw, who lives with Mantee, fled the group's meeting after 
hearing the news, rather than stay to hear a city building official talk about 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went outside and cried," Shaw said. "The whole conversation about 
rebuilding seemed so ludicrous in light of the information." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents wondered why authorities have not charged the two men, while 
others groped for a way to match investigators' suspicions with televised 
videotape of the pair helping victims during the opening hours of the four-day 
blaze, which killed three people and caused more than $375 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to reconcile what the Sheriff's Department is saying and what you 
see," York said of the footage. "It's hard to believe they might have set the 
fire. . . . It's irrational."

NEW SPECIES OF DINOSAUR FOUND FOSSILIZED NEAR SOUTH POLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fossilized remains found within 400 miles of the South Pole belong to a new 
genus of dinosaur whose most distinctive feature is a bony crest rising above 
its brow, paleontologists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinosaur, officially named Cryolophosaurus ellioti, or "frozen crested 
reptile," most closely resembles the allosaurus dinosaur common to North 
America, a two-legged creature similar to the tyrannosaurs featured in the 
popular movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the allosaurus, make it a little smaller and put a crest on it and 
there you have it," said William Hammer, a paleontologist at Augustana College 
in Rock Island, Ill.  
</P>
<P>
 The dinosaur, about 30 feet long, represents both a new genus and a new 
species that roamed Antarctica in the Jurassic period some 200 million years 
ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large, curved crest was grooved, at least 10 inches high, and somewhat 
resembled an ornamental hair comb. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by two small horns, the comb probably was not strong enough to use as 
a weapon, but rather served much like a peacock's tail, as a way to attract the 
opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said the fossils give additional credence to the continental drift 
theory, which holds that Antarctica, Australia, Africa, and parts of South 
America were once part of a single land mass referred to as Gondwanaland that 
later broke apart.

HEALTH CENTERS OFFER FREE IMMUNIZATIONS FOR TODDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free toddler immunization clinics will be held this month at Los Angeles 
County health centers, where vaccinations are provided by the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The immunization clinics are part of a local and nationwide effort to protect 
children from contagious and potentially fatal illnesses such as measles.The 
May immunization campaign is especially aimed at toddlers because vaccination 
rates nationwide drop off sharply after the first year of life. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey in Los Angeles found that toddlers, on average, are six to 12 months 
overdue in receiving immunizations required during the second year of life, and 
that some children do not get them until they enter school. Many parents don't 
realize that toddlers need shots to complete the immunizing effect of 
vaccination given during the first year of life, according to Dr. Laurene 
Mascola, the health department's chief of communicable disease control. 
</P>
<P>
 To schedule an immunization appointment, parents can call their local county 
health center or 1-800-427-8700. Assistance is provided in English and Spanish.

DANA PARSONS: TOLLWAY AGENCY MAY PAY PRICE FOR BYPASSING THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've got to hand it to an agency that can, even temporarily, make political 
bedfellows of conservative Assemblyman Gil Ferguson and county 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, that is the magic act that the county tollway agency has pulled off, 
turning one of its strongest supporters in Ferguson into just another of its 
antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Ferguson still supports the controversial San Joaquin Hills tollway but 
he's leading the charge against putting tollbooths on Newport Coast Drive, the 
scenic six-mile thoroughfare that now connects Coast Highway with MacArthur 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin would merge with Newport Coast a couple miles south of 
MacArthur, and to continue north drivers would have to pay a toll. Ferguson and 
his constituents fear that drivers will avoid the toll and clog Coast Highway 
in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson says he would be satisfied if the Transportation Corridor Agency 
conducts public hearings and, ideally, relocates the booths. Tollway officials 
have said they won't do that because the plans have always called for tolls on 
a part of Newport Coast Drive and that's how the overall project was sold to 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they thought longtime friend Ferguson would go away. "There are so many 
people saying, 'Gil, what the hell is 50 cents?' It isn't a matter of 50 
cents," Ferguson said. "They (agency officials) didn't do what the law required 
or what ethics would require, even if the law didn't require it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials have been adamant about saying the plans have always shown 
that Newport Coast Drive eventually would be part tollway. They say residents 
may not have zeroed in on it because of other controversies surrounding the San 
Joaquin project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson and a phalanx of Corona del Mar residents are equally insistent that 
the tollway agency buried the information because they knew it would add even 
more public controversy and make bond-selling to help finance the project more 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, many of those opposing the local toll support the San Joaquin 
project. Further, they're loath to suggest their actions may undercut the 
project, although some are openly considering suing the corridor agency to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Councilman Phil Sansone, another corridor supporter but who's as 
angry as Ferguson about the Newport Coast Drive toll, says their opposition 
isn't hurting the overall project. "I don't see it," he said. But when asked 
how and where the agency would make up for lost revenue if the Newport Coast 
Drive toll were scuttled, he said, "I'm not concerned about how they make up 
the revenue. What I'm concerned about is that they were not upfront about the 
revenue." Referring to suggestions his efforts might hurt the overall project, 
he added, "That's the corridor agency propaganda. The fact is they were not 
upfront on the issue and that's what's got everyone pissed off." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, over in environmental circles, they're trying not to gloat too much 
over Ferguson's onslaught against his onetime soul mates. Carolyn Wood, 
president of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, said her opinion is that if the 
Newport Coast Drive toll is eliminated, "the whole concept of this has 
changed." It could lead to downsizing the overall project, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the unlikely coalitions forming -- at least on paper -- she said, "Of 
course, anything is possible. The one thing all the groups have in common is 
they don't think the process is being followed properly. I know people have 
been talking to each other, and I've met a lot of people I didn't know before." 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked Ferguson on Thursday how he feels about cuddling up with the 
environmentalists who want to kill the entire tollway, he chuckled. "The irony 
hasn't escaped me," he said, noting that he supported and even introduced some 
of the legislation leading to the tollway construction, believing it crucial to 
relieve South County overcrowding. As a former member of a building trades 
association, Ferguson also has fought with and sued environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is that I just saw a flyer that the anti-growth people put out 
saying what a wonderful person I am," he said. "I've always been the last guy 
on their totem pole as to what a bad guy I am." 
</P>
<P>
 So, I asked, why are you doing it? "It's sort of like the guy who's in the 
swamp with alligators up to his rear end and he turns to his friend and says, 
'Honest to God, I just came in here to drain the swamp.' " Ferguson contends 
both county officials and tollway officials haven't been forthcoming and "I 
came away determined people were going to at least be heard someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 A prediction? "There will be a corridor," Ferguson said. "There will be a 
tollway. It will connect with the Corona del Mar Freeway. Things will get 
better. But I also predict the public will prevail in this (Newport Coast Drive 
toll). It's too blatant for them not to."

FEDERAL GRANT TO AID ELDERLY VICTIMS OF EARTHQUAKE; SERVICES: AGENCIES WILL USE 
THE $7 MILLION TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF SENIOR CITIZENS, INCLUDING 
HOUSING, FOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Earthquake relief workers who aid the elderly were jubilant Thursday after 
learning that a $7-million federal grant is on the way to Southern California 
to keep alive financially strapped programs for senior citizens victimized by 
the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful," said Lynn Bayer, director of the Los Angeles County Agency 
on Aging. "This is the first time that we've had (earthquake relief) money 
that's specifically designated for the elderly." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal money comes just in time, Bayer said, and will allow relief 
agencies to pay for services already delivered and continue programs until June 
30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the devastating quake struck on Jan. 17, programs administered by public 
and private agencies have helped about 25,000 senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been telling our projects to hold on because the money is coming," she 
said. "But we've been slowing down a little, fearing the money wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will allow us to go forward with some confidence," Bayer continued, 
"because we haven't been doing really intense outreach work for fear that we 
would find more needs than we could ever fill." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief programs for the elderly include cleanup work, relocation, assistance 
in filing federal aid forms and counseling. Day care and respite for families 
with elderly parents are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was announced by Fernando Torres-Gil, assistant secretary for aging 
of the Department of Health and Human Services, during a City Hall news 
conference hosted by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and attended by Robert 
Martinez, head of the California Department of Aging. "Older persons are too 
easily overlooked," said Torres-Gil, "and their needs tend to take more work 
and can last much longer because they are the most vulnerable of our citizens 
during times of earthquakes and other disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 The money, granted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is 
expected to be available within 10 days and is earmarked for the aid of elderly 
quake victims in the city and county of Los Angeles and in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the planned 18 months of relief work for senior citizens is 
$9 million, most of which will be covered by the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, agencies such as the Valley Interfaith Council, 
the Department of Recreation and Parks and the Organization for the Needs of 
the Elderly will receive portions of the award, according to Ann Delorise 
Smith, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the money will end up outside the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the Valley will receive a sizable amount, other areas were 
damaged and those seniors in those areas will also be benefiting," said Smith, 
noting that people in such areas of Los Angeles as West Adams were also victims 
of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the award will be greeted warmly by members of the Robert M. Wilkerson 
Multipurpose Senior Citizens Center on Vanalden Avenue and Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, which forced the center's closure, services and classes 
previously offered to the facility's 5,000 members have been scattered 
throughout the community. Meals and some exercise classes are held at a senior 
citizens center in Canoga Park. Other classes have been held at local parks and 
churches.  
</P>
<P>
 The center is expected to open at the end of this month or early next month, 
said Jill Kaplan, project director for the Wilkerson Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to going back," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The special needs of older people during a disaster became glaringly evident 
shortly after the quake. While other victims flocked to Valley parks for food, 
water and shelter, many seniors lacked transportation or were too frail to 
venture out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our seniors weren't there," Kaplan said. "We had a task force to go look for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 They were often found in quake-damaged homes and in shelters, sometimes with 
no way of getting medication or fulfilling other needs such as obtaining 
bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got them meals, water, whatever we could to help them survive," Kaplan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, the need for some services has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a mental health program and that has doubled," she said. "People that 
were mentally healthy before were totally shaken up and need our services." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is to get 9% of the grant, Bayer said. The rest will be divided 
between Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles. The county will receive 
35% of the remainder and the city, where most of the quake damage occurred, 
will get 65%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the grant money will help relief workers find housing for senior 
citizens who are trying to return to the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the seniors are coming back, especially to the Valley," Smith said, 
"and some won't be coming back to anything."

A VICTORY ON CINCO DE MAYO; COMMEMORATION: COUNCILMAN RICHARD ALARCON SUCCEEDS 
IN RELATING SIGNIFICANCE OF MEXICAN CELEBRATION TO YOUNG SYLMAR STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the uphill battle a ragtag Mexican army faced against a much larger, 
better-equipped French army 132 years ago, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon on Thursday had the tough task of trying to explain the significance of 
Cinco de Mayo to a group of noisy, fidgety elementary school kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the small Mexican army in 1862, Alarcon also scored a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was pretty good," said Omar Nevarez, 8, of Sylmar, one of about 
three dozen students from Hubbard Street and Sylmar elementary schools who 
attended the celebration at Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were paying attention," said Alarcon, whose 7th District 
includes Sylmar and most of the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The event at Mission College was one of many planned through this weekend to 
commemorate the Battle of Puebla, in which 2,000 poorly armed Mexican soldiers 
defeated 6,000 French soldiers on May 5, 1862. The battle was only a minor 
setback for the French -- who within the year captured Mexico City -- but the 
victory served as a rallying point for Mexico's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration of Cinco de Mayo is more popular in the United States than in 
Mexico, primarily because it was embraced by Chicano student activists in the 
late 1960s as a symbol of their struggle for civil rights. The students also 
focused on Cinco de Mayo because it falls late in the school year, which 
allowed them more time to plan a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, a free celebration with music and dancers will be held at Valley 
College's Monarch Hall in Van Nuys. On Saturday, a celebration with food, 
entertainment and prizes will be held at the San Fernando Mall on San Fernando 
Road from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's celebration at Mission College also featured a six-man group called 
Nazca, which played Andean music. The children stared intently as the rhythmic 
sounds of flutes, guitars and drums filled the small room on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon preceded the musical group, and most of the youngsters were more 
intent on eating lunch than listening to a politician discuss a subject to 
which they couldn't relate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon -- who at one point looked down directly in front of him and told 
two children not to fight over a bag of Cheetos -- slowly worked the crowd to 
get his message across. He started by telling them that at one time no one 
thought Mission College would be built in the northeast Valley because 
officials didn't believe it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we proved that we could make it happen and make it an important place 
that we use," Alarcon said as the children sipped milk and chomped apples. 
"Don't let anybody tell you you don't (care about) education." 
</P>
<P>
 He then asked the children if they enjoy going to movie theaters, and where 
those theaters are located. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Panorama City," said one boy. Another child mentioned Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "And why don't we have a movie theater here?" Alarcon asked, having captured 
the attention of most of the children. Alarcon answered his own question, 
telling them it is because business owners do not want to invest in an area 
where there are gang problems and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," Alarcon said, building to his message for the students, "just like the 
Mexican army in Puebla, if you all stand together, you can get what you want. 
If you promise to get rid of graffiti and not get involved in gangs, I think we 
can get a movie theater here." 
</P>
<P>
 The children applauded, and Alarcon got his victory.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; 135 BUILDINGS TO BE DEMOLISHED DUE TO QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting further damage from aftershocks and an inability on the part of 
owners to repair their buildings, about 135 of the 154 red-tagged structures in 
San Fernando will have to be demolished, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks whacked a few of them worse, and a lot of the people don't 
have the money to rebuild," said Jim Eldridge of DGA Consultants, an 
engineering firm hired by the city to perform and process building inspections. 
"Also, a lot of the damaged buildings are 70 to 80 years old, and it doesn't 
make sense to repair an 80-year-old building." 
</P>
<P>
 The 154 red-tagged structures include 53 businesses, or about 6% of those in 
the city, and 198 residential units, or about 3% of the total, according to an 
updated damage assessment report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report estimates the cost of structural damage at $48.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales tax is San Fernando's largest source of revenue, Councilman 
Doude Wysbeek said the city will not suffer greatly from the loss of 
businesses. "Most of these businesses will come back," he said. "There will be 
a temporary loss of revenue, but the (San Fernando) Chamber of Commerce tells 
me it will not be that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the buildings red-tagged is the San Fernando courthouse, which brought 
many people into the city. Many of the city's businesses have reported being 
severely affected by the courthouse's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest severely damaged structure, a 17,000-square-foot office building 
at 451 S. Brand Blvd., has already been demolished. The Northeast Valley Health 
Corp., a health care provider which also has offices in Van Nuys, was the 
building's main tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the number of buildings to be demolished keep rising. Initial 
estimates done in February found only 21 structures needed to be demolished, 
but an updated assessment in April found that 53 buildings needed to be razed, 
and 66 had been knocked down as of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always under the assumption that any building could be fixed," said 
Howard Miura, San Fernando's Planning and Community Development director. "But 
some were so damaged that we recommended demolition." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers have conducted 2,367 building inspections in San Fernando since the 
quake. In addition to the 154 red-tagged structures, 145 buildings housing 215 
residential units and 30 businesses have been yellow-tagged, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the rebuilding process, the City Council voted in March to waive 
all construction permit fees for repairs that began within 45 days after Jan. 
17, half of the fees for work that begins between 46 and 90 days, and 
one-fourth of the fees for work that begins within 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already issued 292 building permits, at a cost of $82,875. It 
expects to be reimbursed the total amount by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; FAMILY CARE CENTER GRANT IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Valley Family Care Center in Sun Valley was denied a $400,000 state 
grant for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a blow to all of us," said Diane Agliam, principal of Glenwood 
Elementary School, one of four schools in Sun Valley and North Hollywood that 
have worked two years to set up the center.The center offers counseling 
services for parents in low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a grieving process we're going through," Agliam said of the 
news that the center would not get the funding it had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The center received a $50,000 planning grant from the state last year, and had 
expanded with volunteer help and the support of local agencies such as the 
United Way, North Hollywood Rotary Club and Valley Community Clinic. Counseling 
sessions were started and a dental chair was donated to the center from the 
Rotary Club, which was also arranging for dentists to volunteer time at the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone as far as we could without additional money," Agliam said. The 
$400,000 would have been used to create a parenting center and renovate two 
bungalows at Glenwood, turning them into medical clinics for immunizations, 
screenings and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the counseling program will continue using classroom space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now going to have to put a lot of energy into chasing money instead of 
providing services," said Ann Britt, chairwoman of the center's board of 
directors. The center will focus on getting private donations and corporate 
sponsors. The center serves parents of students at Glenwood, Roscoe Elementary 
School in Sun Valley, and Camilla and Arminta elementary schools in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so much depending on that grant," Agliam said. "It was to have 
provided our students and our families with the . . . services that are so 
desperately needed." ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SCHOOL'S FAMILIES PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven Glendale families have graduated from the Families and Schools Together 
program, for families with children who have behavioral problems or who weren't 
working at their academic ability, said John Poplawski, Los Angeles County's 
supervising deputy probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos School program, which encourages parents to spend time with their 
children to prevent kids from joining gangs, abusing alcohol and dropping out 
of school was successful in its first year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program requires a collaborative effort among parents, school personnel 
and counselors. It originated in Milwaukee and is in place in 100 schools 
throughout the nation, said Donna Domroy, a grant writer with Glendale Family 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Family Services worked with the Glendale Unified School District, the 
United Way, and the Los Angeles County Probation Department to bring the 
program to Cerritos School.  
</P>
<P>
 After school administrators identify at-risk children, a team of school 
personnel, mental health and drug abuse specialists and parents contacts these 
students' parents and invites them to group meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 At eight weekly meetings, parents have dinner with other parents and are 
encouraged to spend 15 minutes a day playing with their child. 
</P>
<P>
 Playtime is suggested because children tend to disrupt class if they do not 
get enough attention at home, Domroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 If parents and elementary schoolchildren are taught to communicate with each 
other and with school officials it will help children be more productive and 
prevent problems from occurring later on, Poplawski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the program's focus is delinquency prevention -- if we keep kids in 
school and support them, the chances are they won't be committing crimes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings also involve presentations on drug and alcohol abuse and games 
between the families and their children, Poplawski said. There are monthly 
follow-up sessions with parents for several years after they graduate from the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to take another group of Cerritos School parents through the 
program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Family Services has applied for several grants to expand the program 
to another Glendale elementary school. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; LIBRARY REPAIRS WILL AFFECT PIERCE SESSION

 Los Angeles Pierce College summer school will start two weeks ahead of 
schedule to accommodate repairs to the school library caused by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer session will start on June 13, instead of June 27, and end on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction, which is scheduled to take four weeks, will begin as soon as 
summer session is over, and be completed by the beginning of the fall semester. 
The library will remain open throughout the summer session, and will be closed 
during the four-week construction period only. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce President Mary E. Lee said the school decided to repair the library 
after the summer session because temperatures are lower in June than in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, summer school was almost canceled because of budget difficulties, 
but was reinstated after students complained. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; JEWISH CENTERS FORM COMBINED DAY CAMP

 "We're on the road to recovery," said Selma Sladek, marketing associate of the 
West Valley Jewish Community Center in West Hills, which sustained extensive 
water damage during the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 While the JCC building remains closed while the interior is being repaired, 
all services and programs are operating at other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators of the JCC are worried that the public doesn't realize the 
center is still functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in trailers; we're in alternate facilities. We didn't go to sleep," 
said Sladek, who is especially concerned about the JCC's upcoming Jewish day 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The center cannot hold its summer camp in the temporary facilities, so it has 
joined with Jewish community centers in Simi Valley and the north San Fernando 
Valley to form a giant Camp Valley Chai, to be held at the North Valley Jewish 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sladek hopes at least 300 to 400 youngsters will be enrolled by June 6. There 
is still space available. Cost for a two-week session begins at $280. 
</P>
<P>
 Sladek said camp organizers have pooled the best staff members and program 
experts of all three Jewish community centers for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Valley Chai has programs for children age 5 and up. An open house will be 
held on May 15 at 10 a.m. at the north Valley center. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCIL OKS HOLDING 1996 ELECTIONS IN 1997

<P>
 To avoid conflict with the California presidential primary, the Calabasas City 
Council gave preliminary approval this week to holding the city's elections 11 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 If finally approved, the April 9, 1996, city election will be moved to March 
4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The change of election dates would add 11 months to the council members' 
present terms. Final approval of the switch will be considered May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation moving California's 
presidential primary from June, 1996, to March of that year in an attempt to 
give the state's voters more clout in the selection of presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 That change would complicate the efforts of Calabasas officials to borrow 
election booths and other equipment in time for the city balloting in early 
April. KURT PITZER

 Neighbor-Helping-Neighbor, a citywide earthquake survival program, has been 
launched by the city of Los Angeles and the Governor's Office of Emergency 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood program is a self-help, community-based earthquake 
preparedness plan which shows neighbors how to pool their efforts in a major 
earthquake.The Neighbor-Helping-Neighbor program suggests that communities hold 
gatherings before a quake hits and assign committees to be responsible for 
search and rescue, first aid and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is designed so that neighbors can plan and prepare to survive a 
disaster together," said Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the City Council's 
Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson put together the program after he saw how neighbors came to each 
other's aid after the Northridge earthquake.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA; EXPANSION OF WORSHIP HOUSE DRAWS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of an Agoura neighborhood want to halt the expansion of a Jewish 
worship house, saying they fear it will drive down property values and alter 
the quaint nature of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to lower our property values in the long run," said neighbor 
Arlene Fishstein. "It's just an inappropriate spot for that type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For about the last year, members of Chabad of the Conejo Valley, a 
conservative sect of Hasidic Jews, have used the 1,700-square-foot house on 
Conifer Street as a place to pray and conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 They submitted plans March 23 for a 1,300-square-foot expansion that included 
a second story and a small parking lot in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes would have required a parking variance and zone change from the 
Ventura County Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council at first recommended the plan be 
approved, but reversed itself when neighbors protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they had been given the impression that the expansion was to be 
more limited than the submitted plans showed. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease neighbors and ensure approval, Chabad on Monday eliminated the 
parking lot from its plans and expanded the house by about the same 1,300 
square feet, but built out instead of up, eliminating the second story, said 
Nancy Francis, manager of residential land use for the Planning Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The current plan no longer requires a variance or zone change, according to 
senior planner Ron Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since neighbors complained, Chabad must now apply for a 
conditional-use permit to hold religious meetings in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say they still don't approve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost any sort of goodwill they had by doing it on the sly," said David 
Winstone, who lives across the street from the Chabad house. The group "said 
one thing, did another," Winstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad Rabbi Moshe Bryski declined to comment, saying he wanted to let the 
issue die and to repair relations with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad member Ron Ressner said Bryski "didn't really think it was going to be 
the issue it was," and had no intention of trying to make changes behind 
residents' backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad is a conservative sect of Judaism that concentrates much of its energy 
on social and educational programs, as well as bringing non-practicing members 
of the faith back into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors are worried that if Chabad makes its desired changes, the 
building could not be sold in the future as a home, and instead may become a 
commercial site. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the planning division, we're concerned that it (the neighborhood) not lose 
its residential character," Francis said. The latest proposal is undergoing a 
30-day review by the Planning Department. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PRAYER DISCUSSED AT RELIGIOUS GATHERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney active in religious liberty issues told the 21st annual San 
Fernando Valley Prayer Breakfast on Thursday that the freedom to pray in public 
settings is much better established in law than most people realize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've swallowed the line that prayer, even silent prayer, is to be kept in 
the closet," said Brad W. Dacus of Sacramento, western regional coordinator of 
the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal-defense agency based in 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Dacus spoke to more than 400 people attending the breakfast at Sportsmen's 
Lodge as part of the National Day of Prayer, designated by Congress in 1988 as 
the first Thursday in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar breakfasts were held in Glendale, La Crescenta, Palmdale and 
Lancaster, among other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing examples of legal prayer in California, Dacus said government meetings 
may be opened with prayer and civic officials may pray at private meetings as 
long as they are not standing on a podium with a city's seal visible (implying 
government endorsement). Also, "if governments open public buildings for other 
groups, they may not exclude religious groups" from using the facilities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith groups, however, are sometimes asked to not be "too religious" in such 
settings, Dacus said. Unwarranted restrictions often come about, Dacus 
asserted, because "religious discrimination is rampant in the country right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 After reading Scripture for the breakfast meeting, Matthew K. Fong of the 
State Board of Equalization, a Republican aspirant for the state treasurer's 
post, drew cheers from the audience when he spoke of his desire to "bring the 
opportunity to pray in schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Organized classroom prayer in public schools, barred by U.S. Supreme Court 
rulings, is supported by most boosters of National Day of Prayer observances 
but opposed by religious leaders who favor church-state separation. JOHN DART

 An organization dedicated to forcing deadbeat parents to pay child support 
will help shed some light on the issue with a candlelight vigil May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Chapter of the Assn. for Children for Enforcement 
Support (ACES) will join chapters around the country in the eighth annual 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando chapter holds monthly meetings, offers counseling for 
families needing help and lobbies state and federal agencies to step up 
enforcement of child support laws.

 The organization also offers a toll-free number for people needing 
information. Callers can request a 15-page booklet that lists state laws on 
child support enforcement and gives information on how to deal with the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are in need of the services the most can't hire a private 
attorney," said Geraldine Jensen, founder and national president of ACES. "The 
object is to empower people to be able to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Through October of last year, the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office handled 369,860 delinquent child support payment cases. Of that number, 
they had collected in 42,529 cases or about 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen blames poor leadership, a lack of staff and incompetence for the 
county's collection rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the average parent, (the district attorney's office) is a major obstacle 
in the road to collecting child support payments," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be well-prepared and know your legal rights and you need to be 
persistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, about 19 million children are entitled to support and are owed 
more than $34 billion in unpaid child support, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Allred, attorney and child support advocate, will be a guest speaker at 
the vigil at the district attorney's office in Encino. TERESA ANN WILLIS

GOP CANDIDATES FOR BEILENSON SEAT SPLIT ON GUN BAN, ABORTION PROTESTS; FORUM: 
BUT THE TRIO ALSO SHOWS A GREAT DEAL OF UNANIMITY ON SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL 
ISSUES DURING A DEBATE IN WOODLAND HILLS. 
</P>

<P>
 The same day U. S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) was voting 
Thursday for an assault-weapons ban and for making it a federal crime to block 
access to abortion clinics, three GOP candidates seeking his job in the 24th 
Congressional District were splitting over how they would have voted on the 
same issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their remarks at a candidates' forum sponsored by United We Stand 
America, the Ross Perot group, GOP candidates Richard Sybert, Mark Boos Benhard 
and Robert Hammer also showed a great deal of unanimity on several federal 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 All three favored term limits for congressional lawmakers, supported the 
repeal of language in the U. S. Constitution that automatically grants 
citizenship to people born in the United States of illegal immigrants, backed a 
balanced budget amendment and were gravely skeptical of President Clinton's 
health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Such positions drew strong applause from the audience of about 100 local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also joining the three at the United We Stand forum were candidates Scott 
Gaulke, a Democrat, John Koehler, a Libertarian, and Rhett Wooden, an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who declined to appear, saying he would not attend primary election 
debates, is virtually assured of winning the Democratic nomination in the June 
7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican nomination is a tougher affair, with several relatively 
well-financed and active candidates in the running. In addition to the three at 
Thursday's event, Emery Shane, a realtor, and businessman Sang Korman are also 
in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's forum at Parkman Junior High School in Woodland Hills came against 
a backdrop of the controversial votes being cast only hours earlier in 
Washington, by Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson joined the House majority to support a measure to ban 19 
military-style, semiautomatic weapons. The measure was approved by the 
narrowest of margins, 216 to 214, meaning that a change of one vote would have 
killed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Beilenson voted to make it a federal crime to block access 
to abortion clinics, a measure prompted by recent anti-abortion protesters' 
attempts to blockade clinics. A first-time conviction for blocking access to 
the clinics without violence would carry a maximum fine of $10,000 and six 
months in jail, a second conviction a $25,000 fine and one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson had previously backed even stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's forum, Benhard staked out the most conservative position, 
telling the audience that he opposed any ban on assault weapons. "People are 
kidding themselves if they think banning assault weapons will solve the crime 
problem," Benhard told a cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard also said he opposed singling out abortion protesters for a new 
federal law and would thus have voted against the measure to make such protests 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hammer said he too would have opposed the assault weapons ban while 
Sybert took the opposite tack. "I was impressed by the testimony of the police 
chiefs (who urged the ban)," Sybert said. "No one can feel comfortable that 14- 
and 15-year-olds are riding around with these weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 On making it a federal crime to block access to abortion clinics, Sybert said 
that while he was pro-choice he was "concerned about discriminating against 
pro-life persons in the exercise of their 1st Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hammer, who is pro-choice but opposes federal funding of abortions, 
said he would support such legislation to ensure "free access to the 
facilities." Of the three at Thursday's forum, Sybert has the best-financed 
campaign, having pumped more than $400,000 of his own money into the race. The 
former Wilson cabinet member has also been endorsed by dozens of local 
Republican elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, who owns a public relations firm and was an aide to former 
Congressman William Dannemeyer, has staked out a position as the most 
conservative candidate on a number of issues and recently won the support of 
the California Republican Assembly, a longtime conservative organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, a banking consultant, has also shown some fund-raising ability as he 
has attempted to establish himself as a moderate Republican who can bring a 
strong business background to managing the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 In balloting after the debate, United We Stand members picked Hammer as their 
favorite with Benhard coming in second and Sybert tying with Wooden for third.

TRIAL ORDERED IN KIDNAPING, SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man was ordered to stand trial Thursday on charges of 
abducting his estranged girlfriend, and then severely beating her with a metal 
rod and sexually assaulting her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most heinous crimes I have ever seen," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Carole Chizever, who has prosecuted criminal cases for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing two days of testimony from the 23-year-old woman, who said she 
was hospitalized for five days due to her injuries, Van Nuys Municipal Judge 
Robert L. Swasey said there was enough evidence to warrant a trial for Michael 
Kyung Lim on five felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim, 19, is charged with kidnaping for sexual purposes, torture, rape, 
forcible oral copulation and corporal injury to a spouse, which also applies to 
girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who recently came from Korea under a student visa, testified that 
she was held against her will at Lim's Owensmouth Avenue apartment from the 
morning of April 2 until he took her to a supermarket the next day. Lim, she 
testified, wanted her to buy food to make him dinner that night, and "he said 
that if I cooked it untastefully I would get hit more," she said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the market, she escaped from Lim by running up to an employee and begging, 
in broken English, for help, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reports at the time said that employees and other shoppers held Lim 
until officers arrived and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 While admitting the woman suffered a severe beating that cannot be justified, 
defense attorney Harland Braun characterized the case as "a garden-variety 
beating between lovers." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified she was beaten on March 19 and April 3. Braun said both 
incidents were the result of jealous rages caused by suspicions that the woman 
was seeing other men.  
</P>
<P>
 "Does it take a rocket scientist to figure out what's going on here?" Braun 
asked Swasey at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a rocket scientist to figure out what's going on in the defendant's 
mind," the judge shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun unsuccessfully argued that everything but the corporal injury charge 
should be dismissed, but he was able to convince Swasey to lower Lim's bail 
from $2 million to $750,000  
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who came to the United States to study at UCLA, testified that 
during the April attack she was struck countless times during a four- to 
five-hour period with a metal rod -- identified by Braun as part of a frame 
from a mirror. She said Lim also used a kitchen knife to cut off most of her 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her testimony, the woman looked away from the defendant's table, 
where Lim quietly sat with a bowed head, dressed in blue jail-issued clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said the April beating occurred after Lim observed two men following his 
car, and one of the men waved to the woman. The lawyer said he believes Lim is 
guilty of an assault, but not torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors disagree. There is a "mean, perverse, sadistic thread" running 
through Lim's behavior, according to Chizever. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim is scheduled to appear in Superior Court for an arraignment May 19.

8 ARE INJURED IN HIT-AND-RUN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hit-and-run driver crashed into a car, injuring its eight occupants, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second car, Eloy Mendoza, 19, of Panorama City, was treated 
for cuts to his forehead and legs at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven others, including a 4-year-old girl, who suffered bruises and complained 
of pain, were treated at local hospitals and released Wednesday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday when the driver of a four-door 
gold Chevrolet Caprice traveling north on Woodley Avenue near Vanowen Steet in 
Van Nuys rear-ended the car carrying the eight occupants and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 The car with eight occupants crashed into the car in front of it. That car 
also left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no suspects late Thursday.

UNMARKED BRIEFCASE BLOWN UP BY POLICE; EXPLOSION: IT WAS MISTAKENLY LEFT BY AN 
OFFICER IN THE VAN NUYS DIVISION PARKING LOT. BUT OFFICIALS FEARED IT MAY HAVE 
CONTAINED A BOMB.

<P>
 The next time you leave your briefcase lying around at a police station, make 
sure it's labeled -- otherwise it just may get blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened Thursday after Sgt. Horace Frank of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Van Nuys Division spotted an unmarked briefcase in the 
station's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous computer messages went out to the squad cars and no one stepped 
forward to claim the nondescript brown case, the LAPD's bomb squad was called 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Two houses in the area and part of the police station were evacuated for more 
than an hour while the three-person bomb squad figured out how to disable the 
briefcase, which was on top of a block wall next to the watch commander's 
parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a special rifle, they shot the case with a specially designed bullet, 
causing it to explode. This is common practice, they said, when suspicious 
objects are found at or near police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat it as if it's an explosive or a bomb," said Lt. Steven Allen, a 
member of the LAPD's bomb squad. "Until we determine it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 But it turned out that the briefcase, now decorated with a hole the size of an 
apple, actually belonged to an LAPD traffic officer who had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it got run over by an RTD bus," said Lt. Winthrop Taylor of the 
Van Nuys station. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not identify the officer because they said he might be 
disciplined for not appropriately labeling his briefcase. All personal 
possessions must bear the officer's name, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. David Twitchell of the Van Nuys station recalled a similar incident last 
Christmas when the bomb squad was called out to investigate a tin can 
discovered sitting on the hood of a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the bomb squad determined the can was harmless and opened it up, 
only to find inside a batch of cookies from neighbors who wanted to show their 
appreciation for two officers who had helped them out. 
</P>
<P>
 That tense situation would have been avoided if the appreciative neighbors had 
simply left a note of thanks, Twitchell said.

MURDER DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER SAYS HER STEPFATHER RAPED AND BEAT HER; COURT: 
NICOLE SAMUELS MOROIANU TESTIFIES SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. 
PROSECUTORS SAY THE MAN'S KILLER WAS HIRED BY HER MOTHER, MARY ELLEN SAMUELS.

<P>
 Nicole Samuels Moroianu's face betrayed no emotion Thursday as she told the 
jury at her mother's murder trial in Superior Court that her stepfather had 
beaten and raped her starting when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu, 24, said she didn't tell anyone for several years, afraid her 
disclosure would break up her parents' marriage. She said she felt embarrassed 
and ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When she finally ended her silence during her sophomore year at Alemany High 
School -- first telling a school counselor whose name she said she couldn't 
recall, then telling friends -- she spoke only about the beatings, Moroianu 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 She told her mother about the alleged sexual abuse in October, 1988, about a 
year after her parents had separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Robert Samuels, a 40-year-old motion picture camera operator 
who had adopted Moroianu as a child, was shot to death inside the house the 
family used to share on Bahama Street in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the killer was hired by Moroianu's mother, Mary Ellen Samuels, 
who inherited about $500,000 when her estranged husband died. Samuels also is 
accused of hiring other killers to do away with the original hit man, James 
Bernstein, a 27-year-old reputed cocaine dealer who had proposed marriage to 
Moroianu a few months before he was strangled in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi says Bernstein was slain because Samuels feared 
he would cooperate with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu says she is testifying "to help my mom," who she professes is 
innocent and has been falsely accused by fair-weather friends. Although 
prosecutors have named Moroianu as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
slayings, Moroianu waived her right not to incriminate herself and took the 
witness stand late Wednesday for her mother's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't no Menendez," defense attorney Phil Nameth said, referring to the 
controversial abuse defense employed by the Beverly Hills brothers in the 
killings of their parents. Instead, he said, Moroianu's allegations of sexual 
abuse provided the motive for Bernstein, driven by love for Moroianu, to kill 
Robert Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 As she described intimate violations by a man she repeatedly referred to as 
"my dad," Moroianu spoke in a monotone and diverted her gaze. Across the 
courtroom, Mary Ellen Samuels dabbed occasionally at her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu testified that Robert Samuels began fondling her when she was 12, and 
raped her eight times between the ages of 13 and 16, when she said she left 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with slapping, she recalled: 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feed the dogs correctly and he slapped me on my face and said, 'Does 
this look good to you? Does this look like something you'd like to eat?' " 
</P>
<P>
 About a week later, she said, he pushed her: "I believe this time it was 
because I wasn't picking up the dogs' bowel movements correctly. He pushed me 
down and he said, 'If you're not going to pick it up the right way, you can eat 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes reddened and filled with tears as she recalled these incidents. But 
after the lunch break, Moroianu seemed emotionally detached as she described 
the eight alleged rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's holding back," defense attorney Nameth said. "She doesn't want to cry 
in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu said her stepfather usually came into her room as she slept, on 
weekends when he had been drinking. Once, she said, he woke her by pouring ice 
over her head, then lifting her by her nightgown. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father also struck her mother when he drank, Moroianu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe her. Bob wasn't that type of person," said Robert Samuels' 
sister, Susan Conroy, who has attended the trial daily. "Like mother, like 
daughter. After all, she is fighting for her mother's life." 
</P>
<P>
 In her testimony, Moroianu also disputed testimony by prosecution witnesses, 
many of them her former high school friends, that she had asked them to find a 
gun and spoke of killing her father. She also denied that she had been involved 
in a plot to steal Samuels' car, so his slaying would look like a carjacking. 
And she denied telling friends that she had altered the death scene to make it 
appear a break-in and struggle had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu will return to the witness stand Monday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRUSTEES WON'T REVERSE CLAS DECISION; 
EDUCATION: ANTELOPE VALLEY BOARD MEETS WITH ATTORNEY AND SAYS IT WILL NOT GIVE 
THE CONTROVERSIAL TEST. STATE HAS SAID IT WOULD SEEK A COURT ORDER.

<P>
 Trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School District stood firm Thursday 
in their defiant stance to not administer the controversial CLAS test, 
virtually ensuring the district will be sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a closed session with the school district's attorney that lasted 
more than two hours Thursday night, board members said they decided against 
reversing their April 20 decision not to give the test. 
</P>
<P>
 After the board's conservative majority voted last month against administering 
the test, the state Department of Education ordered the district to give the 
exam and said it would seek a court order if necessary. The district was given 
until today to tell the Department of Education whether it will reverse its 
decision and administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Praised by its supporters as a revolutionary method of testing critical 
thinking skills of students, the California Learning Assessment System test has 
come under fire amid charges of asking students personal questions and failing 
to measure basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four of the 1,007 school districts in the state, including two in Los 
Angeles County, have decided against administering the 1994 CLAS test despite 
warnings from the Department of Education that the law requires the test be 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Antelope Valley district, the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified 
School District opted last week not to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen state senators last week threatened to seek elimination of 
funding for CLAS in the 1994-95 budget unless three demands are met: 
objectionable questions are removed from the test, local school boards are left 
to decide whether to give the test and a panel of education experts is allowed 
to review the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Antelope Valley board went into closed session state assemblyman 
William J. (Pete) Knight (R -- Palmdale) presented the board with a letter 
signed by 28 members of the Republican Assembly Caucus praising the decision to 
not administer CLAS. Knight also said he has introduced legislation that will 
allow the state legislature to review the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being expected to fund this test, we are responsible for it, but we 
cannot see and cannot review the test," Knight said. "I think that is 
appalling."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HART HIGH DROPS PLAN TO GRADE PORTIONS OF 
STATE ASSESSMENT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of two Santa Clarita Valley schools planning to grade students on portions 
of the controversial California Learning Assessment System test reversed its 
decision Thursday after concerns were raised by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at William S. Hart High School had planned to grade 10th-graders on 
essay and reading comprehension sections of the CLAS test, which students began 
taking this week.But Principal Laurence Strauss said the recent controversy 
about the test made school officials change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing that because of the concern and confusion that is associated with 
the test," he said. "We don't want to add any confusion to the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Hart and Castaic Middle School, which still plans to grade 
eighth-grade students on an essay portion of the test, said they believe that 
students deserve immediate feedback and school credit for taking the five-day 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with CLAS and the State Board of Education said issuing a grade on 
the essay portion of the test is acceptable, but it is uncertain if the reading 
comprehension section can be graded. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss said he has received an unspecified number of calls from concerned 
parents since the school's intention to grade students was made public this 
week, but he said most of the concerns are due to "lack of understanding of the 
contents on the test." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the CLAS test contains questions that challenge authority and 
traditional family values. The test is administered to fourth-, fifth-, eighth- 
and 10th-grade students.

 Narcotics officers found more than they bargained for while searching a 
Palmdale apartment for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a small amount of packaged marijuana, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies discovered a mortar round Wednesday morning in the apartment, in the 
38300 block of 11th Street East, Deputy Patrick Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five people from 16 surrounding apartments were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Division from Edwards Air Force Base, which 
was called in to assist in removing the M-83A1 mortar round, determined 
Thursday that it was a dummy round, said Gary Hatch, base spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the search Wednesday, deputies arrested the apartment tenant, Edward 
Reed, 27, on suspicion of possessing marijuana for sale and possession of a 
destructive device. Reed is being held at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station 
in lieu of $500,000 bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also arrested Monrovia resident Arnold Alegria, 24, on an outstanding 
warrant for receiving stolen property.SHARON MOESER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ROAD TO BE RENAMED FOR SMOKEY BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smokey Bear will celebrate his 50th birthday today by having a road in the 
Angeles National Forest named after him during a celebration at Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The road, about one-tenth of a mile long, will be dedicated at 11 a.m. 
followed by a public ceremony from noon to 2:30 p.m., said John Damann, a fire 
prevention officer with the U. S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The road currently is called Hungry Valley Road, but officials decided to 
rename it because the public was mistaking the Golden State Freeway exit for 
the Hungry Valley Recreation Area several miles to the north in Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Smokey's 50 years old this year, it's being renamed in recognition of 
his 50 years of firefighting prevention," Damann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight signs will be placed along the Golden State Freeway directing motorists 
to the road, Damann added. 
</P>
<P>
 The public can meet the stern critter, best known for the slogan, "Only you 
can prevent forest fires," at the Vista Del Lago visitors' center at the lake, 
about 60 miles north of Downtown Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting equipment and an exhibit depicting Smokey Bear's history will be 
featured. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of a children's Smokey Bear poster contest will also be announced.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 INJURED, FREEWAY CLOSED AFTER 3 BIG RIGS 
COLLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A collision involving three big rig trucks on the Golden State Freeway early 
Thursday injured two drivers, including one suspected of drunk driving, and 
forced the partial closure of the freeway for almost nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 4:05 a.m. on the southbound Golden State Freeway just 
before Lyons Avenue when a truck traveling about 65 m.p.h. ran into the back of 
another truck that had stopped because of road construction, said Sgt. Robert 
Delmese of the California Highway Patrol. A third truck then ran into the first 
two, Delmese said. The middle truck lost its load of empty boxes, which caught 
fire, possibly fueled by 60 to 80 gallons of diesel that spilled from the 
truck, Delmese said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the driver had been trapped in there, he would have been in a lot of 
trouble. . . . His truck was surrounded by fire," said a Los Angeles County 
firefighter at the scene who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Martin Lopez, 24, of Dinuba, Calif., was taken to Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita with major injuries to his face and 
moderate injuries to his back and right knee, said CHP Officer Wendy Moore. His 
truck was badly damaged in the collision and his flatbed trailer was consumed 
by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the third truck, Rogelio Alanis, 28, of Parlier, Calif., was 
arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving and may face further charges 
because he left the accident scene for about three hours, Moore said. Alanis, 
taken to Henry Mayo with moderate injuries, told officials he left the scene to 
make phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the first truck, Carlos Pinheiro, 38, of Inglewood, was not 
injured, and the trailer of his vehicle sustained minor damage, Moore added. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers closed the southbound side of the freeway from 4:20 until 6 a.m. 
before opening one lane to traffic, directing vehicles into a lane that had 
been closed by the California Department of Transportation for repairs, Delmese 
said. All lanes of the freeway were reopened about 1 p.m., although the Lyons 
Avenue off-ramp remained closed until about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter traffic on the Golden State Freeway, slow since the Jan. 17 
earthquake because of a two-lane detour around a damaged bridge, came to a near 
halt and was backed up for miles throughout rush hour. Traffic on the Antelope 
Valley Freeway and other routes leading to the San Fernando Valley was also 
heavy as motorists tried to avoid the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's bad, it's really bad," remarked Al Maas, a salesman driving on the 
Golden State Freeway who said he passes through the detour twice a week. 
"Anything out of the ordinary causes a chain of events around here."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VOTE DELAYED ON SHOPPING CENTER NEAR SANTA 
CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to concerns raised by Santa Clarita officials, the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors delayed voting Thursday on a proposed shopping 
center to consider the need for additional sheriff's deputies there. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to vote June 9 on the Valencia Marketplace project just 
west of the city of Santa Clarita between McBean Parkway and Pico Canyon 
Road.The project, which would be larger than Santa Clarita's 1 1/2-year-old 
regional mall, would be an open-air center anchored by large discount stores 
and supplemented by more than 35 smaller retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jan Heidt told supervisors Thursday that 10 
additional sheriff's deputies would be required to patrol the center, mainly 
because it would contain several ATMs and would be easily accessible from the 
Golden State Freeway. An environmental report on the project states the 
sheriff's station two miles away would be adequate.  
</P>
<P>
 "You should certainly require the developer to pay for the deputies," Heidt 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The board has ordered developers to pay similar fees before, said Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, who represents the area. For instance, the developer of a 
large factory outlet center planned near Gorman agreed last year to pay part 
the cost of a sheriff's patrol as a condition of the project's approval, 
Antonovich said.  
</P>
<P>
 The delay will give county planners the chance to prepare a report on the 
issue and to help settle another dispute over the future configuration of roads 
in the area.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JURY TOLD OF DEFENDANT'S ROLE IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A prosecutor told jurors Thursday that a 23-year-old Lancaster man played a 
key role last year in the slaying of an ATM customer outside a local bank, a 
crime partly recorded by a security camera. 
</P>
<P>
 During her opening statement at the trial of Wesley Dale Harper, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Pamela R. Rogers told the jury that Harper faces a first-degree murder 
charge in the March 5, 1993, slaying, even though another man is believed to 
have fired the fatal shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, Rogers said, "was the person on that morning who drove in his father's 
pickup truck around the Lancaster area, looking for banks, going through 
parking lots where ATMs were (located), looking for victims." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Harper and his passenger, Christopher Arthur Mann, 20, spotted a man 
using an automated teller machine outside a Bank of America branch on Lancaster 
Boulevard. Mann then left the truck, asked the customer to light his cigarette, 
followed the customer back to his car and shot him in the head with a sawed-off 
rifle, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann dragged the ATM customer, Hans Christian Herzog, 44, of Lancaster, from 
the vehicle, she said, and then drove away in Herzog's car as Harper left in 
the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog had made a deposit just before he was shot, but had not withdrawn money 
from the bank machine, she said. His death received widespread attention 
because random slayings are rare in the Antelope Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Mann, who will be tried separately at a later date, is accused of 
pulling the trigger, Harper still can be found guilty of committing 
first-degree murder during a robbery, Rogers said. She said jurors will hear 
evidence that in addition to driving Mann to the bank, Harper provided the 
weapon used in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said jurors would see portions of the shooting incident that 
were captured by a bank security camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's attorney, Edward Consiglio, said he would postpone his opening 
statement until later in the Lancaster Superior Court trial. Harper wore an 
orange Los Angeles County Jail uniform as he sat next to his attorney Thursday, 
showing little emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing last May, a sheriff's investigator testified that 
Harper had told him that he and Mann had been using methamphetamine, a 
stimulant, before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The first witness in Harper's trial, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
William Gordon, described the scene when he arrived at the bank shortly after 
the shooting. "I saw a male adult, lying on his back, with a large pool of 
blood under his head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon testified that he covered Herzog, who was still breathing, with a 
blanket. Paramedics treated Herzog, then took him to Antelope Valley Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays showed that a bullet was lodged inside Herzog's head, the prosecutor 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WORK BEGINS ON QUAKE-DAMAGED VALENCIA LIBRARY; 
RECOVERY: OFFICIALS SAY THE BUILDING COULD BE CLOSED FOR UP TO EIGHT MONTHS TO 
REMOVE ASBESTOS AND RESTORE THE INTERIOR. BRACING WILL BE ADDED. 
</P>

<P>
 Repairs began Thursday on the earthquake-damaged Valencia Library, which will 
be closed for up to eight months as workers tear out much of the building's 
interior to remove asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped to reopen the 24,000-square-foot library, the busiest of 
the county's 87 facilities, within three months after the earthquake ruptured a 
water pipe in the building and damaged one-fourth of the library's 155,000 
publications. But Alan Harsen, head of facilities services for the county's 
libraries, said the asbestos must be removed to meet building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior of the building, at 23743 Valencia Blvd., has been stripped 
nearly bare, except for empty metal bookshelves covered with plastic. The 
carpet and furniture have been removed because of asbestos contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 volunteers and library staff members worked three days after the 
earthquake to remove 80% of the library's books, periodicals and other 
materials, but flooding caused about $750,000 in damage to those items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost quite a few titles simply because they're not in print anymore," 
said Josefina Reyes, community library manager for the branch. Back files of 
magazines and government documents were also destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The asbestos removal is expected to be completed in the next 30 days, after 
which the long process of replacing everything from the carpet to the ceiling 
tiles will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsen said additional bracing and other earthquake safety equipment will be 
installed during the rebuilding. He said bracing installed across the top of 
the bookshelves before the earthquake kept all of the shelves upright and 
prevented more serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Local library employees will work in a trailer next to the building, sorting 
through cartons containing more than 100,000 books to be placed on the shelves. 
But Harsen said reshelving may not start until December and the library 
probably won't be open for six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia branch is the only one of the 38 affected by the earthquake that 
remains closed, Harsen said. Santa Clarita residents are left with two much 
smaller branches in Newhall and Canyon Country, each open three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 A bookmobile and children's story program may be established at a temporary 
site near the Valencia Library, said Evelyn MacMorres, regional administrator 
for the north county libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Library, at 22704 9th St., is open from 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays and 
Wednesdays, and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays. The Canyon Country branch, 18536 
Soledad Canyon Road, is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays, 1 to 8 p.m. on 
Wednesdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays.

 "The water was everywhere, and I thought the boat was going to tip over. 
Everyone was frantic, and that made it so much worse," said Rosary High School 
junior Diane Spillan, describing what happened after a huge wave knocked out a 
large window of a Catalina Cruise ship on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
 She and about 30 other students from the Fullerton school were returning on 
the vessel to Long Beach after their annual three-day trip to Catalina Island 
Marine Institute. About 400 passengers were on board that day when the rough 
water hit; about 15 passengers were injured. Although they were shaken, the 
students from Rosary escaped serious injury.  
</P>
<P>
 "The trip had been very rough, but we had become used to the swaying of the 
boat and were dozing," teacher Josephine Golcher said. "I awoke when I heard 
the wave hit the side of the boat, and I saw it break over the rail. Several of 
our girls were knocked onto the deck, and for several moments we could not go 
to their help." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Spillan after the experience: "I was just glad to step off the boat."

 Under the program, students will be given 15 minutes a day to read books and

 Just what do students of the '90s think about? The Mustang Stampede, the 
student newspaper at Trabuco Hills High School in Mission Viejo, decided to 
find out. 
</P>
<P>
 What is your most valuable asset? "My mind and my heart," said one student. 
"My sense of humor. If I didn't laugh off my stress, I'd go insane," said 
another.

 What will be the state of the world in 200 years? "There won't be a world in

MY TURN: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; LACK OF FAMILIARITY BREEDS RACISM 
AND HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA TUNAC, Nina Tunac is a student at Troy High School in Fullerton, where 
this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oracle.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Superman isn't the only one who could benefit from X-ray vision. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world where people continue to judge each other on the basis of their 
skin color, society might well wish more people had his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Between May 1990 and May 1992, there were 212 incidents of hate crimes in U.S. 
high schools, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many forms of racism, but overt racism is manifested by prejudice 
and some kind of discriminatory act that is usually conscious, says Joseph Liu, 
professor of the Comparative Culture Department at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Caused by ignorance and fear of the unknown, this type of racism is 
perpetuated by stereotypes, according to Mary Ottman, an affirmative action 
specialist at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're afraid of what we don't know. A lot of (racism) has to do with 
stereotypes," Ottman said. "People extrapolate a situation from the media, like 
the riots, and they take those behaviors and apply them to the entire race of 
African Americans. So, in spite of the fact of the small number of people in an 
economically depressed area, we go ahead and apply those behaviors to every 
black we come into contact with." 
</P>
<P>
 Because racism is a learned behavior, children will imitate how their parents 
act toward people and the way they hold themselves around other races, says 
psychologist Justo Corpuz of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a hypothetical world with no outside interference, if you put a black kid, 
a yellow kid, a brown kid and a white kid together, and they grow up without 
anyone else's help, they're not going to know any differences between 
themselves because they don't have any preconceived ideas of racism," Corpuz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know about hating people just because their hair is blond or their 
skin is dark. They're not going to pick on each other because of physical 
attributes; they will probably pick on each other for ideas they don't like. 
They'll show individual differences through their personality, how they think 
and how they create ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An black student at Troy High School in Fullerton said she felt the full 
effects of racism when she attended a wedding with her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five people scrutinized me throughout the whole ceremony and reception," she 
said. "I felt totally out of place because I was black. While I was standing by 
the wedding cake, a friend of Jane's uncle walked straight up to me and said, 
'Why are you here? You're not wanted.' I was so shocked that I couldn't say 
anything. I could feel that all eyes were on me, and when I got home I was so 
upset that I just sat in my room and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know those people, and I've never done any wrong to them," she 
said. "I don't understand why they hate me because of the color of my skin. 
People are human, not colors, and it's sad to think people would judge others 
solely on their appearance. You're not born a racist; you're taught to hate 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to stifle racism, schools need to introduce a course on multicultural 
education as early as first grade, Corpuz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be part of the curriculum to actually be able to accept and 
identify each other as people. As children, you don't have a white person or a 
black person; you're all people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids are playing, it shouldn't be, 'Why don't you go play with that 
blond boy,' " Corpuz said. "When you do that, you're subconsciously 
stereotyping people with their physical attributes. There's an underlying 
element of racism in saying that instead of saying, 'Why don't you go play with 
Jeff,' who is a person that happens to be blond-haired and blue-eyed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Learning about other cultures will significantly reduce racism and promote a 
universal understanding of all peoples, Ottman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to end racism is by fostering individual relationships with 
people from other cultures. Not just race; I'm talking about lifestyle: gays, 
lesbians, bisexuals, religion, age, whether or not you're from Mexico or Puerto 
Rico. People should also share foods and customs with each other, because 
differences aren't bad."

FIGHT MISERY BY KNOWING YOURSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are countless opinions and judgments in reference to Kurt Cobain's 
emotional/psychological difficulties, which ultimately resulted in his death.  
</P>
<P>
 Through all the articles, I see that people (especially teens) feel a certain 
connection with his state of mind, even when they rightfully dismiss suicide as 
an answer.There is a difficulty in putting this abstract connection into focus 
so people can see the connection and not just feel it. A popular refrain in 
such circumstances is, "How could this happen?"  
</P>
<P>
 The following quote is from "Pensees" ("Thoughts") by Blaise Pascal, a 
17th-Century mathematician and philosopher. This suits the Cobain situation 
specifically, as well as answers the inevitable question of how someone with so 
much can be so desperately miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that consoles us from our miseries is diversion. And yet it is 
the greatest of our miseries. For it is that above all which prevents us from 
thinking about ourselves and leads us imperceptibly to our destruction. But for 
that we should be bored, and boredom would drive us to seek some more solid 
means of escape, but diversion passes our time and brings us imperceptibly to 
our death." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important point to be gained from this passage is that everyone, 
especially teens, must discover and come to terms with themselves as 
individuals. When people have a free moment to think about the world and their 
place in it, they become uncomfortable, and many get high to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Please come to understand that diversion is the greatest of our miseries. "Get 
to know yourself and be proud" is the clear lesson to be gained from the 
tragedy that is personified in Kurt Cobain.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A HAUNTING JOURNEY BACK TO AN ERA WHEN DOVES CRIED; GRAND 
DAYS BY FRANK MOORHOUSE ; PANTHEON $24, 592 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edith Berry Campbell, beginning her diplomatic career at the newly formed 
League of Nations in the mid-1920s, has received a letter from one Annie 
Dickinson, founder of an orphanage in Yugoslavia populated by victims of the 
Great War. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickinson wishes the League great success and wants to donate to the 
organization a beautiful, dove-emblazoned chair made by children in the 
orphanage's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edith knows that gifts are problematic for the League, she takes 
matters into her own hands and agrees, through unauthorized correspondence, to 
accept the chair. Edith strongly believes in principles and policies and 
accepted rules of conduct but, as she explains to a colleague when the chair 
arrives in Geneva, exceptions must sometimes be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "That chair has to have a place in our lives or we are living our lives 
wrongly and running this League wrongly," she says. "This chair is a test of us 
all!" 
</P>
<P>
 The chair incident is a minor but emblematic moment in "Grand Days," the first 
volume in the League-based Palais des Nations series produced by Australian 
writer Frank Moorhouse. It would be a striking novel set in any period, 
well-written and peopled with engaging characters, but Moorhouse's choice of 
time frame makes "Grand Days" especially poignant; the hopes and idealism 
expressed in Geneva in the 1920s are shadowed by the reader's knowledge that 
the League of Nations is destined to be a noble failure. 
</P>
<P>
 League representatives acquit themselves splendidly in "Grand Days," its 
admirable heroine Edith prominently among them, yet it's apparent the 
international conflicts that eventually destroyed the organization -- and seem 
to paralyze its successor even today -- are far beyond their powers of control. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake to label "Grand Days" a novel of diplomacy, however, for 
although it touches on international relations, Moorhouse's main interest is in 
personal negotiations of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith, an Australian, is a born diplomat, but what she negotiates in Geneva 
isn't so much seating arrangements and executive statements as the differences 
between individuals. She takes diplomacy personally, and "Grand Days" 
chronicles the various levels of intimacy she seeks, permits and occasionally 
discourages, with friends and co-workers, acquaintances and strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in short, much of Henry James in this novel -- the emphasis on the 
complexities of social interaction, on the overlooked details of life, on the 
clash of manners and cultures. Moorhouse, naturally, is more modern than James 
-- one of Edith's great friends is transsexual -- but also more arch, giving 
"Grand Days" a humor and drollery absent from most of the master's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Like James, too, Moorhouse isn't overly concerned with surface plot. When 
Edith, early in the novel, accepts the gift of a revolver from an odd American 
named Col. Strongbow, the reader expects the gun to reappear at some point; it 
never does, though, for few of the charged, apparently significant incidents in 
"Grand Days" have external consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time these episodes feel like untied loose ends, but eventually one 
senses that Moorhouse (perhaps best known in this country for writing the story 
filmed as "The Coca-Cola Kid") is simply being lifelike -- showing us that 
Edith, whatever risks she takes and whatever mistakes she makes, ultimately 
controls her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as it turns out, others' destinies as well: In the closest thing this 
book has to a turning point, Edith must decide whether to ruin her mentor's 
career by telling superiors that he has communicated unimportant but classified 
League information to his native country. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that "Grand Days" follows an idealistic young woman's rise in a 
cosmopolitan but doomed organization, one expects it to conclude with some 
conspicuous realization. That's not what happens, however -- in part because 
the novel is the first in a series, but also because Edith has enormous 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 She rarely doubts her talents and is so wedded to the League's goal that she 
is perfectly willing to be changed by her experiences there -- to the point of 
admitting unapologetically to herself that she "wanted only to associate with 
people who were robust and undefeated." Edith's cause requires that of her, and 
she regards the loss of old friends, and the seeking of new and more powerful 
ones, as a necessary sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Such willfulness, oddly, only adds to our admiration for Edith, for we know 
her motivations are never selfish -- that her thoughts, words and acts are on 
the same continuum, are directed at the same benevolent end. 
</P>
<P>
 When a suitor repeats to Edith the old joke about the League being the 
"wastepaper basket of the world," she's ready to call off the relationship 
right then . . . but willing to see, too, that "Variations of cynicism were 
perhaps youthful standbys until one of the wisdoms was reached."

DOWN-TO-EARTH BASS PLAYER; JAZZ: KTLA SKYCAM REPORTER JENNIFER YORK REMAINS 
UPBEAT ABOUT HER TWO LOVES, DESPITE THE LONG HOURS. SHE WILL PERFORM ON 
SATURDAY AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL IN IRVINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an old story: Struggling musician works a day job to supplement the 
meager wages earned while playing late-night club dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Jennifer York is no exception. But her day job starts when most 
after-hours jazz clubs are still going strong. She's up at 4:30 a.m., gathering 
her wits and her makeup. She arrives at Van Nuys airport by 5:15 and, by 5:30, 
as the airborne traffic reporter for KTLA Channel 5 News, York, her cameraman 
and the pilot are lifting off in Skycam 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking a little green this morning," says the cameraman as he hits York with 
a spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up till midnight," she counters, teasing her hair and smoothing her 
makeup while unscrambling the traffic information that's pouring into her 
headset. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a spilled load of bicycles on the San Gabriel Freeway, and Skycam 5 
will be there to document the backup. York props a pair of stuffed animals in 
the copter's window, scribbles some notes on her clipboard and turns to face 
the camera mounted in the rear of the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of nights later, York, whose quartet plays Saturday at the Southern 
California Jazz Festival in Irvine, can be found fiddling with her bass amp on 
the tiny bandstand inside Tribeca, a sleek Encino restaurant and watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Her quartet -- with saxophonist Janine Del Arte, drummer Suzanne Morissette 
and pianist Alexandra Casselli -- moves into the familiar strains of "Autumn 
Leaves." Wearing a short blue dress speckled with white polka-dots, she leads 
the way, playing an upright that makes her, although she is tall, seem small. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second set, she switches to electric bass guitar, pounding out the 
rhythmic vamp of Grover Washington Jr.'s "Mr. Magic." During her solo, she 
slaps the strings in the heavyweight style of bassist Marcus Miller (one of her 
heroes), combining rhythmic and melodic elements in a way that causes a knot of 
patrons at the bar to shout their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she's back to the upright for Cedar Walton's Latin-flavored "Bolivia" 
and on to "My Favorite Things," the pleasant ditty from "The Sound of Music" 
that saxophonist John Coltrane developed into his personal declaration of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 York, 31, twists and turns with the beat, obviously deep within the music and 
enjoying herself mightily. By the time the night's last set is finished, 
there's little more than four hours left before her alarm goes off again. 
</P>
<P>
 York's daily schedule would leave most people sleepy-eyed and cranky. But she 
is a whirligig of energy at both ends of the day, bursting with the kind of 
enthusiasm that few bring to a single job, let alone two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love both my jobs," York asserts with such animation that even a cynic 
can't help but believe her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jennifer has more energy than any 10 people I know," said saxophonist Ann 
Patterson, leader of the Maiden Voyage big band that also boasts York as its 
bassist. "She's so serious about her playing. There's no way that she's 
depending on her visibility in television to get by on the bandstand. She's 
working very hard to become a great musician." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 York is equally dedicated to her broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Her clear-headed reports during last year's Laguna and Malibu fires, coming on 
days that often found her working 18 hours without a break, helped her team 
earn an Emmy nomination for live coverage of an unscheduled news event. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent death of her cousin in a freeway accident, she said, emphasized to 
her "how important it is to remind people to drive safely, because a lot of 
them out there aren't paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The divergent paths York follows are a result of both conscious effort and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I tripped and fell into this job," she said of reporting. "I 
consider myself a bass player first, but I love doing newscasting. I can't 
imagine my life without both." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Covina, York grew up in Hemet and began playing the piano when she was 
5. She was attracted to an electric bass in the seventh grade because "it 
looked just like the one Paul McCartney played." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep up both piano and bass for a while, but bass finally won out. 
It was rare to see a girl play bass, and it felt really special to me. It's a 
very rhythmic instrument, very percussive and melodic, and I found I could 
combine both those aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her high-school experiences in Hemet were particularly important, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I would have done without music in high school. The 
relationships that were established there were very special, and we could 
really bond on band trips. It kept me out of trouble too because all my time 
was spent in band." 
</P>
<P>
 But York gave up the bass when she moved on to attend UCLA to get a degree in 
political science. Broadcasting became her goal. She went to New York in 1984 
for an internship with ABC and "Good Morning, America," a stint that she turned 
into a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working with Joel Siegel, who was an incredible inspiration for me, 
he's such a perfectionist. We worked 12- and 16-hour days, and I learned a lot 
about the importance of discipline," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years in New York, she joined the staff of a Hackensack, N.J., 
radio station as its promotions director. It was there where she realized how 
much she missed being involved with music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Christian station, and there was a lot of music there, and I met a 
lot of Christian entertainers. And I liked what they represented and what their 
songs said. It's as if God inspired me to come back to California and play bass 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1987 she returned to the Golden State, enrolled at the Musician's 
Institute in North Hollywood and waited tables at Jerry's Deli. She was quickly 
hired to play in an all-female band at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe I got the gig," she said. "I had left the bass for eight 
years and had truly forgotten how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney job allowed her to support herself as a musician. But when the gig 
ended after a year, things changed. "That's when reality hit. I didn't know 
that you might need a day job other than playing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She parlayed her broadcasting experience into a position as traffic reporter 
for KFWB-AM (980), becoming its airborne reporter in 1989. Her schedule called 
for her to be in the air between 6 and 10 a.m., and again from 3:30 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she kept plugging away at her music career, playing in the 
pop band Smart Cookies and, later, the Christian band Rachel Rachel, which 
recorded on the Epic Records subsidiary, Word Records. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was also developing a new love: jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a fan of Weather Report and (its bassist) Jaco Pastorious and I 
thought playing 'Birdland' like him would be the greatest. In 1987, I went to a 
Chick Corea concert in San Diego and totally fell in love with (the playing of 
Corea bassist) John Patitucci. I'll never forget that concert. It totally 
freaked me out, and I thought, my gosh, that's what I have to do the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 York left Rachel Rachel in 1992 to pursue the upright bass, studying with 
respected bassist John Clayton, composer and co-leader of the Clayton-Hamilton 
Jazz Orchestra. That same year she was hired by KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, York works the occasional club date -- she can be found every Wednesday 
at Tribeca and Sundays at Amazon in Encino -- and she does casuals and plays 
with Patterson's Maiden Voyage. Her husband of less than a year, Nils Johnson, 
is also a bassist who travels with the Ray Charles Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 She's anxious to get a CD out with her quartet and travel the world playing 
jazz festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group's only been together six months, and it's been such an enjoyable 
ride for us. Things are really starting to open up." 
</P>
<P>
 But her broadcasting career is also important. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Tesh is a great role model for me," she said. "He does his TV show 
during the week, then tours with his band on the weekends. He's made both 
broadcasting and music work together." 
</P>
<P>
 So has Jennifer York. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jennifer York Quartet appears Saturday at 1:15 p.m. on Stage B, at the 
Southern California Jazz Festival, Koll Center, MacArthur Boulevard at Main 
Street, Irvine. The festival begins today at 5 and continues through Sunday. 
$10 per day or $25 for a weekend pass. (714) 645-1999.

O.C. THEATRE / JAN HERMAN; SCR CONTEST ENDS, MAY BECOME BIENNIAL EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa is quietly ringing down the curtain on 
annual operation of the California Playwrights Competition after its six-year 
run as one of the nation's most lucrative contests for unproduced scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide contest, which was designed to encourage emerging writers and to 
find new plays for possible production at SCR, could survive as a biennial 
event if funds are found to underwrite it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motivation is primarily economic," SCR literary manager John Glore said 
Wednesday. "But quite honestly it isn't just an economic decision. We feel that 
in six years the contest has achieved what it set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Glore, who headed the contest with SCR dramaturge Jerry Patch, said "we wanted 
to make the writers in the state aware of us. We wanted them to send us their 
work. We now have a list of 2,000 writers. By going biennial with the contest, 
which is our intention at this point, we feel we'll still be serving that 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to curtail the contest does not represent a retreat from new 
plays by unproduced writers, Glore said, maintaining that SCR will continue to 
read unsolicited manuscripts from California residents as part of "an open 
submissions policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988 the theater has awarded 15 playwrights a total of $55,000 in prize 
money from $150,000 in grants provided by the American Express Co. (the rest of 
the money went to administration of the program). The grants ended this year. 
The annual first prize was $5,000; lesser amounts went to runners-up.  
</P>
<P>
 SCR initially raised $174,000, including a $43,500 matching grant from the 
California Arts Council, to launch the contest in tandem with an annual play 
festival that presented some of the early prize-winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival ended in 1990, however, largely due to its high cost of operation 
and its drain on the theater's manpower resources. Both the literary department 
and the technical staff faced logistic problems each time the festival rolled 
around in spring because of the clash between short production deadlines and 
the lengthy process of script rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unpredictability of the schedule also contributed to the festival's demise 
because the sales department could not tell subscribers early enough in the 
season what plays they could expect to see, thus posing a threat to 
subscription income. 
</P>
<P>
 But the contest itself continued to operate, drawing almost 300 scripts a year 
from throughout the state. All first- and second-prize winners were given 
public readings. A few winners went on to full production as part of SCR's 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To date, SCR has produced seven scripts obtained through the contest -- two on 
the Mainstage and five on the Second Stage. (Of the two that reached the 
Mainstage -- "Once in Arden" in 1990 and "Pirates" in 1991 -- the former had to 
be withdrawn from the contest after being declared a finalist. It turned out to 
have been written by a part-time SCR staffer, Richard Hellesen, who had 
submitted it under a pseudonym.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Pirates," which won the 1989 contest, was the most recent first-prize winner 
to be produced. "Noah Johnson Had a Whore," the 1990 second-prize winner, was 
the last to be staged (it was a Second Stage production in 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of productions developed from winning scripts in recent seasons would 
seem to suggest that SCR has little to gain by keeping the contest as an annual 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the trend could be reversed by the latest first-prize script, 
"Green Icebergs," a comedy of manners that won the 1993 contest. It was given a 
reading Monday on the Mainstage, and the theater is expected to decide by the 
end of the month whether to produce it next season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patch has said that SCR is "bullish" on the play. Glore also touts it highly. 
Moreover, SCR producing artistic director David Emmes chose to direct the 
reading himself, a sign that he may be leaning toward a production. It is Emmes 
who ultimately decides, with artistic director Martin Benson, what gets 
produced at SCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the reading, "Green Icebergs" author Cecilia Fannon was snapped up 
by Artists and Writers, a major talent agency, on the strength of that script 
and others she has written, including her 1992 second-prize script "To 
Distraction."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: SIT DOWN FOR 8 LONG HOURS OF 'STAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes patience to survive Stephen King's occasionally creepy miniseries on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us love a good scare. And Stephen King has such a well-earned 
reputation for fright writing that dramatizations of even his less grisly 
novels raise expectations of exquisite horror. Such is the case with his latest 
television venture, which starts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Be prepared not to be scared, though. Or even to be stimulated. "The Stand" is 
for viewers with time on their hands. Lots of it. And for viewers with 
patience. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when a miniseries is usually defined as anything longer than a sound 
bite, it's encouraging, in one sense, to see ABC offer the genuine article by 
spreading eight hours of King across four evenings. Yet "The Stand" is the 
sprawl that crawls, a wildly tossed salad of mysticism slowly sinking in its 
own weird juices. Despite its creepshow pretensions, much of it is flat-out 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 King wrote the teleplay based on his own 1978 bestseller, which was reissued 
in 1990 with more than 500 pages that had been cut from the original. He starts 
with a bang: An accident at a government lab in California turns lose a 
super-flu virus that spreads swiftly, killing almost everyone in the United 
States and turning their bodies into pulpy messes. Sniff or cough, you're 
history. So just like that, director Mick Garris strews America with rotting 
corpses whose heads are oozing, scabby puddings. Not pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas-masked military moves in, ruthlessly imposing martial law and carting 
off some victims of the epidemic to be coldly studied by scientists wearing 
goofy, poofy, flu-proof lab suits that make them look like big green Barneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, not everyone is stricken, and exactly why is never explained. The 
relatively few who are immune have little in common except for having the same 
puzzling dream while sleeping: A 106-year-old Miss Jane Pittman look-alike 
named Mother Abagail (Ruby Dee) sits on her creaky front porch in rural 
Nebraska quoting the Good Book and singing "What a friend we have in Jesus" 
opposite a cornfield prowled by a stringy haired demon of a man named Randall 
Flagg (Jamey Sheridan), no relation to Fannie. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that both the all-seeing, all-knowing Mother Abagail and the 
nasty Flagg (whose eyes glow in the dark and whose face and voice turn Freddie 
Kruegerish when he gets teed off) actually exist, and King makes them 
pointpersons for good and evil, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 The story's good survivors -- played by Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Ossie 
Davis, Rob Lowe, Bill Fagerbakke, Adam Storke and Ray Walston -- converge on 
Mother Abagail's house and, later, on a "free zone" in Boulder, Colo. Evil 
survivors -- played by Miguel Ferrer, Matt Frewer, Laura San Giacomo and Corin 
Nemec -- become disciples of Flagg, who uses his thugs, terrorist tactics and 
evil magic to take over Las Vegas, where he becomes even bigger than Wayne 
Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 As she's about to check out, meanwhile, Mother Abagail has some heavy advice 
for her own guys on how to take on Satan: "Be true, stand !" This is meaningful 
to them, and four of her followers immediately "go forth" from Boulder to 
confront Flagg and his leather-jacketed lounge lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 Inconsistencies abound here. Sinise's earnest leader and other prominent 
members of the good camp conveniently have psychic visions only when it serves 
the script. Otherwise they're in the dark. And Flagg's own powers appear to 
come and go as if his batteries needed recharging. He's such a stud in bed that 
he turns his girlfriend's hair white during just one carnal encounter, yet he 
can't stop her from the ultimate betrayal. Having furniture-throwing snits like 
Bobcat Goldthwait did on "The Arsenio Hall Show," moreover, he can turn someone 
he doesn't like into an electric fizz merely by pointing a finger. On other 
occasions, though, his wattage appears to dim and he has to have his henchmen 
do his dirty work for him. And, finally, he seems to know everything his 
potential foes are doing all the time, only to falter when the plot orders up 
his comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when "The Stand" is enjoyable, most of them related to the 
dark humor that King invests in the sadistic, grinning, taunting Flagg, who at 
one point cites the surgeon general's report regarding the dangers of drinking 
while pregnant and excuses "those of you with small children" from watching a 
public execution. Sheridan has fun with Flagg, and is a good physical choice. 
His face all points, he could almost impale himself on his own chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, though, "The Stand" is a jagged hodgepodge that rarely makes much 
sense even when you accept its plot holes, disconnections and scene-by-scene 
convolution and try to focus on its big picture. Whatever that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin Peaksian in his clutter, King is like an old-fashioned cook who puts in a 
pinch of this, a pinch of that. He uses an ever-present crow to symbolize 
badness. His good survivors come together on their yellow brick road to 
Nebraska and Colorado like Dorothy and her fellow travelers in "The Wizard of 
Oz." He has a love triangle. He has spies and counterspies. He has more male 
bonding than you get in a beer commercial. He has Lowe's sensitive character, 
who can neither hear nor talk, relating to the hulking Fagerbakke's dullard 
like George and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men." 
</P>
<P>
 He has just about everyone in here but Siegfried & Roy. He has Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar as a babbling, placard-carrying doomsday prophet. He has a bit 
part for director John Landis, and another for himself as a good survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, you keep waiting for the world to end. More importantly, for this 
miniseries to end. Afterward, you may still be unclear about what "The Stand" 
stood for. King has metaphors galore. Flagg could be the Prince of Darkness, 
Rush Limbaugh or Tom and Roseanne. The lethal flu could be AIDS or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had to identify the most significant message in "The Stand," though, it 
would be this: Avoid Los Vegas at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Stand" airs 9-11 p.m. on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday on ABC 
(Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

ALONE, AMAZED AND A MUSE; AWAY FROM THE BAND, KRISTIN HERSH SURPRISES HERSELF 
WITH ACOUSTIC ACCLAIM AND RAW HONESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristin Hersh has made one of the year's most acclaimed acoustic albums, but 
don't expect the 27-year-old singer and songwriter to toss her band -- Throwing 
Muses -- for an unplugged solo career. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark-haired mother of two shudders at the idea of becoming an acoustic pop 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do appreciate this (attention), but the band is home to me," she says. "I 
like the smell of stale beer and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat, often jocular Hersh has garnered respect from rock's underground 
since the early '80s through Throwing Muses' surreal pop sound. On her own in 
the acoustic "Hips and Makers," her first step outside the Muses, she exposes 
her raw talent in spare numbers with little ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are nevertheless intense, with Hersh's throaty-then-airy voice 
dipping in and out of the unassuming guitar work. Her lyrics often are biting 
and painful, with sarcasm hidden in seemingly sweet moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which features Michael Stipe on one track, is being supported with 
a solo tour that includes a stop tonight at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mean for it to be a solo album," says Hersh, who recorded it in a 
horse barn down the street from her home in Newport, R.I. It was done in three 
days with producer Lenny Kaye, guitarist with the groundbreaking Patti Smith 
Group in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to record the songs I'd written after falling in love with the 
acoustic guitar on the road with the Muses. I would bring it to my hotel room 
every night and play. The simplicity and physicality of that instrument invited 
very intimate, small and gutsy songs, which I was really attracted to. But as 
far as I knew, people at large only listened to big, glossy pop music. This was 
little, raw and weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking her new material on the road without the comfort of a full band proved 
unnerving for Hersh at first. "I was terrified! The thought of having people 
sit and stare at me for an hour and a half sounded like a nightmare for them 
and me. So on stage, I would take out my contacts and get really drunk so I 
couldn't see the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten easier since I realized I'm not responsible for other people and 
equipment, and I just set a piece of wood in my lap and play. I'm not a 
performer with a capital 'P.' I just adore the music." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hips and Makers" revolves around Hersh's personal life, and she "thought 
maybe it was inappropriate for publication because I don't believe in making 
music talk for you. It should be the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I could see my life picture splattered all over it. I had to take a giant 
step back and listen, and it didn't seem to suffer from my life being in it. It 
wasn't brought down by it and still seemed magic. Talk about your ego! I 
thought I was the only person with a dorky little life. Well, duh, it's 
universal!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was born in Georgia but grew up in Newport, where her hippie parents, 
both teachers, played Patti Smith, the Doors and Neil Young at home. "I didn't 
have to buy those albums but did have to deal with the fact that they were 
actually cool even if my parents liked them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father taught her to play guitar at age 9, and by 14 she'd started 
Throwing Muses out of the local hard-core punk scene with her step-sister Tanya 
Donelly, who left the Muses a few years back to form the band Belly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was placed in accelerated courses through high school and entered 
college early but left after her junior year when she became pregnant. Around 
that time, the band became the first U.S. group to sign with Britain's 
eccentric 4AD label, which released the Muses' first two albums. The group 
switched to Sire Records around 1987 and since then has released five more 
albums. Hersh already has made most of the Muses next album and plans another 
solo acoustic record. 
</P>
<P>
 Her upbeat persona seems the antithesis of the defeat that surfaces from time 
to time in her music. The contrast has spurred descriptions of Hersh that range 
from bubbly housewife to dark artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be called a perky housewife over suicidal poetess anytime," she 
says forcefully. "I have bipolar disorder and am diagnosed as schizophrenic. A 
lot of people know it and use it to say I'm that kind of poet. I can't say 
enough that being sick is humiliating and has nothing to do with being a good 
poet or musician. 
</P>
<P>
 "So anytime they want to call me a giddy housewife, it's just fine with me. 
I've never been anything but goofy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Kristin Hersh plays tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $17.50. (714) 496-8930.

HE'S PLAYING 2ND FIDDLE TO A MOUSE; MUSIC: AS BARRY SILVERMAN PIECES TOGETHER 
CLASSIC ACCOMPANIMENT, THE DISNEY ANIMATION ALMOST RUNS AWAY WITH IT.

<P>
 Conductor Barry Silverman has been watching Walt Disney's "Fantasia" a lot 
lately, and for the most part, he's enjoyed it tremendously. But every time the 
"Sorcerer's Apprentice" scene comes on, he's had what you might call a syncing 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, you see, is preparing for concerts tonight and Saturday at 
Saddleback College in which his Saddleback Symphony will provide live 
orchestral accompaniment to excerpts from several Disney animated films to be 
shown on a giant screen above the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 He's found it's tougher than it looks not to do a Mickey Mouse job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing the ('Fantasia') video, and knowing the (Paul Dukas) music, I'd always 
known there were cuts -- but I had no idea of the extent of cuts needed to make 
it work," Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to figure out what cuts ('Fantasia' conductor-arranger Leopold) 
Stokowski made," he said. "There were at least 30 in 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' 
alone -- three measures here, six there, 12 over there, and each measure goes 
by in less than half a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are sections (that remain) for the brass and strings that are 
practically impossible" to play, Silverman said. "In all my professional years 
of playing, I've never played it that fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can hear mistakes throughout the (Stokowski) recording -- they're barely 
making their parts, and in some places they don't make their parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman and his group will nevertheless strive to make all their parts in 
the Dukas music and other famous compositions used in "Fantasia," including 
Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" and Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony, as 
well as instrumental passages from "Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also touches on Disney's latest hits with songs from "Beauty and 
the Beast," featuring baritone Stan Nickel and soprano Eileen O'Hern, and 
"Aladdin." The concert will end with a sing-along version of "A Whole New 
World" from "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, 50, served as a percussionist in the 1960s and '70s with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic and Tel Aviv Orchestra, both under Zubin Mehta. He also 
played for the Monday Evening Concerts in Los Angeles. He took over the 
Saddleback orchestra 10 years ago; it's since doubled to 70 members. Two years 
ago, Silverman mounted a "Hollywood Hits" concert that featured the orchestra 
and video excerpts from such films as "E.T.," "Star Wars," "2001: A Space 
Odyssey" and "Superman," and the present effort grew out of that one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he discovered that keeping up with cartoons is a considerably 
bigger musical challenge than playing along to Hollywood's big-budget, 
outer-space blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do Bugs Bunny's 'What's Opera, Doc?,' " Silverman recalled, "but 
they'd used bits and pieces of music such as 'Tannhauser,' instead of complete 
arrangements. In Disney's 'The Bandmaster,' there's a big chunk of (Rossini's) 
'William Tell' Overture, but then it stops for cartoon bits and sound effects. 
That was not ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did '2001,' I didn't have to time it exactly," he continued. "Same 
with 'E.T.' -- I took the published music from the bicycle scene to the end, 
and after getting a feel for the tempo, the music fit fine. In the cartoons, 
the tempo must be exact, measure by measure. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep pace, he said, "I had to write in the screen action every few 
measures. Then I practiced by watching the videos without sound. During the 
concerts, I can only watch the screen, so I had to memorized all the scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman is planning sequel concerts in both the "Hollywood Hits" and 
"Cartoon Classics" formats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to start with the best examples of the merger of music and video," 
he said. "But as you start to research, you often find more work, better work, 
more interesting work. I think we've just scratched the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry Silverman leads the Saddleback Symphony in "Cartoon Classics," a 
program of live music accompanying clips from Disney animated film, tonight at 
8 p.m. in the McKinney Theatre, Saddleback College, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, 
Mission Viejo. $8 to $10. Also Saturday at 7 p.m. (714) 582-4656.

RICHARD ROBERT REDLIN LOOKS FORWARD TO A DIFFERENT ROLE; ACTING: THE DISABLED 
ACTOR WILL PLAY A UNIQUE PART IN 'HART TO HART,' BUT HE WANTS TO PORTRAY 
ORDINARY CHARACTERS WHO JUST HAPPEN TO USE CRUTCHES OR WHEELCHAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Richard Robert Redlin, who walks with the support of forearm crutches, 
steadies what he calls his "sticks" and asks, "Did you ever notice how enamored 
movie makers are with disabled characters? And how seldom they hire disabled 
actors to play those roles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Redlin, who guests tonight in the latest "Hart to Hart" TV movie, reels off 
examples of major movies with disability-specific protagonists: "Rain Man," 
"Scent of a Woman," "Piano," "Born on the Fourth of July," "My Left Foot," 
"Children of a Lesser God." 
</P>
<P>
 "Funny thing," he continued, "is that out of that bunch of award-winning 
movies, only 'Children of a Lesser God' featured a performer (Marlee Matlin) 
who is actually disabled, and she went on to win the Oscar." 
</P>
<P>
 The paradox, said Redlin, is that "we work in a business that's based on 
imagination and, unfortunately, a tremendous lack of vision prevails, 
particularly where people with unique situations are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, members of the Hollywood disabled acting community, who are 
organized, have been trying for decades to get a fair casting break from 
studios and producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disabled roles don't always go to disabled actors," noted director Victoria 
Ann-Lewis, who develops projects for disabled actors at the Mark Taper Forum. 
Disabled herself, she emphasized that "it's a constant battle to integrate us 
into the movies as ordinary people -- judges, nurses, lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann-Lewis, who directed Redlin last year as a legless acrobat in "PH*reaks" 
for the Taper's New Works Festival (in which he had to whirl around on a beggar 
board and stand on his head), calls Redlin "an incredibly energetic, promising 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's extremely difficult for talent even like Richard to develop a 
career. But someday," she said with some fire in her voice, "I think someone 
will finally turn the tide and make it big as a leading man or lady who just 
happens to be disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Redlin, who's 41 but looks 31, broke his spinal cord at the age of 22 when he 
fell down a Union Oil refinery smokestack in an industrial accident in his 
native Chicago. Doctors, he said, told him those deathless words heard in many 
a potboiler: "You will never walk again. Your active life is over." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, said Redlin, "they told me I should learn to fix TV sets." But a 
monumental, decade-long rehabilitation program saved the world from another TV 
repairman. It took years but he got out of his wheelchair and onto his feet, 
supported by his trusty "sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 "After my fall, I was full of anger at first. I went through terrible dark 
periods but I channeled them into constructing my life, trying to maximize my 
disability. Everyone has some sort of disability, physically, socially, 
economically. I'm doing everything I can to heal my body spiritually and 
physically but, at the same time, I'm going forward with life and not getting 
hung up on my disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who look at me might say in mock-envy, 'Look at Richard: He lives at 
the beach, he's buying a condo (which Redlin is, in Santa Monica), he drives, 
he acts.' But I have tremendous problems every day. Spinal cord injury is a 
hard nut." 
</P>
<P>
 With rugged, leading-man looks and natural screen magnetism, he unabashedly 
looks forward to the day when he can reasonably audition for a romantic 
leading-man role in which he's coincidentally a guy who's a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be hired for my acting," Redlin said, with an intensity that 
non-disabled actors couldn't possibly understand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Redlin, a comparative late bloomer (he began his acting 
journey in 1985 in classes under teacher Sanford Meisner), has probably been 
working more than many disabled actors, essentially in roles where his 
disability is germane to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's "Hart to Hart," shot on location in Hawaii, represents big exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 His role was originally written for a character in a wheelchair, but Redlin 
convinced co-executive producer Robert Papazian (with whom he had worked two 
years ago on a USA cable movie) that his character, who is celebrated in the 
story for authoring a book called "I Can Do It Alone," would be more dramatic 
on his feet than in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's action, which also features guests Vicki Lawrence and Mike 
Farrell, Redlin's athleticism is a major plot point. Director Peter Hunt put 
Redlin through the paces on Oahu beaches during filming last month, from 
flirting with Jennifer Hart (Stefanie Powers) to dancing at a masquerade ball 
(in which stars Robert Wagner and Powers are dressed up as Laurel and Hardy) to 
crawling and pulling himself into the ocean and saving Jonathan Hart (Wagner) 
from drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a twist, my character saves someone who doesn't have a physical handicap," 
said Redlin. "It will encourage people to believe that disabled actors can play 
different roles." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hart to Hart: Old Friends Never Die" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 
36 and 39).

A LITTLE RESPECT, PLEASE?; CHAVEZ'S CONQUEROR FRANKIE RANDALL STILL CHAFING AT 
BOXING'S REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GREATEST TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frankie Randall emerged from a stint in jail, from boxing obscurity, from 
three decades of difficult life to knock down and defeat Julio Cesar Chavez 
three months ago, and what did it earn him? 
</P>
<P>
 Deja Julio . Another fight against Chavez, another purse share smaller than 
Chavez's -- $1 million vs. Chavez's $1.5 million -- another round of questions 
about why he thinks he can beat Chavez, another opportunity to prove himself 
against somebody he has already defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the first fight never happened, like it's a nightmare to 
everybody," an obviously frustrated Randall said Thursday, two days before 
Saturday's rematch at the MGM Grand. "They all want to forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that many of the hotel's and Don King's hopes lie in Chavez's 
regaining his World Boxing Council super-lightweight title -- and fulfilling 
the rest of his contract with the hotel -- Randall has been tense and restless, 
and the continuous push and pull of autograph seekers, interview requests and 
other commitments have done nothing to settle him. 
</P>
<P>
 For any fighter, it can all be overwhelming. For a man as emotional as 
Randall, who waited as long as he did to get even one title shot, the last few 
days have been close to oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat through more than a hour of television interviews Wednesday, patiently 
and pleasantly by promoter 
</P>
<P>
 King's side, but then quickly left the room in a near jog, mumbling about 
people "still riding Chavez's coattails." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so pumped up, I'm knotted," Randall said. "I'm ready to let some of this 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 All Randall (49-2 with 39 knockouts) says he wants to do is quiet the Chavez 
crowd once and for all and be recognized not only as the man who beat Chavez, 
but as a talented fighter in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 All he sees everybody else doing is root for Chavez to end his brief reign, 
and all he hears is Chavez saying that the defeat was caused by his own poor 
training and lack of desire, not Randall's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand why it's happening," Randall said. "The man's a legend in his 
own time. I'm not trying to take away anything from him. But I'm a champion 
also. They've got to recognize me a little bit and bring me around. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if I go ahead and lose the title? Then I'm written off to be just 
another opponent. I wasn't just another opponent. I beat all the odds and beat 
the man who wasn't supposed to get beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man's a great champion, but the best fall. And when the best fall, the 
people usually grasp onto the new champion. But now it's still Chavez, Chavez, 
Chavez. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are (fixated on him). He's done well for Don, but I'm the 
champ." 
</P>
<P>
 About a month after beating Chavez, Randall got married -- but then 
immediately had to deal with the death of his father, Wallace Randall II. 
Randall, who says he is his family's sole provider, has yet to have a 
honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things had been piling on," Randall said. "Fortunately, I've come to 
grips with it all." 
</P>
<P>
 For Randall, it was another dance with hardship and loss in a lifetime of 
both. He had a sterling amateur career -- he was a five-time Golden Gloves 
champion -- but missed the 1980 Moscow Olympics, along with the rest of the 
America's best amateurs, because of the U.S. boycott.  
</P>
<P>
 Randall, 32, from Morristown, Tenn., turned professional in 1983 but always 
seemed to fall just short of contending for a title. He was 28-0 before losing 
a decision to Freddie Pendleton, who went on to the lightweight title. The next 
year, Randall was knocked out in the second round by Primo Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Randall missed two years after he had been convicted on a drug charge. He 
was released in 1990 after serving 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight fights and three years later, he was standing over a fallen Chavez, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was a good fighter; I just needed the opportunity," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could enjoy the title, though, or even consider fighting anybody 
else, the contract with King pushed him into this immediate rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 At times recently, Randall has looked like a nervous fighter caught in the 
glare of oncoming headlines. He missed at least four news conferences during 
the nationwide tour to promote the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's feeling is the focus of being the champion," said his trainer, 
Aaron Snowell. "The first time, he could stay focused. He didn't need to use up 
a lot of his energy answering questions or doing any of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to treat this one like the last time, stay concentrated, because he 
knows he has a hard task in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've tried to do is bring about an understanding, a knowledge of it. If 
you have that, it relaxes you. When you don't understand why everything is 
happening so fast, it becomes confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall says the months have gone by quickly since he won the title, and his 
wide smile when he speaks of it tells everyone how much he is looking forward 
to his planned honeymoon in St. Thomas after this fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he consider fighting anybody else in his first title defense? 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I both know I didn't have a chance to take another fight," Randall 
said. "Anyway, why fight Joe Blow and get a cut in the ninth round and maybe 
lose my title?" 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, perhaps sarcastically, perhaps not, repeatedly has said that even if 
he beats Chavez, he might have to fight him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little difficult," he said. "I have to beat him twice in the manner 
that I beat him (before). I took the guy to school. He wasn't able to handle 
the things I did to him. Nobody has. I put him down. I've put a lot of them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall also chafes at any suggestion -- particularly when made by Pernell 
Whitaker -- that Whitaker's clinical dissection of Chavez in their infamous 
draw last September gave Randall the game plan to defeat Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pernell Whitaker is getting involved with something he shouldn't be involved 
with," said Randall, who points out that Whitaker's being left-handed makes it 
a totally different fight. "Give me the break I deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to gain what I just won."

DERBY LOOKING LIKE A KENTUCKY BULLFIGHT; HORSE RACING: FAVORITE DRAWS NO. 4 
POST, BUT OWNER OF ULISES SAYS IT WON'T BE EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holy Bull and Ulises, who are expected to be the hares that run ahead of the 
tortoises in the 120th Kentucky Derby, drew post positions alongside one 
another as the 15 anticipated horses were entered Thursday in Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jimmy Croll, the trainer of favorite Holy Bull, this chumminess in the 
starting gate doesn't make any difference. For Robert Perez, the cocky owner of 
Ulises, it's an immediate chance for his colt to remind Holy Bull that he's in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my spot," Perez said after the post-position pills were drawn in the 
Kentucky Derby Museum at Churchill Downs. "We're the matador. We're here to 
kill the Bull." 
</P>
<P>
 If Ulises can merely make Holy Bull uncomfortable in the first half mile of 
the race, the trainers of the late-running horses will be most appreciative. 
Many of them are conceding the race to Croll's slate-gray colt unless he's 
challenged early, and Ulises might be the only starter willing to make that 
commitment. No one contested the pace with Holy Bull in the Florida Derby or 
the Blue Grass Stakes and the son of Great Above cantered home both times. 
</P>
<P>
 When Holy Bull drew the No. 4 post a few draws after Ulises had pulled No. 5, 
there was a murmur among the several hundred people there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great post," said Croll, who is trying to break an ominous string. 
The last 14 Derby favorites have been beaten. "Ulises? I didn't care where he 
drew. Now that he's next to us, maybe he'll clear the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The inside and outside posts are generally not considered good spots. Jockey 
Pat Day was pleased that his mount, Tabasco Cat, will break from the No. 9 
stall. And Brocco, the Santa Anita Derby winner, won't be able to use his No. 
10 post as an excuse, should he not win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been keen about being down on the inside," said Day, who scored 
his Derby victory aboard Lil E. Tee in 1992 from the No. 10 hole. "If he draws 
inside, a horse has to stand so long (while the rest of the field is loaded), 
and it can be hard to keep him focused and relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one horse -- Ferdinand in 1986 -- has won on the rail in the last 30 
years, and Soul Of The Matter, trying to become the first West Virginia-bred to 
take the roses, came up with No. 1 for Saturday. No. 15 went to Kandaly, winner 
of the Louisiana Derby, which means he'll have to break from the auxiliary 
gate. Churchill Downs' main gate accommodates 14 horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think those two horses (Soul Of The Matter and Kandaly) will be hurt 
by where they are," said Ron McAnally, who trains Valiant Nature, winner of the 
Hollywood Futurity over Brocco last year. "They're both closers, so they should 
have time to get into position." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull was made the 8-5 favorite by Mike Battaglia, the linemaker at 
Churchill Downs. Next on his odds are Brocco at 3-1 and Tabasco Cat at 6-1. The 
odds from there are 8-1 and higher. Here's the post-position rundown, with 
jockeys and odds: 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, Kent Desormeaux, 20-1; Valiant Nature, Laffit Pincay, 
12-1; Powis Castle, Chris Antley, 30-1; Holy Bull, Mike Smith, 8-5; Ulises, 
Jorge Chavez, 30-1; Mahogany Hall, Willie Martinez, 30-1; Strodes Creek, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, 8-1; Go For Gin, Chris McCarron, 15-1; Tabasco Cat, Pat Day, 6-1; 
Brocco, Gary Stevens, 3-1; Smilin Singin Sam, Larry Melancon, 30-1; Southern 
Rhythm, Garrett Gomez, 15-1; Blumin Affair, Jerry Bailey, 15-1; Meadow Flight, 
Shane Sellers, 30-1, and Kandaly, Craig Perret, 30-1. 
</P>
<P>
 All horses will carry 126 pounds. Because the track tote board has room for 
only 12 numbers, Ulises, Mahogany Hall, Smilin Singin Sam and Meadow Flight -- 
horses given the least chance of winning -- have been dropped into the 
parimutuel field. A bet on one is a bet on all four. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/4-mile race is worth $888,800, with $638,800 going to the winner. The 
weather forecast is now calling for morning showers today and a chance of 
afternoon thunderstorms Saturday, with Saturday's temperatures about 70 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This track's actually faster when it's just a little wet," McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although unbeaten in four sprints in Panama, Ulises was 20-1 at Keeneland when 
he made his United States debut on April 24. He led for six furlongs in the 1 
1/16-mile Lexington Stakes before finishing third, well behind Southern Rhythm 
and Soul Of The Matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if it made any difference that Holy Bull was starting just inside his 
colt, Perez said, "I don't care. I don't worry about Holy Bull. He has to worry 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally questions whether Ulises has the necessary class to go with his 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure Ulises will be able to keep up," McAnally said. "I think the 
jockey will have to pump him to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, a 32-year-old Peruvian, will be riding Ulises for the first time and 
also be making his Derby debut. Considered one of New York's best jockeys, 
Chavez is an expert at getting horses out of the gate, which makes him a good 
matchup for Ulises. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, after running in front while winning the Hollywood Futurity, 
raced off the pace as Pincay followed McAnally's instructions in the Blue 
Grass. Valiant Nature couldn't close the gap, finishing 3 1/2 lengths behind, 
in second place. Smith had not used his whip on Holy Bull. Smith has used it 
only twice on Holy Bull, hitting him four times in seven races. Kentucky Derby

MIKE DOWNEY: TOO MUCH OF A BAD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All-sports, 24-hour talk radio has officially flopped in Los Angeles. While it 
prospers in New York, Chicago, Toronto and elsewhere, station KMPC has halted 
the bold experiment that made management rue the day it quit spinning Engelbert 
Humperdinck records. The ratings were only slightly higher than they were for a 
60-second emergency broadcast test. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this week, KMPC has converted to an all-gab, Sports Lite format, with 
intermittent comic relief provided by American League West Division baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 After having broadcast Angel baseball, Ram football and Clipper basketball 
over the last dozen months, it's a wonder more KMPC sportscasters haven't gone 
leaping to their deaths from Sunset Boulevard rooftops. It isn't easy to say, 
"Stay tuned," when what you really want to scream is, "Run for your lives!" 
</P>
<P>
 Why did AM 710 all-jock radio flunk? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe because our Southern California pro teams all -- how shall I put this 
politely? -- stunk like skunks. Of the Dodgers, Angels, Padres, Raiders, Rams, 
Chargers, Lakers, Clippers, Kings and Mighty Ducks, only one in their most 
recent season of play qualified for the postseason playoffs, that being the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 (We did, however, excel in Little League baseball.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe all-sports radio won't work in greater metropolitan La-La Land 
because we are simply a bunch of easy-listenin' dudes and dudettes, coolest 
people on the planet, too chillin' to get too hot, as opposed to those obscene 
phone-callers elsewhere who contact talk shows and scream, "Yo! Lemme ax you, 
whatsa matta with them Mets?" Or: "I tink dat Ditka is da problem with da team, 
m'friend!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wish I knew the answer. Myself, I have done enough radio to know two things: 1 
-- that I have a very good face for radio, and 2 -- that I am to brilliance in 
broadcasting what Ivana Trump is to brilliance in literature. Compared to me, 
Ted Baxter was Ted Koppel. I babble and blather and blabber. People who invite 
me onto their programs end up dubbing Milli Vanilli over my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 But I do listen to talk radio a lot. I like to listen to talk radio more than 
I like to talk to talk radio. I like to imagine what the traffic-copter people 
look like. I like to picture the host sprinting like Carl Lewis down a hallway 
toward a restroom during a 30-second commercial. I like to envision the 
station's psychologist giving advice to the lovelorn for four hours, then going 
home to an empty apartment to play solitaire. 
</P>
<P>
 All-sports radio was a new concept for me, however. I thought it might be too 
much of a good thing, like all-food radio or all-Rolling Stones radio. I mean, 
I like Linda Ronstadt, but I'm not sure I want to be trapped for 24 hours 
inside an elevator with her. Even a glutton can digest only so much sports. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a typical KMPC broadcast day: 
</P>
<P>
 "Good morning and welcome to KMPC. KMPC time, 10:01 a.m. Today on KMPC we're 
talking about last night's 150-79 Clipper defeat, which you heard right here on 
KMPC. Let's open up those KMPC phone lines so you can call us here at KMPC and 
tell us what you think. In the Valley 818 555-KMPC Orange County 714 555-KMPC

or on your cellular phone press star, pound sign, UCLA, PIN, 24 left, 39 right, 
17 left, hang up once, dial again, press I-LUV-KMPC and ask for Vinnie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning on KMPC our guests will be 97 sportswriters and maybe an athlete 
if we can get one to call us back. Our phones are lighting up now. Any of you 
athletes who would like to be on 710 KMPC, those numbers again are 818, 714, 
909, 213, 310 and 900 976 555 KMPC here on KMPC. On hold we have Johnny from 
Carson, Burt from Lancaster, Robin from Ventura, and on a car phone Roberto 
from San Clemente. Hang on, we'll take your calls in a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now let's go out to our old friend Tommy (Cauliflower Head) Tropicana 
calling from Nevada for our regular Boxers You've Never Heard Of segment of the 
program. Hi, Cauliflower Head, how's that face of yours healing? Hello? Oops, 
we must have been cut off. 710 KMPC 555 800 818 The Valley 714 Orange County

Lancaster and on a car phone Roberto from San Clemente. Hang on, we'll take 
your calls in a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say, did anybody see that game last night? I can't believe he did that. He's 
an idiot. KMPC time, 10:02 a.m., and this morning here on KMPC we're talking 
anything you want to talk about here on 710 KMPC, football, baseball, kayak, 
800 555 KMPC, where the time is 10:02 a.m. One line still open. On hold we have 
Johnny from Carson and Roberto from San Clemente and you guys hang on, we'll 
take your calls in a moment. KMPC time, 10:02 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, look who just walked into the studio. That is some wild shirt you've 
got on today! No, no it really is. It's our KMPC station general manager 
program director here on KMPC, Lenny (Wild Shirt) Bernardino. How ya doin', 
Lenny? Boy, that is some wild shirt. Yeah, too bad nobody out there can see it. 
KMPC sports time, 10:03 a.m. Later on this morning we'll be talking to Dodger 
talent scout Dewey Synum, who for nearly five years now has been beating the 
bushes in the North Dakota-South Dakota-Montana tri-state area for the next 
Fernando Valenzuela. 710 KMPC! One phone line still open. Roberto from San 
Clemente on a car phone, hang on, be with you in a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey you youngsters, don't forget to come see me and many other KMPC stars at 
the big Custom Hubcap and Wheel Alignment show this weekend out at the Pomona 
fairgrounds. I'll be out there Sunday from 4:15 a.m. to dawn, so hope to meet 
you out there! It's 10:04 a.m. here on 710 KMPC, with KMPC news time just a 
minute away. Vince Coleman, should he be deported or what? One phone line still 
open. KMPC time, 10:04, let's go out now to Roberto from San Clemente on a car 
phone, Roberto you're on KMPC 710 all-sports radio! Hello? Roberto?"

 Simi Valley High baseball Coach Mike Scyphers and the brother of Royal High 
baseball Coach Dan Maye acknowledged Thursday they accepted money from an adult 
baseball league last summer in exchange for use of fields, a violation of 
school district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state law, the Simi Valley Unified School District, which 
includes both schools, prohibits employees from accepting money for use of a 
facility, said Susan Parks, assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who was coach at Simi Valley for 16 years before being removed 
Tuesday pending a police investigation into alleged financial and disciplinary 
improprieties, said he accepted a cashier's check for $700 last May from Ted 
Severns, then president of the Thousand Oaks chapter of the National Adult 
Baseball Assn. Severns is no longer an NABA official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cashier's check made out to me," Scyphers said. "I cashed it and in 
turn paid it to my assistant coaches. Darin Furlong got $500 and Shaun Murphy 
got $300, of which $100 came out of my pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he paid the coaches without the knowledge of the school district, 
Scyphers also violated Southern Section regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Maye, a Royal assistant last season and a minor league pitcher this 
year, was given $250 by the NABA, Severns said. Maye admitted he accepted the 
money, but said it was less than $125. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much (Severns) paid and where it went to is not exactly clear, but I know 
I got some of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Maye, who said he did not receive any money, knew about the payment to his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Severns) told me, 'I paid your brother,' " Dan Maye said. "I said, 'The 
school district should have received the money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Grady, director of planning and facilities for the Simi Valley school 
district, said the district has never given permission to an adult baseball 
league to use the baseball fields at either Simi Valley or Royal high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Principal Mike McConahy said he is investigating Dan and Steve Maye's 
involvement with the NABA. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the NABA gave Scyphers two additional checks, totaling $1,300, made 
out to "Simi Valley Baseball," an account from which team expenses are paid. 
The checks, dated March 18, were for field usage this summer and the 1993-94 
winter season. Scyphers said the $1,300 remains in the team's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he instructed Russ Stephans, a Simi Valley assistant who plays 
in the NABA, to connect the league with the school district office. Jeff 
Richardson, new president of the Thousand Oaks chapter of the NABA, said he 
followed Stephans' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an adult baseball group which is in the process of filling out the 
necessary paperwork," Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not confirm that payments by the NABA are the subject of the 
investigation of Scyphers. Severns, Richardson and Mike Micheli, national 
director of the NABA, said they have not been contacted by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Micheli said it is standard practice for the organization to pay baseball 
programs, rather than school districts, for field usage. He estimated that the 
NABA uses 500 high school fields nationwide and in 90% of the cases fees go 
directly to the baseball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help out the programs because most programs are underfunded," he 
said. "If the money goes to the district, it might not go directly to the 
baseball kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA also has provided equipment in exchange for field use, which happened 
last year at Newbury Park High. The league gave 10 dozen baseballs, batting 
helmets, bats and a home plate to the Newbury Park program without the 
knowledge of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was skeptical of taking a check but I didn't think there was a problem 
taking equipment," Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said. "I never thought I 
was renting the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricius pointed out that many of the players on the NABA team that used the 
Newbury Park field were his former players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say no to a bunch of guys who played for you," he said. "I 
wanted to help them out. They are alumni." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Richardson contacted the Conejo school district and is arranging to 
rent the field for $320. 
</P>
<P>
 In the league's first year in the area in '93, officials organized the season 
on the fly and scrambled to line up fields. When Severns sought use of the Simi 
Valley field, he said, Scyphers instructed him to complete the necessary 
paperwork through the district office. But Severns apparently did not follow 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Severns said that Scyphers wanted the money before the NABA used the field, 
and the league's national office could not release the funds in time for the 
first scheduled game. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I got a cashier's check for $700 and took it over to him personally," 
Severns said. "He said to make it out to Mike Scyphers. It was going to go to 
his coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Steve Maye was an unpaid assistant at Royal who was friendly with 
Severns because Maye played in the NABA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally we were to pay $500 for the season (to use the Royal junior 
varsity field)," Severns said. A second installment of $250 was not paid 
because the league stopped using the field, Severns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Maye, insisting he received no more than $125, said that with the money 
from the first installment he bought "two or three dozen baseballs" and gave 
them to Dan Maye. "If anyone screwed up, it was me," Steve Maye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Maye said that Severns didn't follow through on his request to apply for a 
field permit through the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used the field for one week, then the second week they jumped the fence 
to the varsity field, broke into the dugouts and stole the mound rubber," Dan 
Maye said. "So I left the sprinklers on to make sure they couldn't use the 
fields again." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Maye attributed much of the confusion about field usage and the NABA to 
the fact that it was the league's first year in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty screwed up."

FULLER RETURNS AS PEPPERDINE COACH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SAN DIEGO STATE 
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR CALLS WAVES' ACTIONS 'UNETHICAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Fuller has been named Pepperdine basketball coach, returning to the 
school where he once starred and was an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who coached San Diego State the last two seasons, replaces Tom Asbury, 
who resigned April 12 to coach at Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pepperdine has always been a special place for me," Fuller said. "Sixteen 
years ago, I decided I wanted to play here and coach here some day. Through the 
grace of God, that dream has been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine has only two part-time starters returning from last season's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wright, Pepperdine athletic director, said he received 65 inquires from 
coaches and answered nearly 500 telephone calls during the three-week 
nationwide search. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision came down to Fuller and Steve Aggers, a four-year assistant 
under Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see (in Tony Fuller) is what you get," Wright said at a news 
conference. "He's honest, professional and has good morals. He's all the things 
we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State Athletic Director Fred Miller said he was upset with the 
manner in which Fuller was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Fuller is a hell of a guy, and I wish him well," Miller said. "But there 
are procedures to follow, and San Diego State was never contacted by Pepperdine 
University." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Pepperdine did not get permission to interview Fuller, who, at the 
end of the season, orally agreed to an extension through the 1997 season with 
the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miller: "I consider that unethical and bad business practice. . . . It 
was clandestine and it was unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright could not be reached for comment on Miller's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Tarkanian, who will be in San Diego today on business unrelated to San 
Diego State, is a leading candidate for the Aztec job. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller took a struggling program and guided the Aztecs to an 8-21 record 
during the 1992-93 season and 12-16 last season. He began his coaching career 
as a part-time assistant under Jim Harrick at Pepperdine in 1983 and was 
promoted to a full-time position two years later. He followed Harrick to UCLA, 
where he served four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Inducted into the Pepperdine Hall of Fame last fall, Fuller averaged 19.5 
points and 6.8 rebounds as a senior under Harrick in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was a tremendous player for me," Harrick said. "I described him as 
quietly effective, and he's proved to be that way as an assistant and as a head 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Wilson, a part-time Wave assistant for four seasons, will be one of 
Fuller's full-time assistants.

WILKINSON GETS BIGGEST BONUS, $14.4-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Wilkinson finally lived up to his nickname Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing a $14.4-million contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, the rookie 
defensive lineman known as "Big Daddy" was handed a $5-million bonus check. 
</P>
<P>
 He promptly said he would give part of it to his mother, Veronda; part of it 
to his Dayton high school, part of it to officials at Ohio State and part of it 
to his nine siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the neat things about this is watching an athlete retrace his roots," 
said agent Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-year contract was notable not only for its size -- Wilkinson received 
the largest bonus ever given an NFL rookie -- but in the swiftness of its 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, the top pick in the NFL draft 12 days ago, was expected to go 
through a contract fight with the notoriously stingy Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 Until just moments before the Bengals phoned Wilkinson and told him he was 
being drafted first, many thought they would trade the pick to the New England 
Patriots because they couldn't afford him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went about it and did things that maybe we would not have done before," 
said Bengal General Manager Mike Brown. "The total amount is more than I ever 
thought I'd live to sign off on, but here we are. It's what's happening in the 
game today." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Wilkinson, 6 feet 4 and 308 pounds, can tear up the 
contract after four years if he is in for 35% of the plays this season. 
</P>
<P>
 His signing is expected to be the first of many lucrative contracts given to 
first-round draft picks since the rookie salary cap was increased by nearly 19% 
over last year's. The increase was a result of higher ticket sales and 
television money leaguewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get to work as soon as possible -- I don't want to miss anything," 
said Wilkinson, who at 14 was anointed by his family as the one who would 
provide support after his father's sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Ohio have known me all my life," he said. "It will be great to 
get in there and perform for them."

CANADA, SWEDEN TO HAVE REMATCH IN WORLD HOCKEY SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canada gained a chance to avenge the shootout at Lillehammer, Norway, when it 
beat the Czech Republic, 3-2, Thursday to earn a berth against Sweden in the 
semifinals of the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be a rematch of Canada's sudden-death loss to the Swedes in the 
Olympic final two months ago, although the cast of characters on both teams is 
different.Both are bolstered by NHL players. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's only holdover is Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' draft choice who had 
a goal and an assist against the Czechs. In the Olympic final, Kariya missed in 
a sudden-death shootout to give Sweden the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think of it sometimes, but now I'm focusing 100% to win the world 
championships," said Kariya, who is tied for the tournament scoring lead with 
10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinal Saturday will pit the United States, upset winners over 
Russia on Wednesday, against Finland, 10-0 winners over Austria on Thursday. 
Finland beat the U.S., 7-2, in their first meeting.

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN BRAZIL SAY A FINAL FAREWELL TO SENNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a shower of rose petals and cries of "Senna, champion," Brazilians on 
Thursday flocked to say farewell to beloved racing hero Ayrton Senna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of fans took to the streets to accompany the final ride 
of the three-time Formula One champion who rivaled Pele as a national idol. 
</P>
<P>
 As an air force acrobatic team traced a heart and an "S" in the sky, Senna's 
body was lowered into a grave at the Morumbi cemetery with honors of a chief of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've cried for three days. He was everything to me," said Zenitte Silva 
Barros, a businesswoman. "He brought great honor to us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Senna, 34, died of multiple head injuries when his Williams-Renault slammed 
into a concrete wall at nearly 180 m.p.h. in Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix at 
Imola, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 His death sent this nation of 155 million into mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 250,000 visitors -- nearly twice the expected number -- filed through the 
state legislature where Senna's body lay since its arrival from Paris on 
Wednesday.

FABREGAS' DEFENSE A BONUS FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels left spring training secure in the belief that their catching 
platoon of Greg Myers and Chris Turner would add offensive punch. They felt 
considerably less sure that the tandem would provide an acceptable level of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League's fleet set figured to be marking their calendars for 
games against the Angels. After all, Myers and Turner combined to throw out 
only 24 of 114 would-be base stealers last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine games into the season, the Angels are beginning to believe they 
have the best of both worlds, thanks to an unfortunate turn of events and the 
amazing progress of rookie Jorge Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers was hitting .227 when he tore cartilage in his knee during a collision 
at home plate April 23 and went on the disabled list. Turner is struggling 
along at .114. So when the Angels called up Fabregas from triple-A Vancouver to 
provide catching depth, it wasn't long before they gave him a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a shot heard 'round Anaheim Stadium and the report is still 
reverberating. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, he threw out both Yankees who attempted to steal and the 
Angels held on to win in 13 innings. Thursday night, Fabregas picked off a pair 
of Athletics to help the Angels win, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good win, with our bullpen tired," Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
"(Phil) Leftwich and (Craig) Lefferts did a good job, with an assist from Jorge 
Fabregas behind the plate, I might add. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early, but he certainly has caught and thrown with the best of them so 
far. Everything he's doing is just about textbook right now. He's really 
popping those throws. We'll just sit back and reap the benefits for the time 
being because he's on the top of his game now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas' throw to pick Scott Brosius off second to end an Oakland rally in 
the fifth inning Thursday night looked like something launched from a Patriot 
missile battery and was as accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know anything about him going in," Brosius said, "but he made it 
real clear in the first few innings that he was more than willing and very 
capable of throwing. There was no excuse for me getting picked off there, we 
had already seen his arm in the first few innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas' defensive highlight film has almost overshadowed his .375 batting 
average He walked and scored a run during the Angels' three-run fourth inning 
and singled to center in the eighth, but he was clearly more interested in 
talking about his throwing than his swinging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to just sit there and catch balls," Fabregas said. "I've got a 
pretty decent arm and I'm going to use it. I'm an aggressive catcher and 
there's nothing that feels better than helping a pitcher out of a jam like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas caught Troy Neel leaning too far toward second in the fourth inning. 
And the A's had already scored a run in the fifth -- on Geronimo Berroa's 
bases-empty home run -- and had runners on first and second when Fabregas 
signaled for the pick-off play and then called for a breaking ball to batter 
Rickey Henderson to pick off Brosius. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to call an off-speed pitch so they get farther off base," Fabregas 
said, smiling. "The biggest thrill for a catcher is to throw a guy out stealing 
or pick a guy off." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilling? Sure. Important? And how. Henderson completed his at-bat leading 
off the sixth and hit a long home run to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas, who caught all 13 innings Wednesday night, might be due for an off 
day, but he certainly won't be asking for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tired? No, no, no," he said. "Not in the major leagues. There's no such thing 
as tired up here."

SOMEHOW, THE YALE RAIDERS DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goodby, Orlando. Hello, Connecticut? 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the Raiders made it clear to Orlando officials that they had no 
intention of seriously negotiating a move to that Florida city, owner Al Davis 
has agreed to meet with Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker in Los Angeles 
about Weicker's desire to land a pro football team for his state. 
</P>
<P>
 Weicker also plans on meeting with Ram officials during a whirlwind trip to 
the West Coast in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 All indications are that Raiders are merely being polite to Weicker, that they 
have no intention of considering a move to Connecticut, where they would play 
in the Yale Bowl for three or four years before a proposed new stadium would be 
ready. It would cost about $25 million to provide the Yale Bowl with locker 
rooms and a large enough press box for NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I am not going to do is get into some harebrained scheme which 
is meant to bootstrap somebody else's bid," Weicker said Thursday. "If we are 
looked on seriously, and I think we are looked on seriously by both teams, then 
obviously I am going to do everything I can, personally, to bring about closure 
on it."

CANYON SOFTBALL BENEFITS FROM LINDENBERG'S MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perception is important when you're young, and the image Nina Lindenberg 
created, whether by her own doing or not, wasn't good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not a team player. Selfish. Unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been blown way out of proportion," Canyon teammate Kristy Kachig said. 
"I think a lot of the problem was intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindenberg was the starting shortstop as a freshman and Kachig, a starter at 
second base the last three seasons, has seen her teammate post some 
intimidating statistics during their four years together. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Lindenberg's aggressive personality, and some fragile egos, this 
monster image was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the older players didn't want her to do as well because she was a 
freshman coming in and starting," Kachig recalled. "She didn't have their 
respect and she tried so hard to earn that, and she was really aggressive about 
it, and I think that may be why she got the bad rap about not being a team 
player. Now, everyone respects her." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Lindenberg had her moments. Her sarcastic sense of humor rubbed some 
teammates the wrong way. And her frustration was often evident when teammates 
couldn't perform as well as she could. But respect -- that's not a problem now. 
She was unanimously elected a team captain this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That never would have happened a couple of years ago," Canyon Coach Lance 
Eddy said. "Nina's really matured as a person. She's had this talent all along. 
She was younger and had trouble tolerating people who couldn't play up to her 
level; there aren't many who can." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year of the shortstop in Orange County, Lindenberg is one of the best. 
She is fielding. 950, batting .419 and has a slugging percentage of .645. She 
has scored 14 runs, driven in nine and stolen 16 bases. And third-place Canyon 
(12-8, 4-4) is locked in a down-to-the-wire battle for a Century League playoff 
berth after three losses this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she was young, she knew she was good and her demeanor did not wear well 
with the other players," Eddy said. "She learned she doesn't have to put it in 
people's faces. I can't think of any negatives about her today." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the line, Lindenberg met someone who reminded her of herself 
and decided it was time to change. Her unanimous selection as captain 
represented her teammates' unconditional acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me happy to think that people knew what I could do for them, that I 
would be there for them and back them up if they needed the backup," Lindenberg 
said. "My freshman, sophomore and junior years, our team captains didn't do 
anything but put us down, and I was the same way. When I made team captain, I 
knew I could help others by not putting them down because I didn't like it when 
I was put down." 
</P>
<P>
 That new attitude has changed the atmosphere on the Canyon diamond. The 
cliques are gone and so are the hostilities. Instead of put-downs, there is 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference this year is that now we want to win instead of wanting to go 
home because someone is playing ahead of you," Lindenberg said. "I'm better 
this year than last year just because I know my limits and I know what I can 
and can't say. I know others' capabilities and what they can do, and I don't 
put them down because I know they're giving 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindenberg has taken full advantage of her resources. The sacrificed summers 
and the hours of practice in the back-yard batting cage (with two pitching 
machines to emulate various pitches) have paid off: She received a scholarship 
from Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 She has enough speed to pressure any defense, and at shortstop, she has "great 
range, a really strong arm and a great head for the game," Eddy said. "If she 
chose, she could be a two- to three-year starter for the varsity baseball team. 
She's been hitting baseballs in her yard since she was 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting the smaller baseball instead of a softball has improved her batting 
eye. A right-handed hitter, she has exceptional power. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddy was the Comanche coach during Lindenberg's freshman and sophomore 
seasons, and coached at Irvine Valley College last year. He's back this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'm back just to get a chance to watch her," he said. "I wouldn't 
trade her for any player in the county. She's the best player we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindenberg no longer must prove herself to jealous teammates and point out 
that she belongs in the lineup. The most explosive thing about her now is her 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like sometimes I'd put too much pressure on my teammates instead of 
boosting them up," Lindenberg said of her past. "If they made a physical error, 
I would get mad instead of telling them to shake it off and get it next time. 
It's not right; you want to boost your teammates up instead of putting them 
down. I guess I just grew up."

 Katella softball Coach Rhonda Weyer was ejected in the seventh inning of 
Thursday's 3-2, 12-inning loss to Esperanza, after knocking down an official 
and then pushing an opposing player. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Mike Callahan, who said he will mail a report to the Southern Section 
office today, said Esperanza catcher Julia Cappelli dived to tag Mandy Van Son 
and landed on top of her. Van Son never reached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan continued: "I'm making the call, and someone came up behind me and 
pushed me on my backside. (Weyer) grabbed (Cappelli) from the ground, turned 
her around and pushed her toward first base." 
</P>
<P>
 Weyer could not be reached for comment. MARTIN HENDERSON

KICKING, HITTING, IT'S ALL THE SAME TO THIS PLAYER; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: RING 
MOVES SMOOTHLY FROM HIGH SCHOOL SOCCER STARDOM TO SIMILAR STATUS IN A DIFFERENT 
SPORT AT PIERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Without knowing it, Jason Ring might have started a trend with the Pierce 
College men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ring, a 6-foot-3, 177-pound redshirt freshman outside hitter and middle 
blocker, is one of the best attackers for the Brahmas. With teammate Gabe Higa, 
who much like Ring joined the squad without any experience in organized 
volleyball, he is part of a powerful offensive tandem that has spearheaded the 
team's run toward a second state title in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas (19-0), who breezed to the Western State Conference championship 
with an 18-0 record, will face Grossmont (15-4) tonight at 7:30 in a semifinal 
match of the four-team state tournament at Santa Barbara City College. If 
Pierce wins, it will play in the final Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ring, 19, it would be an accomplishment he couldn't have reasonably 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 When he enrolled at Pierce two years ago and tried out for the volleyball 
team, he had tinkered with the sport only recreationally. He played high school 
soccer, and was a four-year varsity standout in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ring, who was looking for a college to attend in Southern California, knew 
about the successful Pierce volleyball program and approached Coach Ken Stanley 
about playing. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Frank, and uncle, Rob Ring, played volleyball at Pierce and he 
wanted to keep the tradition alive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Brahmas were fresh off a state title in 1992 and loaded with 
talent, but Stanley took him on. "I came down here looking for schools and 
talked to Coach Stanley and decided to stay," said Ring, a defenseman on the 
soccer team at Redmond High in Redmond, Ore., near Bend. "I played (volleyball) 
a little bit on the grass. Last year was the only time I had ever been coached 
and this year is the only time I've played in a match." 
</P>
<P>
 He has adjusted to his new sport quickly, much like Higa, who joined the 
Brahmas this season after giving up a basketball career that took him from 
Quartz Hill High to UC Irvine to Irvine Valley. Last Friday, in a sweep of Long 
Beach City that secured a perfect regular-season record for the Brahmas, Ring 
had 17 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, he was goofy-footed and I told him, 'If you want to play, you'll 
have to change your approach (when preparing to spike the ball).' He changed it 
in a week," Stanley said of Ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he would be quite as good as he is. I think he could go on and 
play big-time volleyball. If he learns to pass, he'll play at a high level." 
</P>
<P>
 Ring says he loves playing for the Brahmas but his desire to attend Pierce has 
hit him in the pocket as hard as one of his spikes. He works part-time at a 
sporting-goods store to make ends meet but sometimes those ends seem far apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing this year has been money," said Ring, who pays $1,800 per 
semester for out-of-state tuition and lives with teammate Mark Smith in an 
apartment in Northridge. "It's real tight. I work, my parents try to help out 
and I try to get financial aid when I can, but it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ring, who wants to become a chiropractor, says he hasn't considered 
leaving Pierce because of the economic hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Ring said. "As far as volleyball goes, it's great. It's worth it 
to me."

TITAN FRESHMAN TRANSFERRING TO RHODE ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton freshman basketball player Josh King, a 6-foot-7 forward 
who was regarded as the team's top young prospect, will transfer to Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him his release a couple of weeks ago and he's decided to go there," 
Coach Brad Holland said. "He told me he thought he'd like being at a smaller 
school better. He said he liked playing for me and liked our staff, but he 
feels this will be better for him and I have to respect that." 
</P>
<P>
 King averaged 6.7 points and 4.1 rebounds last season.

DISSIDENT TITAN ATHLETES WILL STILL PRESS CLAIMS; CAL STATE FULLERTON: 
RESIGNATION OF ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SHUMARD DOESN'T ALTER THEIR PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of two dissident student-athlete groups said Thursday they plan to 
press ahead with their complaints against Cal State Fullerton, and that Bill 
Shumard's resignation as athletic director hasn't altered their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is our just due," wrestler Dwayne Buth said. "It's not that we 
were out to get Shumard fired." 
</P>
<P>
 The wrestlers are protesting the fact that their scholarships were reduced for 
the 1992-93 school year. Buth said he is planning to meet again with university 
officials to see if a settlement can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Pearson, member of a group of protesting football players, said "as far 
as we're concerned this doesn't change anything." Fifteen football players are 
upset about a university edict that they would have to work 10 hours per week 
to maintain part of their scholarships because the football program was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything, we were upset with the way all this was handled," Pearson 
said. "We felt we were under duress to sign that agreement, and the hours we 
would have to work weren't flexible. We want to get paid what is owed us, as 
well as make the athletic department accountable for its actions," Pearson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said he has requested a meeting with university President Milton A. 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Anderson, executive assistant to Gordon, said Thursday there will be a 
national search for Shumard's replacement. She said a search committee will be 
appointed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said Gordon expects to be able to name an acting director by the time 
Shumard leaves his position May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those being mentioned as possible successors to Shumard are Neale 
Stoner, who was athletic director at Fullerton from 1972 through 1979, and 
Karen Miller, athletic director at Cal Poly Pomona. Miller was a finalist when 
Shumard was hired three years ago.

BASKETBALL OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS SCYPHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under scrutiny by one employer, Simi Valley High baseball Coach Mike Scyphers 
has a vote of confidence from another. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dangleis, the supervisor of Big West Conference men's basketball 
officials, said Thursday he will ignore reports of alleged misconduct by 
Scyphers until police and school district authorities "elevate their 
investigation from the witchhunt phase." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who built Simi Valley into a perennial Southland baseball power, was 
suspended from coaching on Tuesday pending an investigation into what police 
say are possible "financial improprieties" and "improper discipline practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he accepted money from an adult baseball league to reserve the 
high school's baseball field on Sundays, a violation of school district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Simi Valley players reportedly have been questioned about a disciplinary 
system called "the block," which Scyphers instituted after he became coach of 
the Pioneers 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Simi Valley player breaks a team rule, teammates are allowed to bid for 
the opportunity to swat that player with a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds went to an end-of-the-year party. 
</P>
<P>
 State law defines such disciplinary action as corporal punishment, which is 
prohibited by the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and school officials have declined to divulge specifics about their 
inquiries, but their probe has not yet tarnished Scyphers' reputation as one of 
the West Coast's premier young basketball referees. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, nothing has happened to change my mind about him," Dangleis 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd make assignments to him right now without any regard for what has been 
going on in his other job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always has been a very industrious and hard-working official." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, a former Cal State Northridge point guard, has been an NCAA 
Division I college basketball official for four years, routinely receiving 
assignments from both the Big West and Pacific 10 conferences -- a lucrative 
side job. 
</P>
<P>
 Both conferences pay men's basketball officials $465 per game, plus travel 
expenses and a $110 per-diem fee.  
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he worked 51 games during the past season, but not all at the 
Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Scyphers' assignments was the Big West Conference Tournament and a 
first-round National Invitation Tournament game between Fresno State and 
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's rated up there pretty high in our conference, especially among the young 
guys," Dangleis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McCabe, an independent officials assigner, went a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the best young prospect in the western United States," McCabe 
said. "I'm convinced with the path he's on he'll do an NCAA Tournament in the 
next two years or so, and eventually a Final Four sometime soon after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Noted for his knowledge of the rule book, Scyphers has been an instructor at 
Pac-10 officials' clinics and worked with McCabe at a basketball officials' 
camp at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody around I know would ever question Michael's integrity," McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy, who has critiqued Scyphers both as a player and 
an official, lauded him as a person of "great character and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers was never bothered by coming back to officiate a game involving his 
alma mater, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes I was," the coach added. "He's so conscientious about making 
sure he's impartial that he bends over backwards, sometimes I've thought to the 
other extreme."

 A group of parents of Simi Valley High baseball players is investigating the 
possibility of hiring a lawyer to seek a temporary restraining order to 
reinstate Mike Scyphers as coach, said Maureen Celusta, the mother of senior 
pitcher Nathan Celusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Celusta also said she and other parents have scheduled a meeting at 
8:15 a.m. today with Principal Kathryn Scroggin. Nearly two dozen parents 
signed a petition in support of Scyphers during the Pioneers' game Wednesday.

TIRED OF HYPE, JACKSON CHALLENGES LEWIS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people want to turn the Lennox Lewis-Phil Jackson World Boxing Council 
heavyweight title fight into another "Rocky IV." The fighters simply want to 
get it on. 
</P>
<P>
 While the managers and trainers of Lewis, the defending champion, and Jackson 
proclaim tonight's bout a Britain vs. United States grudge match, the boxers 
try to ignore the blarney. Fighting for a championship is enough for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words can't hurt you," Jackson said. "It's like sticks and stones. It all 
will happen in the ring, throwing punches." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who feels slighted in this country, where Evander Holyfield and, now, 
Michael Moorer generally have been considered the true heavyweight champion, 
also leaves the mudslinging to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are talking about Michael Moorer and other pretenders," said 
the 28-year-old Londoner, who was given the WBC belt when Riddick Bowe, then 
the undisputed champion, dumped it into a garbage can in a dispute over a 
mandatory defense against Lewis. "My focus is Phil Jackson. This is a man to be 
taken seriously; he has more knockouts than I have fights. It's up to me to 
prove myself as the true champion." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lewis (24-0, 20 knockouts) weighed in at 235 pounds for the bout 
that will be refereed by Arthur Mercante of New York. Jackson (30-1, 27 
knockouts), who at six feet is five inches shorter than Lewis, weighed 217.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: HE CAN DISH AND HE CAN SET THE TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome Payton, who point guard for the Palmdale High boys' basketball team, 
sparks the baseball team as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton plays shortstop and bats leadoff for the Golden League leaders and is 
hitting .484, has scored 30 runs and stolen 30 bases in 31 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's swinging the bat good and really doing the job," Coach Kent Bothwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter, he wheels and deals. In the spring, he wheels and steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton, a 6-foot, 170-pound senior, scored 10.6 points per game to help lead 
the Palmdale basketball team to a 24-4 record and the Southern Section Division 
I-A semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a second-team selection on The Times' All-Valley team. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been a gem on the diamond too, and last Friday had a near-perfect game. 
Payton went five for five, scored five runs, stole three bases and drove in 
five runs. GOLDEN LEAGUE

 Making a Pitch 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Coach Ed T'Sas has been singing the praises of center fielder 
Chris Tapia, hoping to catch the attention of professional scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as good as any center fielder we've seen," T'Sas said. "He does all 
those things that you're supposed to do as a hitter -- hit for power, hit to 
all fields, run and bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always talk about the pitchers up here, (Quartz Hill's Roger) Worley 
and (Palmdale's David) Glick, but we've got hitters, too. Whenever a scout 
calls me, I tell him Tapia's our man." 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia has had an excellent senior season, leading the Antelopes to contention 
for the league lead, and hitting .442. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has 18 extra-base hits, including 10 doubles and six triples. MARMONTE

 Share the Victory Stand 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park second baseman Shawn Adams hit a home run in the top of the 
eighth inning to beat Simi Valley the first time the teams met this season, and 
he had several chances to be the hero when the teams played again last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams came to bat in a tie game with runners at first and second and one out 
in the fifth, but grounded into a double play. He also led off the eighth and 
10th innings, but failed to reach base both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Jeff Bennett, who hit a game-winning home run in the top of the 
seventh to defeat Thousand Oaks, won the Simi Valley game with a two-run shot 
in the bottom of the 10th. Newbury Park won, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad," Adams said. "I wanted to be the only one (who had beaten) Simi. 
Bennett already had Thousand Oaks. I wanted Simi."

 Newbury Park senior Keith Smith put on a throwing clinic before the Simi 
Valley game. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing center field during warm-ups for the benefit of about two dozen scouts 
who had come to see his arm, Smith threw several one-hop bullets to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really fair to the right fielders to have to throw after that," 
Coach Gary Fabricius said.

 Sophomore Nathan Kaup continued to be the key to Camarillo's run into playoff 
contention after an 0-4 league start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scorpions won five consecutive league games entering the week. During the 
five-game streak, Kaup hit .470 and made no errors at shortstop. On the mound, 
he was 3-0 with a 1.23 earned-run average.

 Westlake Coach Rich Herrera is puzzled by what's happened to his team, which 
seemed to be peaking after it won a tournament in Las Vegas in early April. But 
the Warriors lost eight of 10 games after returning from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so frustrating," Herrera said. "We've tried different things and the 
outcome is basically the same." WEST VALLEY LEAGUE

 Forging Ahead

 As expected, senior Randy Wolf has carried El Camino Real this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the week, the left-hander had completed each of his nine starts and 
was 8-1 with a 1.11 ERA. But there is more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's City Section 4-A Division player of the year also leads the team 
in every hitting category: batting (.530, 26 for 49), doubles (four), triples 
(five), home runs (three) and RBIs (19). 
</P>
<P>
 He has done all this despite enduring the sudden death of his father, James, 
of a heart attack, on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's carrying on," Coach Mike Maio said. "Which is all you can do."

 Cleveland has a team ERA of 3.05. The Cavaliers, however, are 3-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't hit," assistant Marty Siegel said. "Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the week, the team batting average was .241, the slugging percentage 
only .291.

 Tony Williams leads the Cavaliers in RBIs with six. By contrast, eight players 
for hard-hitting Chatsworth have more RBIs. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE

 First-place Monroe held a 4-2 lead over Birmingham on Monday when Monroe Coach 
Kevin Campbell called upon hard-throwing ace Joel Zamudio in the seventh to put 
the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zamudio (3-2) was looking to pick up his third save, the Braves had 
other ideas. Second-place Birmingham took advantage of Zamudio's wildness (a 
walk and a hit batsman) and scored two earned runs on David Cohen's two-run 
double in the seventh to tie it, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his appearance, Zamudio, who walked four and hit three batters in six 
innings of relief, had pitched 28 innings without giving up an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio, who struck out nine, did not get the loss. Mike Perez, who started 
the game and was relieved in the fourth, returned to the mound in the 13th and 
in the 14th surrendered the game-winning hit to John Ransom. PACIFIC LEAGUE

 Hoover Vacuum Is Farver 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover was the first team to beat Crescenta Valley in a league game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-0 upset has served as a huge confidence booster for the Tornadoes (10-7, 
9-3) who have won five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really coming together as a team," Hoover Coach Bob Cooper said. 
"That win over (Crescenta Valley) really did a lot for us. It's given us quite 
a boost." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior shortstop Mike Farver has helped lead the team with exceptional 
defensive play, according to Cooper. Farver played second base last season and 
has adjusted to his new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been absolutely fabulous," Cooper said. "In the last three games he's 
been on fire. He's made some incredible plays." EAST VALLEY LEAGUE

 Although there was disappointment in the Poly dugout after the Parrots' 1-0 
eight-inning loss to Sylmar Monday, there was also a few swollen chests, 
prideful that the Parrots proved they can play with Sylmar, the state's 
sixth-ranked team according to Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Poly) won 12 straight (before facing Sylmar) and they have nothing to be 
ashamed of," Poly Coach Chuck Schwal said. "They lost to a good team, but we 
did our job. You never want to lose, but when you do, you hope it's to a good 
team.

 "And you want to go out with your guns blazin' and we did. We gave 'em a good

 Monday's Sylmar-Poly game brought back memories of years past, when the 
outcome of teams' matchups would inevitably dictate which team won the league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been two years since the game between the two schools has been 
competitive. Sylmar was dominant in 1993, Poly prevailed in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella was happy to see the rivalry rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why you practice all the time, for these games," Donatella said. 
"(Poly) matured a lot since last year." CAMINO REAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Lead 
</P>
<P>
 An ideal leadoff man: Bell-Jeff's Josh Readman hit safely in 17 of the team's 
first 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior left fielder and second baseman has multiple hits in six games and 
leads the team with a .415 batting average and .566 slugging percentage. He 
leads Bell-Jeff with 22 hits in 53 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's incredible for a leadoff guy," coach Craig Sherwood said. "He's the 
reason we're doing so well lately. He has speed, power and consistency." Around 
the Leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley freshman Kevin Barlow, the team's starting third baseman, 
had seven hits in eight at-bats last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cleveland pitchers surrendered only one earned run in a recent four-game 
stretch. The team went 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth shortstop Bryan LaCour went six for eight last week to hike his 
average to .500. The Chancellors have won 13 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 97 plate appearances, Harvard-Westlake's Jon Schaeffer has been hit by a 
pitch or drawn a walk 32 times. The Stanford-bound senior catcher is hitting 
.492, which gives him an on-base percentage of .690. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chaminade may have one of the Mission League's best pitchers -- sophomore 
Gabe Crecion. The 6-foot-4, 210-pound hurler has a 7-2 record and a 1.96 
earned-run average. A couple of weeks ago Crecion's fastball was clocked at 86 
m.p.h. Not bad for a guy who just turned 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa's Charlie Boch was seven for 14 with 13 RBIs over a four-game 
stretch. "I wouldn't want to face him right now if I were pitching," Coach 
Richard Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa baserunners have stolen 34 bases in 35 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royal shortstop Joel Mellinger had nine RBIs in two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Faith Baptist pitcher Judd Granzow has 107 strikeouts in 53 1/3 innings.

STRENGTHENING DOLLAR CALMS STOCKS, BONDS; MARKETS: ADMINISTRATION'S 
INTERVENTION IS A SUCCESS. MANY TRADERS STAY SIDELINED AHEAD OF APRIL 
EMPLOYMENT DATA. 
</P>

<P>
 The dollar extended its rebound against most major currencies Thursday, 
helping to soothe stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the dollar's gains Wednesday and Thursday, boosted by market 
intervention engineered by the Clinton Administration, suggested that the 
battle to strengthen the battered buck is being won so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar leaped to 102.85 Japanese yen from 101.85 on 
Wednesday. It also rose to 1.667 German marks from 1.654 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the central banks of 15 other nations 
intervened heavily in the U.S. and European markets Wednesday, buying up 
dollars. It was the largest coordinated intervention by the leading 
industrialized nations since August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there wasn't any sign of central bank buying on Thursday, analysts said 
currency traders treaded lightly for fear of triggering more intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are nervous about the central banks coming back," said Earl Johnson, 
foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. "Their 
attack was very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's ongoing decline this year, which accelerated over the past week, 
raised concerns about higher U.S. inflation and the flight of foreign capital 
from U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
 A falling dollar boosts the price of exports coming into the United States, 
and also devalues U.S. assets held by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's decision to defend the dollar helped the bond 
market stabilize for a second day, traders said. Foreign investors would be 
more likely to purchase U.S. bonds if they thought the dollar would rise, 
because a stronger dollar automatically boosts the value of dollar-denominated 
assets held by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond held steady at 7.33%, and shorter-term 
yields also were mostly unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said the bond market's flat day had more to do with 
hesitation ahead of today's April employment report than the dollar's rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts estimate that unemployment remained steady at 6.5% in 
April and that non-farm payrolls rose by just under 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A stronger-than-expected employment report could send interest rates up again, 
in anticipation of another credit-tightening move by the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks closed mixed in quiet trading Thursday, as traders there 
also awaited today's employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smartest thing anybody could say about this market is that it's looking 
for something to push it one way or another," said Richard Meyer, head equity 
trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials eased 1.78 points to 3,695.97, as declining issues 
narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was only 
256 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, however, managed to edge 
up 0.25 point to 740.55. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Weiss, executive vice president at IDS Advisory Group, said the market's 
relative calm in the past few sessions could be a sign it was nearing the end 
of its correction phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volatility is starting to dampen down," he said. "We're not getting the 
kind of swings on news we were getting four or five weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance stocks rose amid sentiment that the downward pressure on premiums 
is easing. Aetna rose 1 to 53 7/8, Marsh & McLennan jumped 2 to 87, Chubb 
gained 1 1/4 to 78 1/4 and General Re leaped 4 1/8 to 120 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks also were strong, as crude oil prices jumped in reaction to 
the outbreak of civil war in Yemen. Light, sweet crude oil for June settled at 
$17.29 a barrel, up 43 cents on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the International Energy Agency revises upward its forecast for oil 
demand in industrialized countries this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among energy shares, Arco gained 2 1/8 to 99 3/8, Phillips Petroleum added 7/8 
to 31 7/8, Chevron rose 7/8 to 87 and Royal Dutch advanced 2 1/8 to 107 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many health care issued continued to advance. Abbey Healthcare rose 1 to 21 
3/4, Wellpoint Health jumped 1 1/8 to 33 7/8, United HealthCare gained 1 to 48 
3/4 and Ramsay-HMO surged 2 to 65 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, electric utility stocks suffered another drop. The Dow 
utility index fell 2.11 points to 192.79, a new 52-week low, resuming the slide 
that began last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Gas & Electric tumbled 7/8 to 24 3/4, San Diego Gas & Electric lost 
5/8 to 21, American Electric Power dropped 7/8 to 30 1/2 and Florida's FPL 
Group slumped 2 1/8 to 31 3/4. Merrill Lynch downgraded FPL stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Weak utility stocks often are viewed as a bad omen for interest rates, because 
they frequently decline in advance of rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks also lost more ground, perhaps on disappointment over April 
sales reported Wednesday. Ford fell 1 to 59, Chrysler dropped 1 1/4 to 45 3/4 
and GM sank 1 1/8 to 55 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Encino-based security firm Pinkerton slid 1 5/8 to 
16 5/8 after reporting that it barely broke even in the first quarter, despite 
higher revenues. The company blamed certain start-up costs for new accounts and 
"strong price competition" in the security-guard market. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index rallied, climbing above the psychologically 
important 3,100 level. It rose 35.5 points to 3,106.00. In Frankfurt, the DAX 
index eased 13.18 points to 2,235.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Mexican and Japanese markets were closed for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, coffee futures topped $1 a pound for the first time in 
more than 3 1/2 years on speculative buying ignited by tight supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a buying frenzy," said analyst Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Green coffee beans for May delivery surged 5.45 cents on New York's Coffee, 
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange to $1.002 a pound, the highest daily settlement for 
near-term deliveries since Sept. 5, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee futures have rallied 27.7 cents this year, or about 38%, as production 
and exports have dwindled due to nearly five years of low prices and poor 
growing weather in some producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have also been driven higher by an agreement among 28 producer 
countries to hold back up to 20% of normal exports. The countries began 
retaining shipments Oct. 1 but stopped last week when a 20-day moving price 
average reached 80 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Their agreement requires the producers to begin releasing the retained stocks 
when the indicator price reaches 85 cents. It stood at 82.83 cents Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, near-term gold futures fell on New York's Comex to $373.60 an 
ounce, off $3. Silver fell 6.8 cents to $5.11 an ounce.

CAMEL 'COLLECTOR'S PACKS' HAVE ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVISTS FUMING; TOBACCO: R.J. 
REYNOLDS' ACTION IS SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT TO LURE YOUNGSTERS. COMPANY INSISTS ITS 
MOTIVES ARE PURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The smirking face of Joe Camel has resurfaced on the last place that 
anti-smoking activists want to see him: cigarette packs. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocative cartoon mascot for Camel cigarettes -- denounced by critics 
for its appeal to children -- is being nationally distributed by tobacco giant 
R.J. Reynolds on cardboard "collector's packs" of Camel Lights as part of what 
the company is calling a temporary promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the surgeon general harshly criticized the cartoon mascot for 
its appeal to children. And earlier this year, the company took heat after it 
added female camel caricatures to its ad mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing experts say the latest action by the tobacco company is a clear 
attempt to boost sales by more closely connecting the product with its highly 
publicized ad campaign. Reynolds insists its motives are pure. 
</P>
<P>
 The new packaging "is just a fun thing for our franchise of smokers," said 
Maura Ellis, a spokeswoman for Reynolds. "We've said all along that if we felt 
the cartoon character was causing kids to begin smoking, we would stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics contend that Reynolds' action is an attempt to get children to 
reach for the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new low in advertising," fumed John F. Banzhaf III, executive 
director of Action on Smoking & Health. "Children, of course, will now want to 
pick up the packs and collect them. This is the most despicable thing that R.J. 
Reynolds has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite claims by Reynolds executives that the cartoon camel has no special 
appeal to children, "it has become a status symbol among young kids," said 
David Altman, president of the group Stop Teen-age Addiction to Tobacco. 
"Obviously, the company plans on pushing the camel cartoon just as far as it 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest promotion features five different camel characters -- four of which 
are members of the imaginary "Hard Pack" musical quartet, Ellis said. All of 
them also appear in print ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing pictures of the big-nosed camels on the packs "is a way to get 
consumers to look twice," said Stephen A. Greyser, marketing professor at 
Harvard University. It prompts consumers to immediately link the product with 
the ads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds and the rest of the tobacco industry have faced mounting public 
criticism for months. Two weeks ago, top tobacco executives were humbled by a 
grilling from a congressional committee. Shortly before that, a report from 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders specifically criticized the Joe Camel ads for 
their "special" appeal to youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Journal of the American Medical Assn. several years ago found 
that some 6-year-olds said they were as familiar with Joe Camel as with Mickey 
Mouse. Another survey found that nearly 25% of all Camel smokers are under 25 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has also turned the cartoon camel into a promotional bonanza. It 
publishes catalogues that encourage smokers to purchase Camels by luring them 
with an array of free items -- from T-shirts to leather jackets -- in exchange 
for proof-of-purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joe Camel caricature was created by a British artist in 1974 for a French 
ad agency. It debuted in the United States in 1988 for the 75th anniversary of 
the brand. At the time, the camel's face showed up on all sorts of promotional 
materials -- even briefly making an appearance on a limited number of cigarette 
packs before anyone knew who or what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Nicholas Price, who created Joe Camel, told a reporter that he was 
"mortified" the campaign appeared to attract children. After all, he said, he 
is a father of seven.

HOME BUYERS ARE CAUGHT IN A RACE WITH RISING RATES; REAL ESTATE: AS LOAN COSTS 
CLIMB, OWNERSHIP WILL ELUDE SOME WHO WAITED. ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES CAN 
HELP.

 When Todd and Marilyn Bentson started looking for their first home in 
Riverside County earlier this year, they figured they could comfortably afford 
a nice house in the range of $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With fixed mortgage rates under 7% and a down payment of nearly $30,000, their 
monthly payments would have been less than $800. But by the time the young 
couple narrowed their list of prospective purchases last month, rates had 
jumped to more than 8%, and the best loan they could find called for monthly 
payments of more than $900. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably still buy one of those houses," Marilyn Bentson said, "but 
we'll sure miss that extra $100 or $150 a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Southern California, would-be home borrowers have been squeezed by the 
rise in mortgage rates that accelerated in February, when the Federal Reserve 
Board began raising interest rates to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some borrowers, such as the Bentsons, are biting the bullet and buying anyway. 
Others, including many homeowners who want to refinance their current loans, 
are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages with low introductory payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some builders and real estate agents are blaming higher interest 
rates for a sudden drop in sales. Many local lenders have already begun laying 
off clerks and loan processors now that business has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most analysts believe interest rates won't rise too much more this 
year, some worry that any unexpected increases could snuff out the region's 
recent housing rally. And while higher rates have so far knocked relatively few 
buyers out of the market, real estate agents say consumers are beginning to 
grow cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was almost at a fever pitch has now converted to, 'Maybe we'll buy, 
maybe we won't,' " Pasadena real estate agent Ricki Weinberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have shot up to 8.5% from about 7% 
when the Fed initiated the first of its three rate hikes this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-point increase has added about $154 to the monthly cost of a new 
$150,000 mortgage, and it slammed the brakes on a long refinancing boom. 
Refinancings account for just 10% to 15% of lenders' new loan business today, 
down from about 70% earlier in the year, according to the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rise in rates hasn't dampened refinancing -- it has (virtually) turned 
off the spigot," said Warren V. Lasko, executive vice president of the trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 California's largest mortgage banker, Pasadena-based Countrywide Funding, said 
Wednesday that it has trimmed more than 500 people from its loan production 
division -- nearly 20% of the department -- since its mortgage business peaked 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Insurance Co.'s home loan company, one of the nation's largest, 
said earlier this week that it will lay off about 600 people, or 12% of its 
staff, by the end of May and that many of those cuts will be made in its huge 
loan-processing center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers are having to make some major adjustments. Many who went ahead with 
refinancings have had to change their plans in midstream as rates have shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rick and Cheryl Maholchic first started shopping for a loan to refinance 
their $275,000 Agoura home in February, they hoped to get a fixed-rate loan at 
about 7% to replace their adjustable-rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time they had chosen a lender and filed their application, rates 
had jumped to 8%, making it less worthwhile to pursue a refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rates shot up the day we got the offer, so we had to take a step back and 
think of something else," said Rick Maholchic, a 29-year-old insurance 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 They did a little more loan shopping and found a lender willing to make a 
"hybrid" mortgage that carries a 4% fixed rate for the first five years, 
converting to an adjustable-rate loan for the remaining 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cut $800 off our monthly payments, and we'll probably move before the 
rate has a chance to go up five years from now," Maholchic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some developers and real estate agents say the rate upswing has actually 
helped their business by pushing cautious home buyers off the sidelines and 
into the market before rates go even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the worst of the rate hikes are over and that we'll still have a 
strong spring home-buying season," said Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist for 
the California Assn. of Realtors. But if rates continue upward, she said, "more 
people would get pushed out of the market and sales would take a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say prospective buyers of relatively modest means -- the people one 
lender described as "the folks who really notice the difference between a 
$650-a-month payment and a $700 payment" -- have seen their home-buying dreams 
put on hold by the rate hikes.  
</P>
<P>
 Upland-based Inco Homes caters to these buyers. One of the few Southern 
California developers which builds single-family homes for as little as 
$60,000, Inco said its orders for new homes at the end of March were half what 
they were a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Inco's stock price plunged 25% in value last Friday after the company said its 
first-quarter profit fell 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "First-time buyers are always the first to feel the pain when interest rates 
go up, because they're the ones who are living on the tightest budgets," said 
Ira Norris, Inco's chief executive. "For them, a one-point rise in rates can 
make the difference between being able to buy a home and not being able to 
buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers started coming back in April. "Maybe the shock has worn off," Norris 
said. "Mortgage rates at 8% or 8.5% are still a great bargain, even if they're 
higher than they were a few months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The rising rates have frustrated John Hartley, who recently went into escrow 
to buy a home in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 When he sold his Coto de Caza home in south Orange County a month ago, he had 
hoped to buy a home near the beach with a fixed-rate loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But "since we sold, it seems like interest rates have gone up two or three 
points," he said. He was looking at fixed rates of 8.5% and adjustable rates 
pegged to fast-moving indexes, and at big loan fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley, a civilian jet simulator technician for the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, ended up with an adjustable-rate loan that starts at 5.65% and 
probably won't go much above 6.1% in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's paying a bit more to reduce the ceiling -- the most he could possibly 
pay if rates went through the roof -- to 9.95%. "Interest rates," he says, "are 
like going to Vegas and throwing the dice."

CHRYSLER PLANS ELECTRIC VERSION OF MINIVAN; ENVIRONMENT: IT SAYS THE VEHICLES 
WILL MEET STATE'S 1998 ZERO-EMISSIONS RULE, BUT IT WARNS THAT BATTERY 
TECHNOLOGY IS LAGGING AND BUYING MAY BE LUKEWARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite concerns about the advancement of battery technology, Chrysler Corp. 
said Thursday that it is committed to building electric-powered minivans to 
meet California's 1998 zero-emissions mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chrysler will build electric cars for California," Francois Castaing, vice 
president of vehicle engineering, said in a briefing with reporters. "We have 
no interest in fighting electric cars, per se." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes a week before the California Air Resources Board is to 
conduct a technical review of the mandate, which requires 2% of vehicles sold 
in 1998 to be emissions-free. Only electric-powered vehicles now qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement from Chrysler, until now considered the most pessimistic of 
Detroit's auto makers toward zero-emissions technology, is likely to bolster 
the case of electric vehicle backers before the ARB. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's true Chrysler is ready to build and sell electric vehicles, that's 
very good news," said Melanie Savage, spokesman for Southern California Edison 
Co.'s electric vehicle transportation division. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chrysler continued to send out a mixed message by emphasizing that 
the state of battery technology is likely to make the electric minivans 
unattractive to most consumers because of short range and possibly high cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have doubts that people will buy this vehicle," Castaing said. "But having 
said that, we are going to try. We are going to put it in the marketplace and 
see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's skepticism about the willingness of Californians to buy electric 
vehicles is challenged in a poll, to be released today in Sacramento, which 
concludes that 8% of the state's voters -- or 1 million people -- would 
"definitely" buy such a car for between $20,000 and $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll -- conducted by Santa Monica-based opinion research firm Fairbank, 
Maslin, Maullin & Associates and commissioned by environmental groups -- also 
concludes that 60% of the voters surveyed support the 1998 emissions mandate. 
The poll reports only a modest decline in interest when those surveyed were 
told about such drawbacks as the high cost of battery replacement and the 
limited driving range of electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler and other auto makers are asking the ARB to appoint an independent 
group to assess the status of battery technology. The industry would be willing 
to help pay for such a study, Castaing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's announcement appeared designed to give it a public relations edge 
over Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., which say they can meet the 
mandate but have been more vocal in their opposition to the zero-emissions 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent testimony to California regulators, GM said it opposes the mandate 
because "commercially viable" electric vehicles cannot be produced by 1998. 
Last week, Ford said it wants the ARB to modify the mandate by allowing Ford to 
field demonstration fleets and sell partially built cars to conversion 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's statement also highlights a potential competitive edge, because the 
company plans to meet the mandate by using an existing production line. It also 
has to produce fewer electric vehicles, because its sales in California are 
much lower than those of GM and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler said the electric-powered minivan will be modeled on its popular 
seven-seat Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager vehicles, which are being 
redesigned for the 1995 model year. The price tag can be held down because the 
electric version can be produced on the same line as gas-powered models. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest unknown is what battery will be used. The company is hoping that 
nickel-metal-hydride batteries -- a mid-term technology that can power vehicles 
up to 140 miles on a charge -- will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, it may have to rely on near-term batteries, such as advanced lead acid 
or nickel-cadmium, which have ranges under 80 miles on a single charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to wait and see what battery develops," Castaing said, "and hope 
for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers argue that battery technology has not progressed sufficiently 
to allow for electric vehicles that are affordable and have adequate range.

 S&P Lowers Debt Rating on Bankers Trust: The move by Standard & Poor's Corp. 
reflects concern over the bank's risky trading activities in global financial 
markets.The change, which also includes the bank's BT Overseas Finance 
subsidiary, affects $5.6 billion of outstanding debt. S&P reduced Bankers Trust 
New York Corp.'s senior debt rating by one notch, to AA- from AA. The rating is 
still one of the highest the agency assigns. But the move is considered a 
symbolic warning shot from S&P about the bank's aggressive operations in the 
trading business.

 Mortgage Rates Rise: The average interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate 
mortgages rose to 8.53% this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said. 
It was the first time the rate has been above 8.5% since June 12, 1992, when 
the average was 8.54%.This week's average was up from 8.32% the previous week. 
The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in October and in recent weeks has been 
between 1 1/2 and 1 3/4 percentage points above that low. On one-year, 
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 
5.25%, up from 5.15% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option in 
refinancing mortgages, averaged 8.03% this week, up from 7.85% a week earlier. 
The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

 Signs Grow of Blockbuster-Viacom Deal Unraveling: Blockbuster Corp. Chairman 
H. Wayne Huizenga, in an indication that the company's acquisition by Viacom 
Inc. could be on the verge of collapsing, said Blockbuster's board may not back 
the $5.3-billion deal. Huizenga said directors still believe the combination of 
Blockbuster with Paramount Communications Inc. and Viacom is a good strategy, 
but he said in a letter to shareholders that, "given the current price levels 
of Viacom stock, there can be no assurance that the board would be able to 
recommend the transaction at the time of any shareholder meeting called to vote 
on the merger." Viacom and Blockbuster are reportedly discussing joint ventures 
in cable and possibly a Blockbuster purchase of New York-based Madison Square 
Garden.

THE ECONOMY; ANALYSTS CALL LEAP IN LABOR COSTS AN ABERRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gauge of wage inflation shot up at the fastest pace in three years during 
the first quarter, but private economists and the Clinton Administration 
insisted that the sharp increase was an aberration and not a signal of 
spiraling prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Thursday that unit labor costs in the January-March 
quarter jumped at an annual rate of 5% over the last quarter of 1993, the 
steepest increase since a 6.1% surge in the final three months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also suggests a dramatic slowing in non-farm productivity growth, 
up just 0.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 6.4% gain from October through 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 But economists said both figures overstate the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The jump in labor costs -- which account for two-thirds of the cost of a 
product -- is an aberration, said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not consistent with all the other information we have available to us," 
he said. "Labor is still receiving relatively tame and modest increases in 
wages, salaries and benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, unit labor costs were up just 0.8% over the first quarter of 1993, 
suggesting that inflation should remain near current levels, said economist 
Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Co. Consumer prices were rising at an annual 
rate of 2.5% in March, down from 2.7% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wescott, an economist with the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers, also said the report is misleading, noting that a separate 
measurement of labor costs was well-behaved during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report last week, the Labor Department said its employment cost index 
edged up just 0.7% in the first quarter, down from 0.8% in the fourth quarter 
and the smallest increase in 7 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to put (unit labor costs) in context with the other data," Wescott 
said. "This is one piece of information on the quarter that is not corroborated 
by other important indicators." 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts consider the index the more reliable of the two inflation 
gauges. They differ somewhat in the factors that are measured. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing 
first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 17,000 last week to 
350,000. Analysts said the report suggests that job growth slowed in April to 
about 170,000, from 456,000 in March, which had the biggest jump in more than 
six years. The department releases the April employment report today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the productivity report, the Labor Department said first-quarter growth was 
the slowest since a 0.4% decline in the second quarter of last year. 
Productivity is defined as output per number of hours worked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zandi contended this too was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the relatively slow growth in the first quarter, it's more 
representative to look over last year, when there have been strong gains," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth in productivity reflects the nation's living standards and the 
competitiveness of its products overseas. If it remains strong, inflationary 
pressures are less likely to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Zandi attributed recent growth to corporate restructuring and downsizing and 
to major technical advances. He suggested that harsh winter weather may have 
played a significant role in the slowdown and said, "We may be in for a period 
of stronger productivity growth than we have seen over the past several years." 
</P>
<P>
 However, other economists contend that recent productivity improvements were 
the result of the recession and recovery, in which companies worked their 
employees longer and harder instead of hiring more people.  
</P>
<P>
 As the economy improves, they say, businesses will begin adding to their 
payrolls and productivity growth will slow. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said output grew just 2.6% in the first quarter, down from the 
fourth quarter's 8.9% advance. At the same time, the number of hours worked 
increased 2%, compared to 2.4% in the fourth quarter.

THE ECONOMY; EARLY EASTER BLAMED IN LACKLUSTER RETAIL RESULTS 
</P>

<P>
 The nation's major retailers Thursday reported lackluster sales for the month 
of April, but industry analysts said the slow business resulted from the fact 
that Easter came early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With Easter on April 3, consumers did much of their holiday buying in March, 
siphoning off business that normally would show up in April and causing some 
retailers to show modest sales declines last month. Retailers generally 
consider March and April sales together when assessing their performance in 
early spring. Considering both months, analysts said, the spring sales trend is 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores, operator of the 
Broadway department store chain, had a 2.8% drop in same-store sales -- revenue 
from stores open at least 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking the two months of March and April together," Carter Hawley Hale 
President David Dworkin said, "this year they were ahead 2.2% compared to last 
year on a same-store basis. Additionally, last year's April showed exceptional 
comparable-store gains of 14.6%, and so we are not disappointed by this month's 
small relative decline of 2.8%." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, California retail sales were soft in April, reflecting the 
stronger Easter buying in March. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis-based May Department Stores Co., which has a major California 
presence -- reported a 0.1% same-store sales gain for April compared to the 
same period a year ago. The retailer operates the Robinsons-May department 
store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp., operator of the Target and Mervyn's chains, also reported 
modest sales gains for April. Target and Mervyn's both had a same-store sales 
increase of 1% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Target's performance in California is about the same as the rest of the 
country," said Ann Barkelew, spokeswoman for the Minneapolis-based Dayton 
Hudson. "Mervyn's' California performance was its best in the state in more 
than a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Dayton Hudson -- which also operates the Dayton's, Hudson's and 
Marshall Fields department store chains -- had a 2% same-store increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, retail sales climbed 3.3% in April compared to the same period a 
year ago, according to an index compiled by Salomon Bros. In comparison, 
nationwide sales in March rose 11.1%.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Feiner, a Salomon analyst, said the index for March and April combined 
was a healthy 7.4%. He expects retailers to continue posting good gains, 
particularly because consumer demand for apparel has picked up after a long dry 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
 While some store operators said sales were weaker than expected, some 
retailers -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, for example -- turned in very 
strong performances. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said sales from 
stores open at least a year rose 8%, and Sears' same-store sales advanced 
12.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 A more modest same-store gain of 1.2% was reported by Federated Department 
Stores, the Cincinnati-based operator of Bloomingdales. Federated is expected 
to continue its effort to acquire R.H. Macy & Co., which operates the Bullock's 
and I. Magnin chains.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy reports its sales later than other retailers because it is in Chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization. Macy earlier this week said its same-store sales for 
March rose 14.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a number of major retailers reported same-store sales were lower in 
April compared to the same period a year ago. For example, sales fell 2.1% at 
J.C. Penney stores. Limited Inc. had an 8% drop in sales for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gap Inc. said sales at stores open at least year were unchanged in April.

CHEROKEE DONS BRAND-NEW LOOK; APPAREL COMPANY WILL TEST BACK-TO-BASICS LINE IN 
SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Cherokee Inc. emerged from its bankruptcy reorganization last May, 
nothing has been quite the same at the clothing and shoe company. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess? Inc. co-founder Georges Marciano and Saudi businessman Abdullah Taha 
Bakhsh have scooped up Cherokee's stock. Together they own about 32%. Cherokee 
Apparel, the company's main division, is now being run by a team of former Lee 
Apparel executives. Even Cherokee's 20-year-old Indian head logo is history. 
</P>
<P>
 But will any of this turn the company's fortunes around? 
</P>
<P>
 That will be answered this summer when Cherokee, based in Sunland, tests its 
revived back-to-basics fashion strategy under Joe Elles, a 12-year veteran of 
Lee Apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming president of Cherokee Apparel in September, Elles has discarded 
Cherokee's scattered array of clothing, including all of its dressy outfits and 
combination wear. Cherokee's new fall lineup, which will be shipped this month, 
instead focuses on a much narrower line of jeans, casual pants and shirts for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they didn't stand for anything and they had everything," Elles 
said. Before joining Cherokee, Elles, 39, was Lee's vice president and general 
manager, the No. 2 post at the $1-billion jeans company. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles, known as a high-charging salesman, has used his industry connections to 
win back business for Cherokee from retailers such as Carter Hawley Hale 
Stores, operator of the Broadway chain. Carter Hawley and other big retailers 
had dropped Cherokee in recent years because of the company's financial 
troubles and what they described as its lack of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley says it is now impressed with Cherokee's new system to replenish 
inventory of key pants on a weekly basis. Previously, Elles said, it took 
Cherokee as long as 12 weeks to restock store racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway is just the sort of moderately priced department store in which Elles 
wants to position Cherokee. So he is curtailing business at discount stores and 
doing less with retailers such as Mervyn's, which at one time accounted for 25% 
of Cherokee Apparel's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles is also cutting Cherokee's retail pants prices by $4 to $8 a pair. Elles 
dumped the Indian head logo because, he said, it added no value to the product, 
replacing it with more informative labels stressing fit and fabric. And he 
plans to launch a $7-million advertising campaign later this year, double last 
year's ad budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get (customers) to try it on," Elles said, "we think they'll buy it 
because of the fit." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a big if. Department stores are entrenched with a few big brands 
along with a clutter of private labels and also-rans. In women's jeans, for 
example, Elles is up against Lee, which dominates with almost 20% of that 
market, compared to 1% for Cherokee. In the casual pants market for women, J. 
C. Penney's private label is No. 1, followed by Levi's popular Dockers brand 
and then Cherokee. Cherokee Apparel also sells tops, but three-quarters of its 
business is in pants and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, the stores in America could get rid of half of the brands, and 
there'd still be enough to cover everybody," said Harry Bernard, a partner at 
Colton Bernard, an apparel consultant in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard says Cherokee has a well-recognized name and has built a good-size 
volume. He adds that Elles "is a hell of a salesman." But Cherokee has much to 
overcome, Bernard said. "The image of Cherokee was that it was everywhere. It 
was not a confined product, and it didn't have a specific niche." 
</P>
<P>
 "We relied on the same thing for too long and the consumer rejected it," said 
Cary Cooper, who has been Cherokee's chief financial officer since 1988 and is 
one of the few executives who survived the shakeout at Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc.'s sales peaked at $237 million in its fiscal year that ended 
May, 1991, but sank to $157 million in the year that ended May, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding Cherokee's problems were its massive debt and interest expenses, 
incurred in a $174-million leveraged buyout in 1989. The heavy debts forced 
Cherokee to file Chapter 11 protection in April, 1993. When the company emerged 
from Bankruptcy Court the following month, its $190-million debt and 
obligations were pared in half in a swap deal that gave creditors controlling 
interest in Cherokee's common stock. Shortly after, Robert Margolis, who led 
Cherokee's leveraged buyout, resigned as chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis, who helped start Cherokee Apparel in 1983, also helped recruit 
Elles. Elles had risen through the ranks at Lee and helped turn around the 
company by reassigning executives and pushing for more ads aimed at such events 
as the Super Bowl. By all accounts, Elles had a bright future at Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I counseled with told me I shouldn't go," said Elles, who spends his 
weekends in Wisconsin, where his family still lives. "But I decided to because 
I thought Cherokee's brand franchise was still healthy . . . and the chance to 
be president, and to turn a company around. That was a great challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Elles came to Cherokee on a two-year contract that includes stock options if 
the company succeeds. To help him, Elles has hired half a dozen executives from 
Lee to run Cherokee's sales operations, and he has brought in designers from 
fashion names such as Liz Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles says his goal is to make Cherokee profitable in its next fiscal year 
ending in May, 1995. For the nine months that ended Feb. 26, its latest 
reporting period, Cherokee posted a loss of $8.5 million on sales of $85 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 Elles hopes to boost revenue with products such as jeans. Cherokee has never 
had a significant presence in the jeans market which is crowded with brand 
names. Elles says Cherokee's pants will cost 10% less than Lee's and 25% less 
than Levi's. "We'll have the best value in the marketplace," he said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; SPINOFF OF UNIT HAS JEFFERIES STOCK 
FLYING HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you're trying to sell something, but the bids are coming in dismally low, 
it helps to get a few more opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy has worked beautifully for Los Angeles-based brokerage Jefferies 
Group this year. Unable to attract many buyers to its stock, even though the 
price was less than seven times earnings, Jefferies in March decided to spin 
out its crown jewel technology unit as a separate entity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 3.7 million shares in Jefferies' Investment Technology Group 
Inc. hit the market at $13 a piece, and quickly jumped to close at $16.25 on 
Nasdaq. They ended Thursday at $15.875. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of parent Jefferies, meanwhile, have zoomed from $30.50 just before the 
spin-out announcement on March 15 to $43 on Nasdaq now -- even as most 
brokerage stocks have plunged on worries about the bull market's longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 By asking the market to value ITG separately, Jefferies has boosted its own 
worth because it retains about 82% of ITG's stock. Thus, the better the public 
reception for ITG, the higher the implicit added value in Jefferies' own stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was ITG snapped up so readily? Handily, many of the institutions that 
Jefferies needed to attract to ITG stock were already ITG customers. 
</P>
<P>
 ITG's chief asset is POSIT, an automated trading system that allows big 
investors to trade stocks confidentially among themselves, away from the stock 
exchanges and the Nasdaq market. Three times a day, POSIT's computer matches 
buy and sell orders from ITG institutional customers, determines a price for 
each stock by referencing current market prices, then executes the trades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big investors use POSIT partly for efficiency: Rather than deal with 
brokerages' often wide bid and asked spreads for thinly traded stocks, 
investors can use POSIT to trade at prices within the official market spread, 
direct with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than price, however, is POSIT's confidentiality. "You can put a 
million shares up for sale without anyone seeing you," says Jim Goff, money 
manager at Janus mutual funds in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 When trading stocks in very large blocks, camouflage is often useful. If an 
institution tries to drop a huge number of shares for sale on the open market, 
other investors may immediately see that block, and the market price of the 
stock can dive accordingly. With POSIT, the transactions are visible only after 
the fact. Thus, big trades can occur without moving the market price of a 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 POSIT isn't alone in this so-called third-market trading. Instinet, a Reuters 
unit, also crosses blocks of stocks for big investors. So does the Arizona 
Stock Exchange in Phoenix. Other systems also compete, and more are proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But POSIT is the largest such system operating during market hours, and its 
growth has been meteoric. In 1988, average daily trading on POSIT was 288,000 
shares. By last year's fourth quarter, POSIT was trading an average of 8.3 
million shares a day. Its customer base jumped from 140 institutions to 205 
during 1993 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that growth, POSIT and other automated third-market trading systems 
remain tiny players. POSIT's trades were a mere 2% of total New York Stock 
Exchange and Nasdaq volume in the fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To fans of the third-market trading concept, however, that as-yet minor market 
share just means the potential for expansion is huge. While brokerages, the 
exchanges and federal regulators debate the future of the stock market -- and 
the merits of exchange-floor trading versus Nasdaq -- many experts believe the 
future is already here in more price-efficient systems like POSIT. ITG is seen 
enjoying a technological lead. 
</P>
<P>
 ITG "has been profoundly helped by the total inability of the NYSE to innovate 
at a pace sufficient to meet the market's needs," says Charles Ronson of IPO 
Value Monitor newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 ITG's revenues, $50.7 million last year, have surged nearly fivefold since 
1990. The company earned 45 cents a share last year, and Ronson expects 73 
cents this year, giving the stock a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 on that 
estimate. If this is a true growth stock, that isn't an outrageous P-E. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Jefferies? At $43 a share, its P-E now is 9, based on '93 earnings 
of $4.88 a share. Given that ITG contributed just 16% of Jefferies' '93 
revenues, it's clear Jefferies is still dependent on the traditional 
institutional brokerage, investment banking and junk-bond businesses that have 
made it an important niche player on Wall Street since the early-'80s. Because 
those are highly cyclical businesses (while ITG may or may not be), the market 
may not be willing to value Jefferies much higher, for now. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a company whose stock visibility has been almost as low as that of its 
POSIT trades, the ITG spin-out may have done wonders to enhance the long-term 
potential in Jefferies' shares. The Traders' Broker 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of L.A.-based Jefferies Group have zoomed since the firm announced in 
mid-March a partial public stock offering of its trading systems division.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; SOME FOODS GIVE NEW LABEL LAW 
THE SLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Take a squeeze bottle of honey, a condiment jar and a jug of milk. What do you 
have? Three foods that are exempt from new federal food labeling regulations 
that take effect Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is letting producers of a handful of 
foods off the hook because their packages are either too round or too small to 
accommodate the new nutrition labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency lacks authority to order food companies to alter the size of their 
containers. So if the label doesn't fit, well, the food package doesn't have to 
wear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of food packages, of course, will have the new labels telling 
consumers the amount of key nutrients in a single serving. But under the 
so-called Lifesaver rule, small food packages need supply only a phone number 
or address that consumers can use to get nutritional information. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think honey bottles, condiment jars and milk jugs are larger than 
Lifesavers candy rolls, you're missing the finer points of the new labeling 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the squeeze bottle of honey from Western Commerce Corp., a City of 
Industry-based packer. The bear-shaped bottle is about as tall as two packs of 
Lifesavers.  
</P>
<P>
 The only flat surface on this bear -- its stomach -- is smaller than a roll of 
Lifesavers. In a letter to Kraft General Foods, which also has a bottle shaped 
like a bear, the FDA said such containers need provide only an address or 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to honey bears, a milk jug would seem large enough to accommodate a 
food label. But another rule applies. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons too complicated to explain here, about half of all one-gallon milk 
jugs have two indented circles that reduce the space available for labels. The 
rules allow these two-circle jugs to carry a special short-form nutrition 
label. Other milk jugs will be required to use the standard long-form label. 
</P>
<P>
 The dairy industry complained about having to use two different labels, so the 
FDA struck a compromise. The agency said milk processors can use the short-form 
on all jugs for two years, as long as they agree to modify the two-circle jugs 
during that time to make room for the standard label. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the FDA is concerned that it may have opened the door to cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have received reports that some firms plan to rework their equipment . . . 
so it only produces containers that have two or more indentations," an FDA 
official said in a letter to the Washington-based International Dairy Foods 
Assn. "This would risk regulatory action." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the nearly spherical eight-ounce condiment jar from Asta Food 
Research of Newport Beach. Here's how the FDA described the situation: "We do 
not have information available to indicate that it is technologically feasible 
to provide a nutrition label on this particular jar." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen J. Nelson of Asta translates: "A label won't stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: The FDA said companies using the Asta jar need provide only a phone 
number or address. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Labels to go: The new labeling rules exempt most foods sold behind supermarket 
deli and bakery counters, but these regulations also have their quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 Baked goods fully prepared at a supermarket chain's central bakery and shipped 
to stores require the nutrition labels. But labels are not required on goods 
finished at individual stores, such as cakes baked at the main bakery and 
shipped to stores to be topped with icing. 
</P>
<P>
 Potato salad sold at the deli counter to a particular customer needs no 
nutritional label. But according to an FDA official, the same potato salad sold 
in prepackaged containers does require a label. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennine Sherry, a consultant to Ukrops Supermarkets in Richmond, Va., told 
food executives in Chicago recently that competitive pressures will force 
grocers to label even exempt products. "If consumers don't see a label, they'll 
wonder why you're not telling them what's in it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not sweating movie popcorn: A Gallup survey released recently by Quaker Oats 
has found that consumers ignore nutrition when it comes to snacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-three percent of those polled said they eat snacks that are not good 
for them because they taste good. Sixty-three percent said they are less 
concerned about nutrition when snacking than when eating a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker Oats' highly snackable but fat-laden granola cereal has been cited by 
some consumer organizations as a food to avoid.

FIRED TRADER SEEKS RELEASE OF FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Jett, a bond trader fired from Kidder, Peabody & Co. for allegedly 
reporting bogus profits, sought in state court Thursday to force Kidder to 
release almost $5 million of his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett's lawyer said Justice Martin Stecher signed an order directing the 
securities firm to explain in Manhattan's State Supreme Court next Tuesday why 
Kidder should not have to give Jett the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth E. Warner, Jett's attorney, said the firm froze Jett's cash management 
account of $4.8 million and his vested executive compensation account of 
$130,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, 36, was the head of Kidder's government bond trading department and has 
been accused of creating phantom trades and profits that inflated Kidder's 
income by more than $350 million over more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder has filed a $10-million arbitration claim against Jett.

SEC CHAIRMAN SAYS AGENCY NEEDS A BIGGER BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. urged lawmakers 
Thursday to beef up the agency's budget so it can better police a wide range of 
burgeoning financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before a Senate appropriations subcommittee, Levitt requested 
$309.6 million for fiscal 1995, an increase of $37 million over the current 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC chairman also asked for an additional 271 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resources requested in the budget are absolutely critical for the 
agency," he said. "Without the increases, the agency cannot meet its mandate of 
protecting investors and enforcing the nation's securities laws." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized the need for more resources to monitor the booming mutual fund 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, as investors are entrusting more and more of their savings . . 
. to mutual funds, the SEC's resources to regulate and inspect those funds have 
lagged far behind," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the agency generates far more in fees collected from the 
industry each year than it receives to fund its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC draws fees for stock exchange transactions and from parties filing 
registration statements and other documents. But the bulk of that money winds 
up at the U.S. Treasury to pay for other government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC has been pushing for legislation that would allow it to fund itself 
rather than relying on Congress to appropriate funds each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SEC is a profit center for the federal government," Levitt said, adding 
that "the commission strongly supports the creation of a self-funding 
mechanism."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; THE FLUB BEHIND NEW LINE'S 'MASK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Line Cinema, which is releasing "The Mask" this summer starring Jim 
Carrey, may want to find its own mask to hide behind. In a costly slip, the 
company failed to sign a sequel agreement with Carrey before he became a hot 
commodity in "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources expect New Line to cough up as much as $10 million, or more than 20 
times his original salary, to get Carrey to re-sign on the dotted line. While 
all sides declined to comment, negotiations with the actor's representatives at 
United Talent Agency are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey was a relatively unknown cast member on Fox TV's "In Living Color" when 
he signed on to star in "The Mask" last year. The surprising success of "Ace 
Ventura," which has grossed more than $70 million domestically, changed all 
that. The elastic actor is getting $7 million for each of his next two movies: 
"Dumb and Dumber" and "The Best Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey's bargaining position is even stronger on "The Mask" sequel because the 
special-effects-laden fantasy has been pegged as one of the summer's likeliest 
hits. People close to New Line say the company already views "The Mask" as a 
franchise on the order of its other successful series: "The Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles" and "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone expects this movie to be a smash," said one high-ranking industry 
source. "In those cases, sequel terms are usually worked out in advance. They 
just missed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives are at a loss to explain why New Line didn't lock Carrey 
in for the sequel as part of his original contract, a fairly standard industry 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 One source described the negotiations between Carrey and New Line as "very 
sensitive." Others pointed out that the actor would have renegotiated a sequel 
agreement once his star ascended anyway, though probably not as lucrative a 
deal as the one he'll get as a free agent. Veteran negotiators said the mistake 
gives Carrey as much as 20% more wiggle room. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line, which has one of the industry's most respected management teams in 
Chairman Robert Shaye and President Michael Lynne, used to be known for 
frugality. But it has been on a spending spree since its recent acquisition by 
Turner Broadcasting. To the company's credit, "The Mask," which cost $20 
million to make, is expected to be a big moneymaker -- maybe even returning 
enough to make up for the extra millions New Line will pay to retain Carrey.

least. Australian media magnate Kerry Packer, who recently bought into Arnon 
Milchan's Regency Enterprises, quietly joined exhibitors at a screening of "The 
Client" on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Packer and Milchan were whisked to the General Cinema in Sherman Oaks in a 
black stretch limousine just before show time. Packer evidently was thrilled 
with the thriller, which stars Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones and is being 
distributed by Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the enthusiastic response from West Coast theater managers, Regency 
and Warner plan more previews across the country leading up to the July 22 
opening of "The Client." Successful screenings also give distributors leverage 
in negotiating financial terms with theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
 As the third movie spawned by a John Grisham bestseller, "The Client" already 
has a strong pedigree. The first was "The Firm," which grossed $157 million 
domestically. The second was "The Pelican Brief," which took in $100.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After the screening, Packer and Milchan had lunch on the Warner Bros. Burbank 
lot, where Regency is based, with studio bosses Robert Daly and Terry Semel. 
</P>
<P>
 The backing of Packer, whose net worth is estimated at $1.7 billion, has given 
Milchan added muscle in Hollywood. While there's been little revealed about the 
terms of their deal, Variety recently reported that Packer's Nine Network 
Australia received a 30% stake in Regency in return for its $115-million 
investment. The company, which is also backed by the French entertainment 
company Canal Plus, is on an aggressive expansion drive, with Milchan aiming to 
produce 15 films a year by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the recent Packer investment, Milchan is said to be exploring a 
public offering in Regency in the range of $100 million, managed by Goldman 
Sachs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency's output includes hits such as "J.F.K." and "Free Willy." The company 
has also produced its share of turkeys, including "The Nutcracker Suite" and 
"Heaven and Earth." 
</P>

<P>
 After six years, Russell Simmons' Def Jam Records is about to part ways with 
Sony Inc. and enter into a lucrative, long-term distribution pact with PolyGram 
International, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal -- which is still being negotiated and is expected to be announced 
soon -- will put PolyGram on the map in the $800-million annual rap business, 
allowing the London-based conglomerate to cash in on profits generated by 
hip-hop acts such as Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Domino and Warren G.

 If it involves the Eagles, lawyers can't be far behind. The industry rumor

close to settling a long and bitter legal fight that sought to release him from 
his solo recording contract. Under terms of the settlement, Geffen would 
release an album of Eagles material recorded for an upcoming "MTV Unplugged" 
special and a Henley greatest-hits package with some new material. In addition, 
look for MCA and Glenn Frey to resolve their litigation, allowing Frey to 
participate in the Geffen-Eagles project while keeping his future solo 
recordings at MCA.

COMPANY TOWN; FOX HEATS UP THE ANIMATION WARS; MOVIES: HEAVYWEIGHT DON BLUTH 
DISCUSSES THE DEAL THAT WILL BRING HIM AND GARY GOLDMAN HOME FROM IRELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Walt Disney Co. has proven repeatedly that animated films can reach the 
highest box office echelons, no other studio has been able to duplicate that 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the potential payoff so huge -- not just in ticket sales but in 
videos, merchandising and other areas -- the major studios are embracing 
animation like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest move, 20th Century Fox announced earlier this week that it is 
investing $100 million in an animation division to be headed by veterans Don 
Bluth and Gary Goldman, who will leave the independent animation studio they 
set up in Ireland nearly eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluth, in his first interview since the announcement, says the pair are 
looking to Fox for the kind of sophisticated scriptwriting and marketing that 
his company lacked. With the muscle of the studio behind them, he said, "I 
think we have a shot at being competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Bluth and Goldman have enjoyed success with films such as "The Land Before 
Time," "An American Tail" and "All Dog's Go to Heaven." However, their most 
recent movie, "Thumbelina," stalled at about $10 million, which Bluth blames on 
bad marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for optimism over the Fox deal is the involvement of newly 
installed studio President Bill Mechanic, a former Disney executive who built 
its video merchandising operation into one of the company's most profitable 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animation is potentially a great business," says Mechanic, "but not a great 
business in and of itself. I don't think we would have invested so heavily 
without a Don Bluth. Don and Gary are preeminent in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanic also points out that Disney's position in animated features was built 
up only over the past decade. "Nine years ago, when I started there, there 
wasn't great success," he says. "There was a great history." 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney's renewed commitment to animation enabled it to reclaim its former 
glory. Now, he believes, Fox can take a similar path. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope we would do the same thing with Don and Gary," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of their five-year deal with Fox, Bluth and Goldman will create a 
separate animation production company that will work under the newly formed Fox 
Family Films division. 
</P>
<P>
 No site has been picked for the as-yet-untitled animation studio, but it 
definitely will not be in California, Bluth says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like earthquakes," he says, "and it's too crowded with animation at 
present." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the studio will be located somewhere in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluth and Goldman will have a staff of about 200, the same as his company in 
Ireland. The new team will begin production on its first feature film in 
October, with a release target date of Christmas, 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Bluth and Goldman will probably make a film every 18 months, which Fox will 
augment with work from other producers in order to release an animated feature 
each year, Mechanic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bluth doesn't begin work at Fox until May 31 -- Goldman starts July 
15 -- he said he already has three projects in development for the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluth, Goldman and more than a dozen colleagues walked away from Disney in 
1979, disappointed with its then-lackluster attitude toward animated films. 
</P>
<P>
 With financial incentives from the government of Ireland, they eventually 
created a studio on the banks of the River Liffey in Dublin. Since then, 
they've attained some success but also weathered some financial problems, 
including two bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluth is now an employee rather than an owner of the Dublin company that bears 
his name. Don Bluth Ireland Ltd. was taken over by Media Assets of Hong Kong, 
which was itself taken over by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. -- owner of 20th 
Century Fox and its parent, Fox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Fox President Mechanic says the fact that Bluth and Goldman 
are essentially moving from one arm of Murdoch's empire to another had nothing 
to do with securing the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Fox deal was announced in Ireland, newspapers there erroneously 
reported that Bluth's studio would shut down as a result. In fact, says Bluth, 
the company is up for sale and considering offers. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio is completing work on the feature film "The Pebble and the 
Penguin." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm attached to Ireland," Bluth says. "It's an enchanting place. But it's a 
time of going home." 
</P>
<P>
 His homecoming coincides with a burst of animation activity in Hollywood. 
Warner recently hired Disney executive Michael Laney to head a new feature 
animation division, and MGM launched its MGM Animation division earlier this 
year. Will there be room in the marketplace for all of them? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only room for the good product," Mechanic says bluntly. "I think most 
will fail."

THE FULL RANGE; TENOR SAXOPHONIST GORDON BRISKER KEEPS BUSY BY CHANGING 
FORMATS, FROM POST-BE-BOP TO BIG BAND SHOWS. HE ALSO COMPOSES CLASSICAL AND 
JAZZ PIECES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon Brisker gets around, and in a variety of musical guises. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Tuesdays ago, the fat, jubilant tones of Brisker's tenor sax were giving 
the great singer Anita O'Day ideas to play off of during a performance before a 
jampacked Vine Street Bar and Grill in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week later, Brisker teamed up with trumpeter Dick Forrest and led a 
very tasty post-be-bop assemblage at the Club Brasserie, offering crack solos 
on such bubbling wares as his own "Lester Left Out" to substantial applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting the format once again, Brisker will dust off his Big Band book and 
appear with his 12-piece ensemble Tuesday at the Moonlight Tango Cafe in 
Sherman Oaks. O'Day, for whom Brisker has served as musical director for about 
a decade, will offer guest vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 And behind the scenes, Brisker, who has lived with his wife, Cindy, a TV 
director, in North Hollywood for two decades, composes 20th-Century classical 
and jazz pieces -- of the latter, he has concocted 200 such works in his 
career. And he recently earned a master's degree in composition from Cal State 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 All these activities cause Brisker to seek new musical vistas, reach for 
unheard sounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like all kinds of music, and as I get older, I want to get more into things 
that are a stretch," said the musician, 56, a native of Cincinnati. "Jazz is a 
stretch. Writing 20th-Century legit style -- that's a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about what I want to leave behind," he continued. "Do I want to leave 
something that's like a Spyro Gyra copy?" he asks rhetorically, referring to 
the well-known pop-jazz band, "or leave what I can really do?" 
</P>
<P>
 What Brisker can really do is play gutsy jazz tenor saxophone, and compose 
with feeling and verve. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic Harvey Siders called Brisker's writing "clean, modern, with a 
meticulous concern" for the tonal colors that result from the way the sounds of 
the various instruments are blended. Fellow saxophonist Dave Pozzi, after 
observing Brisker's inventive, moving improvising at the Club Brasserie, said 
with a smile, "Gordon's cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brisker's musical plate has continually been full. He has performed with the 
Big Bands of Woody Herman, Louie Bellson and Bill Holman, has backed O'Day, and 
has been part of small groups led by trumpeter Bobby Shew and others. 
</P>
<P>
 He's made five albums as a leader, including 1986's "About Charlie," with a 
quintet featuring trumpet maestro Tom Harrell and renowned pianist Cedar 
Walton, and "New Beginning," a 1989 date with his Big Band. In addition, 
Brisker's written a guidebook, "Jazz Improvisation and the Inner Person," to 
aid novice improvisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many Los Angeles area musicians, Brisker takes his work where he can 
get it. Recent assignments have included everything from doing a jingle for a 
New Zealand company to some orchestrating for a TV show, from performing with 
Pat Long's Big Band at a North Hollywood high school to playing a one-night 
"casual" at a Beverly Hills hotel. This kind of across-the-board employment 
isn't exactly what Brisker had in mind when he started in music -- he simply 
wanted to be a jazz soloist -- but he's not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every week is different, and that makes it fun, and hair-raising, since 
you're always kind of going on a wing and a prayer," he said. "But, thank God, 
things are pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Brisker, who feels he's still evolving as a player and writer, sees his best 
years as lying ahead of him. He pointed out an aging artist's remark that he 
felt mirrored his own life: "The man said he had lived a long and successful 
life because he had picked something to do that he knew he could never 
accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcoming the challenges of music and finding your place within it can be 
tricky, Brisker said. "You can't compare yourself with others," he said. "We 
all want to think we're the next great hope, but as soon as you get past that, 
you're on your way." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>

Moonlight Tango Cafe, 13730 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks.

BROTHERS HOOKING CUSTOMERS WITH BAJA-STYLE TACOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheong Lee, the longtime owner of Shanghai Pine Gardens restaurant on Balboa 
Island, chuckles at how his three sons have simplified the restaurant business 
at their Wahoo's Fish Taco chain. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Lee's sons don't need highly trained, temperamental chefs in 
their kitchens. Wahoo's fish-based menu is noticeably shorter than Shanghai 
Pine Gardens' complex bill of fare. And few individual items on Wahoo's menu 
cost more than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee knows that the simple formula works because every day at lunch, the 
customers are lined up at the Wahoo's restaurant on Bristol Street in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held chain is enjoying similar success at its flagship 
restaurant on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, which opened in November, 1989, 
and at a store on South Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. A fourth restaurant will 
open soon on Main Street in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father has been (in restaurants) for 40 years, and now he knows that the 
restaurant business is about marketing," said Wing Lam, co-owner of Wahoo's 
with his brothers Ed Lee and Mingo Lee. "You've got to get people in so they 
can see what you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 What Wahoo's has are fish tacos -- tortillas stuffed with fish, seasonings and 
cabbage, the kind that Southern California's surfers regularly buy from street 
vendors in Baja California. And, unlike Shanghai Pine Gardens' kitchen, Wahoo's 
fare is relatively simple and easy to prepare, which helps keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam and fellow San Diego State University graduate Ralph Rubio acquired a 
taste for fish tacos during trips to Baja California. In 1988, Rubio opened 
Rubio's, a San Diego-based chain with restaurants in Irvine and Tustin and 13 
other locations. Two more Rubio's restaurants will open this year in Laguna 
Niguel and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam and Rubio acknowledge that fish tacos, a relative unknown outside of 
Southern California, won't challenge hamburgers as a national favorite. But 
both believe that the tacos eventually will become more than a regional food. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it boils down to is that fish tacos just taste great," Rubio said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wahoo's broils its fish -- the chain also offers meat and chicken tacos -- and 
rounds out its basic offerings with rice and black beans from Hawaii. Lam said 
the simple nature of the dish also makes it possible to serve customers 
quickly, which is important for busy diners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said fish tacos sell themselves -- as long as he's able to get customers 
in for an initial taste. But rather than target mainstream restaurant-goers 
through heavy advertising campaigns or coupon deals, Lam attracted business by 
converting "opinion leaders" and letting them tell friends about the merits of 
Wahoo's food. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam initially courted surfers who eat fish tacos during surfing trips to Baja 
California. He solidified ties to the surf industry by catering corporate 
functions for surf apparel companies, and serves fish tacos to leading surfers 
during local contests.  
</P>
<P>
 "All those guys love to eat our stuff," Lam said. "And they tell other people 
about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahoo's also sponsors a high school "athlete of the week" award through a 
local newspaper. Winners eventually stop by to grab a bite to eat at Wahoo's 
and, Lam said, "more important, they bring their friends along." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam is forging similar relationships with leading snowboarders, rock climbers 
and cyclists. The formula is simple: Wahoo's introduces fish tacos to the 
athletes and lets them spread the word about the food's taste, texture and 
healthful nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahoo's menu is playing well to consumers who demand better value and more 
health-conscious fare. "For five years we've been printing the number of 
calories, the amount of fat and carbohydrates in our food," Lam said. "We saw 
the handwriting on the wall early on that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam doesn't discuss revenue or profit figures, but the average meal check 
falls between $5 and $6. The Costa Mesa restaurant company has about 60 
employees, most of whom work full time at the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lam earned a business degree at San Diego State in 1984 and worked for two 
defense contractors before opening Wahoo's, but "is now in his element," said 
Lowell Larson,Lam's former supervisor at Sparta Inc., a Laguna Hills-based 
defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's talking to people all the time, he's got a million friends and he's

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; FEDERAL REGULATORS HIT CORPORATE BANK WITH CEASE-AND-DESIST 
ORDER

<P>
 The long recession that has sent regulators scurrying through Southern 
California banks with orders to fix problems has claimed another Orange County 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate Bank in Santa Ana has been slapped with a cease-and-desist order, 
the severest restriction that regulators can impose short of a federal 
takeover.The once-feared order, however, has become so commonplace among 
community banks here that many bankers view them more as a guide to help them 
work through problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most banks facing federal restrictions, Corporate has a healthy amount 
of capital -- its final reserve against losses -- and isn't searching for more. 
What regulators don't like is the $7.8 million in delinquent loans and real 
estate the bank holds through foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Stanley Pawlowski said the bank sold an apartment complex last week 
and will cut its problemassets in half by the end of June.

DISK DRIVE MAKER LAYS OFF 103 AT ANAHEIM PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seagate Technology Corp., the world's largest maker of disk drives for 
personal computers, said Thursday it has laid off 103 workers at its Orange 
County plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire West, spokeswoman at Seagate's headquarters in Scotts Valley in 
Northern California, said the company is phasing out older products at the 
Anaheim plant, which makes the aluminum disks that serve as the basic storage 
components in disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is good for our products but we decided to phase out this line," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Seagate laid off 60 full-time employees and 43 temporary 
workers, West said. The workers built Seagate's eight-inch hard disk products. 
The plant remains open and will focus on building newer technologies that don't 
require as much labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagate has more than 40,000 employees worldwide. It acquired the Anaheim 
plant in November, 1987, from Aeon Corp.

 Playtime at Credit Union: Parents aren't likely to hear their children begging 
to be taken to the bank, but the kids may be glad to tag along for a trip to 
the Orange County Teachers Federal Credit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana credit union, the state's third largest, has installed play 
areas for children at five of its six locations and has stocked the areas with 
educational toys donated by Lakeshore Learning Materials in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play centers are visible from both the teller lines and the loan 
department, so parents can keep an eye on their children," said Gayeann L. 
Gwynn, the credit union's marketing vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The only branch without a children's area is the Fountain Valley office, which 
is not only the credit union's busiest branch but is also in the same shopping 
center where a Lakeshore store is located, she said.

PENSION FUND TO INVEST IN LOCAL HOMES; REAL ESTATE: CALPERS WILL PROVIDE $20 
MILLION FOR A 2,500-HOUSE DEVELOPMENT IN RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's largest public-employee pension fund said Thursday that it will 
invest $20 million in a 2,500-home, master-planned development in south Orange 
County as part of its program to help create housing in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Employee Retirement System, known as CalPERS, with $80 
billion in assets, has created a joint venture with the Santa Margarita Co., 
the master developer of Rancho Santa Margarita. The partnership will begin to 
develop Las Flores, a 1,005-acre community in the southeast area of the county, 
which may signal a new willingness by investors to enter the local real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of our single-family housing development program started in 
1992," said Patrick Hill, spokesman for CalPERS in Sacramento. "For CalPERS 
this is viewed as an attractive investment with a good return. In addition, it 
helps the economy by providing capital to builders." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rancho Santa Margarita, CalPERS will be acquiring and developing the land 
and then selling the lots to developers who will actually build the homes, Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the CalPERS program has invested in 59 projects statewide with at 
least half of them in Southern California. It has invested in 12 Orange County 
projects, including the Pacific Grove development in Aliso Viejo, which has 138 
single-family homes priced from $176,900 to $206,000, all built by Pacific 
Gateway Homes, said Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS has approved additional investments in Aliso Viejo, including Pacific 
Grove II, where 94 homes are planned by Pacific Gateway, said Horace Hogan, 
executive vice president with Pacific Gateway, a 5-year-old home-building 
company based in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill predicted there would be more investment by the state in Orange County 
housing developments. The Las Flores plan includes single-family detached 
homes, condominiums and rental units. At least 25% of the homes will be 
designated as low-income housing.

 Westcorp Touted: Falling stock prices produce bargains, and well-known Wall 
Street money manager Peter Lynch thinks that Westcorp Inc. in Irvine is one of 
the nation's better values. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, the holding company for Western Financial Savings Bank is 
waiting for Wall Street to share his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, vice chairman of Fidelity Management & Research, recently picked 
Westcorp as one of eight financial institutions and 48 companies overall that 
are recovering from the recession's doldrums with stock prices well under their 
true value. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcorp, through Western Financial, is "a very attractive auto finance 
company, which alone justifies more than the price of the stock," he said in 
the April 25 issue of Barron's business and financial weekly. Also through the 
thrift, the company makes home loans, and the two lines of business "are worth 
twice the price of the stock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time his interview appeared in Barron's, the price of Westcorp stock 
was $9 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. It rose only 37.5 cents by the 
end of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seemed a bit more impressed with his choice of Western Digital Corp. 
in Irvine, the only other Orange County company on his list. Stock in the 
computer disk drive maker was selling at $14.125 a share when Lynch's interview 
was published. It closed Thursday at $16.25 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>

share.

 Foundation Health Corp.: The Sacramento-area health care provider said 
Thursday that it has acquired two Orange County workers' compensation service 
companies with more than 240 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Health, based in the Sacramento suburb of Rancho Cordova, has 4,000 
employees and last year had revenue of $1.5 billion.It agreed to buy Reviewco 
and the Noetics Group, two affiliated companies based in Irvine. Terms were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewco, which has 100 employees, monitors bills from health care providers 
to weed out possible workers' compensation fraud, reduce service costs and 
eliminate billing errors. The Noetics Group, with 140 employees, helps 
administer workers' compensation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewco and the Noetics Group had combined revenue of about $20 million in 
1993. Kurt Davis, a spokesman for Foundation Health, said the cost-cutting 
services that the two companies provide are in such high demand that the 
acquisition made sense for his company.

 Ingram Micro Inc.: The worldwide computer distributor reported Thursday that 
its first-quarter sales increased 35%, to $1.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the increase was due to strong sales of brand-name computers 
-- Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Digital Equipment Corp. -- that Ingram Micro 
began distributing in the past year as well as to high demand for multimedia 
products, which allow a computer to combine sound, video, graphics and text. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Micro also reported rapid growth in Europe, with year-to-year sales 
increasing 104%.

 The privately held company, a subsidiary of Ingram Industries Inc. in 
Nashville, Tenn., does not disclose profit.

PRESLEY COS. REVISES LOSS TO $64 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Presley Cos. reported Thursday that it will change its 1993 loss from $51 
million to $64.3 million because it decided to change its method of accounting 
for its real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The builder of planned housing tracts said in a statement that it has revised 
its method of determining value of its properties to include post-completion 
holding costs other than interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley Cos. has been financially troubled because it bought vacant land at 
the top of the real estate market in the late 1980s, and it has since seen the 
value of the land plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Presley Cos. said it finalized an agreement with its 
lenders to restructure a $340-million revolving line of credit, giving lenders 
a 70% stake in the company.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: MEETING OF GAY MINDS; TWO AUTHORS WANT TO START A WORKSHOP TO 
'BRING ABOUT A SENSE OF CONNECTION AND SECURITY' FOR GAY AND LESBIAN WRITERS. 
ROBERT PETERS, A UCI PROFESSOR, IS ALSO LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK ON HIS WORK ON THE 
SEX LIFE OF J. EDGAR HOOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sudden death of Robert Peters' 4-year-old son from meningitis in 1960 
spurred him to begin writing what would become his first published book of 
poetry, "Songs for a Son." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've mined my life since the very early poems," said Peters, who retired from 
UC Irvine last year after 26 years in the English Department but still teaches 
a course there. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until the father of three other children split from his wife of 
17 years in the late '60s that he began writing about something he had kept 
hidden: He's gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing about the death of his son, Peters said, "Unlocked all the poetry and 
the frustration (about) where the marriage had gone sour and deciding I was not 
going to live lies any more. That's when I decided that my nature, from age 3, 
was homosexual and that's what it's going to be, despite all the kids I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Peters, 69, has continued to mine his life for many of his 30 
books, writing "What Dillinger Meant to Me," a collection of poems about farm 
life in Wisconsin and the boyhood "sexual reverberations" he felt for gangster 
John Dillinger, who escaped an FBI ambush nearby; "The Drowned Man to the 
Fish," a collection of poems about the "harrowing" difficulties of leaving his 
wife and children; "Crunching Gravel: A Wisconsin Boyhood," a memoir, and an 
upcoming World War II memoir, "For You, Lili Marlene."  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of myself essentially as a gay writer, although much of my work 
has gay themes," said Peters, who is working on a book-length monologue based 
on the controversial sex life of J. Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, who is interested in getting feedback on his work-in-progress, is 
hoping to start a writing workshop along with fellow writer Paul Trachtenberg 
for Orange County gay and lesbian writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters initially wanted to form an advanced workshop, but he doesn't know of 
any writing groups for gays and lesbians in the county, "so maybe this is the 
time to try to get something established for people who do want to write and 
have this commitment to their sexuality and not worry about how useful it will 
be to me."  
</P>
<P>
 Peters said prospective members should submit samples of their work, so he and 
Trachtenberg can "see who's out there -- if anybody's out there -- and is it 
poetry or prose they are interested in, and how much experience they have. Then 
we can just play it by ear whether or not we want to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for limiting the workshop, which will be held in the Huntington 
Beach home Peters and Trachtenberg share, to about 10. Writers should send 
their material to Peters in care of the Department of English, UC Irvine, 
Irvine, CA 92717. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and Trachtenberg, who have been together 24 years, plan to co-lead the 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachtenberg, 45, has published three books of poems, including "Short Changes 
for Loretta," and recently a novel, "Ben's Exit." The Orange County-set novel 
(Cherry Valley Editions; $7) features a central gay relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters achieved local notoriety two years ago for performing his "Snapshots 
for a Serial Killer: A Fiction and Play," a disturbing look into serial killer 
Randy Kraft's mind. He also has written and performed -- both locally and 
nationally -- in "Ludwig of Bavaria" and "The Blood Countess," which is about a 
real 17th-Century Hungarian countess who believed servant girl blood made her 
skin whiter. (Peters played the countess.) 
</P>
<P>
 After he completes his monologue on Hoover, Peters plans to write a book about 
what it's like being a father who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to really make that an honest book if I can," he said. "It may be one 
of the most important of all the books I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that he is gay took a heavy toll on his family. His daughter 
and two sons, he said, suffered emotionally. But Peters, who said he loves 
being a father, is still close to them. He also has remained on good terms with 
his ex-wife and is grateful "she never turned them them against me, and she 
could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he is a more disciplined writer than Trachtenberg, writing several 
hours every day. In addition to fiction, poetry and drama, he also does 
criticism and book reviews for American Book Review and other publications. He 
even writes more than 100 letters a month to fellow poets and writers.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's mostly my social life, apart from playing Scrabble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, who has taught courses on Victorian writers and contemporary poetry at 
UCI, is teaching "Gay-Lesbian Writers," an undergraduate English class at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 In conducting the course, he said he is "making a contribution to helping 
elevate the gay consciousness, to making young lesbians and gays on campus feel 
not as inadequate -- or guilty -- as they otherwise might feel as outsiders and 
so on by presenting a whole range of visiting writers and texts of published 
writers that they are reading." 
</P>
<P>
 The course, Peters said, is also important for "cross-fertilization." 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is half of the class of 60-plus students is straight, and that means 
that people are sitting there listening and talking to one another, and that 
should make for understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the visiting gay or lesbian writers who have -- or will -- speak and 
read to the class are Los Angeles poet Eloise Klein Healy, New York poet and 
biographer Edward Field, Trachtenberg and fiction writer Sandra Christiansen of 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he emphasizes poetry in the course and, in fact, gay and lesbian 
poets typically have an easier road to publication than do writers of 
gay-themed novels, thanks to a multitude of alternative presses that are more 
willing to publish poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major mainstream publishers, Peters said, St. Martin's Press "is the 
only really big one that will take the risk" of publishing a novel with a 
strong sexual theme unless it's the work of Gore Vidal or some other major 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainstream publishers think, I suppose, that the religious right will raise 
hell and they won't sell all the copies they want to," he said. "That's still 
an issue, but things are getting better. I think (the film) 'Philadelphia' is 
evidence of that. But it's still walking on eggshells with that subject matter, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters believes that "any visible gay or lesbian still runs a risk (of 
becoming a victim). I've been very lucky. I've seen very little of it in my 
life personally, but the hate people are out there -- the bashers." 
</P>
<P>
 For writers, Peters said, there's also political correctness to deal with 
within the gay community -- the idea that "if you present gays in any negative 
light you're betraying your kind. Which, of course, is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of flak on the 'Serial Killer,' who was ostensibly gay, because I 
suppose it's like most minorities with long histories of persecution. The 
activist people want positive takes, and this guy is a monster, and my point is 
whether he's gay or straight is utterly beside the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dearth of mainstream publishers producing gay- and lesbian-themed 
books, Peters said, a handful of small straight presses are receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Sparrow Press of Santa Barbara is one. Another is Asylum Arts, a small 
press in Santa Maria that will publish his collection of essays on major 
contemporary American poets, "Where the Bee Sucks: Workers, Drones and Queens 
of Contemporary American Poetry."  
</P>
<P>
 "That publisher is thoroughly open-minded," said Peters. "He's a straight guy, 
but (for him) it doesn't matter what the subject matter is. I've been lucky to 
find enlightened editors like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few gay-oriented publishers is GLB (Gay Lesbian and Bi) Publishers 
in San Francisco, which published Peters' "Snapshots for a Serial Killer," 
"Zapped: Two Pop Novels" and "Goodnight, Paul," a book of poems "celebrating" 
Peters' life with Trachtenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Paul) got on my case because most of what I write has a a bleak side to 
it," Peters said. "He said, 'Why don't you write a happy book?' So I tried to 
get away from the dark imagination. They're short lyrics on different things -- 
how I see him in life, things he does, what his interests are, the things we do 
together. So it's the writing life we share very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Naiad Press of Tallahassee, Fla., is one of the small presses that exclusively 
publish lesbian writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting to me how the lesbians do much better in this than the men 
do," said Peters. "I think they find their own audience, and I think it's true 
in the whole society that women read more than men and I think that carries 
over in that a press can devote itself to lesbian writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a gay book is "super erotic" or pornographic, Peters said, that is not 
about to happen for gay fiction.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the majority of males who read gay lit read it to be turned 
on, and the serious literary things like Christopher Isherwood's 'A Single Man' 
and John Rechy's 'A City of Night' or William Burroughs' 'Naked Lunch' reach 
over into a hetero readership as well," he said. "But my feeling is it's the 
porn and the soft-core stuff that generally sells" in gay bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachtenberg's publisher, Cherry Valley Editions in Cherry Valley, N.Y., is 
another small straight press that publishes both gay and lesbian writers.  
</P>
<P>
 As a gay writer, Trachtenberg views the prospect of an Orange County gay and 
lesbian writing workshop as an opportunity to "bring about a sense of 
connection and security knowing there are other people looking for this same 
kind of outlet. It's kind of a fellowship and shows that we're not isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a writer is struggle enough, Trachtenberg said, and being a gay writer 
is even more of a struggle -- "unless you go to the right places and you feel 
safe like in the (gay) ghettos in San Francisco and Greenwich Village where 
there is more hobnobbing and collective consciousness and support." 
</P>
<P>
 As an archivist who collects contemporary American poetry to sell to 
university libraries, Trachtenberg said he is "only beginning to emerge as a 
full-time writer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben's Exit," his first novel, reflects his life growing up and living in 
Orange County. In writing the slim 123-page book, he said he intended to 
portray "kind of an elite idealistic world" in which gays and straights get 
along with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel reflects Trachtenberg's view of himself as a "gay assimilationist," 
which he defines as "showing the world that there is no difference between a 
gay life and a straight life, that they can get along equally. On the opposite 
end of the spectrum would be the gay militant." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachtenberg said one publisher rejected the book "because he thought it was 
homophobic. He's from San Francisco and he's in a (gay) ghetto and he doesn't 
see that world like I do in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 "My argument is, sure I support the gay militants too, but they should see the 
good and benefits of the gay assimilationists because they're showing that gays 
can assimilate in society." In so doing, he said, straights will learn to say 
of gays, "Hey, they're all-right people." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachtenberg said he's open about being gay among his friends. But living in 
Orange County, "I guess what comes to mind is having to soft-shoe, not be open 
and say who I am in order to have a more comfortable life, a less stressful 
life."  
</P>
<P>
 When he goes to the gym, for example, "nobody knows who I am. A gay person in 
Orange County becomes an expert in traveling incognito for survival." 
</P>
<P>
 But through his writing, Trachtenberg has found he can be himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been my freest way of expression," he said. And a gay and lesbian 
writing workshop, he said, would extend that sense of freedom: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say profoundly."

QUAYLE COMES OUT SWINGING; IN HIS NEW BOOK, THE EX-VICE PRESIDENT DISSECTS THE 
PAST AND TRIES TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR A SHOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's tough, getting laid off a job you really, really like. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so very long ago, he was surrounded by staff and showered with perks. Now, 
the former vice president has been reduced to walking through airport metal 
detectors, like anyone else, and cringing when his belt buckle sets the buzzer 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 He does his own grocery shopping, drives his own car, answers his own phone 
and leaves his own shirts out for the laundry pickup. Not one Secret Service 
agent is there to join him on his daily jog. When the dogs are noisy, it is 
Quayle, not some underling, who chastises, "Quiet, you guys!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shooing the dogs out into a yard that features a bird feeder shaped like the 
White House, Quayle agreed that it's a huge change, moving from No. 2 in 
command of the Free World to stay-at-home dad and husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I do miss it," he said, "running the country with George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday in the sun room of a house that is large but hardly a 
palace, Quayle sounded more upfront than wistful. He has purposefully laid low 
these last 18 months since he and Bush were voted out of Washington, turning 
down interview requests and generally blending into the rich green landscape of 
this suburb north of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time-honored tradition of American political resurrection, he has used 
this period to write a memoir -- a book he began outlining days after the 
defeat of '92. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing Firm" (HarperCollins) offers Quayle's version of what went wrong -- 
and, occasionally, what went right -- in the elections of 1988 and '92. It 
casts a sharp and critical eye on Quayle's own numerous bungles as vice 
president of the United States. And it so harshly evaluates certain key figures 
in official Washington -- not to mention most of the capital press corps -- 
that it might well have been titled "Lashing Back," or at least "Settling the 
Score." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is a clear effort to change Quayle's media image as a lightweight 
junior senator from Indiana who became the most caricatured figure in recent 
political history. With its forward-looking conclusion -- "I have much to do" 
-- "Standing Firm" also seeks to position Quayle for a future shot at the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 And if at times this political autobiography reads like a study in 
self-exoneration, Quayle insisted, "I'm not a vindictive person. I just wanted 
to tell exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiral-bound copies of the manuscript of "Standing Firm" were sent to a 
handful of journalists, who in turn were required to promise not to reveal its 
contents before Thursday's publication date. When the Washington Post "obtained 
several chapters independently" and jumped that embargo date, a minor flap 
ensued. Republicans scathed by Quayle's literary sword were not amused. Neither 
was Newsweek, the Post's sister publication, which had purchased exclusive 
first serial rights to "Standing Firm." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you find out how they got those chapters, let me know," said Quayle, who 
found his payment for the magazine rights slashed because of the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, what can you expect from a pack of "very hungry sharks," as 
Quayle describes the denizens of America's Fourth Estate. Right from the start, 
right from the moment his wife, Marilyn, pulled the hot rollers out of her hair 
and learned that her husband had been selected George Bush's 1988 running mate, 
Quayle writes, he was the object of what he calls "unprecedented media abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The first 48 hours after his nomination brought nothing but "a flood of 
negative publicity," Quayle said. Until then, Quayle had felt pretty sure of 
himself. He was popular in his home state, and he had even (briefly) considered 
throwing his own hat into the presidential ring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Quayle writes, he was a rich kid, a lousy student and, if not an 
outright draft dodger, a guy who used connections to join the National Guard. 
He was a "pampered peabrain," and a pretty boy -- "a cross between Vanna White 
and the William Hurt character in 'Broadcast News' " -- chosen mainly to appeal 
to female voters. Because "J. Danforth Quayle" sounded like the kind of name 
that ought to have a Roman numeral attached to it, one newspaper appended a 
"III" to Quayle's name. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quayle was also inaccessible in the days following his nomination, a 
miscalculation he lays at the feet of Republican handlers who cocooned him in 
hopes of warding off further media damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let others do the thinking for me, and that was a mistake," Quayle said. 
"It's like anything else in life -- if you don't trust your instincts, you're 
not going to get very far." 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon imprint stuck. "It was a comfortable caricature," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing Quayle could do seemed to improve this perception. Most of what he 
did, and nearly all of what he said, seemed to make it worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not as if there was no precedent for poking fun at the President's 
chief sidekick. Lyndon Johnson used to say the vice presidency consisted of 
wearing funny hats and attending state funerals. Even Richard Nixon dropped by 
to warn Quayle that "vice presidents are to be kicked around." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle writes that he also ran smack into a generational issue. Many of the 
reporters assigned to cover him were, like Quayle, scions of the Baby Boom era. 
And Quayle was way too strait-laced for their comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just not one of us," one reporter came right out and told Quayle. He 
played golf, he lived in the suburbs, he had a wife and three kids with gobs of 
gorgeous teeth -- and whether he had inhaled was never even a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a way that they could understand a conservative Ronald Reagan or a 
conservative George Bush," Quayle said. "But to have a conservative of their 
own generation be the first on the national ticket was something that was 
almost intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The antagonistic relationship between Quayle and the media was cemented once 
and for all in the now-famous Battle of Huntington (as Quayle titles one of his 
chapters) -- the Aug. 19, 1988, hometown press conference where the friendly 
combat that Quayle's handlers had hoped to engender turned into a furious 
fracas with press, public and politicians all trying to outshout each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a "searing experience," Quayle remembered, and it "put a line in the 
sand." An "us versus them" mentality developed, surprising no one more than Dan 
Quayle himself. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Quayle relates in his book, the architects of Bush's presidential 
campaign were not about to take steps to improve matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lee Atwater said we were the best thing going," Quayle said. "As long as the 
press wanted to chase me, they were off Bush's case." 
</P>
<P>
 His personal barbecuing has given him some sympathy for what Bill Clinton has 
gone through in recent months as a result of scrutiny over Whitewater, Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And because there were times when he hoped his own children were not watching 
TV news or looking at the newspapers, "I think I know what Chelsea is going 
through, too," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Standing Firm," Quayle attempts to even the score between him and the 
press. Only a few journalists come out sounding like credits to their 
profession. But to reach that conclusion, Quayle said he brought his own 
notebook and sat down "for a couple of hours" with more than half a dozen of 
the reporters who had covered him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my assessment of the media is fair," Quayle said. "It's not done in a 
hostile, angry or vindictive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle relives many of his gaffes, such as the time he sent an aide out to buy 
an anatomically correct doll in Chile or the occasion when he referred to a 
group of Samoans as "happy campers." 
</P>
<P>
 A chapter called "Baked, Mashed and Fried" begins with the episode in the 1992 
campaign when Quayle misspelled potato . Going back still earlier, he said he 
felt envious when Clinton made a grand production out of selecting Al Gore as 
his running mate. In 1988, when Bush introduced him in New Orleans, Quayle 
recalled, "I looked like the guy on the game show who'd just won the 
Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revisiting those less-than-salutary days was painful, Quayle conceded -- and 
watching his wife's anguished reaction as she read a first draft of "Standing 
Firm" nearly brought tears to his eyes. "But it was a real political story," 
Quayle said, "the story of a remarkable political downfall." 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet writer's life has given Quayle time for reflection. Recently, he set 
up a small investment group in Indianapolis, where he keeps an office. But 
mostly, it is he who is at home while the kids are at school and his wife 
Marilyn -- who once remarked that "women do not want to be liberated from their 
essential natures as women," seemingly excoriating women who choose employment 
outside the home -- goes off to work in a big Indianapolis law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He is thinking about writing another book, probably focusing on eight or 10 
families around the world who illustrate the complexities of contemporary 
family life. But most of all, he is thinking about whether to jump back into 
politics and try for a lease at that big house on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I clearly have the experience," he mused, sounding as if he has persuaded 
himself and is practicing his stump speech. "I've been there. I know what the 
job is. I know the importance of making good decisions and staying with your 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 By design, Quayle said, he has postponed the inevitable conversation with his 
wife and children about running for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm 47 years old, I've been a congressman, a senator, vice president and, 
God willing, I still have many years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Quayle is relaxed as he discusses his defeats and victories. 
He is particularly gracious as he bids farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as he notes in "Standing Firm," "How you exit is important -- 
especially if you're thinking of coming back."

AN INTIMATE CONNECTION; MOTHERHOOD: WHAT DOES ONE GENERATION OF WOMEN GIVE TO 
THE NEXT? FOR AN ALTADENA FAMILY, IT'S LOVE AND THE STRENGTH TO MAKE THEIR 
DAUGHTERS' LIVES BETTER.

<P>
 Anointed by the exalted experience of giving life to another, mothers share a 
certain spiritual communion. Yet each of their birth stories is unique and 
precious in its singular detail.  
</P>
<P>
 Giving birth to a daughter seems especially miraculous for its magical way of 
closing a secret circle between two people. In anticipation of Mother's Day, 
three generations of the Garcia family of Altadena came together to share their 
memories of the day their daughters were born. Justina Garcia, 62, mother of 
Jovita Glover, 45 
</P>
<P>
 "How could a mother ever forget the day her child is born? My first child, I 
remember some things very well -- 45 years, and still I remember! 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a shy, very shy girl living with her godmother in Guadalajara. 
This girl is me, only 18 years old. Mi esposo is traveling around South America 
with his soccer team. It is a Saturday. Five o'clock in the morning, and I am 
starting to feel so bad.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very shy girl, you see, so I didn't say anything, but my godmother, 
who was also my aunt, she knew about children, about having the babies. She 
could tell I was in pain. Very fast, she took me to the special clinic for 
women having babies.  
</P>
<P>
 "No, there was no anesthesia . . . and this was a very big baby, more than 
nine pounds. (But) by 9 o'clock that morning, my baby was born.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her face, and the first thing I said was: 'She looks like her father's 
side of the family. She doesn't look like me.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy, yes, but poco triste , a little sad too because she was a girl. 
She is going to have the same pain like me, I thought. She is going to suffer 
like women suffer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They came and took the baby away almost as soon as she was born so I could 
rest. My father-in-law decided that her name would be Jovita. That was the name 
of someone in his family who had died. I don't know who. 
</P>
<P>
 "My little Jovita, she had no pelo, not one little strand, and her head was 
very big. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had made many clothes for her, and so my godmother brought the clothes to 
me at the hospital. I sewed everything myself -- chambritas, camisitas, little 
diapers. I made them out of flannel to be soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I embroidered the little shirts the Mexican way, the way my mother had taught 
me. They were pink. Pink like my new baby." Jovita Glover, 45, mother of Laura 
Glover, 24 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike my mother, I didn't have any four-hour labor. I wish I had. Seventeen 
hours was more like it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I began before the sun was even up. It was very early in the morning and kind 
of dark outside when my husband took me over to Queen of Angels Hospital. We 
were living in Boyle Heights then, and I had called the doctor, and he said, 
'Come on in.'  
</P>
<P>
 "It was Jan. 21 -- my due date exactly! My doctor was so good at that. He 
could predict the day exactly.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had an anesthetic, so I only saw parts of the birth. I do remember asking: 
'What is it? Girl or boy?' When they said girl, I thought, well, I wonder if 
I'll be like my mother and have six girls before I have a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I remember asking: 'Is my baby OK? Is she healthy?' That's when they 
told me she had jaundice, and I began to cry and cry because I was afraid she 
might not come home from the hospital with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real yellow, and then she opened her eyes, and they were green. Green 
eyes! Later, when they brought her back for me to hold, her eyes looked so 
brown. I said: 'Is this my baby? First, green eyes and now brown eyes?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that set off quite a fuss at the hospital, and they all ran around and 
checked all the babies' ID bracelets to make sure I had the right baby. And I 
did. Her eyes were just green for a while . . . maybe because of the jaundice. 
We never did find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose her name myself. I almost gave her a Japanese name, after a really 
close Japanese friend of mine. But in English, the name meant Margaret, so 
that's what we went with -- Laura Margarita.  
</P>
<P>
 "A beautiful name, isn't it? Part Japanese, part Spanish, part English. And 
what a beautiful baby she was. . . ." Laura Glover, 24, mother of Sydni 
Chambers, 5 
</P>
<P>
 "What a day! I will never forget that day so long as I live. It was Saturday, 
April 15, and I was out shopping that morning with one of my aunts. We stopped 
into a Hallmark store, and I said, 'Oh, man, wow, that hurt!'  
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed my back in pain. It was three weeks before the baby was supposed to 
come. But 30 minutes later, I had another real bad pain. I had to hold on to a 
store rack. I couldn't stand up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my aunt: 'Take me home. I've got to lie down.' Well, we walk in the 
door, and everybody jumps up, 'Surprise! Surprise!' It's a surprise baby 
shower. For me! So I sat down and started opening present. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, I had another pain, and I made an ugly face. Everybody said, 
'Are you all right?' I said, 'Oh sure.' And so the baby shower goes on and on 
into the night. Everybody starts to go home, and suddenly I have this big 
craving for a bean and cheese burrito with lots of lettuce.  
</P>
<P>
 "So off we go to Taco Bell, and right in the drive-through, I have the worst 
pain yet. I go back home, and I'm lying with my mom in her bed. I'm tossing and 
turning, and my mom finally says, 'What's the matter?' and I say, 'Mom, I think 
the baby's coming!' 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we get to Huntington Hospital, it's a little after midnight and 
I'm dilated four centimeters. The doctor says: 'It's time to go. Now!'  
</P>
<P>
 "Then she asks, 'Who is coming in with you?' My best friend was there, and so 
was my mom. I had to choose. I looked at my mom, and she said: 'OK, Laura, I'll 
do it. I'll go with you. I'll stay with you, honey.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we start into the delivery room, and there's some blood and everything, 
and all of a sudden my mother isn't looking so good. And she says to me: 'I'm 
sorry. I just can't do this. I'm so sorry.' And she leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "So then, they send my girlfriend in, and before you know it, she faints! She 
falls right into the IV pole and the monitoring machines and practically pulls 
me off the bed as she goes down. 
</P>
<P>
 "By now, I'm ready to have this baby. But I'm all by myself! The nurses helped 
a lot, and so did the doctor. I remember the doctor pushed her ponytail up into 
her cap and put on her gloves, and next thing I knew, I had a seven-pound baby 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy. I was really happy. I said: 'Oh God! I had a girl! I had a 
girl!'  
</P>
<P>
 "Then right away I got a little sad and kind of afraid -- afraid of our 
society and what will happen to her."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; DOWN TO EARTH; EDUCATION: THE GOAL OF A HIGH 
SCHOOL AGRICULTURE PROGRAM IS TO HELP STUDENTS DEVELOP CONFIDENCE, SELF-ESTEEM 
AND INTERPERSONAL AS WELL AS HANDS-ON SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANNA FULLMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES Hanna Fullmer is a sophomore at 
Fullerton Union High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of a generation filled with tagging, video games, smog and 
in-line skates, the red farmhouse stands in sharp contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The barn is home to the Fullerton Union High School Agriculture Department -- 
which takes in 3 1/2 acres -- and its chickens, cattle, sheep, rabbits and 
plants.  
</P>
<P>
 It also serves as a classroom for more than 290 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of Fullerton's award-winning program, ranked No. 1 in the state 
in 1993 by the California Future Farmers of America, makes it a standout in an 
era that's seemingly less interested in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's program is one of nine at high schools in the county, although by 
next fall there will be only eight. Dwindling enrollment in the program at 
Costa Mesa High School has led to the decision to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the closing of the Costa Mesa site, agriculture-based programs overall 
in the state have gradually increased since the mid-'80s. Meanwhile, a 
significant shift in emphasis has occurred in many of the programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Although livestock production is an important part of Fullerton's program, 
which began in 1928 with 25 students, department chairman Greg Beard is quick 
to point out that agriculture is more than "cows and plows, feeds and seeds." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, agriculture is science, it is business, it is research, it is public 
relations," Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the program have a chance to work in a computer lab, a flower and 
plant design lab and on the farm, and they attend FFA meetings "that provide 
kids the opportunity to get out and mingle with other high school students," 
agriculture instructor Sheila Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, students are required to raise an animal or cultivate 
plants or to get a part-time job related to agriculture, such as at a florist, 
nursery, veterinary office or landscape service. This helps students gain 
responsibility and earn money, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So do the kids get grief about being farmers in this urban age? 
</P>
<P>
 Just the opposite, according to most students, who say the program is 
well-respected and that participation is considered more cool than weird. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students join the program, which fulfills certain academic requirements 
for graduation, because friends or family members have enjoyed it.  
</P>
<P>
 Others are tugged by nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a little kid, my grandfather had a farm, and being out here is 
just like reliving (that time)," said junior Jeff Mastin, who is participating 
in the breeding sow project and has classes in advanced animal and plant 
science and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to work with animals is a big draw. 
</P>
<P>
 When students sign up for an animal, it's a 90-day commitment. Animals must be 
fed twice a day, and the stall or hutch has to be kept clean. At the end of 
that time, the animals are sold, usually after being shown at the Orange County 
Fair, and students get to keep the money. Animals on the farm include steer, 
sheep, pigs, rabbits and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way for students to learn more about nature hands-on, not just 
out of a science textbook," said junior Patty Gomez, who is taking advanced 
horticulture. About one-half acre of the Fullerton site is devoted to growing 
decorative plants and flowers, which are sold to local nurseries and the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "In agriculture, you learn skills that will prepare you for life. You're 
taught people skills," said junior Erin Hunt, who is raising a lamb and is in 
the veterinary science class. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the agriculture program is to help students develop confidence, 
self-esteem and interpersonal skills, says department chairman Beard.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrett says the program is important in this day and age because "kids need a 
place where they feel safe. They're able to call this place a home. They can be 
themselves out here and still be respected." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Brenda Gonzalez agrees, adding that the program can help keep kids 
off the streets and away from drugs and gangs. Freshman David Garcia said it 
allows a student "to learn what you can't in the city." Gonzalez and Garcia 
both take an introduction to California agriculture course. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who plans to raise a sheep this spring, said one of her favorite 
features of the agriculture program is the competitive teams. Students compete 
against other FFA chapters in everything from floriculture and agri-science to 
parliamentary procedure and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to try to be the best . . . (to) make your school No. 1," Gonzalez 
said. "Sometimes you can, and sometimes you can't -- but at least you really 
tried, and that's what I like." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton students recently took second place nationally in an FFA competition 
among schools from 22 states for marketing plans for an agriculture product. 
The team's plan was based on Fullerton Fresh Eggs, a student-run enterprise in 
which the eggs from 160 chickens on the school farm are sold at the Fullerton 
Farmer's Market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students cite many reasons for being in the program -- some have even 
transferred between schools to get into the well-developed Fullerton program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastin's favorite part is "raising my animals, because it is always a 
challenge. They either get sick or don't eat. It is a kind of job that keeps 
you on your feet."  
</P>
<P>
 Hunt enjoys the leadership conferences the most. "I have made many new 
friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons for joining, Beard said he hopes the program provides the 
students "positive experiences that will last a lifetime." Agriculture 
Education 
</P>
<P>
 * Nine Orange County high schools have agriculture programs. Five -- 
Fullerton, Buena Park, La Habra, Sunny Hills and Sonora -- are in the Fullerton 
Joint Union High School District. The others are at Orange, Mission Viejo, 
Westminster and Costa Mesa; the Costa Mesa program will close after the current 
school term. 
</P>
<P>
 * Statewide, 43,036 high school students are enrolled in the programs, a 
number that has increased about 5% a year since 1986. In Orange County, 1,100 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 * When students enter the agriculture program, they automatically become 
members of the Future Farmers of America, which has been recognized as an 
integral part of agriculture education. A portion of a student's grade -- at 
Fullerton High it's 20% -- is based on FFA participation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Students, split about evenly between girls and boys, have diverse goals: 
Some go on to college to major in business, agriculture, veterinary science or 
other areas; some use their skills to enter the work force directly out of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 * The signature bright-blue jackets of the FFA, with the wearer's name in 
gold-stitch, are worn by students participating in FFA functions. Students are 
eligible to wear the jackets -- which cost $40 -- when they enter the program.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; MIXED REVIEWS FOR CONSUMER CAR 'BIBLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's spring, time for high school proms, fertilizing the garden and the annual 
auto issue of Consumer Reports -- the source of information used most by 
American car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Consumer Reports, published by the nonprofit Consumers Union, 
assembles about 300 pages of information on the dimensions, prices, performance 
and features of almost every model sold in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual issue is famous for its "Frequency of Repair" rankings of 
automobile reliability. It surveys subscribers about their problems with their 
cars and presents the results in charts with colored dots for each mechanical 
system. A red dot is very good and a black dot is a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 If 2% of the survey respondents report problems with a Ford Taurus engine, for 
example, the car gets a red dot; a few more complaints, half a red dot -- 
through gradations to cars with problems reported by more than 14.8%, which get 
black dots. 
</P>
<P>
 But how reliable is the Consumer Reports evaluation of auto reliability? Most 
automobile experts say the magazine deserves a lot of respect for the annual 
car issue but fault the "Frequency of Repair" rating. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power & Associates and Intellichoice issue their own automobile 
evaluations that differ significantly from Consumer Reports, both in 
methodology and results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Complete Car Cost Guide, published by Intellichoice, estimates the annual 
cost of repairs based on data it obtains from insurance firms that sell service 
contracts to consumers. These service contracts are based on analyses of each 
model's mechanical problems, says Steve Gross, marketing manager at 
Intellichoice. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power publishes reliability and quality indexes based on random surveys 
of a minimum of 500 owners of each model, says John Ready, editor of the 
reports. The surveys are sold to car manufacturers, although the firm issues 
abbreviated public releases of its findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer Reports is not as accurate from a research standpoint as ours," 
Ready says. "There seems to be a definite bias in their results." 
</P>
<P>
 Rana Arons of Consumer Reports says the publication has never asserted that 
its "Frequency of Repair" indexes are scientifically based or free from bias, 
but instead that they represent the views of a very large number of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The index is based on a voluntary survey of the magazine's 5 million 
subscribers, who receive survey forms in the mail. Fewer than 10% fill in the 
forms, a response rate at the low end of what survey experts consider adequate 
to assure statistical reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the survey is based only on subscribers to the magazine, it might 
reflect the bias of those individuals. Arons says the publication declines to 
discuss the demographics of its readers, except to acknowledge that they are 
better educated and have higher incomes than average Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from possible bias, critics of the "Frequency of Repair" charts fault 
the magazine's ratings on two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it isn't clear that the margins of 2% to 14.8% are valid 
determinants of good and bad performance. And the Consumer Reports surveys make 
little distinction between a motorist who has a relatively minor repair and one 
who has a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Pitcoff, manager for research and analysis at Ford Motor Co., says 
Consumer Reports survey findings often conflict with Ford's surveys. Pitcoff 
also questions the magazine's results because identical cars marketed under 
different names are often ranked differently in its charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Consumer Reports is very influential," he says, "but there are a lot 
of unexplained things in their data."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite their criticism, Pitcoff and others say the magazine deserves credit 
for helping inform car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty accurate," a Honda spokesman says. "But the consumer needs to 
use it as only one of a series of tools in buying a car."

THE GOODS; CYBURBIA; IN FANTASY BALL, THE COMPUTER IS A REAL TEAM PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any baseball manager involved in the now ubiquitous fantasy leagues, 
Albany, N.Y., teen-ager Sean Sullivan was always on the lookout for any edge he 
could get to boost his team's standing. Six years ago when he was 15, he found 
what was then an almost secret weapon. He discovered on-line computer services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that I could get information by talking to other baseball fans 
that was not available in my hometown newspaper or on the radio," says 
Sullivan, now a computer science undergraduate at Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute in Troy, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is the lifeblood of fantasy baseball (also known, in its classic 
form, as Rotisserie baseball after the New York restaurant La Rotisserie 
Francaise where it was supposedly invented in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
 Each player is manager of his or her own team made up of real-life players 
from the major league rosters. Points are scored based on how your players 
perform on a day-to-day basis in hits, runs, home runs, stolen bases and other 
categories. Managers constantly make trades to strengthen their teams. That's 
where a computer on-line service, accessible over a telephone line, comes in 
handy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are on the East Coast, a West Coast night game might not even make it 
into the local newspaper the next day," Sullivan says. "But if you get on-line 
and talk to someone in the city where the game is being played, they might be 
able to give you details right then that you'll never get in the paper -- how a 
player did that night, was there a possible injury." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of information a manager craves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found," says Sullivan, who now gets his information through the giant 
Internet network and last year won his league's championship with his team, the 
Orange Crush, "this would give me an edge over other players in Albany." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no longer much of a secret. Thousands of fantasy players now not only 
get information by chatting up other baseball fans on the Internet, CompuServe, 
Prodigy and other on-line networks, but also play the game over the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people calling in from all over the world -- Caracas, London -- to 
play," says Harry Conover, head of Sports Forum Fantasy, a Boston-based company 
that runs the league on CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are always looking for information -- reading the entrails, the tea 
leaves -- only now it's by high-speed computer modems." 
</P>
<P>
 Conover says about 2,000 players subscribe to his company's services on 
CompuServe and thousands of others make liberal use of its message service. "We 
have capacity for 1,800 messages in the sports fantasy area," Conover says, 
"and it turns over completely every 27 hours." Prodigy officials declined to 
say how many fantasy players use their service, but it's also in the 
"thousands."  
</P>
<P>
 The Prodigy service costs subscribers less than CompuServe, but fantasy 
players pay extra fees to play the game on-line. All Prodigy subscribers can 
use the sports news areas (including complete box scores of games 30 minutes 
after play ends) and messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy baseball might be the new digital American pastime, but it's still an 
overwhelmingly male enterprise. "It's one of the things I was never able to 
figure out," Conover says. "I go to ballparks and there are thousands of women 
in the stands, enjoying the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I was told by a woman, 'It's just that we have better things to do.' And 
you know, I think she's right."

THE GOODS; FLOWER POWER; TO MAKE MOM'S DAY, BE ORGANIZED, FLEXIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to send flowers for Mother's Day on Sunday and you haven't 
ordered, you should pick up the phone right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that 21 million other people are also sending bouquets to their moms 
this weekend, according to the Floral Index in Chicago, which tracks flower 
sales nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may work to say, 'At your door in 30 minutes' for a pizza, but it doesn't 
work for a bouquet of flowers," says Rocky Pollitz of Teleflora wire service. 
She advises ordering at least two days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have the flowers delivered in advance, not on Mother's Day," advises Julie 
Mulligan of the New York-based 800-Flowers, which expects to handle between 
750,000 and 1 million orders this weekend. "You can't guarantee they will get 
there on time Sunday morning, just when your mother is sitting around wondering 
if you remembered her." 
</P>
<P>
 If you ignore rule No. 1 (order early), it becomes particularly important to 
heed rule No. 2: Give the florist some choices. 
</P>
<P>
 We tested that advice with a dry run. When we ordered flowers delivered from 
five Southern California florists specifying only "$40 worth of the nicest 
spring flowers you have," the results, pictured on this page, were varied in 
style but similar in value. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all high in quality," says Jim Hynd, a floral designer and vice 
president of Fiesta Parade Floats, who critiqued the five for us. "By giving 
the florist some leeway, you got the best available material. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you insist on a certain kind of flower at this point, you are limiting 
yourself," Hynd adds. "Mother's Day is a horrendous crunch, and (florists) know 
what's available." 
</P>
<P>
 But customers should offer a few guidelines as to color and type of flower -- 
and be very specific about price. Don't give the florist an "anything goes" 
open order, Hynd warns. At this late date, you might get anything. 
</P>
<P>
 If you pick out the flowers yourself, experts say look for freshness, pinch 
for firmness and choose flowers on the tight side, with a combination of open 
petals and buds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like picking out vegetables -- if you press gently and it bounces back, 
it's healthy," says Hynd, who deals with huge quantities of fresh flowers in 
designing Rose Parade floats. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other major flower holidays, where the favorite colors are strong and 
vivid, Mother's Day flower shoppers lean toward soft colors. "Basically, people 
want pastel spring flowers -- pinks and lavenders with something soft like 
baby's breath," Pollitz says. "It's what they think mother should be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother's Day used to be a carnation-and-rose holiday, but the old traditions 
don't hold anymore," says Frank Kuwahara, president of the wholesale Southern 
California Flower Market in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all kinds of flowers available -- little tiny tulips, many 
varieties of daffodils, baby roses in pots -- that make wonderful gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorites, he adds, are the spring bulb flowers -- such as freesias, 
jonquils and tulips. "And this year we'll have some good lilacs for Mother's 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Although potted plants and bedding plants are also purchased for Mother's Day 
gifts, cut flowers lead the list, according to statistics from the Society of 
American Florists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about cut flowers that you just can't express any other 
way," Hynd says. "A beautiful arrangement just lasts a few days, but the memory 
lingers on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is how five florists filled an order for $40 worth of spring flowers. The 
critiques are from floral decorator Jim Hynd.  
</P>
<P>
 Apropos Florist, Beverly Hills: "An elegant, subtle arrangement with an open 
look that showcases each sophisticated flower, including miniature double 
tulips and dendrobium orchids." 
</P>
<P>
 Saywell Florist, Downey: "A hand-tied bouquet in a vase is popular for its 
garden-gathered natural look. It's so compact you could almost make two groups 
out of this arrangement. Lilies are the center point, with splashes of lilacs, 
which have a very short period of market availability, adding a very nostalgic 
and romantic touch." 
</P>
<P>
 California Floral Co., Downtown: "The basket has a casual feeling, and the 
nicest feature here is the outstanding use of color. Magentas, purples, hot 
pinks and lavenders of the mums, miniature carnations and gerbera daisies are 
highlighted by yellow centers of the mums and yellow statice." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Flower Mart, Glendale: "Generous abundance of gerbera daisies, mums, 
carnations and irises, with baby's breath used effectively for filler. Arranged 
with a knack for extending the bouquet's life with some buds still to open on 
the Stargazer pink lilies and yellow lilies."  
</P>
<P>
 Visser's Florist, Anaheim: "Highly stylized triangular arrangement is artfully 
designed with flowers in intense color groupings. Lively yellow gerbera and 
blue delphinium are cut dramatically through the middle by hot pink 
snapdragons."

HELLO, FRANCES -- AND GOODBY, YUPPIE NAMES; FAMILIES: PARENTS ARE REACHING BACK 
INTO HISTORY AND ANCESTRY TO GIVE THEIR INFANTS SIMPLE, SOLID APPELLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE L. MacLACHLAN, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So friends of yours are having a baby. Soon little Dylan and Caitlan will have 
a brother or sister. You can't wait to hear what hip name of the '90s they'll 
come up with for this child. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's announced: Felix for a boy and Frances for a girl. Unbelievable! 
What has happened to your cutting-edge friends? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, they're still way ahead. Gone are the 1980s and upwardly mobile 
yuppie names like Lindsay and Morgan, says Pamela Satran, co-author of "Beyond 
Jennifer & Jason," an "enlightened" guide to naming babies in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are searching their family trees, looking for names with history and 
depth, she says. In other words, names that are traditional or classic are now 
fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '90s, there's more of a feeling of looking for meaning," says Satran, 
who has three young children of her own. "There is a less pretentious take on 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the hottest names today are what Satran calls the "Volvo" names -- 
solid, dependable, trend-resistant -- "chic of the reverse kind." The most 
popular of these are Caroline, Charlotte and Claire for girls; Henry, Jack and 
Thomas for boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes a name stylish is what makes anything stylish," Satran says. "It 
has to do with commonality of value." 
</P>
<P>
 Style can be taken too far, however. Satran's book includes a chapter on names 
that are So Far In They're Out. Parents should beware of trendiness in choosing 
these names. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the coin are names that are so far out, they're in. 
Satran calls these the "Edna" names. "I think these Edna names are most likely 
to come back in," she says. "It seems strange, but at the turn of the 20th 
Century, a lot of these names were at the height of fashion." They include 
Flora, Hazel, Leonora, Harriet, Calvin, Dexter, Gilbert and Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of names in general use has stayed relatively stable, says Leslie 
Dunkling, author of "The Guinness Book of Names" and founder of the 
British-based Names Society. About 100 boys' names and 125 girls' names account 
for approximately 90% of all the names given in one year among the white 
population, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the most popular names for 1993 
were Michael for a boy and Ashley for a girl, says spokeswoman Susan Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular culture, too, always influences parents' choice of names. "Novels, 
movies and celebrities put names into the public arena and into the 
consciousness of parents," Dunkling says. Celebrities "mirror society, and then 
society mirrors them back," Satran adds. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular new trends is naming a child after a place that is 
significant to the parents. Nurseries may soon be filled with Africas, 
Chelseas, Indias and Savannahs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought about what we would name the baby every day I was pregnant," says 
Michele Waldie, who lives in Washington with her son, John (Jake) Killian, and 
a newborn daughter named Mary Katherine. "We weren't concerned about what would 
be stylish in the future -- we just wanted something that sounded strong. We 
chose two simple, old-fashioned names. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion played a major role when Nancy and Peter Gould were thinking about a 
name for their son, Samuel Louis, who is just over a year old. "In the Jewish 
religion, you name babies after someone who has died to carry on the memory," 
says Nacy Gould, who lives with her family in Wilmington, Mass. The couple used 
the first initials of two of their grandfathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she never considered naming Sam after a place, she says she has 
friends who did. The friends' last name is Park and when their son, Solomon, 
was born, they came close to giving him a middle name that holds a lot of 
meaning for them: Fenway. In the end, they couldn't do it. But they still went 
the fashionable route: They chose an old, religious family name.

EXCERPTS FROM 'STANDING FIRM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some highlights from Dan Quayle's "Standing Firm": 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget any questions about inhaling. Quayle was worried that a college 
arrest for underage drinking might prove his political undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * His father, a newspaper owner, refused to remove his jacket even in the most 
stifling of outdoor summer news conferences in hot-and-humid Indiana. Quayle pe 
re was worried that the bulldog tattooed on his forearm might embarrass his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marilyn Quayle, for her part, was worried that in the crush of the campaign, 
she might not get 1988 school shopping done for Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne. 
Ever efficient, she did all her buying before leaving for the GOP convention in 
New Orleans.

 * Sometimes the "self-importance" of the press was amazing, Quayle writes. 
Think of the time former Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn said to him, "Did 
you ever think you'd be among so many important people?" Quayle concludes she 
meant herself and the rest of the media present. 
</P>
<P>
 * There's such a thing as wearing objectivity on your sleeve -- but apparently 
not on your shirt. One New York Times reporter showed up in the White House 
press room wearing a T-shirt depicting Edvard Munch's creepy painting "The 
Scream," with the caption "President Quayle?" 
</P>
<P>
 * How 'bout those White House insiders? Former Chief of Staff Jim Baker cared 
only about "what was in it for Jim Baker," Quayle writes. Jack Kemp nattered 
on, wandering onto "tangents" that had "no discernible point." And the handlers 
who surrounded George Bush "made the President look foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 * Combat with the press was often downright intoxicating. "I loved every 
minute of it," Quayle relates. 
</P>
<P>
 * On a judicial level, racism had ended in this country by 1989, writes 
Quayle: "No one could seriously argue that in our country the races were still 
unequal before the law." 
</P>
<P>
 * Quayle may have been portrayed as "the $650-million man" because of his 
family's wealth. But his own circumstances were far more modest, he insists. To 
pay for her inaugural attire, Marilyn Quayle sold the family van. ELIZABETH

DODGERS SURVIVE AT 'STICK; BASEBALL: MARTINEZ STRONG FOR EIGHT, THEN DREIFORT 
SAVES THE DAY IN NINTH AFTER A 9-3 LEAD TURNS INTO A 9-6 SCARE.

 Darren Dreifort heard the crowd of 23,271 at Candlestick Park on Thursday 
night, and how could he not? The San Francisco Giants, who had trailed by six 
runs at the start of the ninth inning, had just scored three runs to cut the 
Dodgers' lead to 9-6, a score that would stand.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who, like the Dodgers, has shown a propensity this season for 
keeping things interesting, had relieved Jim Gott, and once again, did his 
part.  
</P>
<P>
 With no one out and a runner on third, Dreifort gave up a fielder's choice for 
the Giants' final run, a soft liner to right and then hit Darren Lewis to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "A crowd is a crowd; they are going to yell, no big deal," Dreifort said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda watched with interest. With Todd Worrell 
sidelined, Dreifort, 21, has been anointed the closer.  
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he gets out of more jams than he gets into, that's fine with me," 
Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort came back to strike out Robby Thompson and Dave Martinez, and that 
was good, because Matt Williams, who hit his league-leading 13th homer 
Thursday, was on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he was in the on-deck circle," said Dreifort, who earned his 
third save. "I didn't know where we were in the order." 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-inning squirming in the Dodger dugout came long after the Dodgers 
had scored six runs in the fifth inning to take a 7-1 lead. Mike Piazza, who 
helped ruin an entire season for the Giants in their final game of 1993, 
continued his domination, when his two-run opposite-field homer started the 
scoring in the six-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of a four-game series that brought the Giants wanting revenge and 
the Dodgers wanting to reach the top of the division, Piazza drove in three 
runs and homered against Giant ace John Burkett (3-2). Burkett began the game 
with the third lowest earned-run average in the league and left in the fifth 
inning ranked among the rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it was the Dodgers' ace of old, Ramon Martinez (1-2), who held 
the Giants to one run and two hits through the first six innings and also 
helped out with two hits, including a two-run double in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who has struggled this season, sailed quickly through the game until 
the seventh inning, when he gave up two runs, including a leadoff homer by Matt 
Williams. He needed help in the ninth after giving up two consecutive singles 
to start the inning and was relieved by Jim Gott, who didn't help at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Gott gave up two run-scoring hits to reduce the Dodgers' lead to four runs. 
Then in came Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bullpen is too good, I have no worries about our pitching at all -- we 
are going to be fine," said Tim Wallach, who was two for five with a double. 
"Dreifort is cool. In that situation with the crowd and being here, it showed a 
lot of moxie." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who earned his first victory, said before the game that all he 
wanted to do was go out and have a good outing, and it helped that he was 
facing the Giants, who have the worst offense in the league. But what helped 
Martinez more was the Dodgers' potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers hit three home runs against three pitchers, with Eric Karros, who 
also singled and doubled, hitting his third of the year and Brett Butler a solo 
shot to right field for the Dodgers' final run.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing here at Candlestick," said Butler, who was three for four and 
scored three runs.  
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty at stake in this early-season series. The Dodgers began the 
series two games behind the Giants and in third place in the National League 
West with a chance to take over the top spot, which the Giants have held all 
season. This is the first meeting for either club against a division opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 But this was not quite the way the Giants wanted to start this series, with a 
loss and without Barry Bonds. Bonds, who was hit by a pitch Wednesday by the 
New York Mets' Eric Hillman, is sidelined on a day-to-day basis. X-rays and a 
CAT scan taken Thursday showed no broken bones in his injured right arm, and 
early indications were he will play sometime in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonds, despite seven home runs, has been struggling at the plate along 
with most of the regulars. Contrary to last season, when the Giants' offense 
was strong from the start, Williams and Willie McGee are the only regulars who 
have been hitting well. It has been the pitching and fielding that have kept 
the Giants in first place in the West, but not even Burkett could hold up 
against the Dodger's offense.
