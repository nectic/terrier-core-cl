MOVIE REVIEW; SIMPLE LESSONS FROM 'GUMP'; TURNING A PARTICULARLY HAREBRAINED 
LENS ON SOME TURBULENT DECADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forrest Gump may have an IQ of 75, but don't be telling him he's slow. "What 
does normal mean anyway?" his mama always used to say, among other things. 
"Stupid is as stupid does." A kind of holy fool who succeeds brilliantly in 
life while nominally wiser folk get all bollixed up, Forrest's story offers a 
bemused chance to view the most turbulent decades of recent American history 
through a particularly harebrained lens. 
</P>
<P>
 There is magic in "Forrest Gump," but almost by definition magic can't last 
and it doesn't here. In many ways a sweet piece of work with a gentle and 
eccentric sensibility, this Robert Zemeckis-directed film stumbles whenever it 
attempts what Forrest never did -- forcing its charm in search of obvious 
sentimentality and grander points about society. Forrest would have been 
horrified, and, as usual, he would have been right. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming after "Being There," "Rain Man" and what seems like every film starring 
Johnny Depp, "Forrest Gump" is a further example of Hollywood's fascination 
with the mentally challenged. Given how cutthroat and dismissive an industry 
the movie business is, unlikely to so much as return Gump's phone calls in real 
life, this determination to celebrate slowness as wisdom and to confuse the 
ability to make nice with moral profundity is certainly food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Convincingly played by Tom Hanks, Gump comes into view at his ease on a bus 
bench in Savannah, Ga., in 1981, talking away to whoever's handy, oblivious as 
usual to the fact that some people are not in a mood to listen. His deliberate 
but charming Southern-accented voice-over (scripted by Eric Roth from a novel 
by Winston Groom) runs throughout the entire film, telling his story, and, not 
quite coincidentally, the story of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child in Alabama, Forrest (named after Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford 
Forrest) is shepherded through life by his fierce mother (Sally Field, 
inevitably). Set apart from other children by his need to wear leg braces, he 
forms an instant attachment to a little girl named Jenny who asks him to sit 
next to her on the school bus. Like Androcles and that lion, a Gump doesn't 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Forrest never pushes himself forward, it is "Gump's" amiable conceit 
that sheer happenstance frequently puts him in a position to either witness or 
influence history. Even as a child, in one of the film's most engaging 
sequences, he ends up having a considerable impact on the career of Elvis 
Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest's knack for being around great events eventually results in multiple 
newsreel appearances, a situation that has given director Zemeckis, who can't 
seem to make a film anymore without special effects ("Back to the Future," "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit," "Death Becomes Her"), a chance to once again grandly feed 
his habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Related to the newsreels in Woody Allen's "Zelig," only much more elaborate 
and impressive, the effects -- created by Industrial Light & Magic -- are 
showstoppers, presenting Forrest convincingly interacting with several 
Presidents, including John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Clever and 
light-fingered without being overdone, these effects (as well as a later 
subplot involving a double amputee also done on computer) are "Gump" at its 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From Elvis, Forrest goes on (don't ask how) to a football scholarship at the 
University of Alabama just when George Wallace made a last stand for 
segregation, and then to service in Vietnam ("a whole other country"), where he 
meets two men who have lasting influence on his life. One is fellow grunt 
Benjamin Buford (Bubba) Blue (Mykelti Williamson), who knows more than Forrest 
thought there was to know about shrimping, and the men's superior officer, Lt. 
Dan (Gary Sinise), the direct descendant of a long line of military losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all of this and more, Forrest can never put sweet Jenny (Robin Wright) 
out of his mind. While he proceeds tortoise-like through life, she is the 
scattered rabbit, involving herself in every au courant movement from topless 
folk singing to radical politics and heavy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wright makes it easy to understand why Forrest remains fixated on Jenny, 
she has been so transparently made into Everyperson, and the film is so willing 
to milk the pathos in their relationship, that not enough naturalness makes it 
into their connection. 
</P>
<P>
 And as its 2-hour and 22-minute length and the care expended in capturing 
period make clear, "Gump" is also too eager to see itself as making larger and 
more important points about what America went through both pre- and 
post-Vietnam. How else to explain its awkward habit of having Gump mention, in 
a way that relates to nothing else in the film, whenever an assassination takes 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to this overreaching, Hanks is one of the film's strengths, the look 
of deadpan comic determination on his face never wavering as he works to unify 
the movie's diverse strands. Although Hanks never breaks through to the point 
where we forget that we are watching a performance, however expert, "Forrest 
Gump" would be in serious trouble without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it is as a wacky tall tale about some pretty unbelievable adventures 
that "Forrest Gump" works best, ironically commenting on what it takes to be a 
success in today's America. It's most successful when it is being off-center, a 
state of grace it doesn't quite have the nerve to maintain.

MUSIC; BOOKING AN ORCHESTRAL JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer can be a time to catch up on reading you meant to do, especially if 
you're interested in learning more about music. This column is the first in a 
series devoted to current books that can make you a more perceptive listener.  
</P>
<P>
 Think of every symphony as a kind of jigsaw puzzle. All the instruments of the 
orchestra are the possible pieces of the puzzle; the way they're put together 
help to make a specific picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Antony Hopkins' "Sounds of the Orchestra" (Oxford Paperbacks, $7.95) helps you 
see that picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The book starts with a brief history of how the orchestra evolved. The author, 
a British composer, broadcaster and musicologist, describes every instrument 
and gives its individual history, range of notes and system of notation. 
</P>
<P>
 This last point is important because if you look at an orchestral score, it 
appears that instruments are playing in different keys. They're not actually, 
and there are good historical reasons for the apparent discrepancies, but the 
score does look confusing at first. 
</P>
<P>
 This part makes a good and useful reference text. Part Two, however, becomes 
much more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Hopkins look specifically at the scoring of seven works, beginning with 
the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40. 
</P>
<P>
 He then takes up Beethoven's Second Symphony (scherzo), Schubert's Eighth 
(first movement), Berlioz' "Symphonie Fantastique" (last movement), 
Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy, Debussy's "Prelude a 
l'Apres-midi d'un Faune" and the "Four Sea Interludes" from Britten's "Peter 
Grimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis is on how each composer uses and blends the colors of the 
instruments. In some instances, Hopkins considers alternative scoring 
possibilities and explains why they are not as good as the ones the composers 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the composers didn't have much choice. They had to deal with 
limitations in the range of instruments available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert, for instance, had to alter a descending line because the string 
basses of his day could not play as low as he wanted to write. Tchaikovsky, in 
contrast, could write striking scale-like passages for trumpets because 
musicians of his day played valved instruments that expanded their capabilities 
-- instruments that were not available to Mozart and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that technological developments do have musical consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most composers had the opportunity to learn to orchestrate by listening to 
their own works or to the works of others. Poor Schubert -- it seems almost 
impossible to start a sentence about this composer without adding the adjective 
-- did not. 
</P>
<P>
 He never had the luxury of hearing any of his symphonies played, except 
perhaps by amateur groups. Yet unerringly guided by his own genius, he created 
a perfect and distinct sound world in the "Unfinished" Symphony, "not a bar of 
which is derivative," writes Hopkins, "causing an inner voice to murmur to us 
'How like Beethoven . . . ' or 'A touch of Mozart there!' " 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, the author takes one short passage -- the accompaniment for the 
famous second theme -- and suggests five possible scorings for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, the notes remain the same. They are just distributed among 
different combinations of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert used none of these possibilities. He came up with a sixth. "His 
solution," writes Hopkins, "clarinets in the upper octave, violas in the lower, 
is the perfect one, though it was probably devised instinctively." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Schubert, Tchaikovsky often is regarded as a swoony naif who poured out 
melody after melody without much conscious control. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as evident here and also in Roland John Wiley's indispensable book, 
"Tchaikovsky's Ballets" (Oxford University Press), Tchaikovsky was meticulous 
and crafty in his choices. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the somber opening of the "Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy, for 
instance, Tchaikovsky used specific techniques: keeping the second clarinet 
part "consistently" below the first bassoon to produce "a somber blend of 
tone-color that is typical of Tchaikovsky"; and widely spaced interlocking 
chords is "to give a feeling of emptiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Even "the precise placing of the cymbal clashes," Hopkins notes, "reveals the 
care with which Tchaikovsky would orchestrate even the loudest passages, since 
for the most part they are slotted in at the exact moment where the remainder 
of the orchestra has a quaver (eighth-note) rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, the author indulges in scene-painting speculations that 
are not musical or helpful. "I am convinced," he writes, "that Tchaikovsky 
imagined that the tale was being told by Friar Laurence . . . (who) pauses to 
sigh at the memory (of the lovers' tragic end), a sigh we hear eloquently 
expressed on the strings (bars 52-60)." 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite a sigh. But one can still appreciate the details of Hopkins' 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Debussy planned to compose a three-movement work in response to the famous 
Stephane Mallarme poem on the Afternoon of a Faun, but he only finished one. 
Yet in that one, Debussy changed "the whole conception of how to orchestrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins has to discuss the entrance of each instrument almost bar by bar to 
show how Debussy "seems to enter into a new world of tonal experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Debussy and other composers were reacting against the pervasive 
influence of Richard Wagner, and in turn, Benjamin Britten wound up reacting 
against the Impressionism of Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Four Sea Interludes," Britten, too, created a kind of nature painting. 
But how different the sound.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where Debussy often seems intent on disguising sound by infinitely subtle 
blending," writes Hopkins, "Britten is determined to expose it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His treatment of the individual instruments is often inventive and ingenious 
in the extreme, but he prefers to bring out their essential qualities rather 
that to distort or conceal." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins then details the "precision, economy and consistency" in Britten's 
orchestration as he creates four separate "pictures" of the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you'll find Hopkins' writing hard going and it is best if you can 
follow his discussion with a copy of the score as well as by listening to a 
recording. But it will be impossible to listen to any music again without being 
aware of the orchestration and how it contributes to the meaning of an 
individual work.

 False Alarm: A centerpiece taken from the June 28 premiere party for MGM's new 
movie "Blown Away" caused a real-life stir in the Los Angeles Sheriff's bomb 
squad on Sunday when officers evacuated an apartment building in West Hollywood 
after what appeared to be a bomb was sighted in a nearby car. The device turned 
out to be six road flares tied together. Actress Cassandra Gava had left the 
gadget sitting on the seat of her Datsun 280Z while visiting a friend in an 
apartment building on Fountain Avenue. At about 8 a.m., the entire building was 
evacuated and it took two bomb squad officers about three hours to determine 
the bomb was indeed a fake, a sheriff's spokesman said. An MGM spokeswoman said 
the gadget was a centerpiece and was not meant to be taken home by guests. The 
Sheriff's Department is currently investigating how the incident occurred.

Cable's USA Network has announced plans for "Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters 
From Beverly Hills," a live-action children's series about four teen-agers 
chosen by an alien to save the Earth from the forces of an evil intergalactic 
emperor. The teens have special tattoos that flash when they are summoned to 
duty. Co-produced by DIC Entertainment, the half-hour program premieres Sept. 
19 and will air weeknights at 6 p.m.

 * Lawsuit Out of the Gate: "America's Talking," the new cable-TV network owned 
by NBC, has already been slapped with a lawsuit. Martin Israel, host of a local 
Los Angeles cable-TV show called "America Talks," has sued NBC for $15 million 
charging the network's title is copyright infringement. Israel says in his Los 
Angeles Federal Court lawsuit that his show has been on the air since 1984. A 
statement from NBC said the network's attorneys are reviewing the case and that 
in their view "there is no merit to this claim." "America's Talking" premiered 
on Monday.

annual Labor Day Telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. Lewis is traveling 
across the country, taping advance segments for this year's telethon, which 
will be called "Stars Across America!" He began the blitz with a trip to MDA's 
summer camp near San Diego where he visited with youngsters affected by 
neuromuscular diseases. Future stops include a July 13 visit with Mel Tillis 
and other country music stars performing in Branson, Mo.; a July 17 stop at New 
York's Pegasus Room to join jazz singers Maureen McGovern, Barbara Cook and 
Julie Budd; and a July 31 Royal Caribbean cruise from Miami to St. Thomas where 
Lewis will tape a live comedy performance. The actual telethon originates live 
from Las Vegas' Sahara Hotel on Sept. 4-5. The program, broadcast by more than 
200 stations nationwide, raised $46 million last year for MDA's fight. THE ARTS

 Museum Windfall: The Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, has received a

to date," MCA Director Hugh M. Davies said the first floor exhibition gallery 
of the museum's downtown San Diego facility will be named for donor David 
Copley. The $11.5-million campaign -- of which $10.3 million has been raised, 
including the Copley gift -- will benefit a renovation and expansion of the

THEATER REVIEW; 'EDUCATED WOMEN' GIVEN A POLISHED OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Moliere's last plays and greatest satires, "Educated Women," currently 
at the Theatricum Botanicum in rustic Topanga Canyon, may give the first 
impression of being every feminist's nightmare. On the surface, the play is a 
scathing send-up that depicts female scholars as addle-pated twits. Moliere 
seems to be making the case that women would be better off tending to their 
knitting (or other domestic concerns) while letting their menfolk handle the 
weightier issues that put their poor little brains on overload. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Moliere, never comfortable without tongue planted firmly in cheek, is 
after bigger game than uppity females. On closer inspection, he's actually 
gunning for his favorite target -- those pretentious Parisian intellectuals who 
harried him throughout his career, succeeded in getting his masterwork 
"Tartuffe" banned for years and remained a general nuisance to him until the 
end of his days. "Educated Women" is one of Moliere's most lethal 
counterattacks on his detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The foppish Trissotin, played by Philip Littell, hilariously embodies 
Moliere's worst nightmare, an empty-headed poseur whose absolute lack of talent 
does not impede his rapacious pursuit of intellectual notoriety.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most of Paris considers Trissotin to be notorious -- a notorious bore. 
It is only in the household of the unfortunate Chrysale (David Ellenstein) that 
Trissotin has found an audience for his nonsense. Chrysale's wife Philaminte 
(Susan Angelo), his sister Belise (Melora Marshall) and his daughter Armande 
(Holly Orfanedes), Trissotin's fawning acolytes, are spectacularly dizzy dames 
whose dilettantish dabblings in philosophy and the sciences have evidently 
destroyed their common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the other women in the family, Chrysale's sensible daughter 
Henriette (Inara George) is a real hearth-and-home kind of gal who just wants 
to marry her adored Clitandre (Kristofer Soul), a handsome young man of good 
sense and family. Chrysale is delighted with the match, but his missus, who 
"wears the pants," has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Littell, perhaps best known as a performance artist, also did the new 
translation for the play. No stranger to the classics, Littell, who 
collaborated with David Schweizer on the highly regarded "Plato's Symposium" a 
few seasons back, has brushed the cobwebs off this seldom-produced satire and 
given it a sprightly, thoroughly contemporary new sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Littell's portrayal of the insufferable Trissotin is as modern as his 
translation. Wittily underplayed, Trissotin slyly promotes his own venal ends 
while leaving the pedantic posturings to the women. And posture the women do, 
particularly Marshall, who flounces and froths her way through a delightfully 
overblown performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Director Ellen Geer leads her vigorous cast through this exhilarating romp, a 
production as polished as the Topanga terrain is rough. Cushions are a must, 
but a sore backside is a small price to pay for this delightful broadside. 
</P>
<P>

ART REVIEW; 'CONTEMPORARY NETSUKE': NO SMALL FEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who likes classic children's book illustrations or vintage Disney 
cartoons will love the L.A. County Museum of Art's endearing big little show 
"Treasured Miniatures: Contemporary Netsuke." 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate miniature Japanese carvings originally served practical 
purposes. In the traditional dress worn during the Edo period, netsuke served 
as toggles from which to suspend little boxes or pouches from sashes. When 
Japan was coerced into opening to the West in the 1860s, Western clothes with 
pockets became the rage, and, for a while, netsuke were obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since the law of paradox is as fixed as the law of gravity, 
foreigners were charmed by the micro-mini sculpture, started collecting 
examples first as curios, then as artworks. As a result, the best museum 
collections of netsuke (as well as of Japanese prints) today are in Western 
repositories. LACMA has its renowned Bushell collection, the British Museum 
possesses outstanding holdings. Their respective curatorial specialists, Robert 
Singer and Lawrence Smith, decided to organize and share an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the sheer delight of the thing, the 150-work show makes important 
points. First, the Japanese have clearly gotten back into their own game, as 
the show's honorary patron and principal lender is Prince Norihito Takamado. 
Second, the traditional art of netsuke carving is not dead or altogether 
debased to tourist kitsch, nor is the practice confined only to Japanese 
artists. Eleven of the 60 carvers whose work is on view are not Japanese. For 
some unfathomable reason, their works have been placed in a separate display 
case, but they prove themselves the peers of their Japanese colleagues. 
Finally, as a gesture of revulsion over the slaughter of the African elephant, 
the exhibition includes no ivory carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 All animals, including human beings, seem to come with a gene that makes us 
suckers for small things. It has been said it's there to keep us from killing 
our children. Whatever the reason, something in us goes dewy-eyed at the mere 
sight of these things. The artists are happy to play to this weakness. After 
all, they're not out to do Michelangelo's "David" -- and if they were, he'd get 
cute too.

 Kozan Fukuyama's "Here I Go!" depicts a hippo handstand that's at least as 
funny as the hippo ballet in "Fantasia." He also shows a dodo bird John Tenniel 
would recognize from his "Alice" illustrations. It's called "Wonderland." 
Masami Sakai's little bear is straight out of "Winnie the Pooh," and Kansui 
Wakabayashi contributes a frog who has read "The Wind in the Willows." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with amber bunnies, mahogany bats and ebony tigers, there is matter to 
appeal to the grown-up-inside-the-child-within, such as sumo wrestlers, 
delicate geishas and memento mori skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiho Takagi likes to make deeper points by adding complication to intricacy. 
He does two-part pieces that imply narrative. "Rikyu and Hideyoshi" presents 
itself as an austere tea vessel of the type favored by Rikyu, founder of the 
Japanese tea ceremony. The vessel (about an inch-and-a-half tall) opens to 
reveal an ostentatious gold tea service of the type favored by the Shogun 
Hideyoshi. For a time he was Rikyu's patron, but they had a falling out, so the 
Shogun ordered Rikyu to commit ritual suicide, which Rikyu was honored to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a contrast between the Japanese and other carvers, it is probably 
that the newcomers are a trifle more restrained. Australia's Vaughan Cottle 
makes a cultural joke by applying the Japanese form to the image of a cowboy 
hat, boots and lariat. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a touching quality of self-abnegation in the whole practice of making 
netsuke that shows up in Cottle's work. Why would anyone carve a life-size 
snail shell from a stag antler and then put a tiny gold bug inside if he didn't 
think that life is altogether absurd and wonderful?

 NO-SHOW: Anyone who has followed Bo Jackson is familiar with the "Bo Knows" 
Nike campaign. So when Bo agreed to take part in a festival at Magic Mountain 
in Valencia this month, officials used the slogan: "Bo Knows Basketball?" to 
hype it. . . . But, unfortunately, Bo, who plays with an artificial hip, knows 
medicine these days. He was forced to drop out, citing an important session 
with his doctors.

 VALLEY SONG: Tom Petty put Reseda on the map in his 1989 song, "Free Fallin'." 
Now L7, a hard rock band, could do the same for North Hollywood. The band has 
released "Andres," the first single from its new CD. . . . The song, which 
refers to a guy in North Hollywood with long hair, is being played often during 
the week on KROQ in Burbank.

 FARE ENOUGH? Need to ride public transit? Brace yourself for a possible double 
whammy. Not only are the MTA directors considering a bus fare increase from 
$1.10 to $1.35, but drivers are talking about a strike -- and may even walk out 
today (B1). . . . Some riders say it would be cheaper to buy a good used car.

 WORLD TURNS: American Jews may believe in the peace process, but it certainly 
can't be easy for many of them to watch Yasser Arafat's triumphant return to 
the West Bank (A1). . . . Phil Blazer, publisher of the monthly Jewish News in 
Studio City, says Arafat's visit makes him "hyperventilate. I think of the past 
and I have pain. I am amazed at how the world has changed, and that he is 
protected by Israeli security forces." 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHER RATES: The Jan. 17 quake claimed many casualties in the Valley, and you 
can now add insurance rates to that list (D1). Yes, homeowners insurance will 
be available, even though 20th Century in Woodland Hills is dropping out of the 
picture. But the premiums from other companies could be 20% to 25% higher than 
usual. . . . After all, insurers figure, someone has to pay for all the damage 
claims. Michael Arkush

 THANKLESS JOB: Investigators in the county medical examiner's office have many 
grim duties. Among the worst: notifying next of kin about a person's death. . . 
. But this contact allows them to determine if families would permit the 
donation of tissues from their loved ones. The office has helped with so many 
donations, it has received special recognition from the American Red Cross. . . 
. "It's a worthwhile program," Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran said. 
"There are so many people waiting in line for organs, for corneas so they can 
see and skin tissue for burns." 
</P>
<P>
 CURTAIN CALL: The grand opening of the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks may 
still be three months away, but tickets for such shows as "The Nutcracker" and 
"Little Shop of Horrors" are already on sale (B4). . . . Said Mayor Alex Fiore, 
who was among those who stood in line Tuesday to purchase tickets for magician 
David Copperfield: "This is the beginning of a new experience for the residents 
of our city and adjacent cities." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE MOVE: It just got a little easier to get around Ventura County. . . . 
At least that's the idea behind the county's new VISTA bus service that began 
operating Tuesday (B1). . . . For the first time, VISTA provides service 
linking every city in the county -- except Ojai. But Ojai residents shouldn't 
feel slighted, transit official Mary Travis said. Their city already offers 
connecting bus service to Ventura.

 TOUGH LUCK: Diane Evans of Simi Valley would like nothing better than to serve 
on the Ventura County Grand Jury. . . . The past two years, Evans has dutifully 
applied to sit on the panel that serves as government watchdog. Both times, she 
managed to make the first cut, which reduced the number of applicants to 30. 
But in each case, when the 19 jurors were selected by lottery, Evans' name 
failed to come up. . . . "I guess I'm just unlucky," said Evans, who as one of 
11 alternates still has a shot at serving on the jury this year. If not, she 
said she will apply again next year. "I'm persistent."

 A different type of court interpreter: Ever since two witnesses described a 
white Akita that led them to the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman, the district attorney's office has been deluged with calls about the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers wanted to know if the dog -- which was apparently Nicole 
Simpson's -- "could be called as a witness so it could pick out the killer" in 
the O.J. Simpson case, spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. "That makes for great 
TV, but you can't do that in court."

 Gibbons said one caller suggested a translator of sorts -- "an expert who knew 
how to talk to dogs."

 * "I expected to find cultural differences in Southern California and among 
the first I detected was . . . the practice of passing on the right by jumping 
the curb and driving on the sidewalks. This was impossible in Texas, where the 
blocks were short and the sidewalks narrow." 
</P>
<P>
 * While Eighner and Lizbeth were hitchhiking in Hollywood, "a prostitute came 
along, tears streaking her makeup and forced $2 on me. She said her little dog 
had been lost or stolen and she wanted me to buy Lizbeth something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I explained (to a driver who had picked him up) that I was planning to camp 
in the national forest while I wrote a script for an adult video. This my 
driver took in stride. To write adult videos in Southern California is rather 
analogous to being a bankruptcy lawyer in Austin or an undertaker elsewhere. It 
was an essential line of work, even if not everyone would desire it as an 
occupation."

INVESTING IN L.A.'S EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When businessman-philantropist Walter H. Annenberg announced last December 
that he would donate half a billion dollars to help make education reform a 
reality, it was an exciting moment for all of those who care about public 
school education. The donation is the largest ever for education. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes even more reason for excitement: Los Angeles education leaders are 
joining hands to make sure that this city benefits from Annenberg's largess. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be news that Los Angeles leaders have sat down and planned 
carefully how to capture part of the $500 million that Annenberg offers. 
However, the fragmented nature of government here, along with a woeful lack of 
communication among the many education advocates -- school administrators, 
teachers, business leaders and politicians -- has made it unusual for all the 
interested parties to work together. That's changing, and not a moment too 
soon. Los Angeles schools can wait no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's heartening to know, as Times staff writer Jean Merl reported Tuesday, 
that USC President Steven B. Sample, taking the initiative, recently called 
together various education leaders to deliver an important message: Annenberg 
is considering giving Los Angeles some of the funds but wants to know how 
education reform leaders would use the gift. Instead of bickering, instead of 
refusing to talk to all the other concerned parties, everyone got to work. A 
draft proposal already has been sent, and if the ideas attract Annenberg and 
his advisers, millions of dollars could come into Los Angeles to nurture and 
disseminate education reform efforts. The potential is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are conceiving this as a way to turbocharge the reform efforts already 
underway in the Los Angeles area," said Theodore Mitchell, dean of the UCLA 
Graduate School of Education and a member of LEARN (Los Angeles Educational 
Alliance for Restructuring Now). 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN, a coalition of educators, parents and civic leaders, already has done 
much to demonstrate Los Angeles' appetite for having parents, teachers and 
administrators work together to improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting Sample called may not have seemed to be L.A. history in the 
making, but it just may have been.

CRIME WATCH; LIFESAVING TEAMWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 12-year-old Kathleen (Katie) Romanek was abducted at knifepoint from her 
Lodi, Calif., home Saturday, community volunteers, law enforcement officers and 
the media responded immediately with an intense, highly publicized and 
well-coordinated search. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts, it turned out, paid off handsomely: Less than 24 hours after 
Katie disappeared, she was found alive and not seriously hurt in a field in the 
foothills of the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The happy ending stands in stark contrast to another recent case, that of 
Polly Klaas, who was kidnaped from her Petaluma home last October and was later 
found strangled. Richard Allen Davis, a convicted kidnaper, confessed to the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers will be the first to admit that luck plays a part in 
solving such crimes. But one big difference last weekend clearly was a more 
rapid response and better cooperation between authorities than in the Klaas 
kidnaping. And that, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is 
critical because the first 24 hours often can tip the balance between life and 
death in child abduction cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Police at Lodi not only contacted the FBI, they also contacted the Polly Klaas 
Foundation. The foundation quickly mobilized: It distributed 20,000 flyers 
throughout Northern California, contacted the media and organized volunteers to 
help with the search. Meanwhile, local law enforcement worked with the FBI's 
Sacramento bureau and its San Francisco office, which includes a special 
kidnaping task force.

WILL THE DIE-HARDS PLEASE PACK IT IN?; LET'S GET THE VITAL DESERT BILL ON THE 
ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an election year, so even something that should be really easy isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years of legislative wrestling have gone into shaping the enormously 
important California Desert Protection Act in Congress, which would preserve 
6.3 million acres of fragile and magnificent desert in Southern California. 
Numerous compromises were made to accommodate miners, off-road vehicle drivers, 
cattle ranchers and the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Now five Californians in the House, all Republicans, are staging a rear-guard 
filibuster that could kill the bill in Congress' haste to adjourn. They are 
Jerry Lewis of Redlands (the group's leader), Al McCand- less of La Quinta, 
Duncan Hunter of El Cajon, Bill Thomas of Bakersfield and Howard P. (Buck) 
McKeon of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 In April the act -- which would create three new national parks, including the 
Mojave National Park -- was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, and House 
passage seems assured. But the House cannot vote on the bill until it votes on 
45 pending amendments. To slow the process, the five Republicans are abusing 
the liberal rule for debate allowed for the bill, forcing lengthy debate and 
roll calls on each amendment, even ones with no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In two days of debate last month the House could dispose of only four 
amendments, and the leadership pulled the bill until after the July 4 recess. 
No vote has yet been taken on an odious amendment that would designate the 
Mojave park as a "preserve" rather than a park, thereby allowing hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsor, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), has asked the House Rules 
Committee to impose a stricter rule to cut debate. The committee told him to 
try to work with Lewis first. The two have now spoken, raising hopes for the 
legislation when Congress takes it up again next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, an ordinarily pragmatic moderate who represents much of the desert 
area, complains that California's senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, 
never consulted with him. Some surmise the delaying tactics also relate to 
politics: Feinstein's GOP challenger in the fall election, Rep. Michael 
Huffington of Santa Barbara, opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough. The bill has been honed and refined by eight years of political 
discourse and horse trading. Polls show that most Californians support it; the 
Senate liked it, a majority of the House is ready to vote "yes" and the 
President eager to sign it. The five die-hards should get out of the way.

DWORKIN ON SPOUSAL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrea Dworkin's article, "Trapped in a Pattern of Pain Where No One Can Help" 
(Opinion, June 26), had a deeply disturbing effect on me and should be required 
reading for every legislator. We have laws to protect children from abuse which 
do not require the child to press charges. When a battered woman repeatedly 
contacts authorities that in itself should be enough to warrant legal 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 My own experience in a previous marriage corroborates Dworkin's chilling 
description of spousal abuse. It is too late to save Nicole Simpson. Like too 
many women before her, she is dead. If we can finally admit women are being 
brutalized and it is not a domestic problem, but a violent crime where arrest 
should be mandatory, then maybe she won't have died for nothing. 
</P>

<P>
 After reading Dworkin's article on wife abuse, I came to the opinion that it 
was more a vehicle to describe her hate for men. Her generalizations were 
blatant, and statistics unsupported. 
</P>
<P>
 The word abuser is genderless, and there should be a very high price paid by 
those who choose to be abusers. Sadly, in a world lacking moral fortitude and a 
justice system that has become a playground for the wicked, it is the victim 
who usually ends up paying that price. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of article only expresses a mind-set that can neither accurately 
describe the problem nor offer any solutions.

<P>
 Regarding Dworkin's article on women being abused by their husbands: 
</P>
<P>
 This issue is a part of the pervasive view in our society that women and girls 
are the property of their fathers, husbands or lovers. The solution involves 
several things that all women in our society must have: access to reproductive 
health care -- contraceptives and abortion -- so that they can control their 
bodies and lives; educational opportunities equal to those of men; employment 
opportunities equal to those of men (currently prevented by the old boys' 
network), and salaries that equate to those of male workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there will be a basis for a societal attitude change. Then women will be 
empowered to walk out of an abusive relationship, and know that the abuser will 
be punished.

 Working through the long holiday weekend, the Legislature managed to pass a 
budget so the state will not have to resort to IOUs to pay its bills. The fact 
that the state is spared the fiscal chaos and obloquy that would have resulted 
otherwise is indeed good news. The bad news is that California now begins the 
new fiscal year with a level of deficit spending unprecedented since the Great 
Depression. Of course, Sacramento is operating in an economic environment 
unprecedented since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to "balance" the two-year, $57.3-billion budget, the state is taking 
on a record $7 billion in short-term borrowing, cutting benefits to the needy 
and disabled, and counting on, for year two, $2.8 billion in federal funds that 
are yet to be committed. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the budget -- which Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign today -- 
was politically expedient. But deficit spending will haunt us as it did before 
this budget was passed. A spooked Wall Street sought reassurances that 
California was good for its debt. The Legislature had to pass an unusual 
standby measure that triggers automatic spending cuts across the board if the 
state suffers cash-flow problems; the move ensures that creditors will be paid 
and helps to maintain California's credit rating -- for now. Only for now, 
because the red ink that threatened the state's credit rating will persist. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that the $3-billion deficit accumulated over the last three 
years will be whittled down significantly over the fiscal year or even the year 
after. It also is unlikely that the federal government will come through with 
the full $2.8 billion (although rightly it should) that Wilson is seeking in 
reimbursements for state services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The state budget process has long been dysfunctional. Fashioning a creative 
way to pay down the deficit should be a major issue in this year's governor's 
race. We must find some alternative to either significant new taxes or 
significant new cuts to vital social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Securing new loans to pay old loans to finance the costs of the deficit 
translates into a further decline in services and infrastructure. California 
simply cannot afford to mortgage its future forever.

U.S. SCIENCE, MATH EDUCATION

 "In High-Tech Age, U.S. Science and Math Education Falters" (editorial, June 
20) contains many valid points. But it fails to bring attention to the effects 
that the public's lack of participation in schools and in communicating with 
their legislators have on schools.  
</P>
<P>
 I have been teaching science in the Los Angeles Unified School District for 10 
years. The California State Framework on Science wants us to teach a hands-on 
science course at all levels, yet I was given $150 to purchase all the 
laboratory supplies I would need, which included having to buy my own paper for 
170 students for a full year. Even more appalling was that I only had 20 
biology books to use for five classes of 30-36 students. During the school year 
there were at least four opportunities for parents to come visit their 
teachers, yet only three parents bothered to visit me. Attendance was abysmal, 
with many students absent from 10-15 days on average per semester, up to 
several with 20-30 absences per semester. 
</P>
<P>
 We purchased 20 Macintosh computers in September. We didn't get the keyboards 
until May. We were to have a room to put the computers in to start a 
math/science computer lab. The room has not materialized, nor has money for 
tables, chairs, electrical hookups or security equipment. So the computers and 
software are still sitting in a closet gathering dust.  
</P>
<P>
 California will continue to lag behind every major industrialized country and 
every other state in the United States until parents and legislators realize 
that schools are in serious trouble. Strange as it may seem, the state gives a 
freeway contractor a $15-million bonus for finishing a road early. What good is 
a road that leads to nowhere?

 * Your editorial omitted one important consideration. The potential teachers 
of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, etc., must have 
a particular intellectual capacity for dealing with these difficult topics. 
Having obtained academic credentials in these abstract disciplines, the 
potential teachers must consider career alternates. Teaching will pay them 
roughly $30,000 per year at the journeyman level; industry will pay $50,000 for 
the same talent. Over a 30-year career the teacher will forgo over a 
half-million dollars of income, enough to send two children to Harvard for 
bachelor's and medical doctor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Without real incentives to enter teaching and stay in teaching we will 
continue to fail in attracting potential teachers for science courses. I am not 
advocating simply raising the salaries of present teachers, although that may 
be justified on other grounds. We need a fundamental change in our society's 
attitude toward public education. ALAN J. NESTLINGER

 * Re "Vital New Partnership Needed for Science Education," editorial, June 27: 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever I hear a call to improve science education in our schools, I cringe 
with confusion. If we turn out more scientists and engineers, will they find 
work? I don't think so, judging from the colossal numbers of engineers who are 
currently unemployed in California, and the incredibly small number of 
employment ads for engineers in the classified ads. OK, so there will be a new 
boom in telecommunications, resulting in improved employment prospects in the 
field. There will be no chance, however, of a new explosion in technology 
growth to rival the one that occurred in the early '60s with the race to put a 
man on the moon. The business of technology has been "re-engineered" and 
"restructured." Manufacturing has moved to sweatshops in Mexico and Singapore. 
Computer-aided design means that fewer engineers are needed to build a new 
product or communications network.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm well aware of the necessity of a broad-based education. (At Cal State 
L.A., many of my classmates are having a hard time in their business classes 
because they are poor at arithmetic and algebra. Apparently the schools did a 
poor job of teaching them algebra, or they thought they would never use it for 
anything.) But before we blindly demand better music or science teaching in our 
schools, we should be very specific about what the purpose and objectives are.

TEACHING TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was both disturbed and inspired by "Attempt to Teach Tolerance Backfires" 
(June 29). While I generally support an adherence to regulation in the school 
system, perhaps we should examine the very positive effect teacher Toni Wanic's 
open discussion of AIDS and homosexuality had on her second-grade class.(Her 
gay son, Nick Ashton-Hart, spoke to her class.) 
</P>
<P>
 If we feel they are too young to comprehend such ideas, we'd better look more 
closely. Apparently second-graders can grasp complex notions of homophobia, 
AIDS phobia and bigotry of any kind, even when acceptance and tolerance come to 
them naturally. The second grade seems a perfect time to guide our children 
away from developing the bad habits of hatred and disgust. While detailed 
discussions of sexuality may be better reserved for a later time, an 
understanding and appreciation of life's diversity can be instilled none too 
soon.  
</P>
<P>
 Wanic appears to be a teacher in the greatest sense, full of compassion, 
intelligence and the instincts to put her charges first. Perhaps school 
administrators and the PTA -- indeed all of us -- should more closely examine 
the extremely positive response the children had to this "supreme education 
moment" before condemning it out of hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Brava! I hope Wanic will teach my children.

 * Wanic and her son should be given medals of honor rather than reprimands for 
what they did. Had she first asked permission, she would have inevitably been 
turned down, considering the narrow-minded attitude of the administration. In 
our society where homophobia, racism and hatred of minorities in general are 
rampant, sex education and teaching of tolerance are greatly needed.

 I was amused to read Scott Kraft's great article, "After le Brainstorming , 
French Start War on Words," about the "march of English words and 'Franglais' 
into French" ( World Report, June 28).It sounds as if the tide of the English 
Channel is turning and that the Anglo-Saxons subjugated by the Norman Conquest 
of 1066 are reeling with delight. For the French to believe they can somehow 
legislate their noble tongue is absurd. Just ask anyone who has attended an 
English academy.

WORK OUGHT TO MEAN GETTING AHEAD; WELFARE REFORM: THE GOVERNMENT SAVES PLENTY 
WHEN DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE JOBS. WHY NOT MAKE IT MORE REWARDING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTA RUSSELL, Marta Russell is Southern California representative of 
Americans Disabled for Attendant Programs Today. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many junctions between welfare reform and health-care reform, and 
scores of inequities that mar our current systems. But among the cruelest and 
most inefficient practices are the rules that govern disabled people who have 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Ted (he prefers that his last name not be used), a 
quadriplegic with some use of his arms. He is assisted by an attendant, uses a 
power wheelchair and drives a wheelchair lift-equipped van. His van is 17 years 
old and about to give out. Although has worked for 20 years and is close to 
retirement age, Ted cannot afford to replace his van. He is trapped in a cycle 
of poverty perpetuated by outdated welfare policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ted does not earn enough to fully pay his attendant, without whom he 
would be forced into a nursing home (a fate justifiably dreaded by the 
disabled), he must rely on government programs for aid. To remain qualified for 
an attendant, his earnings and resources are restricted to meet Social Security 
guidelines for Supplemental Security Income. Out of gross wages of $2,000, Ted 
pays $354 toward his attendant's salary, leaving $1,646 in monthly income 
before taxes. After taxes, Ted has approximately $1,200 for rent, food, 
utilities -- everything else. Little is left to put away to replace an outworn 
van. But even if Ted could scrape together some savings, anything over $2,000 
would cause him to lose his attendant and thus his independence. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-working SSI recipient in California receives $603 per month. By working, 
paying taxes and having his medical insurance paid by his employer, Ted has 
saved taxpayers about $360,000 over 20 years. If Ted did not have an attendant 
and had been in a nursing home for those 20 years, the cost to taxpayers would 
have been about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is the economic incentive for Ted to work? He can never get ahead. He 
can't save much, for fear of losing his eligibility for an attendant. His 
retirement income will be the same as if he never worked, because any portion 
of his combined pension and Social Security retirement payments above $623 a 
month would go to pay his attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The government spends $4 billion a month on Social Security disability 
benefits for 7.5 million disabled people, most of whom, like anyone, want to 
work and create a better life for themselves. But while the Americans with 
Disabilities Act holds a promise of a barrier-free environment in the 
workplace, Social Security policies erect other, invisible barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Private insurance company practices compound the difficulties. Companies 
exclude certain conditions or treatments from eligibility for payment or use 
them as a basis to deny coverage altogether; most policies will not pay for 
durable medical equipment such as power wheelchairs and respirators, and most 
lack provisions for personal attendant services. The only way many disabled 
persons can get health care is through Social Security programs such as 
Medicaid and Medicare. Dependent on these programs, many disabled are locked 
out of the work force or prevented from getting equipment, like a new van, that 
could keep them working.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has acknowledged that the work issue is at the center of the 
health-care reform debate for disabled persons. Some of the proposals being 
debated in Congress include provisions that would prevent insurance-company 
discrimination and modernize both SSI and Medicaid practices. Those who would 
"save" by axing these reforms simply don't understand that the government will 
reap substantial savings by freeing the work ethic of all people, including 
people with disabilities.

AN EMOTIONAL HIGH, BUT HARDLY A 'VICTORY'; ARAFAT: CAN HE GO FROM REVOLUTIONARY 
LEADER TO HEAD OF STATE? CAN HE ACCEPT PLURALISTIC POLITICS? THE SIGNS ARE 
HOPEFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAOUD KUTTAB, Daoud Kuttab is a Palestinian journalist and TV-documentary 
producer and the president of the Jerusalem Film Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The return of PLO leader Yasser Arafat to the freed Palestinian areas was an 
emotional experience by all measures. What made the return most dramatic was 
that Arafat chose to come first to crowded and potentially dangerous Gaza 
rather than the more comfortable and contained area of Jericho in the West 
Bank. The people of Gaza rewarded Arafat by giving him a passionate hero's 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But was Arafat's return a victory? Hardly. One doesn't have to be a political 
scientist to realize that the deal that made it possible for him to return home 
is very much biased in Israel's favor. Arafat, however, did succeed in 
embodying the long-sought right of Palestinians to return to their homeland and 
participate in the determining of their own future. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities that Palestinians will be able to convert this agreement 
into a stepping-stone for a viable state do exist, despite many inherent 
obstacles: The delay in tackling issues like settlements, Jerusalem and 
sovereignty of the territories dampens the potential of real progress. And the 
Israeli attitude of putting the Palestinians to the test before releasing 
prisoners or more territory is not the way to deal with prospective neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 For Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as for many in the 
diaspora, the test of Arafat's return rests more in attitude and actions than 
in circumstances. How Arafat and his national authority will deal with the 
economic and social issues of Palestinians will be the most visible barometer 
for everyday people. While some of this depends on outside aid, which has been 
slow in coming, much hope is pinned on the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Business, however, is not divorced from the political reality. You can't 
operate a successful system based on free enterprise and the encouragement of 
entrepreneurship without a sound government and an open political system that 
respects human rights, pluralism and free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Palestinian leader respect such values? Judging by what he says, the 
answer is yes. But judging by the policies and actions of the past, the answer 
is not so positive. For nearly 30 years, Arafat has been the leader of a 
revolution, not a head of state. What was required of him as a revolutionary is 
much different than what is needed today. One-man rule, which is often 
tolerated in a period of popular revolt, is a formula for disaster, not for 
nation-building. The new role requires a change in attitude and way of 
operating, even a change in the personnel surrounding him.  
</P>
<P>
 Such changes can't happen overnight and can't be imposed. They have to evolve 
and develop and become institutionalized. For this to happen, concepts of 
collective decision-making, transparency and consensus-building have to become 
the rule.  
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's first few days in Palestine have reflected some positive signs in 
this direction. He made a passionate appeal to those opposed to his policy to 
help him carry the heavy load. He extended a hand of reconciliation to the 
leader of the Islamic movement that has been opposed to the peace process, and 
he promised all that he will work for a democratic Palestine. Arafat went out 
of his way to reconcile any differences with some independent figures like 
Hanan Ashrawi and Haidar Abdel- Shafi, making sure they appeared with him in 
public events. He has told reporters that Cabinet posts still vacant in his 
national authority are reserved for leaders of opposition groups if they wish 
to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also took special care to visit the poorest of the poor in the Gaza 
Strip, making his first stop at the overcrowded and miserable Jabaliya refugee 
camp, where the intifada started seven years ago. And unlike his many previous 
speeches, he made no grandiose promises to his people, speaking instead of the 
difficult road ahead and the hard work that needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming welcome that Chairman Arafat received is certainly a popular 
referendum for his policies. This public expression of support gives him a 
mandate to pursue his policies in the direction he chooses. But it would be 
wrong to interpret this genuine expression of love and loyalty as a blank 
check. Arafat will have a honeymoon of some months, but if changes are not seen 
and felt, and if the promises of a democratic Palestine are replaced by 
autocratic leadership, then the intifada generation will not spare even its own 
leader in the pursuit of independence, freedom and democracy.

 His ebony skin covered muscles rounded by the hormones of young manhood, 
perfected through personal effort. But he was a wounded warrior that day, in a 
large metropolitan hospital that has tended far too many urban warriors. Blood 
oozed from his hip and his foot as we readied him for surgery. A questioning 
glance at his abdomen brought a grimace of smile: "Yeah, man, I been shot there 
before. Same place." For this lad, "three strikes and you're out" would 
probably mean not prison but an early grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Societies fear and revere their young men. A young male's ability to join with 
others to protect the clan or tribe guarantees his people's survival. But when 
there are no enemies around to fight, the tribe must find another mission for 
its youth, lest adolescent strength be turned against the very people the young 
man should be protecting.  
</P>
<P>
 Most groups have historically met this male adolescent drive to prove oneself 
through the establishment of physically or mentally challenging rituals under 
the aegis of older males: Witness scarification rites and bar mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders of American have somehow forgotten their responsibility to the 
young males in their midst. The path to manhood with all its rights and 
responsibilities demands a male guide. If an older man is not there to steer a 
teen-ager through the rocks and shoals of adolescence, then the youngster must 
find others like himself, start a pack and engage in behavior fearfully mutated 
by the lack of a template. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is scandalous in its scope. A man makes a baby, whisks himself off 
to another woman, the child grows up written off both by society and by its 
father, repeats the pattern of studdery and ends up in a coffin covered with 
flowers. Enough already! 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, every single life has value. Letting gangs kill each other off 
unimpeded is not a solution. We may not even be able to rescue the present 
adolescent generation, but we do need to start the ball rolling. We owe all 
kids a firm commitment to their physical safety, and if this means temporary 
martial law, as one unsuccessful candidate for Los Angeles mayor suggested last 
year, so be it. Neighborhood policing, with the police force reflecting where 
possible the complexion of the neighborhood, should take over once things are 
under control.  
</P>
<P>
 Marriage and lifelong fathering -- as opposed to studding -- must come back 
into vogue. Forget throwing federal money at the problem; local communities 
bear the real responsibility for coming up with challenges (be they sports, 
academe or other) that let a boy push himself until he breaks through to 
manhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And we haven't much time, friends. Far too many young warriors already "sleep 
the sleep that knows not waking." Just ask those of us who close their eyes for 
the last time, pull the sheet taut over their heads, and take their young 
bodies down to that cold dark room deep in the bowels of the hospital.

OBITUARIES; TARO YASHIMA; ARTIST, AUTHOR AIDED U.S. IN WORLD WAR II

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taro Yashima, an artist and author born in Japan who aided the United States 
during World War II, has died at the age of 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Yashima, who lived the last half of his life in Los Angeles, died Thursday at 
Glendale Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Atsushi Jun Iwamatsu in Kagoshima, Japan, he and his wife, Mitsu, were 
imprisoned and beaten as suspected communists for opposing Japan's slide into 
militarism. The couple immigrated to New York in 1939, and wrote "The New Sun," 
an account of their imprisonment and their work with the Japan Proletarian 
Artists League. 
</P>
<P>
 The book caught the attention of the U.S. Office of War Information, which 
immediately recruited Yashima. Some of his countrymen branded him a traitor 
because he wrote and illustrated many pro-American publications for the War 
Information and Strategic Services offices during World War II. But Yashima 
said he worked for the United States to stop the loss of Japanese lives as well 
as Americans, and because he wanted to bring a new democratic age to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time it was easy to say I was one who was against his own country," 
Yashima told The Times in 1982. "That's the most terrible thing, because my 
feeling (was), I'm doing (it) because I love my country." 
</P>
<P>
 To protect his family in Japan, including his son, Mako, who became an Academy 
Award-nominated actor, the artist-writer adopted the pen name Yashima, which 
means "eight islands" and symbolizes Japan. For a first name, he chose Taro, a 
boy's name commonly used in children's stories.  
</P>
<P>
 He wrote a second autobiographical book, "The Horizon is Calling," in 1947, 
detailing his work for the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 With a young daughter, Momo, who soon demanded stories about her father's 
birthplace, Yashima turned to writing and illustrating children's books. Among 
his well-received stories were "Village Tree" in 1953, "Plenty to Watch" in 
1954, "Crow Boy" in 1955, "Umbrella" in 1958, "Momo's Kitten" in 1960, "The 
Youngest One" in 1962 and "The Seashore Story" in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seashore book was selected as one of that year's best children's books by 
both the New Yorker and the New York Times. Yashima was a frequent runner-up 
for the Caldecott and Newberry literary awards. 
</P>
<P>
 He also continued his endeavors as an artist and in 1953 moved to Los Angeles 
to establish the Yashima Art Institute. He taught painting and worked in his 
own studio, earning the 13th Grand Prix International Painting Award of 
Deauville, France, and other awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a stroke in 1977, Yashima taught, wrote and painted until recently. He 
had just completed a documentary about his work for a Fukuoka, Japan, 
television station and was writing a book titled "One Inch Fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Yashima is survived by his son, Mako Iwamatsu, his daughter, Momo Brannen, and 
four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Japan America Theater, 244 
S. San Pedro St., in Downtown Los Angeles.

 William M. (Billy) West; Founder of San Francisco's Zuni Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 William M. (Billy) West, 46, founder and owner of the rustic but sophisticated 
San Francisco restaurant called the Zuni Cafe.West began the restaurant 15 
years ago in a dilapidated storefront with only a kettle grill in the alley at 
the back. He was among the first to tout healthful food with fresh ingredients 
presented in a straightforward manner. He prepared dishes from the books of 
Elizabeth David, who later honored him by becoming a frequent customer. West 
hired the young chef Judy Rodgers in 1987, promising to build her a 
wood-burning brick oven. The little cafe up a flight of rickety stairs became a 
gathering place for curious chefs and food aficionados. It was often compared 
to France's brasseries, which serve a range of food, from snacks to full meals, 
at practically any hour. On Friday in West Hollywood.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; MEXICO PAYS PENALTY AGAINST BULGARIA; 
COMMENTARY: BULGARIANS ARE QUICKER TO THE DRAW, MEXICANS FIRE MOSTLY BLANKS IN 
THE FIRST SHOWDOWN OF WORLD CUP '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday night, at 7:04 Eastern Time, in a United States football stadium that 
had seen many things but certainly nothing quite like this, World Cup shootout 
soccer came to America. 
</P>
<P>
 After 43 games, most of which were first-round, group-play games in which ties 
remained ties, the U.S.A. -- or that portion of it that is putting baseball on 
the back-burner for a month -- was treated to the ultimate soccer moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The elements of the drama: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was Bulgaria versus Mexico, Giants Stadium in the New Jersey 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On hand was a soccer-crazy crowd of 71,030 that even included some 
Bulgarian fans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the single-elimination round of 16 of World Cup 1994, which was 
brought to this country so that fans here could see firsthand the ultimate 
thrill of this mostly foreign sport. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bulgaria and Mexico, after having each scored a goal early, had gone into a 
shell of boring back-passing and useless one-on-four attacks that allowed the 
match to drone through more than 100 minutes. Now they were about to deliver 
the ultimate thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 This is done with five players from each team, standing one at a time at the 
penalty spot, 12 yards from the goalkeeper, and alternating shots until 
somebody wins. 
</P>
<P>
 It is soccer's hockey penalty shot, only multiplied by five. It is the bottom 
of the ninth, two out, bases loaded, count three-and-two. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the second half of overtime, the teams congregated near the 
sidelines and spent lots of time talking to their respective goalkeepers, Jorge 
Campos of Mexico and Borislav Mihaylov of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the focal point because, in a shootout, their chances of stopping 
shots from such close range are very slim. One stop out of the five chances 
usually means a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So they get their backs patted a lot, their necks rubbed and loads of advice 
from coaches and teammates alike on which opposing player tends to shoot where. 
</P>
<P>
 When each coach had picked his five shooters and it was time to begin, referee 
Jamal Al-Sharif of Syria marched toward the east goal, flanked by Campos and 
Mihaylov. It was high noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, for this NFL stadium, Bulgaria won the toss and elected to receive. 
Mihaylov would get his first chance at stopping a Mexico bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooter would be Alberto Garcia Aspe, the fancy-dribbling forward who had 
scored Mexico's goal on a penalty kick in the 18th minute. Garcia Aspe was the 
perfect choice to begin because he has such total control of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as the stadium hushed and America squeezed in closer to television sets 
all over the country, Garcia Aspe approached slowly, then rifled a kick well 
over the crossbar and so far off target that all he could do was bury his head 
in anguish and stumble back toward his stunned teammates at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 In soccer, players missing penalty kicks in shootouts live with this failure 
forever. They never forget. Fans never let them. It is one thing to be stopped 
by the goalkeeper but entirely another to flat-out miss. Garcia Aspe had yipped 
a one-foot putt for the Masterstitle, had volleyed an easy floater wide on 
match point at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sympathizers was Campos, dressed as always like a neon gas station 
sign and about to be in the bright lights himself against the first Bulgarian 
shooter, Krasimir Balakov. Undoubtedly, Campos told his teammate it was OK 
because he would just stop the Bulgarian. And, to the shock of all, he did just 
that, with a lightning-quick dart to his right, batting the shot wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first round, it was Mexico 0, Bulgaria 0 and millions of soccer 
aficionados at a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Marcelino Bernal stepped to the plate. He was a perfect No. 2 hitter, 
versatile as a playmaker and scorer. It had been Bernal who had scored the goal 
against Italy last week that had given his team a 1-1 tie and first place in 
the toughest group in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bernal approached, shot to the right of Mikhailov . . . and failed. The 
Bulgarian had guessed right and smothered it. Three penalty shots, three 
misses. Pandemonium in the Meadowlands, bewilderment in the watching soccer 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's Boncho Guentchev was next, and he struck smartly down the middle, 
beating Campos and restoring some measure of sanity to this revered exercise. 
But Mexico's Jorge Rodriguez tried Mihaylov's left side and again the Bulgarian 
guessed right. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico had had three shots at it, from 12 yards, and missed all three. From 
Mexico City to Monterrey, they knew. It was all over. Time to fold the 
sombreros. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Suarez, a defender no less, kept Mexico from total disrespect in the 
soccer world by beating Mihaylov in the fourth round, but all that had to 
happen for Bulgaria to win was for Yordan Letchkov to beat Campos one more 
time, which he did with a right-footer to Campos' right. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos dived, saw the ball pass him, and lay face down, motionless, in the 
east penalty boxof Giants Stadium for a full two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Garcia Aspe said he had missed so badly because he had a moment of 
hesitation, trying to decide whether to aim at the same spot he did on his 
earlier penalty kick or shoot elsewhere. In the end, he shot mostly toward 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos was asked whether he cried. He said he hadn't, and added, "That is the 
way football always is." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Luis Alves, the star of Mexico's offensive efforts all day and the 
player scheduled to kick last for his country in the shootout, said, "There is 
a lot of painfor Mexico. It was the wrong result." 
</P>
<P>
 Hristo Stoitchkov, scheduled to be the No. 5 shooter, suggested his team was 
the beneficiary of divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "God was a Bulgarian today," he said. The Quarterfinals

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; MEXICO PAYS PENALTY AGAINST BULGARIA; SOCCER: 
MISSED PENALTY KICKS PROVE COSTLY AFTER TEAMS PLAY TO 1-1 TIE THROUGH 
REGULATION AND OVERTIME. 
</P>

<P>
 The oles were silenced Tuesday. Hundreds of thousands of them, from Los 
Angeles to Mexico City to midfield at Giants Stadium, went unsaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The cry that for a month has carried a hopeful nation and its former citizens 
living in this country was rendered as silent as goalkeeper Jorge Campos' 
muffled cries into the thick grass. As silent as Alberto Garcia Aspe as he 
buried his face in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 As silent as the Mexican soccer team in the final 100 minutes of its World Cup 
second-round soccer game against Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans had more stars, more skill, even more players at one point . . . 
yet the Bulgarians had two more successful penalty kicks, giving them a 3-1 
shootout victory in a game that had ended 1-all after overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria, a nation roughly the size of Ohio, with no victories in 16 World Cup 
games before this year, finds itself in a quarterfinal match Sunday against 
defending champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico finds itself with a lot of explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
 After celebrating on the field with a giant game of piling-on, the Bulgarians 
walked off as if dazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it has sunk in yet what we have done," forward Petar Alexandrov 
said. "I think, right now, it is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans needed to be helped off by their coaches and trainers, Campos 
remaining face down and motionless on the ground in front of the goal for 
several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 1,030 mostly Mexican fans watched without a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of pain," said forward Luis Roberto (Zague) Alves. "It is the 
wrong ending." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ending, in fact, that was more difficult for the Mexicans to handle 
than the 120 minutes of bump-and-grind soccer forced on them by the Bulgarians 
in 80-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not have the courage to face what has happened right now," said Aspe, 
who in one afternoon experienced the gamut of emotions felt by Mexican fans 
during their giddy ride through this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 18th minute, Garcia Aspe was a hero, tying the score with a penalty 
kick after Bulgarian star Hristo Stoitchkov had scored on a 15-yard shot 11 
minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the first shooter in the five-goal shootout, Garcia Aspe was a failure. 
With nothing but 12 yards of grass between him and Bulgarian goalkeeper 
Borislav Mihaylov, with Mihaylov required to stand still until the ball was 
touched, Garcia Aspe still missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried at the last second about his decision to kick the ball to the left 
side of the goal, as he had done on his previous penalty kick, Aspe hesitated 
for a second. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball left his foot and soared high over the goal. A flat-out miss. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked toward the sky and covered his face with his hands, as if he knew 
what was coming. And it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Campos made a brilliant save of Bulgaria's first penalty kick, 
Mihaylov stopped Mexico's next two kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria then connected on its next three kicks and won the shootout, 3-1, 
clinching the victory without needing a final kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sad," Garcia Aspe said. "I am very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Mihaylov, who had given up three goals in one game against Nigeria in the 
first round, was so happy he wanted to kiss somebody. Actually, a lot of 
somebodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to kiss my entire nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mexico Coach Miguel Mejia Baron tries that with his countrymen today, he's 
going to get smacked. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not devise a strategy to lead his team to victory over a Bulgarian 
squad that began the game minus three starters because of yellow card 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not take advantage of a fourth Bulgarian loss, when Emil Kremenliev 
was sent out of the game with a second yellow card in the 50th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 And he would not take advantage of two fresh stars on his bench -- legendary 
veteran Hugo Sanchez and top playmaker Carlos Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with his team obviously exhausted during the overtime period, Baron 
refused to make any substitutions while his Bulgarian counterpart, Dimitar 
Penev, made the allowed two. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those substitutes, Boncho Guentchev, converted one of Bulgaria's 
penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave everything we had," Garcia Aspe said. "We were exhausted. What 
happened after that was up to the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who watched the game while listening to intermittent crowd chants of, 
"Hu-go! Hu-go!" was not so diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very, very impotent," he said. "I was very angry. I do not 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Also difficult to understand was Mexico's apparent willingness to join 
Bulgaria in playing for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 This happened not only after Luis Garcia had been forced out of the game with 
a second yellow card at the 58th minute, evening the sides at 10 each. This 
happened even during the eight minutes when the Mexicans had a one-man 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he had played for a tie, Baron said, "Are you asking me or 
telling me? Mexico never plays for a tie but for a win." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, why did Mexico take 10 shots in the first 45 minutes and only nine 
in the last 75? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, in 120 minutes against a team missing three strong defenders, did Mexico 
take only three shots within the penalty area? 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the answer to these questions, and more, in discussions that will 
occur south of the border over the next, oh, four years. The Quarterfinals

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; ITALY'S BAGGIO FINISHES OFF NIGERIA WITH 
SUPERSTAR FINISH OF HIS OWN; SOCCER: FORWARD SCORES HIS FIRST GOAL OF 
TOURNAMENT IN FINAL MINUTES TO TIE, THEN WINS GAME WITH PENALTY KICK IN 
OVERTIME.

<P>
 Just when it came time to say, "Ciao, baby," Italy, somehow, some way, reached 
the World Cup quarterfinals Tuesday at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the waning moments of a breezy afternoon not far from Boston, Italy's 
hopes of winning a fourth world championship were restored to life by the man 
who was expected to lead the Italians all along -- Roberto Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the intrigue of Italian opera, the Azzurri finally ascended, whereas 
Nigeria disappeared, victim of inexperience and, perhaps, stage fright. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy defeated Nigeria, 2-1, in a game that turned exciting the moment Baggio 
emerged from a three-match stupor. Baggio scored in the 89th minute to tie the 
score, then made a penalty kick in the 102nd minute before 54,367 in the 
tournament's first overtime match. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened so quickly that Nigeria, the African champion, was left reeling, 
wondering how it had lost. "(We) had it in our hands," said Finidi George, a 
Nigerian midfielder. "It's something I'm going to remember the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria, first-round winner of Group D, never unleashed its potent offense but 
took a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute and frustrated Italy until Baggio's first 
goal. And until two minutes were left, Nigeria looked like the team Spain would 
face here in Saturday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the result of Emmanuel Amunike's goal after George had launched a 
corner kick from the right side, the ball bouncing around in front of the goal. 
When none of the Italians cleared the ball, Amunike tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal held up for the longest time and so did Nigeria's unorthodox play. 
Not only was Italy trailing, it lost Gianfranco Zola, who was ejected in the 
76th minute for arguing with referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico, who also 
gave out a Cup-record-tying nine yellow cards. That matched the tally in last 
week's game between Argentina and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Although finally using its superior skill to launch attack after attack, Italy 
was no closer to scoring through most of the second half. The Italians had open 
shots in front the goal but let the opportunities pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But they never stopped trying, and that, as much as anything, resulted in 
Nigeria's elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy finally scored when Roberto Mussi got the ball in the penalty area from 
Roberto Donadoni. He passed sideways to Baggio when defender Sunday Oliseh 
challenged him, and there was no one there to cover Baggio, who put the shot 
past goalkeeper Peter Rufai. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took something out of us psychologically," George said of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And it lifted the Italians. "(After that,) we were convinced we were going to 
win," Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 So was everyone else. The goal sent a buzz through the mostly partisan crowd, 
and Italy, although a man short, was lively as the 30-minute overtime began. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Nigeria had little fight left and shot impatiently, as if in 
desperation. The Nigerians had come so close to duplicating Cameroon's 1990 
performance of reaching the quarterfinals, but it was slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Nigeria led throughout, it was not the Nigerians' best effort. The 
Super Eagles were unable to use their blazing speed to throw Italy off stride. 
They were hurt when forward Daniel Amokachi suffered an injury and was replaced 
by midfielder Mutiu Adepoju in the 35th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an attacker gets injured, another attacker should come in because of the 
way we play," said Rashidi Yekini, the team's star striker. "They concentrated 
on me. It's very difficult for one attacker to play against four defenders." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nigeria could have made it 2-0 had Paolo Maldini been ejected for taking 
down Yekini as he broke for the goal in the 81st minute. Instead, Maldini was 
issued a caution, and instead of a penalty kick, Nigeria got Austin Okocha's 
free kick, which was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Yekini was bitter about Coach Clemens Westerhof's treatment of players, 
accusing Westerhof of playing favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lesson to Africa," he said. "Before you choose a coach, you must 
think twice. It's all politics. We played the game the way the coach wanted, 
and you see the result." 
</P>
<P>
 Westerhof, who is Dutch and said he would retire from the Nigerian national 
team, probably had less to do with the loss than Italy's determination. 
Although they trailed throughout, the Italians showed creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the overtime, and Italy looked confident for one of the few times in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty kick was set up when Baggio played give-and-go with Antonio 
Benarrivo a few yards from the right side of the goal. Baggio flipped the ball 
back to Benarrivo, who was tripped in the air by Austin Eguavoen. The penalty 
kick was awarded as Benarrivo lay sprawled on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio slowly took three steps toward the ball and when Rufai lurched to his 
left Baggio shot in the other direction and bounced it in off the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup begins now, not just for myself but for Italy," Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it looked as if it might be ending.

ANGEL CATCHER ENJOYS A PERFECT NIGHT; BASEBALL: TURNER GOES FIVE FOR FIVE TO 
LEAD 10-3 ROUT OF RED SOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel catcher Chris Turner was staring at the dingy walls in his cramped hotel 
room last week, feeling miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just been given a one-way ticket to Vancouver, and with the way he was 
hitting, there were no guarantees he'd ever return to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I went down there," he said, "I forgot how bad it really was. It was a 
culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought, 'Wow, what am I doing here? Triple-A isn't for me. Man, if I 
ever get another chance. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre set of circumstances, Turner not only was back in the big 
leagues, but lying awake Tuesday night in his luxurious hotel room wondering if 
this was all a dream after the Angels' 10-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox at 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame him? 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, too embarrassed to even look at the scoreboard because of his .138 
batting average, produced one of the finest offensive performances by a catcher 
in Angel history. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner went five for five with two doubles and two runs batted in, joining Bob 
Boone as the only catchers in Angel history to produce five hits in a game, and 
the 25th position player to accomplish the feat for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, he stole home in the second inning on a botched pickoff attempt 
when teammate Gary DiSarcina got in a rundown. He became the first Angel 
catcher to steal home, and the first non-outfielder since Rod Carew in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Turner wants to go back to Vancouver," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's offensive prowess finally enabled the Angels to shed a 684-day jinx 
at Fenway Park, where they won for the first time since Aug. 20, 1992, after 10 
consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels provided starter Chuck Finley (6-8) more runs than he had to work 
with in his last five starts combined. The Angels -- entering the game with the 
league's lowest batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage -- 
pounded out 17 hits against the Red Sox pitching staff before 26,199. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we scored three runs," Finley said, "I thought it was awesome. They kept 
coming in the dugout and saying, 'There you go. There you go.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey, I'll tell you guys when it's enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, it was the Angels' finest moment of the trip, and it came at the 
right time, considering General Manager Bill Bavasi stopped in to get a 
firsthand look at what was happening. It was only the Angels' second victory in 
eight games, and their 12th in 35. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a sense of urgency to do something right now," Bavasi said. "To 
me, that's akin to panic. That's when you make stupid moves. I don't think 
anybody is excited about our win-loss record (35-49), but the fact is that 
we're (six) games behind, and we're in a pennant race. We're going through a 
rough time, but I think we have a chance of straightening things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachemann: "You have to be patient, and when you do that, you're going to 
go through rough times. You've got to let these kids play. If you keep 
vacillating your plans, you're not going to get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, how do you explain the fate of Turner, who was supposed to still 
be in triple-A? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels decided June 28 that he no longer could hit big-league pitching, 
and banished him to the minors, bringing up veteran Andy Allanson. Little did 
they realize that Allanson already had a broken index finger, and on Sunday, 
had no choice but to bring Turner back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people think I can't hit," said Turner, whose average jumped 
to .182, "so hopefully I've changed some thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had no confidence before. I even stopped looking at the scoreboard a 
month ago because I was so embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter who I was facing, I was just trying to keep from striking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this as a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 So do the Angels.

MORNING BRIEFING: AUSSIE GREAT DOESN'T APPRECIATE NICKLAUS' MODERN ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Thomson, five-time winner of the British Open, doesn't think much of 
modern golf course architecture, particularly fairways designed by Jack 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said that if your grandmother can't enjoy it, it's not a great 
golf course," Thomson told Golf Digest. "I have begun to rate golf courses by 
the number of balls you need. For instance, if a course is a one-ball course, 
assuming it has all the usual features, I think it's a great course. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a 12-ball course I think is rubbish. That's my basic criticism of Jack 
Nicklaus courses. They are very much like the man himself, very serious and 
lacking in humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Thomson: About the par-three 17th hole, with its island green, that is the 
centerpiece of the Pete Dye-designed Tournament Players Club course, the 
outspoken Australian said, "That silly little hole stuck in the middle of the 
lake is the greatest absurdity in golf. The pity is, it's now been copied by 
countless people who just copy things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had it been condemned at birth, as it should have been, we wouldn't have 
those silly things." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which state leads the United States in number of registered 
boats? 
</P>
<P>
 Reason enough: In discussing the World Cup, reader George Kiseda asks how 
anyone can take seriously a sport that does not have a player who has dated 
Madonna? 
</P>
<P>
 Good thinking: Kevin Mitchell claims he was just sitting in a bar, minding his 
own business, when a beer bottle came flying through the air and hit him just 
above his right eye. He claims he was a mistaken target for a wild-armed woman 
patron. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cincinnati left fielder said he had learned his lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going into another bar unless they use plastic cups." 
</P>
<P>
 Whose was it? The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds played a nine-inning game 
in 1916 with only one baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern era: The bathroom break is a rather recent development in tennis. Vitas 
Gerulaitis, who played before they were allowed, once said, "I guess we didn't 
have bladders." 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason: Jay Leno, on "The Tonight Show": "Israeli researchers have 
announced that to reach peak performance, World Cup soccer players should not 
have sex six to eight days before a match. No wonder soccer hasn't caught on in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead: French tennis professional Henri Leconte, 30, was asked how his 
tennis will be in 20 years: "I think I will be playing in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 Well named: The president of the PGA of America's South Texas section is Bob 
Putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Different times: When scout Dick Snyder of the Atlanta Braves first tried to 
sign Dale Murphy to a contract, Murphy said the offer was too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we offered him $5,000 less and he signed," Snyder recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Michigan, with 877,000. 
</P>
<P>

have to have a seance to get (players) to communicate." SHAV GLICK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park got all the attention, but now Ismael Valdes 
is getting all the outs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 While Dreifort, 22, and Park, 21, are pitching for San Antonio of the Texas 
League after starting the season in the National League, Valdes, 20, has become 
the surprise of the Dodger bullpen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He celebrated his first major league victory Tuesday with a raised fist after 
retiring six consecutive batters, lowering his earned-run average to 1.93 in 
seven appearances, and watching Raul Mondesi hit a home run to beat Montreal, 
2-1, in the 10th inning. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So little was known about him before the season that his name was misspelled 
"Valdez" in the Dodger media guide. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Valdes is 6 feet 3, 183 pounds, right-handed, a native of Victoria, Mexico, 
and very poised for someone who has spent only three years in the minors and 
started this season in double-A. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The players are calling me 'Rocket,' " the Mike Brito signee said in easily 
understood English. "I think it's because of the football player named Ismail, 
not because I throw the ball fast." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers lost Monday night, 5-1, but virtually the entire crowd of 54,859 
stayed for all nine innings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Think it might have had something to do with the fireworks show after the 
game? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as though Buck Rodgers was right about J.T. Snow, who is struggling 
again in the American League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Rodgers was right about a lot of things. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only Ernie Banks could have appreciated that 10-hour, 10-minute doubleheader 
Monday at Wrigley Field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No New York Met, San Diego Padre, Colorado Rocky or Florida Marlin has pitched 
a no-hitter, but more surprising is that a no-hitter never was pitched at 
Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. . . . Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for the L.A. 
Dodgers to pull off their first triple play. . . . National League All-Star 
Danny Jackson (11-2) was 8-13 two years ago.The difference is control. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry might return to Dodger Stadium with the San Francisco Giants 
for games Sept. 30-Oct. 2, depending on the progress of his comeback and labor 
contract talks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought that the Toronto Blue Jays would be in the thick of the 
race for the worst record in baseball instead of the best? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fregosi stays cool for a manager who wears a jacket on 100-degree days. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer game in the Bay Area on Monday, Brazil-United States, attracted 
more than four times as many spectators as the baseball game, San Francisco-New 
York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Giants are wearing the name of their city on their road uniforms 
again, the Dodgers should follow suit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The National Best Seven won't attract much interest until there is a big 
payoff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 James Toney is training at Mickey Rourke's gym in West Hollywood for his bout 
July 29 against Prince Charles Williams in Las Vegas. Rourke, who has fought 
professionally, is expected to participate in some sparring sessions with 
Toney. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Padilla will defend his World Boxing Organization junior welterweight 
title against former featherweight champion Juan La Porte on July 24 in the 
main event of the Grand Olympic's next show. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Doing the commentary for CBS will be Gil Clancy, who used to manage La Porte. 
But don't expect Clancy to be partial. He's the best TV boxing analyst around. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Give a slight edge to the St. Louis Blues in the deal that brought them Al 
MacInnis and a draft choice from the Calgary Flames for Phil Housley and two 
draft choices. The Blues can strengthen themselves further and bring back a 
popular player if New Jersey doesn't match their $16-million, four-year offer 
sheet for Scott Stevens. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What do you think about the way the Roller Hockey International playoff race 
is shaping up? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I could use more commentary on soccer strategy from the World Cup TV analysts. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame the Bulgaria-Mexico result was determined by penalty kicks, a 
ridiculous way to decide a World Cup game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, sudden-death overtime is the way to go. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Soccer has one thing over hockey -- no icing calls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two-minute drills wouldn't work in soccer because nobody except the referee 
knows when there are two minutes left. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic was as classy in defeat as he was in victory or in 
tie. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny that Charlie Ward is tall enough for the NBA, but not the NFL.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; AT 16, VARGAS PROVES AGE DOESN'T MATTER IN RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 16, Fernando Vargas has learned that patience pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, it earned him a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, from Oxnard, defeated Datris Biagas, 29-15, to win the lightweight 
title at the Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a lot more medals for Vargas but probably not at future 
festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is the youngest boxer at the Festival, and if not for his youth, he 
wouldn't be here at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the U.S. lightweight champion, he was too young to participate in the 
competition to determine who would fight in the Goodwill Games or World Boxing 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 International rules do not allow boxers under the age of 17 to compete in an 
international event. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lightweight champion, there is little doubt Vargas would be on the U.S. 
boxing team headed for the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, if he were 
a year older. 
</P>
<P>
 His cruise through the Festival bouts supports the idea. Vargas has never lost 
at a U.S. Boxing-governed fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to learn something every time you're out there, so I don't mind 
at all," Vargas said. "My ultimate goal is to win the gold in the Olympics. 
This is a pretty good stepping stone. I have one gold, now I want another. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rule is a rule -- it will come, so I just have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 He was Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he would like to come in on me and box, so I thought I could get him 
to commit," Biagas said. "But he was more patient than I thought he would be. 
He's a real good boxer." 
</P>
<P>
 That's classy praise from a man nine years older than Vargas and a winner of 
three consecutive Armed Forces titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Biagas aggravated a detached-nerve injury in his right elbow in the first of 
the three rounds after missing with a right cross. It limited his effectiveness 
considerably as he jabbed with his left and he clenched many times to try to 
land short hits with his right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I've won with the jab before, he was just too good," said Biagas. 
</P>
<P>
 Biagas sported a raspberry-colored bruise under his left eye. "It doesn't 
matter how old he is." 
</P>
<P>
 So don't be surprised if Biagas, in his second consecutive Festival, starts a 
petition to reduce the international age requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas can get international experience later this month and next at the Elite 
Junior Olympic Program in Colorado Springs, or at Junior Olympic Dual matches 
against Ireland and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to enter because I want international experience," Vargas said. "I 
want to win a gold at the Olympics, I want to be famous, and I want to be on TV 
and have everyone say 'I know that guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He even says he wants to look good winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are not so small goals for a fighter whose trainer didn't think he would 
pan out as a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought I had fear in me or that I would take one punch and go down," 
Vargas said. "Luckily, I'm not like that." 
</P>
<P>
 A quick fighter, Vargas hasn't taken many punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic Festival Notes

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; ITALIANS COME BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you should wonder, Italy is dancing today to the jerky, heart-shaking beat 
of an unsettling new band, the Grateful Undead. It plays two hit numbers, "Man 
Short," and "Brinkmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems our destiny to suffer," Coach Arrigo Sacchi said with a sigh. "We 
fell behind, 1-0, and that made it very difficult. Then -- worse -- we were 
playing with 10 men and sometimes nine. If you think about it that way, to win 
was almost heroic." 
</P>
<P>
 If you think of it another way, for 88 minutes, Nigeria's Super Eagles laid it 
to a misfiring flight of high-priced Italians who more resembled flailing 
butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was all but over. Italy was heading home in well-merited disgrace, 
bound surely to what Antonio Matarrese, that nation's soccer federation 
president, said would have been "summary judgment" as one of the 1994 Cup's top 
underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Roberto Baggio limped to the rescue. The lame man kicked. The fat lady 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw an Italy that doesn't ever give up," Matarrese said, mirroring 
national wonder at the latest exploits of the Gang That Should Be Gone. "It 
shows strength of character in difficult moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the final whistle, the Italian press had discovered a -- you 
guessed it -- "Miracle in Foxboro." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Enough to Drive You Crazy," says one of Italy's sports newspapers in a 
banner headline this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victory was two minutes too far," Nigerian Coach Clemens Westerhof said. "We 
were not afraid. Italy was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi didn't see it that way, patrolling the sidelines with enough vigor and 
nervous energy to bring FIFA officials to restrain him within the chalk-marked 
coaching box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lucky, but also unlucky," Sacchi said after a fretful overtime 
victory, Italy's second triumph while playing a man short. "I felt in those 
last few minutes that we might be out, and it didn't feel just. We deserved to 
win. We were better." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi said Italy set the pace and the tenor of the game against a strong, 
tall and superbly conditioned Nigerian team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took control in the beginning and won that way," Sacchi said. "Strong will 
and determination prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 To many in the largely Italy-cheering crowd, though, as well as to 
commentators in Rome, the Azzurri looked listless, playing fitfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players seemed perplexed and disappointed," commentator Bruno Pizzul 
said. "We were facing the prospect of being pushed out of the Cup without a 
trace. Then the team miraculously got itself back on its feet. It's a day we 
won't easily forget, for they made us fear the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Italian national Coach Enzio Berazot, "I've never seen a team so 
open to attack as Nigeria, but Italy only got through by chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi, who tried six dozen of Italy's premier players before settling on the 
22 to bring to the Cup, has been criticized for his team's lack of spark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, Italy beat Norway, tied Mexico and lost to Ireland, 
managing only two goals in the process and finishing third in its group. On 
Tuesday it was equally disappointing -- right up until the moment it became 
breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last minutes Italy seemed resigned, then Baggio turned the game 
upside-down," said Azeglio Vicini, coach of the Italian team that finished 
third in the 1990 Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio, one of the world's best strikers, had a lackluster first round, going 
scoreless and complaining of an Achilles' heel problem that had him limping 
again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 90 minutes of suffering, but it was a good game," he said. "On 
offense, if we don't have a chance to score it seems like we are not doing 
anything, but we were trying. I don't get many chances early, but then at the 
end of the game I was able to put the ball where I wanted to. Now that I have 
scored, I feel much better." 
</P>
<P>
 There were moments deep in the second half when it seemed even to his 
teammates as if Baggio could not run any further. But his first tournament 
goal, as pretty as it was late in coming, lent him wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the affable Sacchi, "I'm not lying when I say that Baggio is great. He 
loosened up after the goal and then he was extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Says the Rome newspaper L'Unita in its main headline this morning: "At the 
90th Minute, Baggio Liberates Everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Italian commentator Paolo Rossi, who led scorers in the 1982 Cup that Italy 
won, says Baggio's two goals Tuesday -- the second on a decisive penalty kick 
-- will prove pump-priming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baggio needs to unblock himself by scoring," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having now fashioned (or simply endured) two improbable man-short victories, 
Sacchi left Foxboro Stadium a wiser man Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is a game you never stop learning. You think you have seen it all and 
then . . . " He smiled, borrowing a phrase from Italian soap opera announcers, 
"On to the next episode."

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; THIS VICTORY IS BETTER THAN A MIRACLE FOR 
BULGARIA; SOCCER: UPSTART AVENGES 1986 CUP LOSS AND RECORDS ITS FIRST VICTORY 
OVER MEXICAN TEAM IN EIGHT MEETINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Bulgaria barged into the 24-team World Cup field by upsetting France at 
Paris last November, its accomplishment was declared a miracle. Citizens danced 
in the streets of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and they acclaimed Coach 
Dimitar Penev as a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 If they called that miraculous, how might they describe Bulgaria's stunning 
second-round victory over Mexico on Tuesday, gained through a 3-1 edge in 
penalty kicks after the Bulgarians held supposedly mighty Mexico to one goal in 
120 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
 Striker Hristo Stoitchkov could think of only one explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "God was a Bulgarian today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria had never won a World Cup game in its five previous tournaments, 
recording six ties and 10 losses. It managed to tie its way into the second 
round in 1986, but was eliminated by Mexico, the host team. It had never beaten 
Mexico in seven previous tries, losing three times and tying four. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, more was expected of the Bulgarian players, whose individual skills 
have put them in great demand among clubs in Western Europe. But not as much 
was demanded of them as a team as this, a gritty triumph over Mexico before a 
hostile crowd of 71,030 at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the happiest moment of my life," goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov said. "I 
want to kiss the entire nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation would probably return his embrace -- and save one for Penev, who 
pieced together a respectable lineup despite the absence of defenders Trifon 
Ivanov and Tsanko Tzvetanov and midfielder Zlatko Iankov, all suspended after 
receiving two yellow cards in Bulgaria's previous match, a 2-0 victory over a 
Maradona-less Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with another crisis, when defender Emil Kremenliev was ejected in the 
50th minute for getting his second yellow card of the game, Penev remained 
calm. His strategy was sound: play conservatively, play strong at midfield and 
think positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the red card, the whole team was thinking how to get a red card for the 
Mexicans," midfielder Yordan Letchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
 They did that eight minutes later, when midfielder Luis Garcia was ejected for 
a dangerous tackle. Being at even strength in a game that was 1-1 was an 
advantage for them, because they had Mihaylov's quick reflexes and a defense 
that somehow found the energy to limit the Mexicans' shots to outside the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tactically, we played in the best possible way," Mihaylov said. "I think 
Mexico was very strong, but I was confident all through the match. I was almost 
looking forward to penalty kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 A curious statement, considering the only goal he gave up Tuesday was on a 
penalty kick, taken by Alberto Garcia Aspe in the 18th minute. He guessed wrong 
on that shot, diving to his left and coming up empty when Garcia Aspe shot 
toward the keeper's right. 
</P>
<P>
 His guessing percentage improved in the torturous penalty kick procedure. He 
correctly went to the right post to stop Marcelino Bernal and to his left to 
get his body in front of Jorge Rodriguez's attempt, the second and third, 
respectively by Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any particular strategy," said Mihaylov, who plays club soccer 
for Mulhouse, of the French Second Division. "I just look at the foot of the 
player who is going to take the penalty kick and I try to move in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Easier said than done -- as Mexican keeper Jorge Campos could have told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos correctly guessed Letchkov would go for the right side of the net, but 
Letchkov placed the ball high enough to sail over the goalkeeper's body as he 
flung himself across the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Letchkov, whose balding head belies his listed age of 27, said he hadn't 
noticed any weaknesses in Campos and so hadn't decided where to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what I wanted to do," he said. "I just chose an angle to shoot 
and I shot it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'Let the ball be in."' 
</P>
<P>
 When it went in, Bulgaria was in the quarterfinals against defending champion 
Germany on Sunday at Giants Stadium. Having come this far, the Bulgarians 
aren't afraid to think they might go further. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a good team. They are the (favorites)," said Letchkov, who knows the 
German team well because he plays club soccer in Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their entire team is good, offense and defense. But they are also human. They 
can lose also. We have played them so many times, we know they have weaknesses. 
We hope to make it a good match." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Penev: "We have to play with better self-confidence. We have to play 
against them the way we performed against Argentina. If we do that, we could 
win."

<P>
 Attendance at the beach was down Monday, and it appears that the U.S.-Brazil 
game is one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The game drew a 10.5 overnight television rating from 30 major U.S. markets, 
according to Nielsen Media Research, and ABC estimated 32 million people 
watched. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the game drew a 13.9 rating and in San Francisco, 16.6. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the figures are released Friday, the game should break the U.S. 
record for soccer, 6.8, set June 26 when the United States played Romania in 
the first round. LARRY STEWART

 The view from the field did not show how seriously Tab Ramos was injured 
during Monday's 1-0 loss to Brazil.Players and coaches saw Ramos elbowed in the 
head by Brazil's Leonardo and fall to the ground, but they couldn't gauge the 
extent of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos was taken from the field semi-conscious, and U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic 
asked him at halftime if he was ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos' childhood friend, John Harkes, said he watched the replay and only then 
fully understood the visciousness of the blow.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; SPOTLIGHT; CONFESSION GOOD FOR SOUL, NOT

 Belgian newspapers emphasized the possible significance of the national team's 
missed penalty chance during the game against Germany on Saturday. A penalty 
shot could have meant a tie game and the possibility of beating Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian (Soccer) Federation had sent an official complaint to FIFA. The 
Belgian daily La Libre Belgique, headlined, "Confessed mistake is 
half-forgiven," underlining that the referee has publicly confessed his mistake 
in this particular case and can no longer be a referee for this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Roethlisberger of Switzerland admitted he blew a call that would have 
given Belgium a penalty shot in the 70th minute of a 3-2 loss to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Although public confession will not change the result of the match, 
Jean-Francois Jourdain writes, it nonetheless serves the cause of Belgium to 
sweeten the pill for the end of the American adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Another referee, Italian Pierluigi Pairetto, will also no longer work during 
the rest of the Cup, after FIFA decided his yellow card on a foul by Romania's 
Miodrag Belodedici just outside the penalty area was insufficient.

 One of those attending Tuesday's Italy-Nigeria game was former Italian 
national team striker Giorgio Chinaglia, who is working as a color commentator 
for Italian radio. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York Cosmos star in the days of the late, lamented North American Soccer 
League offered this observation on the tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only negative thing, I think, has been my country.The Italians, they have 
been a disappointment so far. Let's hope that today against Nigeria something 
better happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria is not a team to underestimate. They are a little naive, especially 
on defense. But we've seen them play in the African (Nations) Cup, which they 
won, and most of their players do play in Europe, so we know who they are. 
Their strength is their technical skill and their physical strength. But our 
players, unfortunately, are all midgets up front. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy doesn't click as a team, and I think the coach (Arrigo Sacchi) is not 
putting the players in the right position. For instance, (Giuseppe) Signori, 
the top goal scorer in the Italian League the last two years, plays midfield or 
back. He's got to be up front. That is a logical thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he (Sacchi) has his own ideas and until he loses, we've got to say, 'OK.' 
When he loses, then we can jump on him." GRAHAME L. JONES

 In England, where taxi drivers and publicans consider themselves experts on 
soccer, high praise was given to the U.S. squad's performance against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Financial Times, Jurek Martin wrote: "Not all revolutions end with the 
good guys winning. The second 'shot heard around the world' came not from a 
young American in red, white and blue, but from Bebeto of Brazil in the 74th 
minute as the World Cup's favorites ousted their hosts 1-0 on Independence Day.

<P>
 "The U.S. team certainly achieved all reasonable expectations. . . . July 4 
commemorates victory over the Redcoats, but it was not enough to inspire the 
U.S. 218 years later to knock off the men in gold."

 Mexico's star players, goalie Jorge Campos and forward Luis Garcia, made 
similar exits from Giants Stadium on Tuesday, although a couple of hours apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was hit with his second yellow card, and expulsion from the game, in 
the 58th minute against Bulgaria. He left the field while being escorted part 
way by his teammate Campos, who had his arm around Garcia's shoulder and some 
encouraging words. 
</P>
<P>
 Much later, as the game ended in penalty kicks and Campos gave up the winner, 
he left the field while being escorted part way by Bulgarian star Hristo 
Stoitchkov, who had his arm around Campos' shoulder and some encouraging words.

 The Sun in London reported its switchboard lit up when British TV commentator 
Kevin Keegan, a star for Liverpool and England as a player and now manager of 
the Newcastle club, said of the elbowing of Ramos: "It didn't look like such a 
bad challenge to me." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ramos was carried off on a stretcher and Leonardo shown a red card, Keegan 
added: "It didn't look like he did that much wrong to me.Maybe it's my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed to see Leonardo, who I considered to be the best player in 
the World Cup, going off for one moment of madness." 
</P>
<P>
 His view was greatly in the minority. One typical caller to The Sun declared: 
"That's not the sort of comment we expect from an ambassador of the game."

 On the day after beating the United States to advance to the quarterfinals, 
Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira made Tuesday morning's practice at Santa 
Clara University optional for his starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one who showed up was goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel, presumably because 
he had such a light workout Monday.The United States took only four shots, only 
one inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 In his daily grilling by the Brazilian media, Parreira rejected their 
suggestion that the score was not more decisive because the United States was 
so pumped up by playing in its home country on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not only playing on emotion," Parreira said of the Americans. "They 
are pretty good players. They beat Mexico one week before the World Cup, and 
they beat Colombia. It was a difficult game for us, especially after it was 0-0 
at the half." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parreira would not go so far as to say that he felt threatened by the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at the statistics," he said. "We were flagrantly better, even 
playing with one less man." RANDY HARVEY

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: SOMETHING MISSING WITH THIS GRANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the biggest marlin ever caught off Cabo San Lucas, but Florida 
resident Mearle Platt, who caught it, isn't exactly jumping for joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Platt's fish, caught Sunday after a two-hour fight aboard the Gaviota VIII, 
tipped the waterfront scale at 1,060 pounds. It was only one of a few 
"granders" ever taken off the Baja California Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 But it might have been the largest, had it not lost its stomach, literally, 
along the way. Apparently, the giant billfish was ripped open by the crew's 
gaff. It was reportedly too heavy to be lifted onto the swim step for the ride 
in and was towed 19 miles back to the marina. Along the way, the tear in its 
underside grew until the stomach ripped free. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is sure how much weight the fish lost, but it could have easily been 
the 51 pounds necessary to beat the Baja record, a 1,110-pounder caught by a 
San Diego angler in 1979, and some fleet owners say Platt's fish might have set 
a line-class world record as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The world record for 50-pound test line, which Platt was using, is a 
1,166-pounder caught off Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed as Platt might be, his plight is trivial compared to that of a 
lifelong marlin fisherman from the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent story in the Washington Post told of Chris Bowie's last fight with a 
blue marlin in the Gulf Stream 60 miles off North Carolina, how the big fish 
dragged Bowie, 29, to a watery grave on June 16 while he was working as first 
mate aboard a 53-foot sportfisher competing in a North Carolina tourn- ament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie, of Ocean City, Md., was preparing to release the 200-pound billfish 
when his hands got caught in a 30-foot-long wire leader attached to the hook, 
according to his brother, Randy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do anything wrong," Randy Bowie told the Post. "He was an excellent 
fisherman, and he'd done this hundreds of times. But the fish did something no 
one ever saw before. It did a 180(-degree turn) and took off. That tightened 
the wrap and tangled both Chris' hands. It catapulted Chris off the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Second mate Ronnie Fields dived in, hoping to cut Bowie free, and spotted the 
fish 30 feet down, with Bowie attached. But when Fields surfaced for air and 
dived again, all he saw was a spot deep in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing we take comfort in," Randy Bowie said, "is that if the Lord had 
come to Chris and said, 'I'm taking you tomorrow, how do you want to go?' he 
would have thought it over and said, 'On a fighting deck, fighting a marlin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Blue marlin are showing more frequently off Cabo San Lucas and 
the East Cape region in the gulf, but striped marlin remain the prevalent 
catch. The Gaviota fleet in Cabo reported five blues -- all taken on lures -- 
and 33 stripers, 27 of which were released, in its weekly report. Wahoo fishing 
is picking up. One group fishing out of Hotel Punta Colorada at the East Cape 
reported catching and releasing nine sailfish and six blue marlin -- ranging in 
size from 110 to 260 pounds -- in two days of fishing. A 429-pound blue was 
taken by Chuck Reince of Huntington Beach while trolling a green and yellow 
lure aboard a Palmas de Cortez cruiser. Striped marlin and sailfish are fairly 
abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTEWORTHY -- The Los Angeles Rod & Reel Club is holding its annual Kid's 
Fishing Trip for needy youngsters Monday aboard the Annie B Barge in Los 
Angeles Harbor. The club is treating 450 boys and girls, who will travel to and 
from the barge in shifts, to several hours' fishing. About 70 volunteers from 
the fishing club will spend the day helping the youngsters -- many of them 
first-time anglers -- make the most of their trip. 
</P>

FISHING REPORT: SEVERAL LUNKER TROUT ESCAPE HOLIDAY CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the Alpers trout planted in Eastern Sierra waters before the July 4 
weekend escaped the onslaught of holiday fishermen. That's good news for future 
anglers, because the already large fish will grow even larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those that didn't escape: a seven-pound five-ounce rainbow caught on a

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA ENDURING DIFFICULT HOME STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for learning that he had been selected to the National League All-Star 
team for the second consecutive year, Mike Piazza hasn't enjoyed himself much 
on this longest Dodger home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the nine completed games of the 14-game stand, Piazza is five for 30, a 
.167 average.And Tuesday, he struck out in each of his four at-bats against 
Montreal Expo starter Jeff Fassero. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game, for myself, was just an example of how everything gets you at 
once," Piazza said. "You don't get the calls, nothing works out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Piazza, whose average has dropped to .323, said he was not particularly 
upset about striking out four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, there's really no difference between a strikeout, groundout or fly 
out," he said. "It's an out. You've just got to go out and try to swing the 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for me, I think, is to lay off the pitchers' pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's recent plate struggles -- and those of Tim Wallach and Eric Karros -- 
are part of baseball's cycle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was criticizing our pitching a couple weeks ago when (the pitchers) 
were struggling," he said. "And recently they've been outstanding. So I guess 
everybody is going to criticize our hitting now. Hopefully, a couple of guys 
can get back to the fundamentals and not try to hit the ball out of the 
ballpark every time up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio turned in his sixth consecutive quality start Tuesday. "There's 
no doubt Pedro has established himself as one of the top pitchers in this 
division," Piazza said. . . . Brett Butler's explanation of the predominantly 
right-handed Dodger lineup finding it so difficult to hit left-handed starters: 
"It's just one of the freak things in baseball. We'd been wearing out 
left-handed pitchers early in the season. It'll turn around." TIM KAWAKAMI

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HIS FINGER DISLOCATED, COLES POKES HOLES IN TIGERS 
WITH 3 HOMERS 
</P>

<P>
 Seldom-used Darnell Coles hit three home runs a day after dislocating his 
finger and the Toronto Blue Jays routed the Minnesota Twins, 14-3, Tuesday 
night at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning and solo shots in the eighth and 
ninth. He had the second three-homer game of his career, having done it in 1987 
with Pittsburgh. He became the sixth player this season to homer three times in 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles dislocated the little finger on his left hand Monday night in Kansas 
City. He began the game batting only .145 with one home run and six runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 8, New York 7 -- Geronimo Berroa hit a go-ahead, two-run homer off 
Greg Harris in the seventh inning at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Sierra also homered for the Athletics, who won for the 10th time in 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Berroa's 10th homer of the season helped Oakland overcome a 7-6 deficit. Bob 
Welch (2-5) allowed one hit in 2 1/3 innings. Dennis Eckersley relieved with 
runners on first and second and one out in the eighth and got Wade Boggs and 
Paul O'Neill on called third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who went four for five and raised his average to .373, was ejected 
for arguing the called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckersley also pitched the ninth for his 12th save in 17 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Seattle 2 -- Jamie Moyer finally got what he deserved -- a 
victory. Moyer won his first decision since May 25, Cal Ripken drove in two 
runs and Brady Anderson homered at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyer (3-6) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings, walking two and 
striking out five. The left-hander had won only one of his previous 13 starts 
since April 19, although the drought wasn't completely his fault. In six of 
those games he gave up three or fewer runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. had his second successive hitless game for Seattle and has 
gone a season-high 10 consecutive games without a homer. He still leads the 
majors with 32 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Cleveland 3 -- Kevin Brown, who spent the morning with his ailing 
father in Georgia, tied a career high with 10 strikeouts at Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown left the team Monday to be with his father, Gerald, who had a heart 
attack at home. There were doubts that Brown would make it back for his start, 
but he took an afternoon flight to Texas to take his regular turn in the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (6-8) gave up seven hits and walked one in his second complete game of 
the season. It was his first victory since June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas overcame three errors by third baseman Dean Palmer and won for the fifth 
time in six games. The Rangers ended Cleveland's five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 10, Milwaukee 5 -- Bob Hamelin drove in three runs with a homer 
and one of the Royals' four doubles at Kansas City as Bill Wegman lost for the 
first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegman (6-1) was stopped one victory short of the Brewers' record for 
consecutive victories to open a season. Milwaukee had six doubles, and the 
combined 10 doubles were one short of the Royals' record for one game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Meacham (1-1) got the victory in relief of Mark Gubicza, his first since 
beating the Brewers 8-7 on June 6, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6-4, Chicago 2-6 -- Frank Thomas hit his 30th home run and Jack 
McDowell struck out a career-high 11 as the White Sox won the second game to 
split a doubleheader at Detroit. The Tigers won the opener as Cecil Fielder and 
Tony Phillips homered in a four-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell (6-7) set a personal best for strikeouts, despite pitching only six 
innings. He gave up four runs, two of them earned, on six hits and is 4-0 in 
his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in the opener was only the third for the Tigers in 13 games and 
broke Chicago's four-game road winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wells (2-5), who pitched his second complete game of the season, won for 
the first time since April 10, a span of six starts. He gave up eight hits, 
walked none and struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sanderson (7-3) saw his three-game winning streak end.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CURTIS SHIFTED INTO LEADOFF POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Center fielder Chad Curtis was moved to the leadoff spot Tuesday in an attempt 
to remedy the Angels' offensive woes and is expected to remain for the season's 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to make the move, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann dropped third 
baseman Spike Owen to No. 2 in the lineup, and second baseman Damion Easley was 
moved to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels finally ended their offensive drought, producing 10 runs and 17 
hits, including five by rookie catcher Chris Turner, in a 10-3 rout of the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a point where we have to start forcing things," Curtis said. "I look 
back at last year, and even though me and Luis (Polonia) got thrown out a lot, 
we forced things. We were unpredictable. No one knew what we were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who had 48 stolen bases but was caught 24 times last season, has not 
been given permission to steal whenever he wants this season. Yet, he is 
starting to regain Lachemann's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things he does, even if they look irrational," Lachemann said, "there's a 
thought process behind it. It's just a matter of channeling that in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times that I haven't agreed with the reason, but he's always 
had a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who is batting .249 with six homers, 29 RBI and 15 stolen bases, was 
originally supposed to be the Angels' leadoff batter this season. Yet, after 
batting .149 with four RBIs the first 11 games, he was dropped April 16 from 
the leadoff spot and had not returned until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst year I've ever had," Curtis said. "I'd kind of gotten away 
from my approach, and things snowballed. I'm trying to get back to where I 
wanted to. I'm definitely not where I want to be yet, but I'm headed in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two young boys were injured in the ninth inning when the bat flew out of the 
hands of Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina and landed in the seats. The boys 
suffered facial lacerations and were taken away on stretchers, but remained 
conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina provided the boys' parents a bat, and first base coach Max Oliveras 
gave them an autographed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel first baseman J.T. Snow, who is batting .143 on the trip, lowering his 
season batting average to .183, was kept out of the starting lineup. Jim 
Edmonds moved to first base, and Bo Jackson played left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is batting .063 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned," General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but we still have faith 
in his ability, and we're trying to get it straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel batting coach Rod Carew on Curtis: "To me, he's a guy like Bobby Bonds, 
Rickey Henderson and Devon White -- a guy who can pop one. And he can steal a 
base. That's what he brings to the club until we get someone else who can do 
that." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Darryl Strawberry made another successful step in his comeback when he hit his 
second home run in as many games for the triple-A Phoenix Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, attempting to play himself back into shape after sitting out all 
of the regular season while undergoing substance-abuse treatment, homered in 
the third inning against Vancouver left-hander Andrew Lorraine at Scottsdale, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry had a sacrifice fly in the first and a solo shot in the third that 
landed in the right field bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankee first baseman and team captain Don Mattingly was placed on the 
15-day disabled list because of tendinitis in his right wrist. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball players are expected to present their opening contract demands when 
negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement resume today.

 Mutual Fund Reporting Deadline Extended: The National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers said it will extend by 10 minutes the deadline for mutual fund 
companies to report their net-asset values to the public. On June 17, Fidelity 
Investments sent a day-old price report for 150 funds without telling the NASD 
that a computer glitch had prevented it from completing the tabulation by 5:30 
p.m. EDT, the old deadline.The incorrect asset values were reported in the next 
day's newspapers and on wire services. The episode raised concerns over the 
accuracy of such reports. Last week, Securities and Exchange Commission 
Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. asked the mutual fund industry and the NASD to 
report on what steps could be taken to eliminate such price reporting problems.

POST-4TH FED WATCH MAKES FOR DULL SESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks rose slightly Tuesday as bond yields dipped in light post-holiday 
trading and as financial markets nervously awaited the outcome of a Federal 
Reserve Board policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell against major European 
currencies as doubts grew that a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations will come up with a major rescue plan for the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks spent most of the session at mixed levels, with buyers 
favoring blue chips and other big-name companies over smaller issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying temporarily faded in the afternoon, but the Dow industrials managed 
to end with a 5.83-point gain at 3,652.48. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advances outnumbered declines by fewer than 100 issues 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where the pace of trading crawled. Big Board 
volume came to 195.41 million shares, compared to 199.03 million Friday. U.S. 
financial markets were closed Monday for Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Market indicators reflecting mostly NYSE-listed stocks posted small increases. 
The NYSE composite rose 0.17 point to 246.51, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock 
index rose 0.17 point to 446.37. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nasdaq Stock Market composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 
3.26 points to 703.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts said the listless, post-holiday atmosphere, combined with 
apprehension about the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, made for a dull 
session with many big investors on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank's policy-setting committee met Tuesday and will meet again 
today to review economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond inched up 3/16 point, which lowered its yield to 
7.58% from Friday's level of 7.60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco rose 3/4 to 60 7/8 after unveiling a corporate restructuring, leading 
other oil stocks higher. Arco gained 1 3/8 to 103, Chevron added 1/2 to 42 7/8 
and Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 82 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer networking companies Wellfleet Communications and SynOptics 
Communications announced a merger, in which Wellfleet offered 0.725 of a share 
for each outstanding SynOptics share. Wall Street did not greet the deal 
warmly. Wellfleet fell 5 3/16 to 20 1/16 and SynOptics dropped 1 1/8 to 14 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing rose 3/4 to 47 1/8 on the company's report that it delivered 67 
commercial airliners in the second quarter, slightly more than some analysts 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 A rebound in the battered dollar against the yen buoyed Tokyo markets, leading 
the Nikkei average up 202.44 points to 20,834.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,032.69, down 21.71 points, while 
London's Financial Times 100-share average closed down 5.4 points at 2,965.0. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa average rose 8.52 points to 2,276.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fetched 98.90 Japanese yen in New York, compared to 
98.55 yen on Friday, but fell to 1.580 German marks, from Friday's 1.596.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HERE'S TO A NEW RECORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If any office in Orange County government could use a morale-boosting party, 
it is the recorder's office. And if last year's New Year's Eve celebration 
included champagne toasts to better times ahead, that was understandable. 
Still, the party, minor affair that it was, only served to reinforce doubts 
about the independence of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the champagne and refreshments were paid for by title companies, 
according to office employees. The title firms, which depend on the recorder's 
office to register real estate deeds and other business transactions, 
apparently have financed the end-of-year party for the last several years. We 
hate to be party poopers, but this should stop; county employees should buy 
their own bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors adopted a tough gift ban and a wide-ranging ethics 
code last year. The reforms were needed after years of too close relationships 
between public officials and those doing business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before the recorder's office party, a memo from the county counsel 
warned of a ban on gifts from companies or individuals with business before the 
county in the past year. Assistant Recorder Ella Murphy said she thought that 
the gift of the champagne was OK because the office staff, not just top 
administrators, received it. She would have been better off turning it down. 
(Another allegation being investigated by county officials was that minors were 
served champagne at the party.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for the titular head of the office, Recorder Lee A. Branch, he said there 
was nothing he could do to call off the party because the Board of Supervisors 
had limited his powers. The supervisors trimmed his sails because he had 
mismanaged the office for years. In January the board publicly censured Branch, 
an unprecedented move, after investigators found his romance with, and favored 
treatment of, an office employee had devastated morale. Branch's inability to 
run the office is one more reason the county needs a fresh start in November's 
runoff election. Start the new year with a new recorder, not to mention 
self-financing of the party.

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK AND STEVE KRESAL; HOW TO ENJOY PELICAN HILL FOR $9

<P>
 For those who find the $125 mid-week greens fees at Pelican Hill Golf Club a 
bit daunting but still want a taste of golf's good life, an answer is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 At a fraction of the cost, you can hit balls, chip or putt at the course's 
practice center. The center, which has been open nearly a year, is available to 
everyone, even those who don't play one of the two 18-hole resort courses. 
</P>
<P>
 For the price of a $9 large bag of balls, you get the same country-club style 
service and the same views of the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole setting is a special place to work on your golf game, even if you 
can't afford to come out here and play everyday," said Glenn Deck, the head 
teaching professional at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Deck and his staff, of course, also offer lessons. Private lessons range from 
$40 for about 45 minutes with an assistant PGA to $75 for Deck or Derek Hardy, 
one of the top 50 instructors in the nation, according to Golf magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Palmer, an LPGA teaching professional who won the 1975 U.S. Women's 
Open, is also on staff. Group lessons are available. 
</P>
<P>
 For an extra $20, a student can have his or her swing analyzed on video by 
A-Star, a state-of-the-art computer system that offers a golfer an instant 
chance to look at his swing from all sides. It features a video monitor and 
four cameras. After a student hits a shot, the instructor can run it back in 
normal speed, slow motion or frame by frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a split video screen, the program can compare the student's swing to 
optimum swings by PGA Tour professionals. "It really tends to speed up the 
learning process," Deck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deck said the staff concentrates on working out each student's unique 
difficulties, instead of imposing a single swing system. Drills are emphasized 
so that players can continue to improve on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to be the No. 1 teaching center on the West Coast if not the 
entire United States," Deck said. 
</P>

 One challenger to that throne is the Aviara Golf Academy in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, run by Kip Puterbaugh, was recently remodeled, making it one of 
the most technologically advanced in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Puterbaugh, who is ranked among the top 50 teachers in the nation by Golf 
magazine, currently works with touring professionals Scott Simpson and Dennis 
Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Pelican Hill, Aviara has an A-Star machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Puterbaugh has spent about all of the last two years filming several PGA 
players, and has the swings loaded into the computer, for comparisons with 
students' swings. 
</P>
<P>
 All the tape of a student's swings as well as the teacher's comments are 
recorded on a take-home tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you end up doing is improving faster," Puterbaugh said. "You end up 
taking home the whole lesson. The students I have worked with have basically 
fallen in love with this machine." 
</P>
<P>
 The school at Aviara features an all-grass driving range, a large sand trap 
and putting green as well as two covered hitting stalls that hold the A-Star 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But learning on the cutting edge doesn't come cheap. The four-day school costs 
$1,295 and covers all aspects of the game, including two playing lessons on the 
Four Seasons Resort's Aviara course that was designed by Arnold Palmer. It 
costs $995 for three days. The school deals with the most basic parts of the 
game, such as the grip and extend to the mental aspects of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The student-to-teacher ratio is no higher than five-to-one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home is the Jim Colbert Golf School at the MacArthur Place Practice 
Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it isn't as high-tech as Pelican Hill or Aviara, PGA teaching 
professional Andy Gaither says his school is without peer in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for its owner, a standout player on the PGA Senior Tour, the Colbert 
school is actually based on a system developed by Jimmy Ballard, a prominent 
teaching professional in Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard has tutored more than 250 tour players, including Curtis Strange, Hal 
Sutton, Seve Ballesteros, Johnny Miller and Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard helped resuscitate Colbert's playing career after he was forced to 
quit the regular tour in 1987 because of a bad back. Colbert started a golf 
management company -- it ran Tustin Ranch Golf Club for a time -- and was an 
ESPN analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert started the golf school at Tustin Ranch, bringing in two longtime 
Ballard-trained professionals, Gaither and Jane Rosenberg. The school moved to 
its current location in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaither says experience with Ballard's teaching methods make a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "All teachers are good," Gaither said. "Everybody has good things to offer, 
there's no question about that. But we feel we have more to offer because of 
Jimmy Ballard and Jim Colbert." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's student-to-teacher ratio is never greater than three-to-one in 
group lessons (six hours for $155 or $125 during lunchtime on weekdays). 
Private lessons are $65 an hour and include videotaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep it simple," Gaither said. "It's just the fundamentals of what the 
great ball strikers throughout history have done."

 U.S. midfielder John Harkes watched Monday's game from the bench because of a 
one-game suspension accrued for receiving two yellow cards in first-round play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard to watch," Harkes said. "Very frustrating. That hurt me so 
badly to be out. It's part of my dream to play in the second round of the World 
Cup against Brazil, too, you know."

 Harkes said he will decide in the next few days whether to take some time off

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; MARION JONES LEADS SOUTH TO GOLD MEDAL IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the women's basketball team from the South went on a fast break this 
week, it was a fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 With former Thousand Oaks High guard Marion Jones at the controls, the South 
defeated the West, 94-92, Tuesday in the Olympic Festival gold medal game at 
St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a record-setting sprinter in high school, scored 17 points, including 
nine at the end of the third quarter as the South opened a 75-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, every bit of that margin was needed. The West had several chances 
to tie in the final two minutes, but missed two one-and-one free throws and 
guard Kate Paye missed an off-balance shot over Jones at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Baer made a team-high 12 kills and Cal State Northridge teammate Peter 
Piexoto added seven to lead the East volleyball team to a 15-10, 15-12, 15-11 
first-round victory over the West and another Northridge player, Craig Hewitt. 
Baer also contributed two blocks and two aces while Piexoto added four blocks 
and one ace. Hewitt, who played sparingly, had four kills and one block. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hughes of Moorpark and Paul Severns of Glendale contributed as the North 
beat the South, 11-15, 15-7, 15-13, 10-15, 15-12 in the other men's match. 
Hughes made seven kills. Severns had one kill and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In tennis, Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks advanced to the gold medal match 
in women's singles by defeating Laura Berendt of Tampa, Fla., 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. 
Bleszynski, 17, and Jennifer Heiser of Stockton, Calif., won the bronze medal 
in women's doubles by defeating Tara Snyder of Wichita, Kan., and Christy Sim 
of Shawnee Mission, Kan., 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder will be Bleszynski's opponent in today's gold medal singles match. 
After her singles match, Bleszynski and Mark Loughrin of Greendale, Wis., will 
play for a gold medal in mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Tseng of Harvard-Westlake High and David Sutton of San Juan, P.R., lost 
the bronze medal match, 6-2, 7-5, to Mike Jessup of Saratoga, Calif., and Hyron 
Yoo of Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Also losing a bronze medal match was the archery team of Mark Hainline, Justin 
Huish and Barry Weinperl. Hainline and Huish, both from Simi Valley, and 
Weinperl, from Easton, Pa., were defeated, 238-237, by Staten Holmes of 
Houston, Joe McGlyn of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Shane Parker of Hurdle Hills, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In equestrian competition, Westlake Village resident Dennis Callin won a 
bronze medal in dressage for the second year in a row.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; VARGAS IS SHOWING MATURITY; BOXING: CHANNEL ISLANDS HIGH 
STUDENT DISPLAYS STAR QUALITY AFTER WINNING TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Vargas says he wants to be famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he's off to a very good start. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, the reigning U.S. amateur boxing champion at 132 pounds, added an 
Olympic Festival gold medal to his already substantial list of accomplishments 
Tuesday night, and afterward exhibited additional star quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a large gathering of reporters, Vargas held court with style, humor and 
maturity well beyond the realm of most 16-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how, at the age of 10, he became interested in boxing after seeing 
young and small fighters such as himself competing on television. He went on to 
articulately explain how the sport, and the regiment of his training, helped 
keep him from getting into trouble on the streets near his Oxnard home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas spoke lovingly and hopefully about his family and his trainer, Eduardo 
Garcia, a strawberry field foreman who speaks little English. He translated 
Garcia's comments when the trainer was asked how good Vargas was initially. "He 
said, 'Now this guy, he's not going to be good at all,' " Vargas repeated a bit 
sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was asked why. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought I had some fear in my eyes, like the look of a fighter who would 
take a punch and go down," Vargas said, adding with a large smile, "Which I'm 
not of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against Datris Biagas, a 25-year-old Armed Forces champion, Vargas was 
in control throughout a 29-15 decision. The maturity which benefits him outside 
the ring, also seems to help him in it. Tempted by a more experienced fighter 
to take a dance-and-jab attack, Vargas relentlessly stalked his opponent, 
successfully cutting off the ring and scoring on combinations and 
counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see in his eyes he was frustrated a little," Biagas said. "But he 
stayed with his plan. He has good composure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, Biagas lunged at Vargas so ferociously, he aggravated a 
detached nerve in his elbow and took a standing eight count. "I've won fights 
with just jabs before," Biagas said. "But against this kid you need more than 
just a jab." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a junior at Channel Islands High was graciously modest with reporters 
who seemed eager to get to know the youngest-ever U.S. boxing champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he can drive, Vargas replied that he owns a 1982 Celica that is 
"pretty beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets me around places, but I don't like to show it off that much," he 
said, eliciting laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that gold medal around his neck, that was another story. "This is nice," 
he said. "Now I want to get that other gold medal in '96."

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; COMPETITION REMAINS HOT FOR PLAYERS 
FROM RIVAL HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The uniforms don't matter when the players are from Chatsworth and El Camino 
Real high schools. The games will be exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North (base school: Chatsworth) and Woodland Hills West (El Camino 
Real) played an American Legion doubleheader Saturday, and both games had 
dramatic finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, Woodland Hills West trailed, 8-5, and loaded the bases with two 
out in the bottom of the seventh. Woodland Hills West's Gavin Bible doubled 
down the right field line. Two runs scored and Brad Marks headed for the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Brian Wittman's throw bounced past catcher Tony Ardito, but the 
ball ricocheted off the fence and came back to Ardito, who tagged out Marks to 
end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," Valley North Coach Pete Redfern said. "That's not really 
something that happens every day." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Woodland Hills West won, 6-5, getting out of jam in the 
seventh with a double play started by shortstop Justin Balser, who made a good 
play on a ground ball headed up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth and El Camino Real met in the past two City Section 4-A finals at 
Dodger Stadium, with El Camino Real winning both by 7-6 scores. The 
Conquistadores won this year in nine innings after Chatsworth scored five runs 
to tie the score in the seventh. In 1993, Chatsworth took a 5-0 lead before El 
Camino Real rallied for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always have great games with them," said Redfern, who is the Chatsworth 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Careful, it's catching: Want to be a catcher for Newbury Oaks? Better have a 
good health plan. The team has gone through several catchers already because of 
a unlucky string of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with Jeff Bennett, who had to quit the team after elbow problems 
became too severe. Clint Harris was the catcher Saturday, and he jammed his 
finger sliding into home plate. Buzzy Ketchum caught Sunday, and he hurt his 
thumb when he slammed it into a bat making a throw to third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joel Silverstein said Harris and Ketchum should both be back by 
Saturday's key matchup against first-place Westlake-Royal, but the team will be 
struggling for two midweek makeup games. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aguilar or John Shaw will have to catch, and neither is an experienced 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be an adventure," Silverstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast: Natural rivals Granada Hills East and Granada Hills West played a 
strange doubleheader Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, East won, 1-0, with a run in the top of the seventh. But in 
the second game, West won, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first game was 1 hour 40 minutes and was a great game," West Coach Ed 
Pikor said, "and we came back after everyone stopped to get something to eat 
and we had a football game. Same teams, I don't know what happened. All of the 
sudden everyone started hitting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good mixture: What do you get when you make Canyon and Hart players wear the 
same uniform? 
</P>
<P>
 A winner, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Newhall-Santa Clarita is composed of players from archrival high 
schools, the team is 12-3, well in front in the Central Division in District 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have a problem (with team unity)," said Coach Pat Eggleston, 
an assistant at Canyon during the spring. "The two teams put together make a 
great squad. Everyone is more or less quiet, and they understand what you have 
to do. They work together really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Top hitters have been Hart's Aaron Dean (.524, four home runs) and Canyon's 
Mike Bench (.441). Top pitchers are Canyon's Brent Davidson (3-2, 3.25 
earned-run average) and Hart's Bobby Graves (2.33, four saves). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The O in Littlerock: One approach to Legion baseball is that it be used as 
preparation for the next high school season. Teams using this approach are 
inexperienced because they don't use players who have graduated high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But no example of such a theory is more extreme than Littlerock, which is 0-14 
this year after going 0-21 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to win, fine," Coach Dave Toledo said, "but we use Legion (to 
prepare) for the varsity season." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Familiar Voice: If you close your eyes at an Encino game, you might think you 
are listening to a BMW commercial.

 Joe Campanella, whose name you might not recognize but whose voice you 
certainly would, is Encino's public address announcer. Campanella, whose voice

 Recommending victory: Terry Stoller, District 20 chief umpire, said he will 
recommend to Area 6 Commissioner Charlie Hatfield that a victory be awarded to 
Sunland-Tujunga from the June 25 game against Van Nuys West that was originally 
ruled a double-forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys West player charged the mound that day after he was hit by a pitch. 
He then threw equipment onto the field and refused to leave after he was 
ejected. The umpires also had reason to believe the Sunland-Tujunga pitcher was 
intentionally throwing at batters, Stoller said, so they ruled a 
double-forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoller said he decided Sunland-Tujunga did not deserve the forfeit because 
the only evidence that the pitcher intentionally hit the batter was the word of 
a Van Nuys West player. The final decision will be Hatfield's. 
</P>

 Legion lines: Mike Weiss of Van Nuys South pitched 47 consecutive innings 
without giving up an earned run until Burbank South scored five against him in 
the sixth inning Sunday. Weiss' ERA jumped from 0.00 to 1.80. . . .

<P>
 West Hills' Adam Crecion and Scott Shubeck combined to pitch a one-hitter 
against Valley North on Sunday. Jaime Cerna pitched a one-hitter for Sun Valley 
on Saturday against Burbank. . . .

 Newbury Oaks' Andy Wilson, who played at Oxnard College last spring, has a 
.933 slugging percentage. In 30 at-bats, he has 17 hits -- seven for extra 
bases. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal's Brian Schuster had the game-winning RBI in the eighth inning 
of the first game of a District 16 doubleheader against Ventura on Sunday. It 
was Schuster's second extra-inning, game-winning hit this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal's Joel Mellinger, who set a Royal High record with seven 
triples last spring, has three triples this summer. . . .

 A District 20 All-Star team will face a team from Union, N.J., at 4:15 p.m. 
Thursday at Birmingham High. The District 20 team was selected by Commissioner 
Mel Swerdling from two District 20 All-Star teams that will play Sunday at 
Birmingham.

MIKE DOWNEY: 26TH MAN LET THEM DOWN, BUT THEY'RE STILL PROSPERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I really feel that I let Cleveland down. 
</P>
<P>
 Season after season, my favorite town in Ohio and I had a deal. Every April, 
like clockwork, I would write a column predicting that this would be the year 
the Cleveland baseball club finally won the pennant. Whereupon the swell folks 
at Municipal Stadium would take this column, clip it, frame it, mount it on one 
of the stadium's walls for all to see and congratulate me on my obvious 
intelligence and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cleveland would go out and finish in seventh place, usually because there 
was no eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a running gag, but we both took it seriously. One season, the 
public-relations director for the club wrote a note informing me that I would 
be invited to either toss out the ceremonial first ball at one of Cleveland's 
World Series games that autumn, or, barring that, ride in a convertible with 
the champions in the city's ticker-tape parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that was a while ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Those framed columns became yellowing journalism after a number of years, 
sitting there on the stadium walls like bad motel art. To my everlasting joy, 
no Clevelander ever accused me of being a jinx, or requested that I heave my 
columns into the other garbage in Lake Erie. To the contrary, I received dozens 
of thank-you notes, the tone of which brought to mind those old wine-cooler 
commercials, the ones with the old-timer in the rocking chair saying: "And 
thanks for your support." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman wrote to invite me to her bedroom full of authentic Cleveland 
souvenirs and posters. I blushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another called me "Cleveland's 26th man." 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote her back that October to say that having seen Cleveland's 25 other 
men, perhaps what this team needed was not my support but my arm and bat. 
</P>
<P>
 And then "Major League" came out, that movie about Cleveland finally winning 
the big one. That was the one in which Charlie Sheen crossed Bob Feller with 
Ryne Duren. Wild thing, he made their hearts sing. And Tom Berenger played a 
hobbled catcher, Wesley Snipes a swift center fielder and Corbin Bernsen a 
natty third basemen, and together they all made American Express commercials 
and lived happily ever after, although in the sequel they had to use a 
designated Snipes. 
</P>
<P>
 I was jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 For I had foreseen a Cleveland pennant first. But did the producers cut me in 
for 10% of the gross? No, they did not. Did they ask me to play a 
happy-go-lucky media slob, an invitation they could have sent advising, "Come 
as you are?" No, they did not. They got that wacky Bob Uecker instead. Me, I 
didn't even get a guest shot on "Mr. Belvedere." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I abandoned Cleveland. Shame on me. 
</P>
<P>
 All those Aprils I had written my love columns -- careful never to date them 
April 1 for fear of someone thinking it a hoax -- declaring that Cleveland was 
about to experience a non-fiction championship season. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was set this season for this to be the one. Rather than having to 
defeat six other teams in its division, Cleveland this time would need to 
defeat only four. The club had outstanding talent and a calamity-free spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, it had a new stadium, majestic Jacobs Field, named of course in 
honor of that immortal man, uh, somebody named Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, what a nice place to hang one of my columns. Better write a beauty this 
spring, I reminded myself. Maybe some song lyrics about "going to Cleveland, 
Cleveland," to the tune of that Paul Simon song about Graceland. Be sure to 
give everybody a great big Ohio hi. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to your traditional Cleveland column?" Clevelanders began to 
write. Forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you know the rest. Who's in first place? Who's got one of the American 
League's best records? Who's winning more than 60% of its games? Who went out 
and got Eddie Murray and Jack Morris and Dennis Martinez and guys who actually 
know how to win? Who's won more home games than anybody in baseball? Whose 
attendance is soaring as thousands file past all that beautiful but wasted wall 
space? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I was the jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, I am so delighted that this will be the year. I realize that 
midseason is a pretty cheesy time to be making predictions, but, you know what 
they say, a midsummer night's dream is better than no dream at all. 
</P>
<P>
 My only other regret? It's that when Cleveland and Atlanta get together this 
October for one of the all-time great World Series, it will be the first time 
in baseball history that I will spend an entire championship series calling 
neither team by its given nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, go, Cleveland, go.

CRUZ SIGNS CONTRACT WITH SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacob Cruz, the first area player selected in the baseball draft last month, 
signed Tuesday night with the San Francisco Giants for a bonus of $300,000, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, a supplemental first-round pick out of Arizona State, said it was a not 
a hard decision to forgo his senior year with the Sun Devils to play 
professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Playing professional baseball) is basically what I went to Arizona State to 
do," said Cruz, a graduate of Channel Islands High. "It's a steppingstone. It's 
time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, 6-foot, 170 pounds, said another factor in his decision was the death of 
longtime Arizona State Coach Jim Brock, who succumbed to cancer last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, a left-handed hitting center fielder, will report to the Giants' Class-A 
affiliate in San Jose on Thursday. He said he has been invited to play in the 
Hawaii Winter League and will begin spring training in the major league camp 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division Player of the Year, Cruz was 
selected to the NCAA Division I All-American team by the National Collegiate 
Baseball Writers Assn. He was selected to Baseball America's second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz helped lead the Sun Devils to their second consecutive College World 
Series appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants selected Cruz, 21, with the 32nd pick in the draft, which fell in 
the supplemental portion of the first round. Teams are given supplemental picks 
as compensation for the loss of free agents. The selection the Giants used to 
pick Cruz was compensation for the team's loss of Will Clark to the Texas 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Giants' scout Gene Thompson, who covers Arizona State, said he was impressed 
with Cruz's improvement during his three years with the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't impress me near as much as a freshman as he did toward the end of 
the junior year," Thompson said. "He improved himself a great deal at the plate 
and all his stats showed that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz is the fifth area player in the past six drafts to be selected in the 
first round. Who Has Signed So Far?

A QUIETER COACH EXPECTS DUKES TO MAKE NOISE ON COURT; TEAM TENNIS: LOPEZ 
REPLACES QUOTABLE PATTON AND HAS MADE THE TEAM STRONGER BY ADDING TWO DOUBLES 
SPECIALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For four years, Newport Beach Dukes owner Fred Lieberman had Greg Patton, the 
greatest quote machine in World TeamTennis, as his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Patton and his wacky quotes are in Idaho with the newest WTT 
franchise, Lieberman has Angel Lopez, who before his first match already has 
become probably the biggest non-playing drawing card in WTT history. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 of Lopez's closest friends from the San Diego Tennis & Racquet Club 
are taking two buses from San Diego to Newport Beach Saturday to see Lopez's 
home debut Saturday against the Sacramento Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's more business than Patton brought me in four years," Lieberman joked. 
"I just hope the guy can win. If the guy can win, I'll be a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton wasn't exactly a loser. The last two years, he led Newport Beach to the 
WTT final where the Dukes lost both times. Last season, the Dukes had the WTT's 
best regular-season record at 13-1 before losing to Wichita, 26-23, in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 With doubles specialists Kelly Jones and Larisa Neiland added to a team that 
already had Zina Garrison Jackson and Trevor Kronemann, Lieberman said the 
expectations for this season, which begins tonight at San Antonio, are higher 
than last. 
</P>
<P>
 "We improved our team drastically," he said. "We've got the strongest team on 
paper, but there's always luck and injuries involved, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman freely acknowledges that Lopez is partly responsible for the Dukes 
having the league's strongest team on paper. Lopez recruited his former student 
Jones, who was the No. 1 doubles player in the world two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So not only is Lopez the Dukes' promoter, he's also a part-time general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is not a quote machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Greg Patton," Lopez said. "I don't have little rhymes for everything. 
I'm just a hard-working, soft-spoken guy. But I get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was not kidding about the hard-working part. He often spends his days 
teaching nine hours of tennis at the San Diego Tennis & Racquet Club, where he 
has been the head pro since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also president of the U.S. Professional Tennis Assn.'s San Diego 
Division, which has 300 tennis pros as members, and he is a board member for 
the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s Southern California Section and the San Diego Tennis 
Patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez also has found time to coach Garrison Jackson, Jones, Michael Chang, 
Angelica Gavaldon and Tami Whitlinger. During 1989 and 1990, Lopez was a 
touring coach for Jones and Garrison Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Garrison Jackson who recruited Lopez to be the Dukes' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zina called me and asked if I'd be interested in coaching the Dukes," Lopez 
said. "She sounded really excited about team tennis and that got me excited. 
Then she said, 'Let's go get Kelly.' So we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's not familiar with team tennis, Lopez said his familiarity with his 
team should make up for any shortcomings he has with the format. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my little rule book that I'm studying, but I think good 
communication is very important," said Lopez, who played college tennis at 
Arizona in 1977 and 1978. "And it's not like I'm working with four people I 
don't know. I know Kelly and Zina well. I've met Trevor. He's a great guy and I 
met Laurisa at Wimbledon. I started thinking the other day, 'This could be a 
lot of fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said it wouldn't have been much fun anywhere but Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in Southern California got me excited," Lopez said. "If the job was in 
Sacramento, there's no way I would have taken it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said he's simply happy Lopez took it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the drill in team tennis for how you find a coach," Lieberman 
said. "Greg Patton was my third choice. The good news is that Zina called me 
and recommended Angel to be the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The better news is that season-ticket sales suddenly look a lot better because 
of an influx of San Diego fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in San Diego are pretty excited about this," Lopez said. "People in 
Orange County don't know me that well yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman is hoping that will soon change. Duke Facts

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; IN THE END, BAGGIO 
HAS SUNDAY PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Sunday Oliseh, the agony was almost too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the final whistle had sounded, once he knew that Nigeria's World Cup 
dreams had been dashed, he sank to the turf at Foxboro Stadium and lay there, 
physically drained and emotionally exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours, the 19-year-old had played the game of his life. But a single 
mistake in 120 minutes spelled the difference between Nigeria's going on to the 
quarterfinals or going home to Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oliseh knew he had made that mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Giuseppe Signori, the leading scorer in the Italian League for the 
last two seasons, came over to console the teen-ager, helping him to his feet 
and exchanging shirts in the time-honored soccer tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not Signori's shirt that Oliseh should have taken home as a 
souvenir. The one he really should have been given belonged to Roberto Baggio, 
the Italian superstar whose two goals condemned the African champions to a 2-1 
defeat before 54,367 here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was the first of those goals, with only 106 seconds left in the game 
according to the stadium clock, that will haunt Oliseh. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens Westerhof, Nigeria's Dutch coach, had assigned Oliseh, from Agbor in 
Bendel state, the most difficult task of all Tuesday -- guarding Baggio, who 
was voted the world's best player last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it seemed a mismatch of monumental proportions. Baggio, the 
27-year-old superstar from perennial Italian champion Juventus being kept in 
check by a youngster who until recently was playing his club soccer for modest 
FC Liege in Belgium? No contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oliseh did his job in superb fashion, shadowing Baggio like a hawk over a 
hare. Every time the ball was passed to Baggio, there would be Oliseh to either 
sprint in and intercept the pass or to tackle the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game wore on, it appeared more and more obvious that Baggio was being 
taken out of the game by the teen-ager. He was still on the field, certainly, 
but he was no longer an influential factor in the Italian offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The fickle Italian reporters were poised to pillory Baggio, as soon as they 
got through doing the same to Coach Arrigo Sacchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the dying minutes, with Nigeria clinging desperately to a 1-0 lead 
that would have sent the three-time world champions down to one of the most 
ignominious defeats in Italian soccer history, the fateful play unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was played into the Nigerian penalty area, scant yards from the net. 
Italy's Roberto Mussi found himself with the ball at his feet and only Nigerian 
goalkeeper Peter Rufai to beat. Oliseh spotted the danger and sprinted in to 
tackle Mussi. The Italian side-stepped the challenge and passed the ball to 
Baggio, who was momentarily unguarded. Baggio scored, the game was tied and 
Italy was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliseh really had no choice but to leave Baggio and pressure Mussi, but 
because Oliseh missed his tackle, Nigeria failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy went on to win the game in overtime on Baggio's penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Nigeria held on to win, referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico would 
surely have been blamed. Brizio turned in one of the more incompetent 
performances in a World Cup replete with inconsistent and intrusive 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 There were at least two occasions when Brizio could have awarded Italy a 
penalty kick, and on one of them he definitely should have after Baggio had 
been shoved to the ground in front of the net in a crude challenge by a 
Nigerian defender. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps justice was served by the final penalty kick, but it will not make 
Oliseh feel any better. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one consolation for the youngster, it is that when the new season 
begins in Europe, he will be playing before fans who now know what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, Oliseh was traded from Liege to Reggina in the Italian League's 
second division. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for him to be there long. If he continues to play as he did 
Tuesday, he will be picked up by a first-division team in no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means he and Baggio can renew their acquaintance. Baggio might even give 
him a shirt.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; LEONARDO SAYS ELBOW WASN'T INTENTIONAL; BRAZIL: 
HE APOLOGIZES TO RAMOS BUT MIGHT HAVE TO SIT OUT REST OF TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian defender Leonardo was the villain of the 1-0 victory Monday at 
Stanford Stadium over the United States, but the remorseful man who spoke to 
reporters after practice here Tuesday was bearing a message of anti-violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his punishment has yet to be determined, Leonardo, 24, said he 
expects FIFA to suspend him for the rest of the World Cup tournament. He was 
banished from Monday's game for slinging an elbow that fractured a bone in Tab 
Ramos' skull. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonardo said he was not as concerned about himself as he was about Ramos. 
Leonardo visited him for 15 minutes Monday night at the Stanford University 
Medical Center, where the U.S. midfielder was held overnight for observation. 
Ramos was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got from him all anybody could hope for," said Leonardo, who spoke with 
Ramos in English but made his remarks to reporters Tuesday in his native 
Portuguese. "He not only accepted my apology, he wished me luck in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonardo said the incident still weighs on his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am devastated by what happened," he said. "I watched the video later, and 
it looked intentional. It gives a horrible impression. But I tell you from the 
depths of my heart that I had no intention of hurting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was holding me, and I wanted to get free. Three or four times, people were 
holding me. I was frustrated. But nothing justifies hitting another player. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I swung my arm, he was falling. If he hadn't been, I don't think my 
elbow would have hit him. It was the worst part of his face to hit. I didn't 
realize how badly I had hurt him until I saw the reaction of the other American 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like for them to know how sorry I am in my heart and my head. 
Violence doesn't have a place on the soccer field." 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was ejected with a red card in the 44th minute Monday, Leonardo had 
played every minute of this World Cup at left defender for Brazil. Although he 
does not advance as often or as deep as Jorginho, his counterpart on the right, 
Leonardo is skilled enough with the ball that some of Brazil's followers, 
including Pele, have suggested he be moved into the midfield to help solve the 
team's problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said Tuesday that he has not decided who 
will replace Leonardo in Saturday's quarterfinal game against the Netherlands 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo is required to sit out at least one game because of his red card, but 
Parreira said he was told that FIFA President Joao Havelange, a Brazilian, 
revealed in an interview the suspension would cover the rest of Brazil's 
tournament games.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; TEAM MULLS FUTURE -- IN U.S. AND ABROAD; 
SOCCER: AT LEAST FIVE RECEIVE OFFERS TO PLAY IN EUROPE. MILUTINOVIC EVASIVE 
ABOUT COACHING PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was a melancholy mood among the players and staff of the U.S. World Cup 
team on Tuesday as they said their goodbys, exchanged telephone numbers and 
prepared to return to their homes or, in some cases, rejoin their professional 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their part in the 1994 World Cup ended by Monday's 1-0 loss to Brazil, the 
U.S. players spent the day relaxing, assessing their futures and checking out 
of their hotel in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Not present was Tab Ramos, who suffered a skull fracture in the game and had 
remained in Stanford University Medical Center on Monday night for observation. 
Doctors said the break in the bone above his left ear would need three to six 
months' healing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos returned to Mission Viejo on Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled to 
undergo a CAT scan today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos' injury is especially difficult for him because his professional team, 
Real Betis of Spain, was promoted to the first division at the end of last 
season and will begin training camp in a few weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 At least five players under contract to the U.S. Soccer Federation have been 
offered contracts by European professional teams -- Mike Sorber, Paul 
Caligiuri, Alexi Lalas, Cobi Jones and Joe-Max Moore. Moore was a member of the 
U.S World Cup team but did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others -- Claudio Reyna, Frank Klopas and Mike Burns -- are free agents 
and available to play for any team. Reyna is expected to sign a contract within 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The players under contract to the USSF are paid through September or October 
and the coaches are paid through December. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic was asked repeatedly about his plans but was 
evasive. Milutinovic has lived in Mexico for 20 years, has coached at the club 
and national team levels in that country and still owns a home outside Mexico 
City.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Milutinovic and his wife, Maria, have been living with their young 
daughter, Darinka, in Laguna Hills and he has said many times he is happy with 
his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are no happy in California, you are crazy," Milutinovic has said. 
</P>
<P>
 His coaching future in the United States depends on several factors. 
Milutinovic's boss, USSF President Alan Rothenberg, is on record as saying he 
is happy with Milutinovic's performance in the three years the Serbian has been 
national coach. But Rothenberg must run for reelection next month and only 
after that will Milutinovic's role be determined.  
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been speculation that Milutinovic might find work 
elsewhere, he would not say Tuesday if he had been contacted by any clubs. He 
did say he wasn't interested in coaching a club again, saying that brought on 
too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 By most measures, Milutinovic and the U.S. team have been successful, having 
reached their avowed goal of the second round of the tournament. And 
Milutinovic has now coached three countries' teams to the second round of the 
World Cup or beyond. The surprise in this case was how well the largely 
inexperienced U.S. team played in compiling a 1-2-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The players said they were excited about how the World Cup had brought 
attention to their sport, which in the United States has been a relatively 
obscure one.  
</P>
<P>
 "When everybody talks about soccer, everybody is into it, everyone watches the 
games, it gets a lot of attention -- this is the way it is overseas," Lalas 
said. "It's a way of life. For an American, I've never experienced that. That's 
not the way soccer is here. You go for so long just being an outcast, in terms 
of the sporting world, and then all of a sudden, Boom! It's what you always 
dreamed and thought it could be. It makes you feel very good. You start 
thinking, 'Why can't it be like this all the time?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more circumspect about the long-term impact the U.S. team's 
success will have on the sport in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hope it lasts," John Harkes said. "We set higher goals for ourselves 
as a team. We want to achieve more. To be on the field against Brazil . . . no 
one would have thought that. We'll do better next time. I'm already excited 
about 1998. I really am."

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; 3 WHO ARGUED WITH ESCOBAR FACE WEAPONS, DRUG 
CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Three people involved in a confrontation with soccer star Andres Escobar 
shortly before he was killed face drug and weapons charges, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was shot to death apparently because he scored an own goal in 
Colombia's World Cup loss to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the two men and a woman were suspects in the shooting, but they 
were cleared after questioning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 They remained in custody because police said they found 55 pounds of cocaine, 
two revolvers and a submachine gun in the two Medellin homes where they were 
arrested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was shot early Saturday in the parking lot of a restaurant in 
Medellin. Police arrested two suspects over the weekend, one of whom confessed 
to shooting Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects arrested in Medellin on Monday were at the scene of 
Escobar's death with Humberto Munoz, who confessed to shooting the soccer star, 
police said. They were identified as brothers Humberto and Hernan Dario Velez 
Correa and their cousin, Luz Mila Correa. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz worked as a driver for another suspect, rancher Santiago Gallon Henao, 
who allegedly bet heavily on the Colombian team and was upset at having lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were investigating whether drug traffickers planned Escobar's 
death. Earlier, they said the murder was not premeditated and was not linked to 
drug cartels or death threats against other members of the Colombian soccer 
team.

ASK AND SHE SHALL SUCCEED; FEARLESS MISSY GIOVE CRASHES TO THE TOP OF MOUNTAIN 
BIKING WORLD WITH AN ODD AND AGGRESSIVE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missy Giove never dreamed of a career riding bicycles down mountains at 
breakneck speeds. But then nobody had ever asked her to ride one. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1990, that is. During a competition four years ago in Mt. Snow, Vt., a 
friend lent Giove his bike and dared her to enter. She won a beginners' race, 
then finished second in a pro-class event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also crashed really, really hard," Giove recalled in a recent issue of 
Rocky Mountain Sports. "I was going about 40 (m.p.h.) down this ski slope, 
because I had no concept of what you can and can't do on a mountain bike."  
</P>
<P>
 She went flying over the handlebars and landed about 40 feet down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up, with grass sticking out of my helmet, got my bike and did the same 
thing again," she said. "So (friend and pro racer) Charlie Litsky saw this and 
said, 'I've never seen a woman do that. You're psychotic.' So he got a local 
bike shop to lend me a bike and pay for my entry fees." 
</P>
<P>
 And professional women's mountain bike racing hasn't been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting dreadlocks and a nose ring, wearing a dead piranha around her neck 
for inspiration and carrying the ashes of her dead dog in tribute to her former 
"buddy," Giove is still crashing more often than the rest of the women on the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only because she is riding faster than they dare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's a new breed, in that she doesn't have any fear," said Eric 
Sakadinsky, 26, a friend and rider from the Dos Equis-Barracuda team. "She 
makes all the other ladies realize that they're going to have to go a little 
harder if they're going to win races." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kim Sonier, 30, a rider for Team Iron Horse: "She is very fast, but she 
doesn't always make it to the bottom. But we definitely have to try harder just 
to stay closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Giove, 23, who left Team Yeti after last season to join the new team, 
Volvo-Cannondale, is leading the Grundig-UCI World Cup Downhill Standings going 
into this week's competition on Mammoth Mountain in Mammoth Lakes. Racing 
starts today, and the downhill on Saturday will cover 3.5 miles and drop more 
than 2,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first World Cup race of the season, on May 29 at Cap d'Ail, France, 
Giove had to dismount to repair her chain derailleur, but still finished third. 
Anne-Caroline Chausson of France was the winner. Giove's victory on June 5 at 
Hindelang, Germany, was by an impressive 16 seconds over second-place finisher 
Chausson. Elke Brutsaert edged Giove in the last World Cup downhill in a 
driving rain on June 26 at Mt. Saint Anne, Quebec. Giove leads Chausson by 11 
points. Sonier is third. 
</P>
<P>
 Giove credits her aggressiveness and instincts, and, of course, her 
once-feisty motivator, the piranha. 
</P>
<P>
 "The piranha was my bud, my little warrior buddy that used to hang out with me 
when I was in college studying late nights," Giove says, explaining that the 
voracious little fish died one night after jumping from its tank while Giove 
was in Vermont competing in a ski race. "For me, my pet piranha is my reminder 
to be aggressive and to act on instincts, and to not think too much and to just 
be , you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ruffian, the black lab that watched over Giove for 18 years before 
dying, Giove merely sees no reason to let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got him cremated and I carry him with me -- just a part of him, not the 
whole urn; he was a large dog," she says. "So I just take a little bit of his 
ashes every time I race and sprinkle them on me and I just take him for a ride. 
He was my buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 With her flamboyance on and off the mountain, it's easy to see why Giove is 
the most popular rider on the women's tour. She is well liked by most other 
riders because she is always willing to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a different side that most people don't see," Sonier says. "She 
really cares about other riders. If we're standing around, looking like we need 
something, she comes over and she asks us what we need. She is really a nice 
person and not just this wild and crazy girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Giove only wishes that she had always been so well understood.  
</P>
<P>
 While growing up in Manhattan, she was kicked out of several schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a good student, but I always questioned authority," she says. "I was 
either very liked because I was creative and my own person, or I was very 
disliked because (teachers) didn't want to accept me because I was questioning 
them, instead of just understanding that I wanted to further my knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Giove learned how to handle a bicycle while delivering Chinese food on 
Manhattan's East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Her athletic prowess surfaced on the kick-ball courts of Manhattan and then on 
skateboards in and around New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just thrash the chutes in New York City and then I would thrash the 
chutes in New Jersey and (later) in Vermont," she says, still clinging to the 
street-talk she grew up with. "I was just really into skateboarding." 
</P>
<P>
 She later got into motorcycles and, after moving to Vermont, became interested 
in competitive ski racing. A downhill racer, she finished second in the 1989 
U.S. Junior Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came her grand entrance into mountain biking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were slow to accept this brash young newcomer, who dressed and adorned 
herself as she pleased.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I was misunderstood because I present myself differently, you know, 
like on the exterior," she says. "I look different than the next person. I 
might act different than the 'quote' stereotypical woman. But I choose to 
express myself." 
</P>
<P>
 And always quick with the tongue, she ruffled more than a few feathers.  
</P>
<P>
 She was suspended last year for 20 days for swearing at and spitting on a race 
official at the Iron Horse Classic in her hometown, Durango, Colo. The 
suspension might have cost her the downhill championship, because she missed 
three races and still managed to finish fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-ranking race official even said Giove was bad for the sport, that 
"mountain biking will flourish in the long term only if we have a more 
conservative image than what's presented in Missy." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been quite the opposite.  
</P>
<P>
 Giove seems to be just what the sport needs. She has the biggest fan club 
among all female and most male riders, consisting of mostly young wanna-be pro 
racers who, if their parents would let them, would probably be wearing 
dreadlocks and nose rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Volvo-Cannondale realized that and went after Giove before this 
season. First they had to assure Giove that they wanted her as she was and not 
"a clone of everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Volvo-Cannondale General Manager Tom Schuler, "We talked to a lot of 
people and realized that Missy was an obvious choice. Her personality works and 
she's very popular. People appreciate her style."

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; COURSE IS ON TRACK TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think it's hot now? 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the possibilities not so long ago at Scholl Canyon Golf Course in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 A golfer crouches to line up his putt, eyes the hole, adjusts his cap, throws 
his cigarette to the ground. . . . and spontaneously ignites a white flash of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Air Quality Management District shut down Scholl Canyon, 
built on a landfill site, because of methane gas seepage. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening day is only four months away. It's been a long climb back for the 
course, located at the top of the mountains overlooking Glendale, Pasadena and 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a clear day up there, you can see Catalina," said Bob Mezak of the 
Glendale Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane is a colorless, odorless gas produced by decomposing organic matter. 
Scholl Canyon opened in 1986, but because of the potentially dangerous and 
pollutive problems associated with leakage of methane -- which is highly 
flammable -- the course was ordered closed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Methane) burns clear, too," Mezak pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Poof, just like that, golfers in Glendale were left high and dry for four 
years by a problem they couldn't even see. Scholl Canyon was the city's lone 
public course. Nearby Chevy Chase and Oakmont country clubs are private. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, the city of Glendale entered into a 40-year operational lease 
with the American Golf Corp., and the two parties have ensured the acreage 
won't go up in smoke. In November, the facility will reopen and it's a safe bet 
nobody will recognize the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The city installed a series of new wells and underground pipelines to collect 
the methane, clearing the way for the new course. In fact, the gas will be 
piped to the Grayson Power Plant and will be used to generate juice for the 
city. Water at the course will be reclaimed for use elsewhere, Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wells and pipelines were installed, the course was covered with 6-10 
feet of topsoil, both at city expense. Some of the dirt is from various 
Metrolink tunneling projects. Thereafter, the parcel was turned over to 
American Golf, which paid for the actual course construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The original 40-acre site has been expanded to 60 acres and the course has 
grown from nine to 18 holes. The par-60 executive layout will feature six 
par-four holes and 12 par-threes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another boon for Glendale golfers: A 35-stall lighted driving range has been 
built, the city's only public practice facility, Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetite for a public course in Glendale caught Mezak, a senior park 
services supervisor, off guard. Last spring, American Golf held a barbecue for 
the long-suffering members of the Scholl Canyon men's and women's clubs, which 
continued to distribute a monthly newsletter over the past four years. 
Eighty-five folks showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept together all this time," Mezak said of the clubs. "That's hard to 
believe, but they're very enthusiastic about this (project)." 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in methane collection made it possible. The system installed in 
1986 wasn't very effective, Mezak said. Even worse, fissures and sinkholes 
formed on fairways and greens. Subsidence was so severe on the old third green 
that putting became a misadventure, Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezak said advances in methane collection should all but eliminate the 
possibility of future shutdowns, and American Golf has installed a layer of 
plastic sheeting underneath each green to help ensure that no methane 
percolates to the surface beneath unwitting players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has improved considerably," Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 So will the course, it seems. Reconstruction began last November. More than 
300,000 cubic yards of soil were redistributed, according to Scott Williams, 
the site's construction superintendent. Williams said the pre-existing course 
was "totally demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 The rudimentary construction already is complete, though fertilization and 
fine-tuning continues in preparation for the unveiling on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks won't recognize the place, Williams promised. Like a piece of clay, the 
land has been sculpted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have imagined that some of the holes that now exist could have 
been built," Williams said. "What a huge, huge difference." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some, some summertime: Linda Ishii can play with the big boys. Not to mention 
the big girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii, who will be a junior at Westlake High, was among the starting six on 
the school's highly regarded golf team, which is a feat in itself. The fact 
that Ishii, at 5-foot-4, was able to keep up with some of the best players in 
Ventura County shows considerable mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 High schools don't field girls' golf teams, so Ishii played all season from 
the men's tees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courses are real, real long," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have hastened her development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-day span last week, Ishii placed first and second in the girls' 
division of two junior tournaments. She won a Southern California PGA event in 
Apple Valley with a six-under 59 and finished second in the SCPGA match-play 
event in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteerism: Ever want to watch the world's top professionals from inside the 
gallery ropes? 
</P>
<P>
 The Riviera Country Club, located just over the Sepulveda Pass in Pacific 
Palisades, is seeking volunteers to work the 1995 PGA Championship on Aug. 
7-13, which marks only the third time in the past half-century that Los Angeles 
has hosted one of golf's four major events. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't get any closer to the action without a club in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult volunteers are required to pay a $140 fee and must work at least three 
half-day shifts. Volunteers receive a uniform valued at $170 and may use their 
parking and admission passes over each of the seven days -- even when they are 
not working the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you look at what you get, it's a very good deal," said Jim 
Magnusson, a PGA official and the tournament director. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 volunteers are still needed. Also, 600 teen-age volunteers are 
being sought. Teen volunteers are not required to pay a fee. Riviera last 
hosted the PGA in 1983. The 1948 U.S. Open, also held at Riviera, was the only 
other major held in the region in the past 50 years.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; THESE PLAYERS ARE LOCKED IN BATTLE OF THE AGES; 
SOFTBALL: AMATEUR VETERANS COMPETING AGAINST COLLEGE STANDOUTS FOR 15 SPOTS ON 
1996 OLYMPIC GAMES ROSTER.

 Jenny Dalton looks at the injury and sees more than scratches, a huge bandage 
and a shin swollen to twice its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton looks at Barbara Jordan's leg and sees commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That right there shows what's in her heart," Dalton said. "Desire, that's 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball's debut as an Olympic medal sport is still two years away, but 
Dalton, Jordan and other top players know Big Brother already is watching from 
behind the backstop screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late last week when the most talented college and touring amateur 
players in the nation converged at the Fountain Park Athletic Complex to 
compete in the Olympic Festival, eight people have sat behind home plate, 
sipping cold drinks and occasionally scribbling notes. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the U.S. Olympic team selection committee, those who eventually will 
determine a career path for the likes of Dalton and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty players are participating in the Olympic Festival. Only 15 will make the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Jordan won't come out of the lineup. She is 29 and has been waiting 
too long to ease up now. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not alone. Sheila Cornell, Barb Booth, Priscilla Rouse and Karen Walker 
are other local players in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell, 32, a former Taft High and UCLA standout, is a nine-time Amateur 
Softball Assn. All-American. Booth, from Glendale, is 32. Rouse, a former 
teammate of Jordan's at Cal State Northridge, is 30. Walker, a former UCLA 
All-American from Woodland Hills, is 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has their own tale of sacrifice when it comes to pursuing their Olympic 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the other set: Dalton, 20, the home run hitter from Glendale 
High; Amy Chellevold, 22, the slick-fielding first baseman from Thousand Oaks, 
and Nancy Evans, 19, the phenom pitcher from Hoover High. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton, Chellevold and Evans all play for the University of Arizona, reigning 
two-time NCAA Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 They are so much younger. But is a spot on the Olympic team any less important 
to them? 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton says it is not, but she can't help being a bit in awe of the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see it in their eyes, how important softball really is to them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton watches Jordan and is amazed at her determination. Jordan has rarely 
been seen without bulky ice bags strapped to her leg since she was struck 
squarely on the tibia bone in her first game last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she hasn't missed a beat, batting leadoff and playing center field for the 
East team . 
</P>
<P>
 When the East played Dalton's South team on Sunday evening, Jordan stripped 
off her bandages and started the game by drawing a catcher's interference call. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typically crafty, veteran play. On the first pitch, Jordan moved 
forward in the batter's box, looking to slap the ball past an infielder as she 
started her charge down the first base line. 
</P>
<P>
 With the catcher leaning forward in anticipation of a similar effort on the 
next pitch, Jordan stepped back and took a full swing, nipping her opponent's 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Out out later, with Jordan on second, Cornell launched a home run far over the 
fence in right-center field. Two-zip, just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Dalton and the rest of the newcomers are up against. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be in your heart to stay in it that long," Dalton said of the older 
players. "To be out of college and still pursue the dream is something that 
takes a lot of guts, a lot of courage and a lot of pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention considerable sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's circumstance is typical among the more established players. She is on 
unpaid leave from her job as a private investigator in order to take part in 
the Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've reached a stage where I think a lot more now, 'Why am I still here?' " 
Rouse said. "I should be at work, making money. But I want to push myself to 
see how far I can go, how good I can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the Olympic team would be reaching the pinnacle. Softball doesn't have 
a professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike a lot of other sports, softball is pure dedication," Cornell said. 
"That and perhaps stupidity is what keeps us coming out here." 
</P>
<P>
 A competition between players of different ages is the best-case scenario for 
U.S. softball. The older players are being athletically challenged by their 
youthful counterparts and the college-age players are learning from their more 
experienced rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the sport and it's good for the individual competitors," 
Cornell said. "When you don't have anybody pushing you, what is there to make 
you a better player?" 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, participants in the Olympic Festival are not playing in peak 
condition. The amateur softball season doesn't begin until June, with 
competition climaxing in August at a national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so this year. "From June 1, everyone was ready to go," Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse hit a two-run home run in a Sunday game, but afterward was discouraged 
because she struck out later in the game with runners on base. "There's a 
certain amount of pressure we're all feeling," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strain isn't unique to veteran players whose age in all likelihood limits 
their future in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton and Chellevold both say they will make only one attempt at making the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold is on schedule to graduate next May. If she doesn't make the U.S. 
team she said she will "get on with life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for Dalton, who doubts that her body will hold up under the yearly wear 
and tear of top-flight competition. She also doubts she would be able to budget 
time for training around a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 Should they quit the sport after their college careers, several softball 
experts say Dalton and Chellevold will never reach their prime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players coming out of college are really just starting to get to the level 
where they're reaching maturity," said Irene Shea, the only NCAA representative 
on the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In amateur softball, pitchers are 40 feet away -- three feet closer than in 
college. But the biggest difference is the level of experience among players. 
"The veterans will make very few mistakes," said Ralph Raymond, who has guided 
the Raybestos Brakettes of Stratford, Conn. to 17 national ASA championships.  
</P>
<P>
 "The youngster is go, go, go, but in going sometimes they make mental mistakes 
that can cost you a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, who may have the inside track to becoming the U.S. Olympic coach, 
said a mixture of youth and experience is likely to form the nation's first 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 15 spots on the squad, versatility is another key consideration. For 
that reason, Booth, a career catcher, is working to also improve as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Booth quit the sport, thinking she had gone as far as 
possible after being a member of the U.S. Pan-American Games champion that 
year. Then came news of the Olympics. Friends convinced her to resume training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough thing to do, to try to stay at the top of a sport for that 
long," Booth said. "But if you have once chance in life, even it's a slim 
chance, you go for it."

 SECOND IS FIRST? Tina Nguyen of Westminster gets calls daily about her 
Vietnamese language classes, which start again Sunday. And almost all come from 
young Vietnamese Americans. . . . Many find it difficult to speak with some of 
their own relatives because they've grown up here speaking English (E1) and are 
weak in their native language. Says Nguyen: "Many of them want to improve their 
Vietnamese because they're preparing for a return visit to Vietnam."

 OF HUMAN EVENTS: Ad whiz Sakol Mongkolkasetarin of Fountain Valley was in 
great demand a few months ago after his one-man company won four prestigious 
industry "Belding" awards. He was quickly grabbed up by dGWB, a large Irvine ad 
agency. . . . But big-company life didn't suit him. He and two co-workers 
declared -- on July 4 -- their rights include "life, liberty and the pursuit of 
creative freedom" with their own new firm, Acme Advertising in Newport Beach. 
</P>

 RIGHT TRACK: Lake Forest track star Ashley Bethel, who lost her right eye when 
she was struck by a golf ball in February, continues her strong comeback. . . . 
She set a national record for the 13-14-year-old division in the pentathlon at 
last week's U.S. Youth Athletic Championships at Knoxville, Tenn. Bethel won 
the high jump (5-foot-3 3/4) and long jump (18-3 1/4). "I'm still having 
problems in jumps, but if I keep practicing, it will come," Bethel says. Next 
stop: the Junior Olympics July 26-31.

 HE'LL BE BACK: Greg Patton, former UC Irvine and Newport Beach Dukes tennis 
coach, is now coaching Boise State and the Idaho Sneakers, the newest World 
TeamTennis franchise. Patton took with him to the Sneakers former Dukes Manon 
Bollegraf and Amy Frazier and Laguna Beach brothers Rick and Jon Leach; the 
latter recently finished an outstanding four-year career at USC. . . . Patton 
will bring his new team to Newport Beach's John Wayne Tennis Club on July 12 to 
face the Dukes (C4).

HEAVY RAINS SOAK GEORGIA FOR 2ND DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto unloaded torrents of rain on Georgia for 
the second straight day Tuesday, forcing hundreds from their homes and causing 
the death of a woman whose car went out of control on a flooded road. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of the north and central 
sections of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudslides were reported in several areas, and the dam of the Lamar County 
reservoir broke, forcing the evacuation of residents downstream. In Taylor 
County, a dam broke and heavy flooding washed out 10 bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Coweta County, one of the worst-hit areas, 180 families had to evacuate a 
trailer park in the early morning hours. Several feet of water sloshed through 
the swingset and slides of the children's playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out my door; the water was rushing up like the Chattahoochee River," 
Hazel Dykes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were being evacuated at 3 a.m., Dykes watched her porch, ripped loose 
by the surging water, float away into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In College Park, a suburb of Atlanta, Kenny Marmon and his family waited out 
the storm at a shelter at North Clayton High School with about 75 of their 
neighbors from a mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 Just south of Atlanta, some residents had to be evacuated by boat, and in 
Crawford County, 58 Girl Scouts were evacuated from their camp to a shelter at 
a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Beyah, 31, was killed Tuesday when she lost control of her car at a 
flooded intersection in Spalding County.

ENTHUSIASM, CONFUSION MARK VISTA DEBUT; TRANSPORTATION: NEW COUNTYWIDE BUS 
SYSTEM SURVIVES FIRST-DAY GLITCHES, MAKES HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The buses were late, the schedules missing and the riders confused. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the glitches, the launch of the new countywide VISTA bus service 
Tuesday was met with enthusiasm by skeptics and supporters alike. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, VISTA, or Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority, provides 
bus service linking every city in Ventura County except Ojai for the first time 
in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, its $1.9-million annual cost is covered in large part by federal 
funds in a two-year trial program designed to coax residents onto public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley City Councilman Bill Davis, who also serves on the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission, has been an outspoken VISTA critic, arguing that the 
program will be costly and unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very skeptical of this ever since the idea was proposed," Davis 
said. "But now that it's under way, the thing to do is set that aside and let 
the service speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis, spokeswoman for the Transportation Commission, said she is 
confident that once residents learn about the new bus service, they will be 
eager to try it. And once they try it, she said, they will return for its 
comfort, cost and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bus system provides far more connections than the old one, uses luxury 
coaches with restrooms and costs only $1 for a typical adult ticket. Travel 
time compares with that on the few old routes -- about an hour, for example, 
from The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks to the Buenaventura Mall in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said the commission is planning to wait several months -- until all the 
kinks in service are ironed out -- before launching a major advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always last-minute problems to be taken care of," Travis said. "All 
in all I think Day 1 went pretty well, and we'll be smoothing things out even 
more over the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, buses were running about 15 minutes behind schedule as 
drivers figured out their routes and took extra time to answer questions from 
passengers and curious passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the morning, driver Ted Martinez had answered dozens of 
questions, but had not picked up a single passenger on his Oxnard-area route. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the veteran bus driver -- who was hired for the trial period -- seemed 
unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had lots of people come on board to ask me what this bus is for, and 
then say they'll be back to ride it," Martinez said. "I think once people find 
out about it, it's going to be very popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's effort to spread the word was stymied a bit by a shortage of 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said almost all of the 5,000 pre-printed schedules had been scooped up 
ahead of time, and schedules from a second printing were not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had much more interest than we expected in the past few weeks," Travis 
said. "We should have another batch of schedules out by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first year of service, transit officials are hoping to 
attract between 200 and 400 riders a day on each of VISTA's four lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope, said Travis, is that riders will find the 44-passenger coaches -- 
with their restrooms, luggage racks, air conditioning and reclining seats -- an 
easy, comfortable way to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, South Coast Area Transit rider Idolene Spann, 32, was pleased to 
discover that VISTA could get her to her hairdresser at Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great," she told the driver. "I am always looking for easier ways to 
get around." 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks mall, VISTA caused confusion as riders accustomed to taking the 
Interconnect bus to Camarillo and Ventura puzzled over the new service. 
</P>
<P>
 They discovered that their old timetables were no longer any good, and that 
the old green Interconnect buses had been replaced with freshly painted 
turquoise, sky blue and purple VISTA coaches running on a different schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning to visit her daughter in Ventura, Jaye Maria, 78, had arrived at the 
Thousand Oaks mall at 8:30 for the 9:10 Interconnect bus she has taken for the 
weekly trip. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bus did not show, Maria scoured the bus stop, searching in vain for a 
new bus schedule or notice of the change. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time another waiting passenger told Maria that Interconnect had been 
replaced by VISTA, she had failed to board the 9:05 VISTA bus to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really confusing," Maria said as she folded up her old Interconnect 
schedule and tucked it in her purse. "I'm glad they're expanding the service, 
but if they're going to change the times, they should at least give us a 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The VISTA service consists of four fixed routes and five Dial-a-Ride routes. 
</P>
<P>
 On VISTA schedules, the fixed routes are identified as follows. 
</P>
<P>
 * VISTA Highway 126 from Fillmore to Ventura, including stops at the 
Buenaventura Mall and the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * VISTA Highway 101 connects with VISTA Highway 126 and runs through Ventura, 
Oxnard and Camarillo to Thousand Oaks. Stops include Ventura College and the 
County Government Center in Ventura, the Camarillo Metrolink Station and The 
Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * VISTA Central runs between Oxnard and Camarillo, including stops at the 
Oxnard Transportation Center, Point Mugu Naval Air Center and Camarillo State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * VISTA East serves Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, 
crossing into Los Angeles County with a stop in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In less-populated areas, residents who live far from bus routes can call VISTA 
and arrange to be picked up at their homes and taken to the nearest bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas offering this type of service, called Dial-a-Ride, are Santa Paula, 
Fillmore, Agoura Hills, Oak Park and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA buses run Mondays through Fridays from about 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Some 
routes offer hourly service. On others, buses run every half hour. There is no 
weekend service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares on fixed routes are $1 for adults, 75 cents for students and 50 cents 
for senior citizens. Drivers do not make change. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes, which can be purchased by phone or at any city hall in the 
county, are $34 for adults, $26 for students and $15 for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The passes may be used on VISTA and on city buses throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets on Dial-a-Ride service cost $1.50 for adults, $1 for students and 75 
cents for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly Dial-a-Ride passes are $50 for adults, $42 for students and $31 for 
senior citizens. New VISTA Bus Service A new countywide bus system began

DANA PARSONS: CHANCE TO REFLECT ON LIFE'S MADNESS SERVES TO MAGNIFY IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A vacation was just the tonic I needed. Leaving California for 10 days helped 
clear my mind and allow time to reflect on this column. I concluded that maybe 
I've been too hard on myself recently, that maybe the column isn't as bad as I 
think and that maybe I am connecting with the public. Reassured and 
revitalized, I was eager to catch up on the mail that came while I was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Mr. Parsons,  
</P>
<P>
 . . . You write some of the dumbest stuff I have ever read."  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 I see. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to your question, yes, it's good to be back. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . It was sometime in the late afternoon last Thursday, while reclining on 
a lounge chair on the patio outside my hosts' home in the Lake of the Ozarks 
and watching a big blue heron swoop down near the waterline at Wilson Bend and 
then squawk to announce its arrival on shore, that the thought occurred, I need 
to take more vacations.  
</P>
<P>
 I was visiting my sister in St. Louis, and from there it had taken us 3 1/2 
hours to reach her friends' home out on the lake in central Missouri. Our 
hosts, Jerry and Joleen Meyer, have dubbed their hideaway Chalet Point, and to 
get there you jump the beaten path and keep an eye peeled for twin landmarks: 
the shoes-on-the-fence and the cups-on-the-tree. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time you arrive, with the last few miles on a bumpy gravel road and 
then down a steep incline, your car may take a beating but not your senses. My 
sister, who has a much keener eye for such things, noted the wildflowers along 
the drive -- the black-eyed Susans and the Queen Anne's lace -- and the groves 
of oak, elm and hickory. She pointed out the Missouri bottomlands and the 
stretches of interstate highway that were under water last year from the 
historic Flood of '93. As tranquil as the countryside was this year, it must 
have been equally nightmarish last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up in the Midwest, I may be most nostalgic for the silence of the 
open country. There are just too many of us here in California to guarantee 
silence and because the Southern California building industry has linked growth 
with prosperity, things will just get noisier. And because I've chosen to hang 
around the news business, there always will be background noise in my head from 
the constant clamor of the world's craziness. 
</P>

 GRAND RIDGE, Fla. (Reuter) -- A 26-year-old man used a circular saw to slice 
off his penis and testicles during a bout of depression, police said Wednesday. 
 
</P>
<P>
 That electronic message, sent by a friend while I was gone, greeted me on my 
return to work. On most days it might have made me laugh, because I've become 
one sick puppy after years in this business. On the first day back from 
vacation, however, the message was more of a plaintive reminder that nothing 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We decided to eat dinner out on the lake that first night. Joleen sells 
property in the area and got hung up all afternoon on a sale, so she didn't 
have time to display her highly touted cooking prowess. She brought home some 
chicken, whipped up a bean salad and we loaded it, some corn on the cob and a 
bottle of wine onto their 20-foot-plus pontoon and cut loose from the dock 
while it was still light. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake is huge, with an incredible 1,300 miles of forested shoreline. To my 
surprise, it is man-made and was finished in the early 1930s by damming the 
Osage River. Jerry said the project took three years. He wondered aloud how 
long it would take to do the job in today's bureaucracy. We settled on about 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The lake glistened under the slowly setting sun and we immersed ourselves in 
the reverie. My sister told us that whenever she sees a shimmering lake 
anymore, she thinks kindly of her first husband, who loved the water and died 5 
1/2 years ago of a brain tumor. She and their daughter scattered his ashes on a 
lake and just as they were doing so, she recalled, the sun broke through and 
the water seemed to glow. 
</P>
<P>
 We continued down the lake, occasionally ducking around a bend to see some 
lakeside houses and speculate on whether any would someday become my sister's 
retreat from the city. About an hour before sundown, we cut the engine and 
dropped anchor in a secluded cove and broke out the food. As if in church, we 
talked more softly than we normally would. We saw snakes slithering through the 
water, creating their momentary ripples. At one point, my sister shushed me and 
we listened in the dead calm to a choir of whippoorwills in the nearby trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're real quiet, you'll hear sounds out here you've never heard before," 
Jerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 We toasted friendship and our good fortune and headed back to Chalet Point 
before darkness fell over the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least that moment, for at least that day . . . I had no job, no worries 
and no connection to a world going mad.

WORLD CUP / U.S.A. 1994; TAKING DEFEAT IN STRIDE; POLICE SEAL OFF STREET TO 
AVERT UNRULY CELEBRATION OF A MEXICO VICTORY THAT NEVER CAME

 Mexican flags waved briskly in the crowded aisle between the watermelon juice 
and pork rind counters. Young and old dressed in red, green and white bit their 
nails and stared at a big-screen TV perched igh on a wall above several 
dangling pinatas.  
</P>
<P>
 And then, as a dramatic overtime shootout played out, the eager anticipation 
of more than 150 Mexican World Cup fans at El Gallo Giro restaurant in 
Huntington Park turned into bittersweet disappointment as their team was bested 
by Bulgaria on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game is a game and someone has to lose," sighed delivery driver Richard 
Gallegos, 22, a Mexican flag draped over his shoulders. "Our team played well. 
They played as well as they could." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, about one in three people are of Mexican descent and 
they -- especially the ones born south of the border -- constitute the region's 
largest segment of soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Huntington Park had become ground zero for the World Cup 
exuberance -- and in some cases, over-exuberance -- of Mexican team fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after Mexico's 1-1 tie with Italy ensured the team's entry into the 
tournament's second round, police arrested 17 celebrants, hurled pepper spray 
and closed off vehicular traffic on Pacific Boulevard, the center of Huntington 
Park's business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of violence after Tuesday's game, police closed off Pacific Boulevard 
to vehicles early in the morning and ordered pedestrians off the street in 
midafternoon, even before the game's hair-raising conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few public spots available to watch the game was El Gallo Giro, a 
popular fast-food emporium at Pacific and Florence Avenue, at the south end of 
the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people here love Mexico," said Pedro J. Matar, director of sales and 
marketing for the restaurant. "And they know we're part of Mexico, so they 
won't bother us. They'll protect us." 
</P>
<P>
 As the game played out on the TV inside the eatery, several police officers 
milled about outside. The wide boulevard was so deserted that one could fire a 
cannon and hit nothing but asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "What gives, man? It looks like a ghost town. It's too quiet here. It's like 
'Gunsmoke,' " said Pomona resident Eddie Garnica, who was visiting his sister 
in downtown Huntington Park. "I was born and raised in this town and it feels 
kind of creepy today, really." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game concluded, more than 100 riot-geared officers appeared on the 
scene in a display of force. But there were no immediate reports of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Several business owners were perturbed by the police crackdown along Pacific, 
saying their businesses were unduly suffering because of the street closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why the police had to close down this street," said Rosa 
Luna, co-owner of three maternity clothing stores along Pacific. "People just 
want to celebrate. They're not going to make any trouble. We're losing a lot of 
business and we had to send six workers home, so they can't get paid today." 
</P>
<P>
 Several in a small crowd at Florence and Pacific also expressed resentment at 
the heavy police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't happy that the police are out there like that," said Freddy 
Gonzalez, 35, as he hoisted a Mexican flag at the corner of Pacific and 
Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, which numbered no more than 100 people, waved flags and spoke with 
resignation about their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost, but we're proud of our team," shouted Javier Medina, 25. "We played 
well and we showed we have a lot of heart. We'll be back next time."

FANS DROP EVERYTHING TO CHEER MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To many American sports fans, the World Cup ended on the Fourth of July, when 
the Brazilians dispatched an upstart USA team with a short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the soccer-crazed multitudes of Ventura County's Latino population, the 
World Cup climax came Tuesday, when Mexico met Bulgaria. To them, that was the 
momentous clash of nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, who may still think Brazilian defender Leonardo is a Teen-Age 
Mutant Ninja Turtle, cannot be expected to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've never seen the Mexican team play," Oxnard resident Roberto Ruiz, 65, 
said of Americans' apathy toward soccer. "If they had, they would understand 
the greatness of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, for the Mexican team, greatness was absent Tuesday: Bulgaria won. But 
the effort, fans were quick to emphasize, was valiant.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had faith in them, and they didn't let us down," said Ruiz's daughter, 
Maria. "They played hard." 
</P>
<P>
 In La Colonia, the largest Mexican community in a county that is more than 25% 
Latino, Eduardo Valencia and his brother Juan took the day off from their body 
shop jobs to watch the game at the La Michoacana bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aficionados," said Eduardo Valencia before the game. "(Mexico's) got 
the best players, and they try the hardest of any team." 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted, however, he was a fan of Argentina but was rooting for Mexico 
since his team had been knocked out of the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers yelled, jumped out of their seats and swigged beers until the 
final set of penalty kicks that gave Bulgaria the win. Within seconds, they 
left the bar -- finally speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yolanda's restaurant in Oxnard, 13 members of the Castellano family watched 
Mexico's fortunes unfold on a big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my heritage," said family member Tino Mendez, 22. "I played soccer when 
I was growing up, and it means a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The match apparently had great significance for Frank Amaro, who parked his 
delivery truck outside the Mexican restaurant and met his two brothers inside 
to watch the game. All three were waving red, white and green flags and yelling 
maniacally at every Mexican scoring opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the truck right now," Amaro joked. "I just want Mexico to 
win. I don't care for Bulgaria one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted he had never met a Bulgarian. 
</P>
<P>
 When regulation time expired in a tie, the fervent Mexican fans became 
restless. 
</P>
<P>
 Several at La Michoacana paced the floor. Some could not bear to watch, 
turning away from the screen, only to turn back when the Spanish-language 
commentators blared that Mexico was mounting an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the overtime period ended with the score still 1-1, the fans felt 
confident that Mexico, with star goalkeeper Jorge Campos, would prevail in the 
penalty-kick shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Campos came through with a brilliant save. But Mexico failed to 
score, and Campos eventually faltered. In Oxnard, some fans were disgusted. 
Others were more accepting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way the game goes sometimes," Ruiz said philosophically. "It's a 
beautiful game, regardless. I hope I'm around for a few more."

VCNB CONSIDERS MERGER; WILL SELL SUBSIDIARY BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, financially strapped by the recession and 
under the gun from federal regulators to improve its performance by Sept. 30, 
is considering a merger with another financial institution, the bank's 
president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cupp, VCNB president and chief executive officer, said the bank has 
had "very preliminary discussions" about a merger but declined to say which 
financial institutions were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp also said the bank has come to an agreement to sell an Orange County 
subsidiary, Frontier Bank, to Palos Verdes-based Peninsula National Bank for $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to use the proceeds of the sale of Frontier Bank to add to our 
capital account," Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard-based bank is trying to meet capital requirements established last 
year by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency following its 
investigation of VCNB's management and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cupp said federal regulators did not demand the sale of Frontier, he 
said it was necessary to meet their Sept. 30 deadline for the bank to boost its 
capital or face possible civil penalties and removal of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely think this will satisfy their requirements," Cupp said. "This 
is an important deadline and that is why we've been moving very aggressively to 
do all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale to Peninsula is completed, VCNB would be left with total assets of 
about $200 million, Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding on to the Orange County subsidiary, which has branches in Wilmington 
and La Palma, does not suit the bank's long-term strategy of refocusing on 
Ventura County, Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said pressure from federal regulators was not forcing discussions of a 
possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a publicly held company, we always look for opportunities to maximize the 
value of our shareholders' interests," Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling Frontier is simply the latest step in a lengthy process of recovery 
for the bank, which also has included reducing overhead, eliminating 
unprofitable operations -- including part of the mortgage banking department -- 
and selling off a large number of non-performing loans in May, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid Nagle, an analyst at SNL Securities, a banking research firm in 
Charlottesville, Va., said VCNB has "two big strikes against it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first is being in the depressed market of Southern California," he said. 
"The second is having substantial exposure in risky real estate loans, many of 
which have moved into non-performing categories." 
</P>
<P>
 That VCNB would simultaneously be negotiating a possible merger and selling 
off a subsidiary is not surprising, Nagle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a company that has basically a couple of options: either hunker down 
and try to survive," he said, "or consider a sale of the company, assuming they 
could find a buyer who was comfortable with their financial situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at both options is wise, Nagle said, adding: "You can never bank on 
any sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Likely candidates for a merger with VCNB would be financial institutions that 
are already well established in Southern California and looking to expand their 
franchises, he said.

PROPERTY TAX BREAKS IN STORE DUE TO WEAK MARKET; REAL ESTATE: DESPITE AN 
INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL SALES, VALUES ROSE ONLY 1.48% COUNTYWIDE DURING THE 
MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 54,000 Ventura County homeowners and businesses will receive tax 
breaks this year as real estate property values continue to drag in a slowly 
recovering economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an increase in residential sales, property values countywide rose only 
1.48%, the smallest increase since the Proposition 13 tax rollback of 1978, 
county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 New construction and sales of older residences accounted for the minimal gain 
the market posted in the fiscal year that ended June 30, Chief Deputy Assessor 
Daryl R. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many neighborhoods, where property sales have brought disappointingly 
low prices, the county is reducing values and, with them, tax bills. Owners 
should receive notices next week if their property assessments have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reduced better than a quarter of the houses in the county," Brown 
said. "We're not being slouches. We're looking everywhere we can." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's reductions come in spite of an increase in real estate 
transactions around the region. In the first three months of 1994, the county's 
housing sales were up 54% from the same period a year earlier, according to the 
UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly a lot more home sales and turnover of property, but the 
values are dropping," said Mark Schniepp, director of the project. Simply put, 
properties overpriced in the 1980s are selling for less than their assessed 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 County budget planners say they were expecting no increase when assessors 
closed the tax roll for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just hoping it would be an increase, that it would be over zero," 
said Bert Bigler, the county's budget director. "It's just one more problem the 
board has to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a reliable source of local funding, property tax revenues have stagnated 
or dropped in California's recent recession. Compounding the problem, the state 
began taking the revenue from local governments and giving it to school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves counties, including Ventura County, scrambling to find funds to 
pay for human services and criminal justice agencies. In its proposed budget, 
to be released today, the county must reconcile a $16-million deficit, plus $10 
million in state cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problems began for the county in 1978, when Proposition 13 forced 
communities to roll back property tax values to their 1975-1976 levels. After 
that, property assessments could only be increased when the real estate changed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, a building boom and a prosperous economy meant continued growth for 
Ventura County's tax base. The value of property climbed 17.1% in the 1981-1982 
fiscal year and 13.5% in 1990-1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But job losses in defense and manufacturing industries stalled the county's 
economy, and its real estate market stagnated. Economists predict some growth 
in the year ahead, but say the county must deal with a net loss of 6,600 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of assessment rolls show the biggest drops in property value occurred 
around Santa Paula and Ventura. In both cases, the assessors registered 
declines in the mineral values on some property, as stores of natural resources 
have been steadily depleted, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 All cities except Camarillo saw slight increases. Port Hueneme experienced a 
6% jump, largely because property once exempted from taxes is now back on the 
tax rolls. Also, the Cuyama Joint Union region, in the mountainous northwestern 
portion of the county, saw a 14% jump in value, largely due to new 
construction. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County assessor's office Monday will mail notices to every 
homeowner and business whose property has declined in value. The "temporary 
value reduction" also applies to many properties reduced in past years. 
Property owners dissatisfied with their assessment can complain to the 
Assessment Appeals Board. Contact the county clerk and recorder, 800 S. 
Victoria Ave., Ventura 93009. Property Values Although assessments went down 
for many homes, the total assessed value of property went up in most Ventura 
County cities thanks to construction and other factors. 02,15,10 City % change

RUSSO GUILTY OF FELONY CHILD ABUSE IN PLEA AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, the affluent Westlake mother accused of locking her teen-age 
daughter in a back-yard racquetball court, pleaded guilty to felony child abuse 
Tuesday after a judge promised she would spend no more than six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement, which came after a jury deadlocked 11 to 1 last month for 
conviction on the felony, was criticized by the 16-year-old victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she should get more. That's not even a year," the girl said outside 
court. "I was in the racquetball court for two whole years. She's not going to 
know what it's like at all. It is not going to be drilled into that thick skull 
of hers." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo appeared nervous as she entered her guilty plea before Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you plead to inflicting corporal injury on a child?" Campbell asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guilty," the 50-year-old Russo replied softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing was set for Aug. 2, after probation officials complete a background 
report on Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in light blue slacks and a thin white jacket, Russo maintained a stern 
demeanor throughout the hearing and left the Hall of Justice without talking to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But before her plea, as she headed into Campbell's third-floor courtroom, 
Russo made an obscene gesture at a Times photographer. Last month, after the 
jury convicted her on a misdemeanor child abuse charge, Russo hit the 
photographer with her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, James M. Farley, said he was disappointed by the resolution of 
the 13-month case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to see it end this way, I really am, because I don't think she 
committed a felony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the jury deadlocked last month, prosecutors said they would seek a 
second trial unless Russo pleaded guilty to a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office did not challenge the judge's promise not to 
sentence Russo to prison. She could have faced up to six years on the felony 
conviction. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said it was unlikely that any 
judge would have sent Russo to prison, given her lack of a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that the case is resolving, and I think it is resolving on a 
positive note for the victim," Corona said. She disputed the victim's 
contention that Russo was receiving light treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people in custody who could do 180 days standing on their 
head," Corona said. "It's nothing big for them. It's a big deal for Mrs. 
Russo." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Farley said he would recommend that any jail sentence meted 
out to Russo be served in the county's work-furlough program rather than County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Russo has accepted a clerical position with a Westlake real estate 
firm. Being employed is a condition of acceptance into the work-furlough 
program, Farley said. Participants in the program spend nights at a county 
facility but are allowed to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo and her stockbroker husband, Richard, were arrested May 24, 1993, and 
charged with child abuse after neighbors reported seeing Charlotte Russo attack 
the girl, then 15, in the garage of the family's nine-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified about years of suffering at the hands of her mother, who 
she said handled much of the discipline in the household while her father 
logged long hours at work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven-week trial, the girl testified for five days -- saying her 
mother had punched, pinched, scratched, bit and forced her to sleep for long 
periods of time in the racquetball court. On many days her diet consisted of 
oatmeal and raw eggs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo also took the stand, denying her daughter's accusations. The mother 
described the girl as a problem child who lied, stole and refused to follow 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said her husband ordered the girl to sleep in the $75,000 racquetball 
court as punishment for violating her no-sodium diet. But Russo said the girl 
slept there only for a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 The case seemed to turn, however, when several neighbors recounted seeing 
Russo beat the victim. One neighbor said she was standing on her balcony behind 
the Russo home several years ago when she saw Charlotte Russo pounding the girl 
in the head with a gym shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo, 49, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse last November and 
served a 30-day jail term in work furlough, officials said. He was also placed 
on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first interview since her testimony, the girl -- adopted when she was a 
year old -- criticized the plea agreement but also said she might consider 
reunification with her family eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, now living in foster care in Moorpark, said she was happy that a 
second trial will not be necessary, but added that her mother does not seem to 
be remorseful. Rather, she said, her mother appears to have pleaded guilty 
because she felt backed into a corner by the district attorney's insistence 
that she plead to a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems as though she didn't have a choice, unless she wants to go to jail 
for three years," the girl said, referring to a possible state prison term. "In 
a way, she admits it but she still hasn't said, 'I'm sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the short interview, which was conducted under the supervision of the 
girl's foster mother, the teen-ager appeared to be in a good mood, often joking 
about her mother's case and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Told that Russo, a registered nurse, was preparing for a job in real estate, 
the girl said, "I hope she's not going to sell racquetball courts."

<P>
 As for reunification with her family -- which includes six other children, one 
who is younger and also adopted, and five who are grown -- the girl said: "Not 
right now. Maybe in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that all her brothers and sisters testified for her mother and said 
they gave her "dirty looks" when she came to court to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew what went on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today marks her first full year with her foster mother, who is married and has 
two children, ages 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like each other," the girl said. "I get along with her family." 
</P>
<P>
 The foster mother, a homemaker and independent nutritional-product 
distributor, said the trial was hard on the girl. "It was very rough on her, 
very rough on her, as you can imagine. Her whole life changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who had not been in public school full time since her mother took 
her out for home schooling several years ago, is scheduled to begin her senior 
year at Moorpark High School in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, things are looking up," the girl said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BOY, WOMAN HELD AT GUNPOINT; 1 ARRESTED

 A 26-year-old Port Hueneme man enraged over a breakup with his girlfriend was 
arrested early Tuesday after he held a Ventura woman and her 15-year-old 
neighbor at gunpoint for more than half an hour during a five-hour ordeal that 
brought out the Ventura SWAT team, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Micheal Allen Berry was being held at Ventura County Jail on $10,000 bail 
Tuesday. The woman held hostage, Kellie Rangel, 24, and the teen-age boy 
escaped unharmed, police said. Berry's former girlfriend, Judy Dixson, 39, hid 
in the bathroom and was also unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really delusional. . . . I was shaking," Rangel said Tuesday 
afternoon, adding that Berry had said he had spoken to and seen the devil in 
recent days. "He had the gun pressed against my cheek. He was acting almost 
schizophrenic." 
</P>
<P>
 The escapade began around midnight when Berry entered a house in the 300 block 
of Garfield Rondo in northeast Ventura and demanded to see Dixson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel said she persuaded Berry to leave her alone and called police when 
Berry left her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berry then grabbed the 15-year-old and held a sawed-off shotgun to the 
boy's head and a 15-inch butcher knife to his throat, saying he would kill him 
unless the boy left the house, Ventura Police Officer Jack Richards said. But 
he kept the gun and knife on the boy, Richards said, preventing him from 
walking away. 
</P>
<P>
 As police arrived about 12:40 a.m., Berry retreated to another bedroom and 
locked himself in, pulled out the phone line and boarded up windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Rangel said, she and the 15-year-old escaped out the front door 
and, later, Dixson also left the house. 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT team members coaxed Berry from the house about 5 a.m., Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, 
threatening with a handgun and holding people against their will, Richards 
said. JASON GRANT

 A 28-year-old Oxnard man was listed in serious condition at an Oxnard hospital 
Tuesday with three gunshots to the head, chest and stomach after a skirmish 
with an unknown number of assailants, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Martinez was wounded late Monday night after he and two friends were in a 
fistfight that ended in gunshots, said Sgt. Charles Dunham of the Oxnard Police 
Department.Police said they had no suspects and were still searching for a 
cause for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're examining everything -- all possibilities," Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police found Martinez lying bloody in the street in the 500 block of 
North Bonita Avenue soon after police dispatch received a 911 call at about 11 
p.m. Monday, Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency medical personnel treated Martinez at the scene and then transported 
him to St. John's Regional Medical Center, Dunham said. JASON GRANT

 A 30-year-old Ventura woman is scheduled to be arraigned today after she was 
arrested on suspicion of trying to kidnap a 2-year-old boy from his mother's 
side at a crowded holiday street fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Young was being held at Ventura County Jail on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police said Young allegedly tried to take William Goins at about 4:25 
p.m. at Oak and Santa Clara streets in downtown Ventura on Monday. The toddler 
was walking next to his mother at the Ventura Street Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman took the kid by the hand and walked off, and Mom didn't like it 
too much," Sgt. Ted Prell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristy Goins, 22, of Hollywood, ran after Young and dragged her to the ground 
by her hair, Prell said. Young reportedly growled at her and then walked away, 
Prell said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, Goins' sister, Amy, who witnessed the earlier incident, 
saw Young at the corner of Palm and Main streets. She hailed a police officer 
nearby, who arrested Young, Prell said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LANDFILL SEEKS TO BUY POLLUTION CREDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The agency operating the Bailard Landfill near Oxnard will ask its directors 
Thursday to approve the purchase of $63,455 in pollution credits from Unocal so 
that the landfill can stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill managers must secure the credits to comply with a permit allowing 
them to continue operating the dump until May 30, 1997, Imelda Cragin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal in Fillmore offered the best price for pollution credits out of 11 
companies surveyed, said Cragin, environmental manager for the Ventura Regional 
Sanitation District, the landfill's operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations such as the sanitation district must buy pollution credits when 
they are unable to keep emissions at a level acceptable to the Ventura County 
Air Pollution Control District. Companies gain the credits when they reduce air 
pollution below county standards at their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cragin said the contract will cover the three-year period that Bailard is 
allowed to remain open. "It's a one-time buy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cragin said that despite the need to buy credits, the landfill will not pose a 
threat to nearby farmers or residents of a Roman Catholic convent. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Sister Servants of Mary Convent, on Victoria Avenue across 
the street from the landfill, said he will not protest the contract. Stan Cohen 
said the sisters are scheduled to have a daylong mediation session Friday with 
sanitation district attorneys to settle their complaint about health dangers 
from pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to work out a solution to avoid everybody declaring nuclear war 
and starting litigation," Cohen said. "What the sisters desire is that their 
property be protected from dust and pollutants." KAY SAILLANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA; SPOTLIGHT ON SILENT FILMS AT PARAMOUNT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's about to be very quiet at Paramount Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service and the Silent Society of Hollywood Heritage are 
teaming up for the sixth year to present "Silents Under the Stars," two nights 
of silent films in the rustic Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The program raises money for park service programs and Hollywood Heritage, 
which promotes appreciation of historic Hollywood films and locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by live music, "The Night Cry" (1926) and "Manhandled" (1924) will 
be shown at the ranch's pavilion, an open-sided building built by Paramount 
Studios to house props in the late 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch was the setting of countless Paramount Westerns during the 1930s and 
1940s, as well as films such as "The Adventures of Marco Polo" and "The 
Adventures of Tom Sawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 After Paramount sold the property in the late 1940s, it changed hands several 
times, but in 1981, 300 acres of the ranch were acquired by the park service.  
</P>
<P>
 The site is used for concerts, festivals and picnics, but parts of it still 
serve as a Western set for television, film and music video productions.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Night Cry" will be shown at 8 p.m. July 17, and "Manhandled" will be 
shown at 7:30 p.m. Aug. 21. Both will be accompanied by short subjects. The 
cost of each is $5 for members of Hollywood Heritage and $6 for non-members.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; FIREWORKS SALES AID NONPROFIT GROUPS'

 Lava Cones, White Smoke Balls and Solar Flares that sold so briskly in the 
week preceding the Fourth of July were being boxed up Tuesday, taped closed and 
stored for the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore volunteers, who worked almost around the clock during the seven days 
leading up to July 4 to raise money for local nonprofit groups, spent Tuesday 
clearing out the 21 temporary booths that had lined California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was only our second year doing it, but we made about 20% more (money) 
than we did last time," said Chris Villegas, cleaning the booth sponsored by 
the Fillmore High School Grad Nite Live program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We raised about $6,000 -- well over half of what we needed," Villegas said. 
"So that's really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas said Grad Nite Live raises about $12,000 a year to fund an alcohol- 
and drug-free graduation night harbor cruise for Fillmore High seniors every 
June. But without the fireworks sales, the group could never afford such an 
expensive party, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the highway from Villegas, Anna Hipple and Barbara Harm were busy 
closing up their shop, which they said netted more than $10,000 for the Citrus 
Valley Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about getting a new copy machine for the church," Hipple 
said, looking over a shelf of leftover fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 After volunteering as many as 15 hours a day inside the plywood fireworks 
booth, Harm would sleep inside a nearby camper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great getting to see the people," Harm said. "It's kind of where the 
community all comes together." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Faith, who organized the booth for the Fillmore Little League, said he 
dressed up his stand with holiday decorations and played patriotic music to 
attract fireworks buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the flags out, it was colorful and we heard a lot of positive 
(comments)," Faith said. "We exceeded our expectations and made about 10% more 
than we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The only city in Ventura County to allow fireworks sales, Fillmore generated 
tens of thousands of dollars for its local nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thrilled to be a part of it, and that we can put our kids through 
another year of organized sports activity," Faith said. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 The Ventura County Grand Jury on Tuesday indicted a physician on seven counts 
of false personation, accusing Dr. Reynaldo Fong of ordering thousands of 
magazine subscriptions in the name of a Camarillo attorney against whom he held 
a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a weird case," Deputy Dist. Atty.Richard Simon said. "It's the first 
time I've ever seen this charge. He sent her everything from Civil War 
magazines to . . . sports magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said Fong, 44, became angry at Theresa McConville about 10 years ago 
because she worked at a law firm that reported him to the state Board of 
Medical Quality Assurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong had been fired from Santa Paula Hospital for double billing insurance 
companies, Simon said, and in retaliation referred medical malpractice suits 
from the hospital to various law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 McConville's law firm refused to take Fong's cases and reported him to the 
state agency, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had some contact with her, and for some reason, he fixated on her," said 
Simon, adding that Fong has also sent magazines to several doctors and 
administrators at Santa Paula Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 McConville, who received more than 5,000 unwanted magazines in 10 years, 
contacted the magazines and got information about others who were also 
receiving publications sent by Fong, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 McConville contacted the other victims and "they figured out the only 
connection was Santa Paula Hospital," Simon said. After she reviewed her old 
cases, she found a note in Fong's handwriting, which matched the handwriting on 
a false subscription notice she obtained from a magazine, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 22. He is in Salinas, out of custody on 
$5,000 bail. McConville could not be reached for comment Tuesday. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Developers wanting to build housing or commercial buildings in Ventura are 
scheduled to present their plans today in the first of a series of meetings to 
determine which projects will receive priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The city can award up to 1,018 housing allocations through 1999, but 
developers this year alone are asking to build 3,000 units. Today's meeting 
with the City Council and Planning Commission marks one of the first steps in 
the city's monthlong evaluation of the 12 development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at 4 p.m. at City Hall, developers are expected to approach the dais 
one by one to explain why their proposals should receive approval this year. 
Some are offering money in exchange for houses. Others say they will build golf 
courses, tennis courts, a veterans nursing home or regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council and commission will continue to hold hearings throughout the 
month. The council is scheduled for a final vote on the allocations July 25.

 A 66-year-old Moorpark woman was killed in a traffic collision Tuesday morning 
when she pulled out of her mobile-home park and was struck broadside by a van, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elinor Foster, a resident of the Villa Del Arroyo Mobile Home Park, was struck 
about 6:25 a.m. by an oncoming van driven by Charles McLaughlin, 41, of 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The van was traveling east on Old Los Angeles Avenue toward Simi Valley, 
Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this juncture, it appears that she pulled out in front of the oncoming 
van," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks said that an investigation into the accident is continuing and that 
no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Old Los Angeles Avenue was backed up for three hours as a result of 
the accident, Parks said.  
</P>
<P>
 Parks said Pruner Ambulance and Ventura County Fire Department personnel 
pulled Foster from her car after the accident. She was pronounced dead at 7:30 
a.m. at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin was taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks 
with internal injuries and was in stable condition Tuesday, hospital officials 
said. JASON GRANT

 Using Gospel messages and Christian rock and pop music to entertain and 
convert, Christian evangelist Greg Laurie will present his fifth annual Harvest 
Crusade in the county this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the nondenominational crusade expect 150,000 people to attend

 "We're very excited," said Richard Cathers, an assistant pastor at Calvary

always a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelical crusade begins Friday night at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which includes music by country singer Ricky Skaggs and a 
biblical address by Laurie, the pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in 
Riverside, will end at 9 p.m. The event is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be repeated Saturday and Sunday, also at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each night's sermon, Laurie, 41, will invite participants onto 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can bring their friends to hear the Gospel and some great music," 
Cathers said. "It's good to have the opportunity to see people get saved." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's crusade will include a Kids' Crusade, aimed at children age 5 
through 12. It will be Saturday at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's program will star children's character "Psalty, the Singing 
Songbook," a man who sings biblical hymns while dressed as a large, blue book.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SENIOR CENTER LIKELY TO HIRE COORDINATOR

<P>
 The Moorpark City Council is expected to accept an $8,000 grant from the 
Ventura County Area Agency on Aging to pay for a part-time coordinator at the 
city's senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 The coordinator would help Carol Ghens, director of the center.Ghens, who won 
an award from Gov. Pete Wilson for her work at the 1 1/2-year-old center, said 
she is stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many things I need help with," Ghens said. "We have a lot of 
volunteers, but it just goes beyond what volunteers can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Adams, director of the city's Community Services Department, said 
Ghens is in part a victim of her own success. The center once was seeing about 
50 people, but more than 600 use its services now. And each day new people come 
in, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the only paid staffer at the center," Adams said. "Another employee 
would free her to work on new ideas to make the center even better." SCOTT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 3 FACE ARRAIGNMENT IN TAGGING SPREE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Simi Valley men are scheduled to be arraigned today on felony charges of 
vandalism after police arrested them during a weekend graffiti spree in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged taggers, who were arrested with two others from Southern 
California, were taken into custody about 2 a.m. Sunday after San Francisco 
police responded to a complaint of graffiti, Lt. Daniel Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived on Clay Street, they saw the five in the area and some 
had paint on their hands, Lawson said. At least four buildings had been tagged 
and damages were more than $5,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is unusual because taggers generally target businesses near or in 
their hometowns, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They generally just spray in their own territory," Lawson said. "This is 
somewhat unique in that their artistic license has been extended a few hundred 
miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Kevin Martin, 18; Shawn Buss, 22, and Jesse Rosen, 22, all of 
Simi Valley. Jason Drew, 23, of Northridge and Carter Hogue, 21, of Lake 
Elsinore were also arrested. The five were being held at San Francisco County 
Jail. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAPTURED CONDOR MAY RETURN TO ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California condor that couldn't stay away from civilization was captured and 
is being held in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in Ventura County while biologists 
decide whether the endangered vulture should be returned to the zoo where it 
was hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 The capture on Monday followed the June 24 death of another condor near San 
Marcos Pass in Santa Barbara County.That death occurred after U. S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service biologists found that two of the five condors in the wild were 
landing on back-yard fences and on swimming-pool decks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After biologists tried to spook the birds back to their more remote home in 
the backcountry of Santa Barbara County, one flew into a power line and died of 
a broken pelvis. The second bird flew back to rejoin the other birds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second bird returned to the populated area over the weekend, nearly 
drawing the three other condors in the wild with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists will meet with condor recovery team members Thursday to decide 
whether the male condor should be returned to a zoo, said Marc M. Weitzel, 
condor recovery project leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern is that he would draw the three remaining birds back into 
this urbanized area," Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The death last month of the bird tagged No. 89 marked the fifth condor to die 
in a collision with civilization since the program to reintroduce the 
endangered vultures to the wild began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weitzel said such incidents are an expected part of the recovery program 
and will not interrupt plans to release up to 10 more chicks into Lion Canyon 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long-term program and we have to manage it step by step," he said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY COUNCIL TO DECIDE FATE OF LANDMARK 
TREES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council tonight will decide the fate of two 90-year-old 
landmark pepper trees on High Street that an arborist says are ill and in 
danger of falling. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have determined that the trees, which now have large, rotting 
cavities in their trunks, could collapse and injure a passerby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first major wind, and those trees might come down," said Community 
Services Director Christine Adams.  
</P>
<P>
 Adams said an arborist determined that the trees could not be saved and 
recommended their removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees are designated historic landmarks. The only other historic landmark 
in Moorpark is a former Methodist church on Walnut and Charles Street. The 
trees were planted for shade when the railroad line was laid through town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that they were the only shade between Ventura and the San 
Fernando Valley," said Mary Schwabauer, a former president of the Moorpark 
Historical Society. "Back then it was a pretty stark place, and people would 
stop here for a cold drink and shade on their way to Simi or the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on whether to remove the trees during its regular 7 
p.m. meeting at City Hall. SCOTT HADLY

RV PARK BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been reading a number of articles about the city of Port Hueneme's 
proposed RV park on Hueneme Beach. Also, there seems to be growing discontent 
about the performance of city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 I came across an Economic Profile in the Los Angeles Times that seems to 
possibly bear out some of Hueneme's citizens' beliefs: 
</P>
<P>
 The following are some of the statistics provided in this article: 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year in Ventura County, Camarillo had the lowest population growth 
at 1.1%, with Santa Paula having the highest rate at 3.4%. Hueneme had 2.9% 
growth. Keeping in mind the median home prices in the period of January and 
February, 1994, had Camarillo enjoying the largest value of increase by 20.3% 
versus Port Hueneme having the largest loss of value, dropping 19.8% in the 
same time period. The housing vacancy rate was the highest in Port Hueneme in 
that same period at 10.3%, while Simi Valley enjoyed the lowest at 3.1%. In the 
critical tax base area of retail sales, Port Hueneme was down 6.7% from one 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Our city manager and council should look at these performance profiles as a 
pretty dismal record. No wonder they want residents to pay special taxes for 
police, park, beach, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Come Nov. 7, throw the bums out. 
</P>
<P>
 EDWARD B. BORDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I give credit for the upgrading and revitalization of Port Hueneme to the 
people who paid top dollar for their primary or secondary homes in this 
now-beautiful beach area and who have continued to maintain and make quality 
improvements to their homes as well as to the public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 These same people are paying large property taxes, probably more than the 
average Port Hueneme homeowner who is not in the so-called "beach area." These 
beach residents are also paying their share or more of the other taxes 
(schools, Fire Department, police and sales). This in turn has fed the local 
economy and helped build the lovely parks and the eye-appealing municipal and 
commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 It now appears that Dick Velthoen has decided that he wants an RV park on the 
beach whether or not the citizens of Port Hueneme agree with him. We think that 
it is time for our city manager to either listen to us owners and residents or 
move on to some other city willing to pay him the obscenely inflated salary and 
perks that he now gets from Port Hueneme amounting to almost $200,000 per year.

SAFETY CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When will the politicians in government realize that public safety is the 
public's first priority? 
</P>
<P>
 They told us that if we agreed to tax ourselves last November, every penny 
would go to public safety.Earlier this year, they promised to restore past 
budget cuts in the criminal justice agencies. Now, however, they are proposing 
to once again reduce the levels of public safety in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians will say, of course, that "circumstances have changed" and, as 
usual, they will blame someone else for the problem. Meanwhile, they will use 
Proposition 172 tax money to pay the salaries of do-nothing bureaucrats rather 
than following the will of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents taught me when I was young that if you made a promise, you kept it. 
I hope that politicians who run our county government learned the same lesson. 
We who pay taxes and who voted for Proposition 172 ask that they keep their 
promise and give us a safe community to love and raise our families. If they 
must cut the county budget, cut bureaucrats -- not sheriff, police and 
prosecutors.

FASHION PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am annoyed by the vast amount of time, energy and resources being used to 
govern clothing choices for students. For example, safety meetings being used 
to create Fashion Patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Patrols should not be running our schools. Professional educators, 
staff and administrators should not be spending their time measuring waistlines 
and hemlines and verifying if every belt made it through every loop. Fashion 
Patrols send the message that what you wear is more important than what you say 
or do. 
</P>
<P>
 One junior high administrator contends that school is a place of business. An 
elementary principal argues that uniforms will improve concentration in class, 
study habits and attendance. These statements suggest that changing clothes 
will solve the problems facing the children at our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are not a place of business. Businesses are created for the purpose of 
generating profits. Their bottom line is the amount of money earned. On the 
other hand, schools are a place to learn. Learning is a process that is 
reflected on paper, by words, actions and deeds. Students should come dressed 
with an attitude to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the clothes someone chooses to wear, each individual is the same 
person inside. It is the person who matters. It is the student who matters. 
</P>
<P>
 School board trustees should make a decision regarding school district dress 
code policies. Do they want one strict districtwide dress code? Or do they want 
to leave the current general policy intact and let each school site establish 
its own standard, even if it includes uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
 They should make a decision so that more time, energy and resources can be 
redirected toward making real changes. Let's address the real problems, such as 
acts of violence, harassment, pushing and shoving, name-calling, vandalism, 
intolerance, ignorance and prejudices, that confront students and adults in 
their daily lives.

IMMIGRANT REALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly's comments in the June 24 Letters to the Editor section 
demonstrate once again just how out of touch he is with the realities of 
undocumented immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims that immigration "has indeed become a game to the thousands who 
illegally enter this country every day," adding that getting caught is only "a 
momentary hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly also claims that the immigrants put up with this mere "inconvenience" 
in order to obtain social benefits. The fact is that people come here not for 
welfare but for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has actually talked to an immigrant family knows only too well what 
hardship and risk are endured in a border crossing and how terrified immigrants 
are of apprehension and its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 More like a game, or a scam, is Gallegly's effort to follow in Gov. Pete 
Wilson's footsteps, score a political touchdown and enhance his career by 
finding an ethnic scapegoat for our problems. Talk about looking for a 
convenient and opportunistic solution.

MOORPARK MAY PROTECT HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE WITH TAX TRADE-OFF; PRESERVATION: 
SOME RESIDENTS WONDER WHAT EDIFICES IN THE FORMER 'APRICOT CAPITAL' ARE WORTHY 
OF THE STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council is considering a law to protect buildings of 
historical importance. But even Moorpark residents are asking just what there 
is around their small city that would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a dearth of buildings of historical significance in the town," said 
Mary Leavens Schwabauer, a former president of the Moorpark Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only two things qualified for landmark designation by the county -- the old 
Methodist Church on Charles and Walnut, and the pepper trees on High Street," 
she added. "The only other buildings that would have qualified the owners 
didn't care to have themselves in the program. There really isn't much else."  
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance being considered at a meeting tonight would give the owners 
of historic buildings tax breaks. In exchange, the owners would not be allowed 
to modify the exterior of their buildings without a city permit.  
</P>
<P>
 While the city has been incorporated only since 1983, the community has rich 
history that dates back over 100 years. Schwabauer said that before the turn of 
the century the town was a railroad watering station. And later it became a hub 
of agricultural activity. Moorpark got its name from a particularly tasty 
apricot, and for a number of years called itself the Apricot Capital of the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has lost most of the early structures that held that part of its 
past, said Pat Havens, a member of the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board, 
which designates buildings of historical value throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that something in the area hasn't been identified that could 
call attention to that heritage," Havens said. "We owe it to our children to 
find some of that history and protect it."  
</P>
<P>
 There is not any one building that the city has its eye on protecting with 
this ordinance, said Jim Aguilera, director of the Community Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing this because we want to protect anything in particular," 
Aguilera said. "We're doing this because there may be a need for it in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the local historical society have discussed putting the old wooden 
boardwalk and Whitaker's Hardware store on High Street on a list for 
preservation. But Havens said that when the Cultural Heritage Board asked the 
Whitaker family to apply, they turned down the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were concerned about the limitations for what we could do with our 
own building," said Will Whitaker, who helps run the 75-year-old family 
business. "I don't really know what makes our building that historically 
important, anyway. I could think of a lot of homes that deserve more 
protection."  
</P>
<P>
 In designating a historical landmark, the city will look not only at the 
architecture of the building but its importance to the community. Havens said 
there may be several other buildings in Moorpark that could qualify for 
protection. But without a detailed survey of the town she was hard-pressed to 
mention any other potential landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a rich history there," Havens said. "They've lost a lot 
and there are fewer of the old-time families left. But at least they're trying 
to get something going."

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA BOX OFFICE OPENS TO BRAVOS; THOUSAND OAKS: FOLLOWING 
RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY, OFFICIALS AND CIVILIANS ALIKE LINE UP FOR TICKETS AT 
TEMPORARY FACILITY IN THE OAKS MALL. 
</P>

<P>
 The hottest tickets in Thousand Oaks were on sale at The Oaks mall Tuesday 
morning, as about 50 people lined up to reserve seats for events at the 
soon-to-be-completed Civic Arts Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 At a ribbon-cutting ceremony, city officials opened the Civic Arts Plaza box 
office in the mall and then scurried to find places in line before the more 
popular shows sold out.  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents waited three hours before reaching the new ticket counter 
because of the ceremony, but all said they were happy to be able to see theater 
events come to their city.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to this for months," said Geraldine Sanders, who 
arrived at the mall at 8 a.m. to be the first in line for tickets. "This is 
going to be the jewel of the community, and I want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowds gathered in front of the storefront box office, members of the 
city staff, the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Civic Theaters 
Commission joined Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore, who cut the ribbon opening 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of a new experience for the residents of our city and 
adjacent cities," Fiore said. "Let the games begin." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he had already pinpointed seats he wants for upcoming 
performances, but he, like everyone else, had to stand in line before ordering 
his tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for me, and for all these people, this is really a great experience," 
Fiore said. "Here we are, able to buy tickets right here in our own community 
for shows that will take place right here, not in L.A. or Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mall box office will be open until September, when it will be replaced by 
the box office at the arts plaza itself. The public premiere will be "Man of La 
Mancha" on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said he was buying tickets for magician David Copperfield's performance 
in December. But the box office has seats available for 13 shows, including 
"Mark Twain Tonight," "The Nutcracker" and a performance of the musical "Little 
Shop of Horrors," which will come to the theater next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets range in price from $5 to $45, depending on the show and the location 
of the seats. Most seats are between $18 and $35. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the arts center is on schedule, officials said. On Tuesday 
workers attached rigging to one face of the building, which will hold a curtain 
made of copper. 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain is expected to be attached to the building in pieces over the next 
three weeks, said Ed Johnduff, the Civic Arts Plaza project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller Forum Theatre will be completed in August and opened in September, 
and the larger Civic Auditorium is expected to be finished in October, Johnduff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we've started selling tickets, we know we've got to deliver on the 
building," he said. "At this point, it looks like we're right on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said that the fact that the building is on schedule and under budget "is 
an impressive feat for this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who waited for tickets agreed, though some were concerned about the look 
of the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to have seen it not so tall, so that it blocks some of the views of 
the city," said Walter Bradley, a Camarillo resident. "But you can't have your 
cake and eat it too. And we're real happy they've finally put a theater in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Davis, chairwoman of the city Civic Theaters Commission, said the box 
office opening represented the end of a long process and the beginning of a new 
chapter in Thousand Oaks history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really completes the city," she said. "We have a house for the seniors, 
we have a house for the teen-agers, we have a library and now we have a house 
for the arts." (East Ventura County Edition) FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza box office is selling tickets for Civic Arts Plaza 
performances. Tickets can also be purchased at any Ticketmaster location. The 
arts plaza box office is located on the first floor of The Oaks mall. It is 
open Mondays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; 
and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call 449-ARTS.

MEMORIAL SERVICES FOR FRANK SCIAROTTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memorial services are planned tonight for Frank Sciarotta, a longtime 
Saddleback College professor and administrator who died of cancer Friday. He 
was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciarotta, who retired in 1991 after 23 years of teaching, died at his Laguna 
Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who knew Mr. Sciarotta were always impressed with his intelligence, 
dedication and high energy," Robert A. Lombardi, the district's chancellor, 
said in a memo to faculty and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciarotta, who was originally from Stuebenville, Ohio, joined the district in 
1968 as a member of the charter faculty. In addition to teaching biology at 
Saddleback College, he chaired the college's mathematics, science and 
engineering division as well as serving as associate dean of instruction and 
continuing education. He also served as dean of administration services for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciarotta is survived by his wife, Ann; two sons Greg of Mission Viejo and 
Mike of Kansas; a daughter, Amy Worthington of Mission Viejo; and nine 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services begin at 7 p.m. at Mission Viejo Christian Church.

INTERIM CITY MANAGER PLANS SHORT, SWEET TENURE; VENTURA: DICK THOMAS HELPED 
REVITALIZE SANTA BARBARA. THE RETIRED EXECUTIVE WILL HOLD THE REINS UNTIL A 
REPLACEMENT FOR JOHN BAKER IS FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Thomas, Ventura's new interim city manager, figures he won't have much 
time for his leisure reading anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rose garden that he has so carefully tended since he retired as chief 
administrator of Santa Barbara last spring -- well, it will just have to wait 
for the weekends now. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 63, will hit the road at 7 a.m. today in his beige Oldsmobile Firenze 
and drive south for 30 minutes from his home in Santa Barbara, to assume his 
duties as Ventura's top manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ideal arrangement," Thomas said in a phone interview Tuesday. 
"It's about as convenient as you get. There are similarities to Santa Barbara. 
Plus, I've been close enough to have some feel for what's been going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas will fill the vacancy left by former City Manager John Baker, who 
resigned two weeks ago after serving 12 years. Baker plans to start his own 
consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
 The council hired Thomas two weeks ago to manage the city while it continues 
to look for a permanent replacement for Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas certainly cherishes no grand plans for change in Ventura, especially 
since he hopes he will only be needed for three or four months.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strictly an interim," Thomas said, adding that he is thoroughly enjoying 
his retirement after 36 years managing cities in Kansas, Colorado, Montana -- 
and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas comes to Ventura with rave references from Santa Barbara, where he 
oversaw that city's revitalization efforts. Longtime Santa Barbara council 
members say he provided a positive, nurturing atmosphere for staff at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Steve Bennett said Thomas' experience was precisely the 
reason he supported his selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that stood out to me is that he's very experienced as a city 
manager, and in a city similar to Ventura," he said. "I wanted somebody who was 
going to make sure we were not going to get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he landed the interim position last month, Thomas said, he's had to 
leave his pleasure reading aside to wade through thick Ventura City Council 
agendas and other bureaucratic tomes issued by city staff.  
</P>
<P>
 The new interim manager, however, has not yet attended a council meeting or 
staff conference, so today should be an abrupt introduction. His schedule 
includes: a council economics committee meeting at 8:30 a.m., sessions with key 
staff the rest of the morning, a 1:30 p.m. council Environment Committee 
meeting and a 4 p.m. joint meeting of the council and the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just jump into the pool and see how wet I get," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he planned his retirement last year, Thomas said, he had hoped to 
return to the city administration business on an intermittent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole 36 years (of my career) have been exciting," he said. "You can't 
help but look back on all those exciting times and hope you'll have some of 
that again."

CONEJO SCHOOL TRUSTEE WILLIAM HENRY RESIGNS; EDUCATION: FORMER CORPORATE LEADER 
IS REMEMBERED FOR BRINGING A BUSINESS-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVE TO THE BOARD'S 
ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine-year school Trustee William H. Henry Jr. has resigned after moving to a 
new residence in Oxnard last week, the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired corporate executive, Henry had told colleagues last month that he 
was planning to resign because he and his wife, Fran, had purchased a home near 
Channel Islands Harbor. His resignation was effective last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll miss him. He was a very stable force," Trustee Dorothy L. Beaubien 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The outspoken and fact-oriented Henry had emphasized student performance and 
prided himself for approaching education as a business. He twice served as 
board president. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the community," Henry wrote in 
his resignation letter. "We have made measurable progress on virtually every 
front, even in the face of seriously declining budgets. . . . We can take pride 
in our accomplishments and in our district." 
</P>
<P>
 By resigning just four months before the November election, Henry left 
district officials unsure about whether to leave his seat vacant until then, 
fill it by appointment or hold a special election. His seat is one of three 
trustee positions on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jerry C. Gross said he has discussed the situation with the Ventura 
County counsel's office. "I've asked them to clarify whether we have to have an 
election or appoint someone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Counsel Tony Waters said he hopes to have an answer in a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview Tuesday, Henry said he had planned to move to the harbor 
area after his retirement from Lockheed Corp. earlier this year but had hoped 
to hold off until the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ran for my second term in 1989, the expectation was I would retire in 
1994 and move to the shore shortly thereafter," said the 67-year-old Henry. 
"Then they extended our term. It added a year that I hadn't expected." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Henry found a repossessed home near the harbor, he knew the sale 
would not wait until November. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on nearly nine years in the Conejo Valley district, Henry said he 
tried to be a stabilizing force. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came, it was a bickering board," he said. "I think it is no longer a 
bickering board." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien said Henry was a business-oriented counterpoint to other board 
members, who are mostly educators. "He was concerned with it as a businessman," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry believed strongly that the five-member board should set policy, leaving 
the smaller decisions to paid staff members, Beaubien said. And he was known 
for forthright comments during board meetings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sometimes he said things that the rest of us didn't say, that we 
perhaps thought we couldn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the district began writing a new list of long-term goals several months 
ago, Henry argued that the goals should be easily measurable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept us oftentimes on the straight and narrow," Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the SAT scores of students was another of Henry's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did want accountability and he did want measurement," said board member 
Mildred Lynch, whose back-to-basics approach to education was shared by Henry.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIRS; PARENTS' EYE-OPENING LESSON TRANSCENDS ITS GAY CONTEXT; 
THE FAMILY HEART / A MEMOIR OF WHEN OUR SON CAME OUT BY ROBB FORMAN DEW ; 
ADDISON-WESLEY$22, 256 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Family Heart" is a curious but remarkable memoir, a pearly accumulation of 
sweet memories and bright insights wrapped around a hard pebble of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Robb Forman Dew is a novelist, and she makes good use of her eye for 
detail in evoking the day when her college-age son, Steve, made a shocking 
announcement. She describes the smell of lilacs in bloom, the "CBS Evening 
News" on the set in the next room, the crossword puzzle she is working, at the 
very moment when Steve entered the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been something I've been meaning to tell you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we already know from the subtitle of Dew's book what Steve has to 
say to his parents, but the moment of revelation -- indeed, the whole premise 
of Dew's book -- is somehow ominous and unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of us had the feeling that somehow Steve was slipping away from us, as 
though he were being swept off by a strong current," she writes of herself and 
her husband, Charles, "and we wanted desperately to catch hold of him and pull 
him back to shore." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Steve's parents are models of good manners and supportive rhetoric, 
but Dew now recognizes the "paralysis of politeness" and, indeed, the unspoken 
cruelty in their response. "We love you, Steve," are his father's first words. 
"Nothing could ever change that." But Dew helps us understand that their 
expression of love for their son in spite of his being gay is a kind of insult. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Dew sees Steve's sexual identity as her failure. She grieves for her 
son, alive and healthy and present, "very much as if someone had died." She 
recalls the comforting moments of Steve's childhood, the days when they were 
"safe as houses," but now she feels as if they have become "a counterfeit 
family." She wonders if her son is a pedophile, and she worries that he will 
become a victim of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, she asks herself the inevitable question, the hardest 
question: "Was there something Charles and I had done or not done as parents 
that might have caused Steve to choose his sexual orientation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Dew sees how wrongheaded the question really is, how insulting, 
how pointless. "Sexuality is only one facet of personality," she writes. 
"Sexuality, is in fact, as intricate, essential and unique as fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the book, Dew writes, she and her husband have come "out of our 
own closet." They have become activists in their own right: "The idea of 
keeping silent," she observes, "is inevitably transmogrified into an emotion 
akin to shame." And out of Dew's insistent self-scrutiny comes a definition of 
family values that is real and practical, and yet deeply compassionate and full 
of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "A family is a complicated beast," she concludes. "Its definition is as 
elusive, really, as that of love, or joy, or pornography -- we can't define it, 
but we know it when we see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dew is a mother who has come to understand what every parent must learn about 
his or her adult children: We cannot live their lives for them, we cannot bear 
their pain, we cannot shelter them from a sometimes dangerous world -- we can 
only seek to find out who they are, and to find a way to make some loving 
connection with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dew's book reminded me of Dan Butler's one-man show, "The Only Thing Worse You 
Could Have Told Me," a play that shows us, among other things, how Butler's 
father reacted when he came out. On the night I saw the show, the sold-out 
house was sprinkled with middle-aged and elderly folks whose sons and daughters 
and grandchildren, I imagine, had brought them to the theater to open their 
eyes to what it means to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family Heart" is the same eye-opening experience as seen from a different 
point of view, and it's a book that either a straight parent or a gay child 
might give to one another as way of delivering a consciousness-raising message. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Family Heart" does not speak only to families where sexual identity is a 
hot issue. Rather, Dew has something important to say to every parent, every 
adult child and every family.

ROAD TO RECOVERY; REBUILDING OF BLUFF TOP BEGINS -- WITH TEARING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first visible step in an excruciatingly slow process to repair a 
17-month-old landslide and clear a vital stretch of Pacific Coast Highway began 
Tuesday with the tedious chore of dismantling three damaged bluff-top homes. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente city officials said the demolition would have to be done 
painstakingly, piece by piece and without the help of bulldozers, because the 
three damaged homes on La Ventana are still hanging precariously over the 
50-foot bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials in both San Clemente and Dana Point remain confident that 
the $3.1-million project to clear the homes, rebuild the bluff top and clear 
the 300-foot section of debris-filled highway will be finished by January at 
the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to even try and improve on that," said Mort August, Dana Point's 
director of public works. "I'd like to give the community a Christmas present. 
This has had a real impact on Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining nettlesome issue that could slow the project is the signing 
of waivers releasing the California Coastal Commission from any liability for 
possible future slides on the bluff top, August said. But he believes the 
waivers will be signed sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a minor issue . . . but it is potentially holding up the 
works," August said. "I think we'll be able to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities are jointly supervising the reconstruction project because the 
landslide affected them both. 
</P>
<P>
 The slippage on Feb. 22, 1993, ruined eight bluff-top homes in San Clemente 
and caused 40,000 tons of debris to fall onto Pacific Coast Highway in Dana 
Point, where the roadway has been closed ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the damaged homes, three are in the way and must be dismantled before the 
frail slope can be repaired and the highway reopened. The dismantling began 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers will be moving in a very careful manner, more or less by hand" said 
Trang Huynh, a San Clemente building official. "We don't want them to shuffle 
anything down the slope. It would be very dangerous to go in there with heavy 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner Peter Shikli, who lost his three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot home in 
the slide, expressed his satisfaction Tuesday that progress is finally being 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been about a year and a half of trying to restore the neighborhood," 
said Shikli, 44, the owner of a computer software company who has relocated to 
a San Clemente apartment. "It looks like we are moving in a more positive 
direction. . . . This looks like it's going to be a very first-rate project 
from here on." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government will pay about 88% of the $3.1-million project cost 
through special emergency funds provided by the Federal Highway Administration, 
August said. The bulk of the remaining costs will be paid by the California 
Office of Emergency Services, with the homeowners chipping in $200,000, August 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Dana Point has already spent nearly $600,000 -- mostly on design 
and soils work -- to get the project to this point, but that will be 
reimbursed, August said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things work the way I penciled them out, there should be little if any 
money coming from the general funds of San Clemente and Dana Point," August 
said. "Right now, it shouldn't directly impact the city coffers. I have no 
reason to suspect otherwise at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point City Council is expected on July 12 to approve a reimbursable 
$2.1-million contract for the bluff-top reconstruction project with Santa 
Ana-based Sukut Construction Inc., whose bid was lowest of four that ranged up 
to $3.9 million. August said the project includes landscaping the bluff with 
native plants and installing an inch-thick concrete retainer on the bluff face, 
sculpted to "look like a natural bluff."

HUNTINGTON KEEPS PENSION 'SPIKING'; BENEFITS: CITING CONTRACTS, THE COUNCIL 
VOTES TO UPHOLD THE PRACTICE FOR 153 WORKERS WHO GAVE CITY OFFICIALS NOTICE 
BEFORE FRIDAY OF THEIR INTENTION TO RETIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday voted to continue allowing employees to "spike" their 
retirement pensions, which already may have cost the city $13 million, saying 
they are bound by employee contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 If they halted the practice of spiking now, the City Council "would be in 
violation of collective bargaining laws," Councilman David Sullivan said. "You 
can't unilaterally violate those agreements." The vote affects 153 employees 
who gave city officials notice before Friday of their intention to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law that went into effect Friday makes most aspects of spiking 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking occurs when employees artificially inflate their pensions by adding 
such benefits as unused vacation days, car allowances and city contributions to 
increase their final year's salary, on which a pension is based. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who with Councilman Ralph Bauer voted to 
end the practice, said, "I think we have to find out if spiking is legal or 
not. . . . I don't think we can condone this." 
</P>
<P>
 The council discussed its legal options in a closed session with attorney 
Peter J. Brown of the Los Angeles firm of Liebert, Cassidy & Frierson before 
the 4-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, the council enacted a two-week moratorium on paying the spiked 
portions of retirements pending legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The city estimates that pension spiking by some employees could cost the city 
up to $13 million, the amount of additional pension benefits that the state 
Public Employees Retirement System has paid retirees since the spiking began in 
the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 PERS, however, already has billed the city for $743,632 in disallowed costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has sent a letter to PERS saying the city refuses to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter says that we feel that the spiking process is illegal. Therefore, 
an illegal act can't be approved, and we are not going to pay for the spiking," 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the dilemma are furious that in previous years, city officials 
did approve the spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally shocked that city officials, apparently without the knowledge 
and approval of City Council, would amend signed and approved contracts that 
would cost taxpayers many millions of dollars," said Bill Mello, director of 
the Citizens' Bureau of Investigation, a group of residents investigating waste 
and abuses of city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello charged that in approving employee contracts for 1991 and 1992, 
officials allowed some city employees to increase spiking from 80 to 192 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBI believes spiking is illegal and that the '91 and '92 employment contracts 
are not enforceable because they violate contract law," Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he believed previous city councils probably allowed pension 
spiking because they were never adequately briefed on its fiscal impact.

PRIVATE RAMS TASK FORCE GOES TO TWO-MONTH OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A countywide task force seeking to keep the Los Angeles Rams in Orange County 
must present a competitive proposal within two months to have a chance of 
retaining the team, the group's chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing is important, and moving forward on a concerted effort is important," 
sports agent Leigh Steinberg after a task force meeting Tuesday. "We have six 
weeks to two months to promote a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members said they believe the Rams will decide in a few months 
whether to leave Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams exercised an escape clause in their stadium lease in May, giving them 
15 months to shop the franchise to cities that might offer more lucrative 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's group, known as the Task Forces to Keep the Rams in Orange County, 
has about 40 members. Among the members are Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, Supervisor 
William G. Steiner, hamburger restaurateur Carl N. Karcher, developer George 
Argyros and former Disneyland President Jack L. Lindquist. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, task force members formed several subcommittees to look into the 
possibility of building a new football-only stadium, refurbishing Anaheim 
Stadium, securing season ticket and luxury box commitments from the corporate 
community, and coordinating and soliciting the support of various governmental 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the group also has identified potential investors who might be 
interested in buying a part of the team. He declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to it all is a thorough understanding of the Rams' needs," Steinberg 
said. He and Lindquist, the group's co-chairman, tentatively are scheduled to 
meet with Rams Executive Vice President John Shaw later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, who represents many star athletes in the National Football League, 
said the issue of retaining the Rams is important not only to Anaheim, but to 
the county and state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be the first football franchise to leave California and the 
implication of that is not encouraging for California's economic and business 
scene," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg also said that if the Rams leave, Orange County has little hope of 
ever getting another NFL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Many county residents, however, don't seem to care. According to a recent 
Times Orange County Poll, 68% of county voters said the Rams were unimportant 
to them personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler said he believes the city should focus its 
energies on pleasing the California Angels, the city's other tenant at the 
stadium, and not the Rams. He said task force members may be wasting their 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are spinning their wheels," Pickler said. "I think they are 
flogging a dead horse. My main thought is going to be keep the Angels. I'm not 
holding my breath for the Rams staying here."

BUS RIDERS FACE FARE INCREASE, POSSIBLE STRIKE; TRANSPORTATION: MTA BOARD MAY 
HIKE PRICES TO COMBAT DEFICIT. UNION WORKERS THREATEN TO WALK OUT THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of a potentially devastating double whammy from the bus system -- a 
threatened drivers' strike and a pending fare increase -- those in the San 
Fernando Valley dependent on public transit grudgingly waited Tuesday to see 
what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be happy if they didn't raise the fare," said Lucretia Sowards, waiting 
at San Fernando Road and Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima for a bus to take 
her home to El Monte. "But they will. And if they're thinking about going on 
strike, they will." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she would get around if bus drivers go on strike, she said, "I 
won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Sowards' sentiments were echoed by others Tuesday as they waited for 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Most riders interviewed said they were aware that the MTA in May proposed 
increasing fares from $1.10 to $1.35, but many did not know that a potential 
strike could keep buses garaged as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" asked Nancy Martinez, 18, of Pacoima, when told of the potential 
strike. "I guess I'll have to walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who takes two buses for a 45-minute ride to her job in Van Nuys, 
paused a moment, then realized that her plan was not feasible. "It would 
probably take me about two hours to walk to work," she said. "I can't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board had been scheduled to meet Tuesday to review the status of labor 
negotiations but the meeting was rescheduled for today at 4 p.m. The session 
will be closed to the public, but the board will convene for a public hearing 
immediately afterward to consider a fare policy in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is to be held in the Board of Supervisors Hearing Room in the Hall 
of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldy Norton, a spokesman for the United Transportation Union, which 
represents bus and train drivers, said Tuesday that the MTA and the union 
remain "very far apart." Norton said that union workers -- seeking a 3% raise 
on top of their current cost-of-living increase -- could walk off the job as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials, who are considering the fare increase to help offset a 
$126-million annual operating deficit, oppose both demands. The MTA board is 
scheduled to consider the increase at its July 13 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, people who depend on buses to get to school or work or to run 
errands complained that the poorest of them are being asked to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on a fixed income and can't afford to pay more," said Mary Lou Lavis, 74, 
of Panorama City, as she left the MTA's customer service and ticket office in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Broussard, 20, of Van Nuys, also had visited the MTA center to pick up 
bus schedules. Her response to the proposed fare increase was a litany of 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have more buses, they should have better routes and they should 
have more respectful drivers," she said. "If they raise the fares and go on 
strike they're going to lose a lot of customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Atherley, 17, of Lake View Terrace, said that if the increase goes 
into effect, it may be cheaper for him to buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe a dime would be OK, but a quarter makes a big difference," said 
Atherley as he waited for a bus on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima, the 
second bus he must take to get home from San Fernando High School. "A lot of 
kids take the bus to school, and if they raise the fare I think you're going to 
see a lot of kids without licenses driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Hough, 40, of Van Nuys, was waiting for a bus on Van Nuys Boulevard near 
Sherman Way. He suggested that the MTA could solve its problems the way the Los 
Angeles Police Department did: "Where's (Chief) Willie Williams from? 
Philadelphia? Maybe the MTA can hire someone from the East Coast too."

PART OF DAMAGED INTERCHANGE TO REOPEN FRIDAY; ROADS: CONTRACTOR EARNS 
$3.5-MILLION BONUS FOR WORK ON GOLDEN STATE AND ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY 
CONNECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Part of the earthquake-damaged interchange between the Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways will reopen Friday ahead of schedule, state officials 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A key link between the desert communities of Lancaster and Palmdale and the 
San Fernando Valley and Downtown Los Angeles, new bridges will connect the 
southbound Antelope Valley Freeway (California 14) to the southbound Golden 
State Freeway (Interstate 5) and the northbound Golden State Freeway to the 
northbound Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges will open shortly after the the Friday morning rush-hour, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the connectors from the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway to the 
northbound Golden State and from the southbound Golden State to the northbound 
Antelope Valley Freeway -- the route for travel between the Antelope Valley and 
points north such as San Francisco -- is not expected to be completed until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A legislator hopes to post a sign on the interchange dedicating it to the 
memory of the Los Angeles motorcycle officer who plummeted to his death when it 
broke apart in the Jan. 17 temblor. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has 
proposed that the interchange be called the Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial 
Interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the promise of an extra $100,000 a day for each day work is 
completed ahead of schedule, contractor Kasler Corp. of San Bernardino will 
finish the project 35 days ahead of schedule and rack up a $3.5-million bonus, 
officials said. The contract was awarded March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 round-the-clock workers used more than 6.7 million pounds of steel 
and 16,700 cubic yards of concrete to rebuild the bridges, which are taller 
than a 12-story building, according to an aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. Total cost 
of the project was $19.6 million plus the $3.5-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said the new bridges were built to modern seismic safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the reopening will be a "relief to the neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction of the interchange is expected to ease the pressure on Santa 
Clarita's main streets. Before the Northridge quake, the interchange carried 
about 40,000 vehicles a day, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Highway parallels the Antelope Valley Freeway and was the only 
southbound road out of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys for weeks after 
the quake. Vehicles clogged the mostly two-lane Sierra Highway, and drivers 
lined up for hours along San Fernando Road through downtown Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The two thoroughfares have taken a pounding from the thousands -- sometimes 
tens of thousands -- of additional cars driving over them each day, said Bahman 
Janka, Santa Clarita's traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to get relief now on both of those roads," Janka said. 
"This will take care of much of that (pressure)." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has acknowledged the damage by approving $545,000 to repave Sierra 
Highway, from its intersection with Placerita Canyon Road south to the city 
boundary, and Soledad Canyon Road between Langside Drive and Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few benefits of the quake came in increased ridership for 
Metrolink. The north county commuter line jumped from about 1,000 per month to 
more than 12,000 passengers at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a silver lining in the earthquake," said Peter Hidalgo, a Metrolink 
spokesman. "It forced people to take another look at how they get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily average ridership for June was 4,600, and Metrolink officials expect to 
lose about 7% of their passengers when repairs to the interchange are finished. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar drop-off occurred when the Golden State Freeway reopened, and the 
commuter rail line is considered in greater competition with the Antelope 
Freeway because they parallel one another, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink hopes to prevent some losses by wooing more first-time riders now. 
About 180,000 flyers were mailed to Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley residents 
last month, offering four free rides on Metrolink, and recent ad campaigns are 
stressing shorter commute times along the Antelope Valley leg of the Santa 
Clarita route. 
</P>
<P>
 The interchange will be the third major quake-damaged freeway artery opened 
ahead of schedule. The Santa Monica Freeway reopened April 11, and the Golden 
State Freeway in the Santa Clarita Valley reopened May 17. In both cases, the 
government paid hefty bonuses to the contractors.

RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE HELD IN STRING OF ROBBERIES; ARREST: THE HOLDUPS 
OCCURRED IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA AROUND THE TIME HE LEFT THE FORCE AFTER A 
HIGH-PROFILE CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recently retired Los Angeles police detective who conducted some of the 
department's most sensitive organized crime investigations was arrested Tuesday 
on suspicion of committing a series of armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a warrant issued in Los Angeles, Las Vegas police arrested Michael 
D. Brambles, 45, who retired from the police force in March. During 23 years 
with the LAPD, Brambles was given many high-profile assignments, including 
heading the investigation into the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company and 
serving as the LAPD's main contact with longtime Beverly Hills madam Elizabeth 
Adams, who passed him the pillow-talk intelligence gleaned by her call girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles is charged in nine armed robberies beginning March 3, three weeks 
before his retirement. Police officials said, however, that they believe 
Brambles was already on leave, meaning he was not on duty at the time of the 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page criminal complaint gives few details, but the chief 
investigator on the case said most of the robberies were at restaurants in the 
trendy Melrose area, the Mid-Wilshire district and the West San Fernando 
Valley. One was at a dry cleaner. A sole gunman was reported in each case, 
usually arriving near closing time, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the robberies was May 4. Brambles was picked up for questioning on 
the next day, police said, when one of the robbery victims, a security guard, 
by chance spotted him at an Inglewood motel and insisted he was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were not filed until after a lengthy investigation, and Brambles was 
arrested in Las Vegas, where he moved after retirement, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Larry Hedwall, one of two members of the elite robbery-homicide unit 
assigned to the investigation, said Brambles steadfastly maintained his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's insisting that we have the wrong person," Hedwall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials involved in the investigation said Brambles' former 
position made the case difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you see a colleague or a past colleague cross the line, it's 
painful," Hedwall said. "You hate to believe that's possible, but we all know 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case is not classified as an organized crime matter, it was 
assigned -- in part because of its sensitive nature -- to the organized crime 
unit of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. That was the same 
unit that prosecuted many of the suspects Brambles chased as a supervising 
detective within the LAPD's Organized Crime Intelligence Division (OCID), which 
he joined in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by his boss there as "an exceptional guy . . . very, very 
articulate," Brambles had even represented the LAPD at a Congressional hearing 
in Washington, testifying about mob figures suspected of having hidden 
influence over whiz kid entrepreneur Barry Minkow, whose ZZZZ Best carpet 
cleaning company collapsed in 1987 in a $100-million fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Brambles' own high-flying career later took a downward turn, amid several 
clashes with colleagues and internal police investigations. In a remarkable 
incident in a police force sometimes criticized for its code of silence, 
another OCID detective accused him before a grand jury of improperly coaching a 
witness at a 1989 photo lineup in a mob case, saying Brambles signaled the man 
to identify a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles denied that he had tipped off the witness, and no public disciplinary 
case was brought in that incident. Nevertheless, he was transferred out of OCID 
near the end of 1989 and assigned to the West Los Angeles station. There he 
returned to the public eye when he testified in 1990 on behalf of accused madam 
Adams, saying she had provided him with "extremely reliable" information as an 
informant -- including the identity of a terrorist reportedly planning to bomb 
the English Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 All did not go smoothly for Brambles at West Los Angeles, however, as he was 
disciplined for sexual harassment. According to police records, he left an 
obscene photo of himself on the desk of a female detective trainee. 
</P>
<P>
 A Police Department spokesman said Brambles retired effective March 26, with a 
pension of just under $30,000 per year. Though police officials said they 
believe Brambles had gone on leave earlier, personnel records that would 
confirm the leave were not available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Hedwall said "no one was ever hurt" in the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect was armed with a handgun," acted alone and "just generally (went) 
in and out, most often at closing time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedwall said police thought they had identified suspects in at least a couple 
of the robberies but that the investigation took an unexpected turn with a "one 
chance in a billion" occurrence: The clerk at the dry cleaning store also 
worked as a security guard at an Inglewood motel and spotted Brambles at that 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles had a handgun when he was brought in for questioning, but that was 
not surprising, the detective said, because "he's a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Municipal Court, says two robberies 
occurred March 8 and one each March 3 and 29, April 14, 17, 23 and 25 and May 
4. Nine victims were named, six men and three women. As in many robbery 
investigations, the case hinged on "identification from the victims," Hedwall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though Brambles was long a controversial figure in law enforcement circles -- 
attracting loyal admirers and fierce enemies alike -- those who knew him were 
shocked to learn of the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope he's smarter than to get involved in something like that," said 
retired LAPD Capt. Stuart Finck, who headed OCID for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles prosecutors have recommended bail for Brambles be set at $500,000 
when he is brought here to face the charges.

WORLD CUP / U.S.A. 1994; DEFEAT CASTS A SHADOW; MORE THAN 2 DOZEN PEOPLE ARE 
ARRESTED IN HUNTINGTON PARK AFTER MEXICO'S WORLD CUP LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican flags waved briskly in the crowded aisle between the watermelon juice 
and pork rind counters. Young and old dressed in red, green and white bit their 
nails and stared at a big-screen TV perched high on a wall above several 
dangling pinatas.  
</P>
<P>
 And then, as a dramatic overtime shootout played out, the eager anticipation 
of more than 150 Mexican World Cup fans at El Gallo Giro restaurant in 
Huntington Park turned into bittersweet disappointment as their team was bested 
by Bulgaria on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game is a game and someone has to lose," sighed delivery driver Richard 
Gallegos, 22, a Mexican flag draped over his shoulders. "Our team played well. 
They played as well as they could." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, about one in three people are of Mexican descent and 
they -- especially the ones born south of the border -- constitute the region's 
largest segment of soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Huntington Park had become ground zero for the World Cup 
exuberance -- and in some cases, over-exuberance -- of Mexican team fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after Mexico's 1-1 tie with Italy ensured the team's entry into the 
tournament's second round, police arrested 17 celebrants, hurled pepper spray 
and closed off vehicular traffic on Pacific Boulevard, the center of Huntington 
Park's business district. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, despite Mexico's loss and another round of cautionary street 
closures, 27 more people were arrested in a series of brief but potent street 
skirmishes. Fearful of violence after Tuesday's game, police had closed off 
Pacific Boulevard to vehicles early in the morning and ordered pedestrians off 
the street in midafternoon. Their concerns were realized when they reopened it 
about 7:15 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, the intersection of Pacific and Florence Avenue became 
gridlocked with honking cars and about 150 screaming, flag-waving fans who 
began heaving rocks and bottles as police arrived to restore calm, said 
Huntington Park Police Lt. Steve Peeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeler said the street was reclosed within 15 minutes. Huntington Park police 
arrested six juveniles and nine adults, while sheriff's deputies booked a dozen 
other offenders. Charges included assault with a deadly weapon, public 
drunkenness, disturbing the peace and throwing an object at a moving vehicle, 
Peeler said.  
</P>
<P>
 The adults were being held Tuesday night at Los Angeles County Jail, while the 
juveniles were released to their parents' custody. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because police had been fearful of such an incident that Huntington 
Park was virtually shut down for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few public spots available to watch the game was El Gallo Giro, a 
popular fast-food emporium at Pacific and Florence Avenue, at the south end of 
the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people here love Mexico," said Pedro J. Matar, director of sales and 
marketing for the restaurant. "And they know we're part of Mexico, so they 
won't bother us. They'll protect us." 
</P>
<P>
 As the game played out on the TV inside the eatery, several police officers 
milled about outside. The wide boulevard was so deserted that one could fire a 
cannon and hit nothing but asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "What gives, man? It looks like a ghost town. It's too quiet here. It's like 
'Gunsmoke,' " said Pomona resident Eddie Garnica, who was visiting his sister 
in downtown Huntington Park. "I was born and raised in this town and it feels 
kind of creepy today, really." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game concluded, more than 100 riot-geared officers appeared on the 
scene in a display of force.  
</P>
<P>
 Several business owners were perturbed by the police crackdown along Pacific, 
saying their businesses were unduly suffering because of the street closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why the police had to close down this street," said Rosa 
Luna, co-owner of three maternity clothing stores along Pacific. "People just 
want to celebrate. They're not going to make any trouble. We're losing a lot of 
business and we had to send six workers home, so they can't get paid today." 
</P>
<P>
 Several in a small crowd at Florence and Pacific also expressed resentment at 
the heavy police presence earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't happy that the police are out there like that," said Freddy 
Gonzalez, 35, as he hoisted a Mexican flag at the corner of Pacific and 
Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, which numbered no more than 100 people, waved flags and spoke with 
resignation about their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost, but we're proud of our team," shouted Javier Medina, 25. "We played 
well and we showed we have a lot of heart. We'll be back next time."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; HOMELESS ADVOCATE HONORED BY LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Miller, executive director of the Shelter for the Homeless, was honored by 
an organization of civic and academic leaders for his work with homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County American Society for Public Administration recognized Miller 
last week for his successful partnership with the Westminster Redevelopment 
Agency in providing programs that benefit homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is presented each year by the group, which includes members from 
federal, state and local governments, as well as from universities, to people 
who have done outstanding work in public administration, said Robert Huntley, 
Westminster's acting city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster-based Shelter for the Homeless provided temporary shelter to 
more than 3,700 people in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties last year. 
The group also helps homeless people get food, find jobs and receive medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, the Westminster Redevelopment Agency has spent more than $1 
million for Shelter of the Homeless programs. In 1993, the agency bought four 
buildings that Miller's group is now converting to a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the agency spent more than $10,000 to house a group of homeless 
people evicted from their encampment near the San Diego Freeway. Shelter for 
the Homeless is operating the house where the people are now staying and is 
helping them find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller started his work with the homeless 10 years ago, distributing blankets 
and food to homeless people he found sleeping in local parks. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the nonprofit Shelter for the Homeless in 1984 and quit his job as 
an accountant. Two years later, he received a $14,000 grant from the 
Westminster Redevelopment Agency, and his group began turning leased houses 
into temporary homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the city of Westminster, we wouldn't exist," Miller said.

<P>
 At 17, Chris Choi of Buena Park is an old hand at winning art contests. 
</P>
<P>
 He won his first award -- third place in the La Palma Celebration of the Arts 
contest -- when he was in the seventh grade.Now a recent graduate of Kennedy 
High School in La Palma, Choi has won $300 and first place in a poster contest 
aimed at reducing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, sponsored by AirTouch Cellular, focused on reducing traffic 
congestion in Southern California through public efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi's poster shows a surrealistic street intersection. Traffic is heavy. 
Pedestrians look grim -- "frustrated and grumpy," Choi said -- because of the 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it tight as I could," he said. "And in the upper right-hand 
corner, I showed the sky in yellow, which is pollution from all the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch distributed copies of Choi's poster throughout Los Angeles and Orange 
counties during its recent campaign for citizen involvement in fighting 
traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to winning the AirTouch contest, Choi also recently won two art 
scholarships totaling $975, all of which he will use to attend Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 In his free time, Choi volunteers work for the Cerritos Valley Baptist Church, 
which has commissioned him to do a mural. He also plays the piano and trumpet 
and goes to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi said that after college graduation he plans to pursue a career in graphic 
design or illustration. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS $86.8-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District has approved a tentative 
$86.8-million budget for the upcoming school year that aims to reduce class 
sizes slightly and increase teacher salaries by 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget plan, which was adopted last Thursday by the Board of Education on 
a 7-0 vote, also reintroduces physical education into the elementary schools 
with the hiring of five roving gym teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative plan includes shifting $761,000 from some programs into others. 
The district cut $100,000 by eliminating the Costa Mesa High School farm 
program and saved $250,000 because of teacher retirements, said Michael Fine, 
the district's budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 That $761,000 will be used for such things as reducing class size and 
providing more supplies for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa will reduce class sizes for grades seven through 12 from 29.5 
students per teacher to 29 to 1. The kindergarten through sixth-grade class 
sizes will remain about the same as last year at a ratio of 29 to 1, Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the district will evaluate the money it receives from 
state property taxes and adjust the budget accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will place $2.9 million in its reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 By state law, the district is supposed to hold at least 3% of its operating 
budget in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen A. Wagner, the district's former chief financial officer, was 
convicted of embezzling $3.7 million. He is serving a six-year prison sentence 
concurrently with a 57-month federal sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa district is scheduled to approve a final budget at the end of 
August.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DISCUSS BRIDGE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK and 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District will host a public hearing July 12 to 
discuss whether to support construction of a controversial Caltrans pedestrian 
bridge project, which residents say would increase crime in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at Hoover Elementary School, 408 E. Santa Clara Ave., at 7 
p.m., district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is building the bridge across the Santa Ana Freeway at 20th Street to 
replace a pedestrian tunnel that once went under the freeway. That tunnel was 
demolished as a part of Caltrans' freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
 The crossing is intended to benefit 170 schoolchildren who live west of the 
freeway and attend Hoover Elementary School, located east of the freeway. 
Caltrans officials have indicated that they would kill the project if the board 
requests its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have recommended that the board support completion of the 
bridge. Otherwise, children would be forced to walk another half-mile on a busy 
street to get to school and the district could be liable if children were 
injured on their way to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board recently heard from about 100 residents who opposed the project. 
They said the bridge would increase crime by giving criminals an escape route 
that could frustrate police attempting to pursue them in cars. 
</P>
<P>
 However, board members said they were uneasy about taking a formal position 
until hearing from the parents whose children would use the bridge. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; GOLFERS, NEIGHBORS PRAISE VILLAGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Co.'s plan to build up to 4,000 homes and two golf courses on land 
next to Irvine Valley College has received preliminary approval from the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, known as Oakcreek Village, faced little public opposition and 
was praised by both nearby residents and golfers, who said they welcomed the 
prospect of two new golf courses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakcreek Village will be built on 1,200 acres of mostly undeveloped land 
bounded by Jeffrey Road, Sand Canyon Avenue, and the San Diego and Santa Ana 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf courses as well as some industrial developments are planned for the 
northern end of the village. Most of the new residential housing will go at the 
south end near the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week spent about two hours going over the development. 
Most of the discussions centered on affordable housing and how to pay for a 
Jeffrey Road underpass. 
</P>
<P>
 The city required that Oakcreek include about 100 units of affordable housing. 
The council approved the Irvine Co.'s request to provide about 50 of those 
units just outside the area at a senior citizens housing development in the 
Woodbridge village. The remaining 50 units of affordable housing would be 
located in Oakcreek. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. also agreed to meet with city staffers about an underpass the 
city wants to build on Jeffrey near the Santa Ana Freeway. The underpass is 
expected to cost $28 million, and some council members had hoped the Irvine Co. 
would pay for some of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael J. Le Blanc, a vice president of the company, said the Oakcreek 
project would not be fiscally viable if the Irvine Co. was required to spend 
millions of dollars on the underpass. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did offer the city $200,000 to $300,000 to pay for design work for 
the project. City officials said it will cost a total of $2 million to design 
the underpass.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COLLEGE ADDED TO DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden West College is among 87 higher-education institutions in the nation 
that the federal government recently added to its direct student loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new national program, the government provides loans directly to 
students, through their colleges, rather than through private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's selection for the new loan program was announced by U.S. 
Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "These schools (picked for the program) will have an opportunity to 
demonstrate that direct lending can indeed simplify the administrative tasks of 
educational institutions, lower costs to taxpayers, and most importantly, 
provide better services to students," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have said that direct loans reduce administrative burdens 
and are more efficient. About 1,000 higher-education institutions in the nation 
had previously been certified for the new direct-loan program prior to the 
addition of Golden West and the other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West President Philip Westin said the community college "is proud to be 
part of a new program that will put money in the hands of students who are 
serious about purchasing a quality education at an affordable price." 
</P>
<P>
 Westin said that student loan programs help provide for a community's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education is all about creating the future," Westin said. "When a student 
can't afford a college education, the future of that student, as well as the 
future of the community, is in jeopardy."BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 3 SCHOOLS GET GRANTS TO BUY COMPUTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three local schools have won a total of $74,000 in state grants to pay for 
computers and video hardware to help limited English-speaking students improve 
their language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools receiving money from the state include Willard Intermediate School 
and Franklin and James A. Garfield elementary schools, said Diane Thomas, 
spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants are especially useful in a district whose limited English-speaking 
population is about 66% of its 48,000 students, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard's $38,000 grant will be used to create "Project Travel," in which 
students play time travelers and research various periods of history. The 
program will provide students with a sophisticated multimedia computer network, 
complete with photo scanners and CD-ROM equipment. Students will practice 
English skills, for example, by creating scripts describing their research and 
incorporating them into multimedia presentations, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment will also be used by Willard parents who are enrolled in English 
as a second language classes at Rancho Santiago College, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield Elementary's $20,000 grant will pay for 11 new computers as well as 
writing and word-processing software. All students at the school will spend at 
least 45 minutes a week training on the computers, which they will use to write 
compositions and perform other schoolwork, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Elementary's $16,000 grant will be used to pay for a video project 
designed to improve students' writing and speaking skills. Students will 
produce videos about school activities through the project, Thomas said. JON

<P>
 A charity group that provides emergency food and shelter to South County's 
homeless people will benefit from a jazz and swing concert at Leisure World on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Hooked on Music Program" will showcase local groups covering classic 
sounds from acts like the Andrews Sisters, the Platters, the Mills Brothers and 
the Inkspots. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $5 for the show, which starts at 6 p.m. in Leisure World's 
Clubhouse Three, 23822 Avenida Sevilla. Look for the Gate Three sign off 
Moulton Parkway between El Toro Road and Laguna Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing on Sunday will be the Ferdie Furtado Quintet, the Society Swing 
Trio and Johnny Smith and the New Inkspots. The show will be the first musical 
benefit sponsored by Saddleback Community Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization provides emergency rent assistance, food and clothing, helps 
to pay utility bills and offers many other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "South County may appear to be the land of affluence, populated by people who 
live in well-kept tract and custom homes," said Jeanne Gormick, spokeswoman for 
Saddleback Community Outreach. "But these stereotypes mask the whole truth. We 
have needy people right here in our own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gormick added that donations are particularly needed in the summer because 
community contributions are generally lower during the hot months. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase tickets, make a donation to the program or volunteer, call (714) 
380-8144. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 15 PROTEST HANDLING OF RECALL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen angry residents picketed City Hall Tuesday morning to protest City 
Clerk Anne M. York's handling of a recall election of the mayor and two city 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, mostly Fullerton Recalls Committee members who successfully 
campaigned for the recall of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly 
McClanahan and Don Bankhead, want to have the special election in October 
instead of consolidating it with the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 They charge that York is denying residents the special election by combining 
it with the Nov. 8 general election. By doing so, it allows Catlin and 
McClanahan to serve in office until their four-year terms expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, recalled officials cannot run in a special election meant to replace 
them. Because Catlin's term and McClanahan's term end in November, any one of 
the recalled council members could run for those two seats because it's part of 
the general election, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Bankhead's seat, which expires in 1996, would be up for replacement 
in the special election. The council formerly voted for consolidating the 
elections at Tuesday's afternoon meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the California election code, a special election must be held from 114 
to 129 days after the day the results are tallied. In Fullerton's case, the 
county registrar of voters completed certifying the June 7 recall election 
results June 16, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state election code also gives York up to 28 days to prepare a certified 
statement of the results to submit to the City Council. Tuesday was the last 
day for York to submit the results to the council, which she did. That made the 
election in October impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Tuesday morning's protesters later spoke to the council urging it to 
hold a special election in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Fullerton have said they do not have confidence in you," Hal 
McDonnel said. "Resign now." 
</P>
<P>
 Council supporters said consolidating the election is a responsible move. 
</P>
<P>
 During the demonstration earlier, protesters wore red, white and blue hats and 
T-shirts and carried U.S. flags and placards that read: "York thwarts will of 
the people," "Taxpayers demand our vote now" and "Special election now!" 
</P>
<P>
 They sang "America" before storming into the building to hurl questions and 
accusations at York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't you call for a special election" immediately? W. Snow Hume, a 
recall leader, asked in a loud voice. 
</P>
<P>
 York, who defeated a recall effort against her, said she was acting on what 
City Atty. R.K. (Kerry) Fox said was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not ignoring the recall," York told the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox defended York. He said she has not broken any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Hume threatened to sue York on the grounds that she purposely 
delayed certifying the recall election results so the special election could be 
consolidated with the general election, thus canceling the special election for 
Catlin and McClanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the recalls committee "tried to recall (York) because she was 
following the law," Fox said. "They want people to do what they want them to 
do. If the law is otherwise, then they still want you punished. . . . It's all 
very confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last year when Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted 
for the 2% utility tax despite opposition from hundreds of residents. MIMI KO

VERMIN BREED AMID EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE; HEALTH: OFFICIALS MOVE TO COMBAT 
MOSQUITOES BREEDING IN SWIMMING POOLS AND RATS INFESTING ABANDONED STRUCTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To combat another aftereffect of the Northridge quake, Los Angeles County 
health officials said Tuesday that insect-eating fish and pesticides are being 
used to kill mosquitoes and rodents that are breeding in some quake-damaged 
swimming pools and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before a Los Angeles City Council panel on earthquake recovery, 
county health officials said a survey of 324 quake-damaged buildings found that 
nearly 5% of damaged pools had become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and about 
2% of vacant buildings were rodent-infested. 
</P>
<P>
 In other efforts to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods, the Ad Hoc Committee 
on Earthquake Recovery gave redevelopment officials the preliminary go-ahead to 
establish quake recovery areas, similar to redevelopment areas, in which 
property taxes can be used to back bonds that would finance rebuilding in the 
hardest-hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel instructed the Community Redevelopment Agency to bring the proposal 
to the entire City Council next week and to draw specific boundaries of the 
proposed recovery areas -- concentrated in the San Fernando Valley -- to be 
considered in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the quake committee, said after the 
meeting that the recovery areas will not give city officials the same kind of 
powers to condemn properties that have generated criticism in traditional 
redevelopment areas throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't be a redevelopment project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mosquito and rodent infestation problems were identified after county 
health officials did a random survey of severely damaged buildings to look for 
possible quake-related health problems, said Art Tilzer, director of the 
consumer protection division of the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat mosquitoes in pools that are not maintained, he said mosquito 
abatement officials decided in February to release into the pools schools of 
mosquito fish that eat the insect larvae. Where they found rats feeding off 
food in vacant buildings, county health officials either distributed rodent 
pesticide to neighbors or themselves laced the buildings with the poison, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents parts of the hard-hit Sherman Oaks 
area, said complaints to his office about rats in vacant quake-damaged 
buildings had increased substantially after the quake, indicating that the 
problem could be much more serious than the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing that the problem is less than 5%," he said after 
the panel's meeting. "My anecdotal evidence indicates that the problem is 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he believes the rodent problem will diminish as the food 
supply runs out. But he said he fears the mosquito problem will increase with 
the summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad-hoc panel also was informed of an increasing trend among residents of 
quake-damaged areas toward mixing garden waste with quake debris, which the 
city has been hauling away from residential curbsides for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Santamaria, the city's senior engineer in charge of the quake cleanup, 
said about 10% of the debris hauled away by city crews now includes green 
waste, up from only about 2% in the weeks immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal emergency money funding the city's quake cleanup can be 
used only for quake-related debris, the city will stop hauling away debris that 
is clearly not a result of the quake, Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, sanitation officials will begin to use ribbons to mark trash 
that they believe is not associated with the Jan. 17 quake, leaving it behind 
for residents to sort through and dispose of.

AGREEMENT PENDING ON FINAL OBSTACLE TO COLISEUM REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward resolution of the last big issue holding up the $50-million 
earthquake repair at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency has submitted to the state a memorandum of agreement 
approving demolition of the badly damaged press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherilyn Widell, state historic preservation officer, said Tuesday that she 
expects the agreement to be signed by the end of the week by FEMA, the state 
Office of Emergency Services and the Coliseum Commission, thus clearing the way 
for the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coliseum, repair project director Don C. Webb has been pushing for the 
demolition and complaining that some historic preservationists were dragging 
their feet on it. The memorandum "sounds like a very positive development," he 
said, adding, that the proposed agreement had yet to reach the Coliseum 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Widell said the memorandum acknowledges that the demolition would have an 
adverse impact on a historic feature of the stadium, which is a national 
historic landmark, but that FEMA views the action as necessary. She said the 
agreement does not deal with the question of a press box replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition, which Webb has said would take about a week, would clear the 
way for providing a temporary press facility at the stadium before its 
scheduled reopening Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1984 Olympics, when the press box was used mainly by the television 
network covering the Games and by VIPs, most of the media representatives were 
located outdoors in specially converted seating below the press box. The nature 
of a temporary facility for the coming football season has not yet been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb and prime repair contractor Ron Tutor have expressed concern that the 
press box, if not demolished, could appear to some spectators to be a safety 
hazard. They say it is unusable in its present state. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Dishman, of the Los Angeles Conservancy, said Tuesday that the group 
does not oppose demolition of the press box.

ALLEGED GANG MEMBERS INDICTED IN GUN THEFTS; CRIME: FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY THE 
FIVE SUSPECTS CONSPIRED TO ROB THREE SOUTHLAND SHOPS. IN ONE BURGLARY, 101 
FIREARMS WERE TAKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five reputed gang members were indicted in federal court Tuesday on charges 
that they conspired to steal firearms from Southern California gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five were arraigned Tuesday morning in U.S. District Judge Terry 
Hatter's courtroom. The fifth, named in the indictment as George Batiste 
Thenarse, was arraigned later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment of the five stems from an investigation by the federal Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Los Angeles Police Department in 
response to what was described by the ATF as an effort to crack down on gun 
store burglaries, which have increased over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 ATF agent Brad Galvan, described in a court affidavit as the lead agent with 
the Main Street Crips Burglary Task Force, said 20 gun stores had been 
burglarized in Los Angeles and Orange counties since February, 1992, and more 
than 1,000 guns had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvan said many of the burglaries "are believed to be perpetrated by 
organized street gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, the suspects forced open gun-shop doors with pry 
bars and bolt cutters. The tools were supplied by two of those charged, Michael 
Lamont Bourgeois, also known as "Lil Mike," and Cedric Gunter, also known as 
"Ced," the indictment stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defendants would plan the burglaries of federally licensed firearms dealers 
('gun stores') by visiting the business premises of those dealers and 
recruiting other co-conspirators to participate in the burglaries," the 
indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the indictment added, they would return in the night to commit the 
burglary. Three gun stores were listed in the indictment, including two in 
Orange County. They were Weatherby's Gun Store in South Gate and the Stockade 
Gun Store and B & B Sales, both in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ATF, the suspects succeeded in taking guns in only one of the 
three attempted burglaries. The ATF said 101 guns were taken in the Stockade 
Gun Store burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Thenarse, Bourgeois and Gunter, the other two named in the indictment 
were identified as La Gene Smith and Sammie Lee Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Thenarse was arrested Tuesday morning. The others were arrested in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvan described one incident in April in which Huntington Beach police 
stopped a car driven by Thenarse, with Bourgeois, Gunter and a fourth man 
riding as passengers. He said police discovered two flashlights, three pairs of 
gloves and three pillowcases, along with a pair of large, red commercial bolt 
cutters, in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Thenarse, Bourgeois and Gunter were arrested and detained for possession of 
burglary tools and were taken into federal custody a week later.

ELECTION NIGHT IS FINALLY OVER IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what could be the end to one of the most chaotic elections in Long Beach 
history, the City Council on Tuesday declared contractor Mike Donelon the 
winner by two votes in a June 7 council race that he initially appeared to have 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 7 to 1 to certify Donelon's win over Tonia Reyes Uranga, 
whose lead vanished when several extra ballots were discovered during a June 22 
recount. Councilman Warren Harwood voted against the certification, and 
Councilman Les Robbins was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Election night is finally over," announced Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg, who 
chaired the council meeting in Mayor Ernie Kell's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope it's over," said Donelon after the vote. "I'm ready to get to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's office has acknowledged that a mistake was made when several 
ballots were inadvertently left out of the election night counting, but said 
the latest tally is accurate. The final count gave Donelon 2,936 votes to 2,934 
for Uranga. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon held a one-vote lead after the June 22 recount, but a Superior Court 
judge blocked the council from certifying the recount until Uranga had a chance 
to review several ballots that had been rejected for various reasons. After 
reviewing the rejected ballots, officials decided Friday that eight should have 
been counted. When those ballots were included, Donelon's margin increased to 
two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Uranga, who led by 29 votes on election night, said Tuesday that she is 
not ready to concede the election. She said she is inspecting the election 
materials that Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien granted her access to on 
June 28 and will decide next week whether to challenge the results in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood said the council should not have certified the results because there 
are too many unanswered questions surrounding the election, and the panel 
should wait until the courts can rule on any possible challenges by Uranga. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, by unanimous vote, also directed its legislative committee to 
review the entire election process in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will consider, among other items, a recommendation by City Clerk 
Shelba Powell that the council delay certifying future elections for two weeks 
to give staff time to investigate questionable and absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga and Donelon had been vying to represent the 7th District, which covers 
central and west Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, a community activist and former president of the Long Beach Children's 
Museum, would have been one of the first two Latinos elected to the council. 
Jenny Oropeza won a seat in the 1st District last month and will become the 
first Latino council member. She is scheduled to be sworn in July 19.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; FUND-RAISER PLANNED FOR MAKESHIFT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A makeshift school held in Jimmy Ramos' driveway to teach English now has a 
name, La Escuelita del Pueblo, and plans for a fund-raiser to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which began last month, is taught from 9 a.m. to noon Saturdays 
and Sundays by Ramos and eight students from Fullerton College and Cal State 
Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos started it in an effort to help people who want to learn English but 
can't attend classes during the week or pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 La Escuelita gets no funding other than donations from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 So on July 9, the makeshift school will have a party from 1 to 8 p.m. to raise 
money for teacher and student supplies. The fund-raiser will take place on 
Ramos' driveway, at 334 1/2 Truslow Ave. The public is invited.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 of Ramos' students will help him and the other teachers provide 
Mexican and Guatemalan food, including mole, tamales , tacos and chamin, which 
will be sold at $1 a plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment will include Aztec dancing, poetry readings and skits by the 
Chicano Poet Society, Mexican folkloric dances, clown acts by Tin Tin and Ton 
Ton, music by the band Ceniza, a theatrical performance by a neighborhood 
acting troupe and recorded music spun by Ramos, who is a part-time disc jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the money we raise from the food sales, we're hoping to be able to buy 
headphones, tape recorders, videocassette recorders and other supplies to help 
the students learn in the classes," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to the number of students as evidence that the English classes are 
badly needed in his neighborhood. When La Escuelita opened on June 4, he was 
not prepared for the 120 people who lined up and had to run door to door asking 
to borrow chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are coming to these classes because they know they need to learn 
English for a better opportunity at a well-paying job and to be able to achieve 
their dreams here in the United States," he said. "We see that need and are 
doing whatever we can to help." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL VOTING DELAY CALLED POLITICAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Fred Hunter accused his colleagues of playing political games after 
they postponed a decision last week on how to fill City Council vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's remarks came last Tuesday, before Councilmen Frank Feldhaus and Irv 
Pickler and Mayor Tom Daly voted to delay consideration of a proposed amendment 
to the City Charter.The amendment will be placed on the November ballot for 
consideration by voters if it receives council approval by August. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex proposal would automatically give the losing council candidate 
with the highest number of votes in a general election the right to fill a 
council vacancy in the event an incumbent council member is elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 City law now calls for an appointment by the council or a special election to 
select a new council member in the event of such a vacancy. But even if the 
measure is passed by the council and approved by voters this fall, it would not 
take effect until 1996, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, nevertheless, was frustrated by the council's inaction last week. 
Hunter favors the charter proposal over costly special elections or letting the 
council appoint new members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we ought to get on with this instead of playing these stupid 
political games," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pickler said he needed more time to study the proposals before he could 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's (only) about two paragraphs," shot back Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Pickler said he was still undecided about the proposal. 
"This may be the way to go," said Pickler. "I'm not saying it's not. I just 
don't want to rush into something." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to revisit the proposal in two weeks. MARTIN MILLER

 An Anaheim man was arrested in connection with a fatal shooting outside a 
nightclub early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Carlos Baltazar, 18, on suspicion of murder after a 
19-year-old man was shot to death shortly after midnight in the parking lot of 
La Estrella Mexican Restaurant and Nightclub in Anaheim. Authorities did not 
identify the victim, pending notification of family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Steve Rodig said a security guard at the nightclub detained 
Baltazar after the shooting and turned him over to authorities. The victim died 
at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said police believe the two men were unacquainted and that only Baltazar 
had been inside the club at 500 N. Brookhurst St.

CUP FANS' HOPES DIE IN PEACE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SANTA ANA POLICE WERE READY FOR 
TROUBLE, BUT MEXICO'S LOSS LEFT NO ONE IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Caught off guard last week when celebrating Mexican soccer fans created 
gridlock downtown, police on Tuesday barricaded streets and posted extra patrol 
officers as Mexico competed in another game that could nudge them closer to the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Mexican team lost a close match to Bulgaria, it was clear that 
no one was in the mood for riotous celebration. The rush-hour traffic rolled by 
uneventfully, with an occasional car displaying the Mexican flag with undaunted 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know (if the plan would have worked), because Mexico did not win the 
soccer game. I'm sure there are a lot of unhappy soccer fans and I imagine that 
most people went home," said police spokesman Lt. Robert Helton, describing the 
sunny afternoon as "exceptionally quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, "last week we were caught by surprise. We didn't know 
here would be that level of celebration."  
</P>
<P>
 When the Mexican soccer team tied with the Italian team on June 28, he said, a 
mixture of flag-waving pedestrians and horn-honking drivers tied up traffic on 
4th Street. Police made four arrests for public intoxication that afternoon and 
wrote scores of citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said police were determined to prevent a recurrence of disruption in 
the heart of the downtown business district. More important, he said, they 
wanted to be prepared in case there was an outbreak of violence, as occurred 
last week in Huntington Park, when several businesses were looted, a 3-year-old 
girl was hit with a bottle and police were pelted with rocks, bottles and 
lighted fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 p.m. Tuesday, the Santa Ana police cordoned off a command post in the 
parking lot of the Old County Courthouse on Broadway, which was filled with 
patrol cars, motorcycles and even specially armed tactical units, ready to be 
called upon if violence erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 50 police were deployed for crowd control, with two-officer teams 
stationed at every major intersection in the area between French and Ross 
streets and between Santa Ana Boulevard and 1st Street, Helton said.  
</P>
<P>
 But police said the only disturbance was caused by one apparently inebriated 
young man carrying a large Mexican flag down Broadway who was arrested when he 
zigzagged into an intersection. He was taken away seated in the back of a 
police golf cart, his flag gently fluttering beside him. 
</P>
<P>
 In shops and restaurants on 4th Street, the atmosphere was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry because Mexico is out" of the World Cup competition, said Jose 
Alveran of Garden Grove, who had watched the soccer game at the travel agency 
where he works. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Orozco, manager of Rancho de Mendoza Restaurant, said about 300 people 
had gathered there to watch the game. When their team lost, he said, they 
reacted with silence.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was quiet," Orozco said. "People are very depressed. Today is very sad for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 p.m. the crowd at the restaurant had dwindled to 30, Orozco said. "I put 
the game on VCR," he said, "but nobody wanted to watch it again."

PARTS OF CLAS TESTS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC VIEWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Portions of the controversial new tests for public school students will be 
available for public viewing later this month at the Orange County Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a barrage of criticism from parents, school board members and 
conservative activists throughout California, the state Department of Education 
decided earlier this spring to release the English/language arts segments of 
the California Learning Assessment System to the public. Copies will be 
available for viewing for one month at 41 locations starting July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million students in 7,500 public schools took the reading, 
writing, math, science and history tests this spring at a cost of $26 million. 
But only the language arts portions of the fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade 
exams will be distributed to the viewing sites, because those are the segments 
that created the most debate. The literature selections upon which the test 
questions are based will not be released, because they are protected by 
authors' copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended to evaluate students' thought processes as well as their ability to 
derive correct answers, CLAS measures student achievement against statewide 
performance levels.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that the new exams violate state law by questioning students 
about moral issues without parental permission, and that the questions are too 
personal and too vague for CLAS to serve as a valid testing tool. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a memo from the state education department, each viewing site 
will have on hand: 
</P>
<P>
 * a complete, bound set of the English/language arts exams; 
</P>
<P>
 * selected student work and commentaries; 
</P>
<P>
 * a student information form and explanation; 
</P>
<P>
 * scoring guides and summary of performance levels; 
</P>
<P>
 * a public response form; 
</P>
<P>
 * CLAS brochures and fact sheets; and 
</P>
<P>
 * state curriculum guides for English/language arts, and pamphlets for parents 
in English and Spanish about the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have instructed administrators to have a specially trained 
person present during all viewing times.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, people wishing to view the tests can contact Jane Periolat, 
Building B, Room 1031, Orange County Department of Education, 200 Kalmus Drive, 
Costa Mesa, 92627, (714) 966-4331.

CONDOR CAPTURED, MAY GO BACK TO ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California condor that could not stay away from civilization was captured 
and was being held in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in Ventura County, awaiting a 
decision on whether to return the endangered vulture to the zoo where it was 
hatched, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The capture followed the death on June 24 of a condor near San Marcos Pass in 
Santa Barbara County.That death occurred after U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
biologists found that two of the five condors in the wild were landing on back 
yard fences and on swimming pool decks. 
</P>
<P>
 After biologists tried to get the birds back to their more remote home in the 
backcountry of Santa Barbara County, one flew into a power line and died of a 
broken pelvis. The second bird flew back to rejoin the other birds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second bird returned to the populated area over the weekend and was 
captured Monday. Biologists will meet with condor recovery team members 
Thursday to decide whether the male condor should be returned to a zoo, said 
Marc M. Weitzel), condor recovery project leader.

JUDGE SIDES WITH EX-BLACK PANTHER, ORDERS ONE-MAN CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has said state prison officials apparently retaliated against 
former Black Panther leader Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt after he told television 
interviewers that new evidence shows his innocence in a 1968 murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was transferred in January to the state prison at Mule Creek in Amador 
County and housed with another inmate rather than in a one-man cell, his 
placement for nearly all of his imprisonment. His doctors say double-celling 
aggravates Pratt's medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 State Corrections Director James Gomez has acknowledged ordering the transfer 
and says he did it at the request of unidentified state legislative aides so 
that Pratt could be closer to his wife and children in Marin County. But U.S. 
District Judge Stanley Weigel stopped just short of calling Gomez a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the transfer, and two previous findings of prison system 
retaliation against Pratt, "point to a retaliatory motive," Weigel said in a 
June 27 ruling. He said the transfer was ordered -- under unusual procedures 
that prison officials tried to conceal -- two days after Pratt had agreed to a 
Los Angeles television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is doubtful . . . that (officials) were acting out of goodwill toward 
(Pratt)," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered officials to keep Pratt in a one-man cell, where he was transferred 
in February by Weigel's previous order in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Peter Siggins said Tuesday the state would probably appeal 
the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was the Black Panthers' deputy defense minister in Southern California 
when he was convicted in 1972 of the December, 1968, robbery and fatal shooting 
of schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentenced to life in prison, he has appealed unsuccessfully to state and 
federal courts, saying he was at a Panther conference in Oakland at the time of 
the killing and was denied crucial FBI evidence that would have cleared him.

MOST EVACUEES RETURN HOME AS CREWS GAIN GROUND ON WILDFIRES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crews gained enough ground on two brush fires to let most evacuees return home 
Tuesday, but both blazes were still out of control after blackening more than 
30,000 acres and destroying 14 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19,200-acre wildfire that began with a lightning strike Friday near this San 
Jacinto Mountains resort community continued to burn above Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire came within two miles of the Palm Springs city limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting flare-ups and the people in Palm Springs can see that, but that 
doesn't mean the fire's getting any closer," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman 
George Kenline. "It hasn't moved in quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities hoped to have the fire surrounded by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 miles to the northwest, an 11,000-acre fire burned brush near small 
San Bernardino County ranches. Known as the Devil's fire, it began Sunday near 
Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains and spread northeast toward the 
desert communities of Apple Valley and Lucerne Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross shut down emergency shelters at both fires Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday, authorities had asked residents of about 500 homes to evacuate 
because of the Devil's fire. The request was called off Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 homes in the communities of Pinyon Crest, Pinyon Pines and Alpine 
were evacuated Sunday, and most of those people were allowed to go home 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That blaze, known as the Palm fire, destroyed 14 homes and damaged seven 
others between late Sunday and Monday evening in the Pinyon Pines area, about 
10 miles southwest and 5,000 feet above Palm Desert, said Forest Service 
spokeswoman Frances Enkoji. 
</P>
<P>
 California 74, connecting Pinyon Pines with Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage and 
Palm Springs, was reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five firefighters suffered minor injuries or heat exhaustion in the Palm 
fire.

JUDGE'S PROMISE ELICITS GUILTY PLEA IN CHILD ABUSE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An affluent Thousand Oaks mother accused of forcing her teen-aged daughter to 
live in a back-yard racquetball court for two years pleaded guilty to felony 
child abuse Tuesday, after a judge promised not to impose more than a six-month 
jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea by Charlotte Russo, a 52-year-old registered nurse who is married to 
a stockbroker, came one month after a jury deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction on 
the felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's sentencing agreement was quickly criticized by the 16-year-old 
victim, who attended the court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she should get more. That's not even a year," the girl said. "I was 
in the racquetball court for two whole years. She's not going to know what it's 
like at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Russo appeared nervous as she answered "guilty" when Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. asked how she pleaded to 
inflicting corporal injury on a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo and her husband, Richard, were arrested May 24, 1993, and charged with 
child abuse after neighbors reported seeing Charlotte Russo attack the girl, 
then 15, in the garage of the family's nine-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo, 49, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse in November, 
served a 30-day jail term and was placed on three years probation, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Charlotte Russo's often dramatic seven-week trial, the girl told the 
jury that she had suffered mental, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of 
her mother for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother punched, pinched, scratched, bit and forced her to sleep for long 
periods of time in the family's back-yard racquetball court, the girl 
testified. Her diet on many days consisted of a mixture of oatmeal and raw 
eggs, according to the girl's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo also took the stand, denying her daughter's accusations. The 
mother described the girl as a problem child who lied, stole and refused to 
follow commands. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband ordered the girl to sleep in the $75,000 racquetball 
court as punishment for violating her no-sodium diet. But Russo said the girl 
slept there only for a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russos' six other children -- including one, who like the victim is 
adopted -- all testified for the mother. The case seemed to turn when several 
neighbors recounted in court about incidents of seeing Russo beat the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted Russo of misdemeanor child abuse for charges of locking the 
girl in the racquetball court and physically abusing her. But the same jury 
deadlocked on a felony charge that Russo bit her daughter several times on the 
arms just hours before being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona announced last Friday that prosecutors would 
seek a second trial. That was when Russo decided to plead guilty, said her 
attorney, James M. Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set sentencing for Aug. 2, after probation officials complete a 
background report. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl -- adopted at age 1 -- has been placed in foster care.

GARDEN GROVE POLICE EXPAND THEIR TRANSLATION POWERS 
</P>

<P>
 The Police Department now speaks Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, home to Orange County's largest Korean American community, is 
employing a translation service to help dispatchers communicate with 
Korean-speaking emergency callers. With the new service, unveiled Tuesday, 
dispatchers punch in a phone number to reach translators for Korean and 139 
other languages -- vastly expanding translation powers that previously included 
only Spanish, Vietnamese and Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
 The city subscribed to the new "language line" service last month at the 
suggestion of Councilman Ho Chung, who himself has been called by police in the 
middle of the night to translate emergency calls in Korean. The added service 
targets the city's estimated 6,200 residents of Korean descent, but officials 
said it also will help dispatchers handle calls from throughout the city of 
143,000, which includes enclaves of immigrants from the Middle East and the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are dealing with a whole new set of demographics, and we're having 
to adjust," Police Capt. David J. Abrecht said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said the department, which has two patrol officers and one civilian 
staffer who speak Korean, is also seeking to expand its bilingual ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The translation service, which costs the city $6,000 a year, is offered by 
AT&T and has already been put into action. Dispatch supervisor Julie E. Pelnar 
said she used a Korean-language translator last week to help with an emergency 
call about a woman who needed an ambulance after suffering a heart attack or 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung, who recalled helping police talk to a woman who had wandered onto the 
freeway last year, pushed for the service after learning that Korean 
translation was not available through the state-sponsored translation program 
that the Police Department had been using. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great achievement for the city to show residents and business owners 
that we listen to their concerns," Chung said.

GARDEN GROVE TO OPEN RACE FOR 3 SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Applications will be available beginning July 18 for residents interested in 
running for mayor and two open seats in the City Council in the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for filing is Aug. 12, unless an incumbent does not file, City 
Clerk Carolyn Morris said.If that occurs, the filing deadline will be extended 
to Aug. 17 but only for that seats in which an incumbent does not file, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must be city residents and registered voters to run, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the incumbents -- Mayor Frank R. Kessler and council members 
Robert F. Dinsen and Mark Leyes -- have formally announced their candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler was elected to the two-year mayor term in 1992 after four years on the 
council. Dinsen, who is on his third four-year term, was first elected to the 
council in 1982. Leyes was the top vote-getter in 1990.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: VOTE FOR GAY CANDIDATE WAS A VOTE FOR TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Am I guilty of the worst kind of bigotry by casting a vote for someone because 
he is gay? 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I voted last month for Tony Miller, the Democratic candidate for 
secretary of state. And some readers were offended. Voting for a candidate 
purely because of his sexual orientation, they said, is just as dangerous as 
voting against a candidate because of his sexual orientation -- or race, or 
gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Respectfully, I disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Had I been unaware of Miller's sexual orientation, I might have voted for him 
anyway. After all, he was already performing ably as acting secretary of state. 
But I considered it a major plus that he could be the first openly gay 
statewide official. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is so wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I maintain that no one really has a clue what the secretary of state does, but 
that doesn't matter -- whoever holds the position can function as a potent 
political symbol. March Fong Eu gave hope to women and minorities; Miller's 
primary victory does the same for gays. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said for any political office. Give me qualified candidates 
who are women or members of ethnic minorities and I will vote for them, too, as 
long as their politics jibe with mine. 
</P>
<P>
 This is my own brand of affirmative action, guaranteed under the Constitution 
(but only since 1925, after all, since it took that long for my ilk to get the 
vote). 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I exercise this privilege specifically to make a statement about 
tolerance, to counteract those who would vote against a candidate because he or 
she is gay . . . or female, or not white. This, I suppose is the legacy of my 
outrage over Tom Bradley's loss to George Deukmejian in the 1982 California 
gubernatorial campaign. Racism, I believe, was responsible for the unexpected 
result of that election. 
</P>
<P>
 So I voted for Tony Miller because he is qualified for the job and because he 
is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I can be capricious or cranky in the voting booth. I can coldly vote my 
pocketbook or toss pragmatism to the wind, voting as I wish the world could be, 
not as it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, I cast my lot with Jerry Brown for President. 
</P>
<P>
 Need I say more? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of reasons I felt it important to support a gay candidate 
for state office. Perhaps my error was in being too flippant when I mentioned 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Homophobia is a thriving disease. Despite the recent celebrations of the 25th 
anniversary of the Stonewall riots, despite the success of last month's Gay 
Games in New York, this country has only a thin veneer of tolerance -- and not 
always even that -- toward gays. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for Tony Miller because he is gay and because two women in Mississippi 
are being hounded by violence and threats simply because they are lesbians and 
have created a place -- Camp Sister Spirit -- to train civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for Tony Miller because he is gay and because a teacher in San Diego 
is in trouble with school administrators for inviting her adult gay son to 
speak to her students after some of them made bigoted remarks about gays. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for Tony Miller because he is gay and because right-wing extremists -- 
the so-called stealth candidates -- who get themselves elected to positions of 
influence on school boards need their noses tweaked. 
</P>
<P>
 And I especially took Tony Miller's sexual orientation into consideration 
because there are world-class homophobes such as Bob Dornan in national office 
and because people like Dornan not only face no real censure or approbation, 
but are rewarded with reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 (Fortunately, Dornan is vulnerable this year. A compilation of his quotes has 
been published as part of the Democratic Party's "BeatBob" campaign. The book, 
"Shut up, Fag," takes its name from a remark made by Dornan's wife, Sallie, to 
a gay rights activist in 1988. Many of Dornan's bizarre utterances are 
included, such as "Every lesbian spear-chucker in this country is hoping I get 
defeated" from his 1992 campaign.) 
</P>
<P>
 Should it be irrelevant that a candidate is gay or female or brown or black? 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, yes.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; A RED-LETTER DAY, PLUS WHITE AND BLUE; REPRESENTATIVES 
OF MORE THAN 40 NATIONS ENJOY TRADITIONAL FOURTH OF JULY PICNIC 
</P>

 Consuls general representing more than 40 nations participated in that grand 
old American tradition, the Fourth of July picnic, at an Independence Day 
celebration staged by the Orange County Office of Protocol and International 
Visitors and Protocol Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation members invited the Los Angeles Consular Corps to Knott's Berry 
Farm in Buena Park Monday for an old-fashioned Independence Day party complete 
with fireworks, flag waving and apple pie. About 250 guests attended the 
$50-per-person bash, netting $10,000 for the foundation, which financially 
supports the Office of Protocol. Patriotic Party 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Gold Rush Camp was draped in red, white and blue banners for the 
picnic, with a row of American flags lined up at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a Fourth of July party before," said Gayle Anderson, Orange 
County chief of protocol, who sported a star-spangled white suit with a 
rhinestone-studded cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always celebrating the consuls generals' national holidays and thought it 
would be nice if we invited them to celebrate ours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation members put on a patriotic display for the diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 Kev Veturis sang the national anthem with the American flag and the flags of 
foreign countries as her backdrop. Guests then sat down to a buffet dinner of 
potato salad, corn on the cob, fried chicken, ribs and, of course, apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 John Frank, vice consul of Bangladesh and entertainment chairman, orchestrated 
a group of country dancers to demonstrate a few line dances such as the 
electric slide. 
</P>
<P>
 For the grand finale, guests ate ice cream bars while watching fireworks 
explode above Knott's. Saluting the Flag 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the international diplomats had never attended a Fourth of July bash, 
and they were impressed: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we'd like to copy in Sweden," said Peter Hammarstrom, the 
county's consul general and outgoing dean of the corps. "We've only had an 
official national day of celebration for 11 years, but we've been a country 
since 1523. It's my dream that we have a celebration like this. I like the 
general show of patriotism and how everyone dressed up in red, white and blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most guests were decked out in Americana attire. Mary Dell Barkouras 
made some party-goers want to salute with her festive stars-and-stripes vest 
and skirt topped with a blue cowboy hat. Marcia Giesler sported a blue pantsuit 
and a T-shirt emblazoned with a sparkling flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Protocol serves as a liaison between Orange County and foreign 
governments who are represented by consulates in California. Its mission is to 
encourage cultural, social and business interaction between the international 
community and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included: Kurt Welte, the Swiss consul general and the new 
dean of the consular corps; Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, president of Fiji (who 
arrived with much fanfare and Secret Service agents in tow); Charles Hostler, 
consul general of Bahrain; David Shaby, consul general of the Dominican 
Republic; Paul Bender and Virginia Knott Bender, John and Ginger Barnard, Scott 
and Marylou Hornsby, Carl and Pat Neisser, Richard Bryant, Pat Fleeson, Jerry 
Richards, Patricia Yoder, Felicia Bukaty, Fred and Eva Schneider, Lois 
Grisanti, Mariebelle Eustaquio, Elaine Redfield and Jale Kutay. KATHRYN BOLD

$1.7 MILLION AWARDED TO 7 PLANT WORKERS; LAWSUIT: JURY FINDS THAT CHEMICAL 
FIRMS FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE WARNINGS ON PRODUCTS USED BY LOCKHEED 
EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After two trials spanning two years, a Los Angeles jury Tuesday awarded seven 
Lockheed workers an estimated $1.7 million in damages after finding that a 
group of chemical companies failed to provide adequate warnings about products 
used by workers to build the Stealth fighter and other aircraft at the 
aerospace giant's former Burbank complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict in the marathon toxic exposure case involved seven "pilot" 
plaintiffs from a group of 624 past and present Lockheed employees. The awards 
announced Tuesday ranged from $708,600 for a former worker, who jurors 
concluded suffered brain and nerve damage as a result of chemical exposure, to 
$4,500 for an employee who was exposed to chemicals but suffered no serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from both sides had previously said they hoped a verdict in the case 
would guide future settlements. But Tuesday's mixed verdict raised the prospect 
of years-more litigation to resolve the remaining claims. Superior Court Judge 
Richard C. Hubbell scheduled an Aug. 5 conference to set a trial date for the 
next 15 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep pressing on with these cases," said Brian C. Gonzalez, an 
attorney representing the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said it was "terrific" that most of the eight chemical company 
defendants "were found to be the cause of these people's injuries."  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Laurence F. Janssen, an attorney who represented chemical giants 
Du Pont and Ashland, said he did not believe Tuesday's verdict would lead to 
future settlements. And he said the verdict supported defense contentions that 
Lockheed -- which had earlier reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the 
workers -- was mainly responsible, by failing to protect its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stemmed from illnesses allegedly caused by solvents, primers and 
epoxies used to build aircraft in the 1970s and '80s. The workers claimed they 
suffered ailments ranging from eye and skin irritations to cancer because 
chemical suppliers did not adequately explain the health risks or necessary 
safety precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 The original trial began in August, 1992, and ended nearly nine months later 
in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrial, which began in February, initially pitted 14 pilot plaintiffs 
against 20 chemical companies. By Tuesday, however, claims of seven of the 
plaintiffs had been dismissed and a dozen of the chemical firms either reached 
settlements or were exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the remaining 10 chemical companies, J.T. Baker Inc. and Dexter Corp., 
settled with the workers for an undisclosed amount after the first phase of the 
second trial left them liable for punitive damages, said Thomas V. Girardi, an 
attorney representing the Lockheed employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight remaining chemical company defendants, the jury found that seven 
-- including Du Pont and General Electric -- failed to adequately warn of the 
dangers of their products. Ashland Chemical Co. was cleared in five of the 
workers' cases and a mistrial was declared for the remaining two workers after 
the jury was unable to reach a majority verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies held responsible for providing inadequate warnings will pay all the 
economic damages, which are awarded to compensate for loss of work as a result 
of injuries, and they will also pay a percentage of the non-economic damages, 
which are awarded for pain and suffering, Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury awarded three of the workers an estimated $1.6 million in economic 
damages and awarded all seven just over $100,000 in non-economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severe case was that of George Wilson, who was awarded $647,300 in 
economic damages. "George Wilson's injuries are such that when he goes to the 
store he can't find the house he lived in for 20 years," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurors found the companies liable for only a small share of the 
non-economic damages, deciding that Lockheed was 80% to 86% responsible for 
these. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed will not have to pay any of those damages, however, because the 
workers already agreed to accept a $33-million settlement from the company, to 
be shared among all the defendants in proportion to their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed settlement averaged about $37,500 for each worker, with some 
garnering more than $100,000 apiece because they were alleged to have developed 
cancer or to have died as a result of their exposure to the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Lockheed) didn't pass on any of the material safety data sheet 
information to the workers," said Frank Serrano, jury foreman. "It was the 
predominant mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano said that for the most part, the other chemical companies provided 
adequate warnings, but that non-economic damages for pain and suffering were 
awarded mostly because carcinogens, cancer-causing agents, were contained in 
the chemicals they manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrial had been broken down into two phases in an attempt to simplify the 
proceedings after the original trial, which lasted eight months, then ended in 
a mistrial after 12 weeks of jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a landmark case," Judge Richard C. Hubbell told jurors Tuesday after 
their verdicts were announced. "You will be known as the good Lockheed jury."

UNORTHODOX ADVOCATE OFFERS HIS OWN DEFENSE; COURTS: IN OPENING DAY OF MURDER 
RETRIAL, JAILHOUSE ATTORNEY SCORES FEW POINTS ON BEHALF OF HIS CLIENT -- 
HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His opening statement to the jury lasted about 30 seconds. He asked one 
witness if she "hates" him, and prompted another to identify him as the man who 
threw lye in a woman's face 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing for the defense Tuesday in Van Nuys Superior Court was Ricardo H. 
Robinson, defendant and jailhouse lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson, the advocate, didn't score many points for Robinson, the client, 
during the first day of his murder retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want him for my lawyer," prosecutor Robert L. Cohen said outside 
the courtroom later. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is charged with murder, mayhem and related offenses for his alleged 
role in a plot to disfigure law school student Patricia Worrell. Police and 
prosecutors say the attack was paid for by her jilted fiance, fellow law 
student Richard Morton Gilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, a 34-year-old single mother, was studying for a law school exam on 
the evening of Aug. 14, 1980, when she opened the door of her Sylmar home to 
the two strangers. Burned and blinded, Worrell died 10 days later when the 
caustic chemical burned through her esophagus and an artery, causing her to 
bleed to death, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman and Bobby Ray Savage -- the Las Vegas pimp who Gilman paid $750 to 
disfigure Worrell -- are serving prison sentences of 25 years to life for their 
first-degree murder convictions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson's conviction was overturned two years ago, after a federal 
appeals court ruled police took incriminating statements from him after he had 
demanded a lawyer, but before one was provided. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled that Robinson's statements can't be introduced at the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try and tell you people the truth today in its rawest form," 
Robinson told the jury during his opening statement. "Because it's the truth, I 
don't think Mr. Cohen or this judge will allow me to tell it." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks drew an objection from prosecutor Cohen, and some legal 
instructions from Superior Court Judge Michael Harwin about the rules of 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Robinson persisted: "The truth is, people, I have spent the last 14 
years in prison for a crime I didn't commit." 
</P>
<P>
 When Cohen again objected, Robinson ended his argument, and sat down, saying, 
"I have nothing further if you won't let me speak and tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The day's witnesses included the physicians who treated Worrell; her son, 
William, who was 13 when his mother died; and a former prostitute who 
introduced Gilman to Savage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors cringed at gruesome descriptions of Worrell's injuries. One doctor 
testified that the lye continued to burn away her flesh long after she received 
her initial burns. 
</P>
<P>
 And the case nearly ended in a mistrial when a witness mentioned a taboo 
subject -- Robinson's confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was questioning former prostitute Kim Bricker about her contacts with 
police as a prosecution witness. One of his questions prompted her to blurt out 
that police "played me a tape of you confessing," while she was in custody in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Bricker, testifying under immunity from prosecution for her role in the 
scheme, said she introduced Gilman to Savage after meeting him in a Las Vegas 
hotel bar. After they had sex, Bricker said, Gilman asked if she knew anybody 
who could "beat up" his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question from Robinson, Bricker said she recalled 
conversations between Savage and Robinson "that you were going to Los Angeles 
to work over Gilman's girlfriend." She testified that Robinson had told her he 
traded methamphetamine ("speed") for the rental car they used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim," Robinson asked, "Do you know who threw the lye at Miss Worrell?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know which one of you did," she said. "All I know is one knocked, one 
threw." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell's son, William, 27, currently in a prison drug rehabilitation program, 
testified that his mother told him "on her deathbed" that a black man threw the 
lye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Worrell, do you know who threw that stuff at your mother?" asked 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my heart, yes I do," Worrell replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who was that, sir?" Robinson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you Mr. Robinson?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I believe it was you," Worrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to apologize for the loss of your mother's life," said Robinson, 
adding that police "lied" about his involvement.

FISH, PESTICIDES PRESSED INTO BATTLE; HEALTH: THEY'RE BEING USED TO KILL 
MOSQUITOES AND RODENTS BREEDING IN QUAKE-DAMAGED POOLS, BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To combat another aftereffect of the Northridge earthquake, Los Angeles County 
health officials said Tuesday that insect-eating fish and pesticides are being 
used to kill mosquitoes and rodents that are breeding in some quake-damaged 
pools and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before a Los Angeles City Council panel on earthquake recovery, 
county health officials said a survey of 324 quake-damaged buildings found that 
nearly 5% of damaged pools had become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and about 
2% of vacant buildings were rodent-infested. 
</P>
<P>
 In other efforts to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods, the Ad Hoc Committee 
on Earthquake Recovery gave redevelopment officials the preliminary go-ahead to 
establish quake "recovery areas" -- similar to redevelopment areas -- where 
property taxes could be used to back bonds that would finance rebuilding in the 
hardest hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the panel also was told of an increasing trend among residents in 
quake-damaged areas toward mixing garden waste with quake debris, a mix the 
city has been hauling away from residential curbsides for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel instructed the Community Redevelopment Agency to bring the recovery 
proposal to the entire City Council next week and to draw specific boundaries 
of the proposed recovery areas -- concentrated in the San Fernando Valley -- 
that would be considered in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the quake committee, said after the 
meeting that the recovery areas will not give city officials the same type of 
powers to condemn properties that have generated criticism in traditional 
redevelopment areas throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't be a redevelopment project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mosquito and rodent infestation problems were identified after county 
health officials conducted a random survey of severely damaged buildings to 
look for possible quake-related health problems, said Art Tilzer, director of 
the consumer protection division of the county's Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat mosquitoes in pools that have not been maintained, Tilzer said 
mosquito abatement officials decided in February to release into the pools 
schools of mosquito fish that would eat the insect larvae. Where abatement 
officials found rats feeding off food in vacant buildings, county health 
officials either distributed rodent pesticide to neighbors or themselves laced 
the buildings with the poison, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents parts of the hard-hit Sherman 
Oaks area, said complaints to his office about rats from the neighbors of 
vacant quake-damaged buildings had increased substantially after the Jan. 17 
quake, indicating that the problem could be much more serious than the survey 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints have been from neighbors around Colbath Avenue, where 
city officials have identified one of 13 clusters of particularly troublesome 
vacant quake-damaged buildings, known as "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing that the problem is less than 5%," Yaroslavsky 
said after the panel's meeting. "My anecdotal evidence indicates that the 
problem is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he believes the rodent problem will diminish as the food 
supply runs out. But he said he fears the mosquito problem will merely increase 
with the summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad hoc panel also heard testimony Tuesday on the increasing problem of 
residents mixing brush and other garden waste with quake debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Santamaria, the city's senior engineer in charge of the quake cleanup, 
said about 10% of the debris hauled away by city crews now includes green 
waste, up from only about 2% in the weeks immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal emergency money financing the city's quake cleanup can be 
used only for quake-related debris, the city will stop hauling away debris that 
is clearly not a result of the quake, Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, sanitation officials will begin to use ribbons to mark trash 
they believe is not associated with the quake, leaving it behind for residents 
to sort through and dispose. Notices also will be placed on non-quake trash, 
giving residents a phone number to obtain more information on the quake-debris 
program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Bernson told Santamaria the panel would leave it up to the 
discretion of sanitation officials to decide what was acceptable debris for 
cleanup. But he told them not to be "nit-picking." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's difficult to try to do a police action" during the cleanup 
efforts, he said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE CUTS 10% OF FALL COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Due to stubborn financial problems and dropping enrollment, Pierce College has 
cut more than 10% of its fall curriculum, the school's president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bring the budget into line," said Pierce President Mary Lee."We 
can't continue sliding into a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 courses have been dropped from the 1,800 offered last fall, Lee 
said, capping a two-year loss of about 20% of the classes at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinking curriculum mirrors a decline in the Pierce student body, which 
dwindled from about 20,000 to about 15,000 during the last decade and fell 
sharply during the last four years. Pierce gets funding from the state based on 
the number of students it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts also come in the face of a budget shortfall of about $1 million this 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to rebuild the student body, Pierce administrators are planning 
to send letters within the next several weeks to recent graduates of high 
schools in the West Valley, encouraging them to attend Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also plans to send Valley residents about 200,000 copies of a 
Pierce promotion that will be inserted into an issue of The Times later this 
month -- another tactic Lee used successfully at Valley College, where she 
spent 10 years as top administrator. A similar, 12-page promotion was sent out 
with newspapers in May. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, the tactics have failed to stop the Pierce slide. As of June 
23, enrollment was down 15% from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stop a four-year downward trend, so it takes some time," Lee 
said. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SUMMER CAMPS OFFER FUN FOR ALL YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether it be for little kids or big kids, water babies or artsy teens, parks 
and playgrounds are offering a splash of fun, as well as classes and camps, 
this summer throughout the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department facilities -- where between 
5,000 and 7,000 Valley youngsters are enrolled -- the day after the Fourth of 
July meant the first day of summer programs, according to Valley Region Supt. 
Olga Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parks and playgrounds provide extended care programs on top of the 9 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. scheduled activities at day camps. "That way parents on their way to 
work can drop off their kids and pick them up as late as 6 o'clock," Singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges, YMCA/YWCAs and other Valley cities are offering their own 
specialized summer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Pierce College extension program, Sharon Cort is teaching weekly 
guitar lessons to children ages 8 to 11 and a vaudeville class where the 
youngsters will dance, sing and perform comedy sketches in the style of W.C. 
Fields and the Marx Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lupin Hill Elementary School, the city of Calabasas will have tykes ages 4 
to 5 kicking and punching away in a two-month-long Shotokan karate class. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, of the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department, said she's happy 
to report that, despite the Jan. 17 quake, all summer day camps are filled to 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, filling the camps was no easy task, said Wendy Wilkinson of the Van 
Nuys / Sherman Oaks Recreation Center, where the camp coordinators "struggled 
(to get) up to 110 (participants) a week before the camp started." The turnout 
was surprisingly slow considering the first field trip will be to Raging 
Waters.  
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Wilkinson said the camp is filled with a waiting list of more than 
50 children well before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 At Shadow Ranch Recreation Center in West Hills, a summer day camp for 
preschoolers and children up to the age of 12 is being offered. About 30 
children will spend five days a week for seven weeks participating in arts and 
crafts projects, water games and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the field trips that 10-year-old Rhiammon Walker said she's excited 
about. "We're going to Magic Mountain, Malibu Beach and the Reseda pool," said 
Rhiammon, who was at first hesitant about going to a summer day camp because 
she was afraid there wouldn't be any kids her age there. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Walker, 8, said she especially enjoys learning new games like 
"carems," which involves scooting black and red checkers across a board with a 
junior version of a billiards cue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just fun," said Brian Woolf, 9, as he wiped the sand off his face, 
having just nose-dived into the sandbox from the swings. "You get to do things 
instead of watching the TV and going 'Duhhhh.' " MAKI BECKER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; RING OF THIEVES 
TARGETS ATMS FOR QUICK CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They sit in a nondescript van trying to be as discreet as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in the driver's seat pretends to read a book but is also watching for 
cops. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy in the back has a video camera with a long-distance lens, focused on 
the bank. For hours, he records the finger movements that reveal the secret 
personal identification codes people enter to access their ATM accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the men will come back and -- if they are lucky -- withdraw thousands 
of dollars in cash from those same accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime is bank card fraud, an offense for which those convicted go to 
federal prison. The risks are many. And police say the odds are good that a 
criminal will sit in a van all day waiting for a chance to score and still come 
up empty. 
</P>
<P>
 But for more than a year and a half, a ring of ATM thieves -- who may well 
look like the men described above -- have been wandering the Valley, and much 
of the rest of Southern California, in quest of easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," Jim Bauer, a spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, said in a 
confidential tone. "We don't want any copy cats. We hate to even talk about it 
because we don't want to plant the seed in people's heads . . . It is not 
common yet, but people are pretty well worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 About all Bauer could say was yes, the Secret Service is investigating several 
ATM theft rings in the area, but because arrests are pending, he was unable to 
give details for fear of jeopardizing the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, however, the Secret Service estimated that the ring had stolen 
at least $100,000 from Bank of America customers' accounts, mostly in the 
Valley and the Palm Springs area. That was seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, officers throughout Southern California have been on the lookout 
for an apparently roving band of thieves who repeatedly strike, only to quickly 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement personnel, this is how a typical operation might 
work: 
</P>
<P>
 First, thieves stake out a bank machine, often waiting in a van or truck 
parked so that they can see the ATM's keyboard. As people use the ATM, the 
crooks record their personal access numbers. If the thieves are using a video 
camera, the time of each transaction is automatically recorded. If they are 
using binoculars or a telescope, they record the time themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, if customers throw their receipts away at the ATM, the thieves make a 
mental note, and later, dig the receipts out of the trash. By pairing the time 
on the ATM receipt with the time on the video recorder, the thieves are able to 
match account numbers with personal access codes.  
</P>
<P>
 And finally, using an encoding machine hooked up to a personal computer, the 
bad guys encode the purloined account numbers on whatever suits them -- 
everything from stolen bank cards to pieces of poster board -- and withdraw 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The only limit on the take is the balance in the account and the daily limit 
on ATM withdrawals -- usually $200 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Los Angeles, which is already the bank robbery capital 
of the country, has also won a place in the lore of ATM fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the city's Security Pacific Bank lost nearly $350,000 when a special 
card was used to steal cash from 300 customer accounts over a long weekend. At 
the time, it was the largest reported ATM crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, a 28-year-old Los Angeles computer programmer was indicted 
on charges of organizing a plot in which he allegedly planned to raid 7,400 
Bank of America accounts via ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his job at GTE Information Services, which handled electronic fund 
transfers for financial institutions and ATM networks, Mark Koenig was able to 
obtain customers' account numbers, prosecutors said. They said he smuggled an 
encoding machine out of the office and waited for a three-day weekend when the 
group -- which included his wife -- planned to travel around the country making 
cash withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot, which could have netted $17 million, was uncovered when one of 
Koenig's co-conspirators balked and informed the Secret Service of the plan, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, some banks have begun leaving out the final digits of account 
numbers on ATM receipts. To avoid becoming a victim, authorities suggest that 
ATM users position their bodies to block an observer's view of the keypad when 
entering their codes, and dispose of their torn-up receipts at home.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PROJECT TO COMBAT CHILD ABUSE BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their methods are innovative but the two San Fernando Valley psychologists 
heading an $800,000 child-abuse prevention project are trying to prove a simple 
point: Good parenting can be taught in 15 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With a four-year $804,000 grant from the California Wellness Foundation, 
psychology professors John Lutzker of the University of Judaism and Ron Doctor 
of Cal State Northridge are launching Project SafeCare this month, targeting 
more than 300 families in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the program participants will be abusive parents and the other 
half will be families considered at risk for abusive behavior. Nurses, case 
workers and graduate students will educate the families according to a 15-week 
formula of in-home training and evaluation. There are 10,000 child-abuse 
referrals in Los Angeles County every month, about 30% of which involve 
children from birth to 4 years of age, according to the project directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutzker, who founded a child-abuse prevention project in Illinois with a 
nine-month framework, said the goal is to deliver the same core prevention 
lessons in a much shorter period. Eventually, he said, the sessions might even 
be recorded on video and distributed through health care organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The training will include lessons in safety, health care and nurturing. 
Parents will learn, for instance, how to store poisons out of their children's 
reach and otherwise child-proof their homes. They will be taught to recognize 
and report illnesses in their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, teaching parents to speak affectionately to their children, play 
interactive games with them and keep them interested during car rides and 
everyday errands, Lutzker said, will help to prevent the disruptive behavior 
that sometimes precedes abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is part of more than $20 million in violence prevention pledged by 
the Wellness Foundation, created two years ago by Health Net as part of a deal 
with the state allowing the Woodland Hills-based foundation to drop its 
nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 If Project SafeCare works, Lutzker said, the early intervention model could 
have wide-reaching implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are saving a generation worth of money if you are successful," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; HUD TO LOAN CHURCH $3.5 MILLION IN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A church-owned apartment complex for senior citizens has been approved for a 
$3.5-million, low-interest loan from the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to pay for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas C. Baker, administrator of Fickett Towers, 14801 Sherman Way, Van Nuys, 
said that he had worried about getting the help "night and day since January 
the 17th." 
</P>
<P>
 Word that the loan had been approved was announced by the office of Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake did not leave the 198-unit apartment building 
uninhabitable. The building was green-tagged, meaning it was safe to occupy, 
despite about $3.5 million in damage, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 One wall was weakened structurally, Baker said, and part of the loan money 
will be used to reinforce it. Other damage at the building included water 
damage and cosmetic damage to walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment building is owned by Shepherd of the Hills Baptist Church in 
Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid from the HUD Earthquake Loan Program can be used to make mortgage 
payments delayed by the earthquake and for bringing the building up to current 
city building codes, as well as for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has been unable to complete repairs on the building without the 
federal assistance, Baker said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY TARGETS RESIDENTS WHO FEED PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its continuing effort to eradicate pigeons that plague business owners 
here, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday asked city staff members to begin a 
campaign to educate residents not to feed the pesky birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The education plan includes distributing flyers to persons feeding pigeons 
explaining how birds congregate where there is food. The campaign also will 
include placing posters in storefront windows and signs outside asking 
residents not to feed the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 A resource list developed by the city also is available for business owners 
interested in alternative pigeon control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members asked the city staff to expand a proposed ordinance banning 
feeding pigeons in the city's central business district to cover the entire 
city, including parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, anyone caught feeding pigeons could be fined a 
maximum of $50 for the first offense, $100 for the second offense and $250 for 
the third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will review the revised ordinance next week. If adopted, the law 
would not go into effect for three months to allow the city's education 
campaign time to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials drafted the ordinance after residents and animal-rights activists 
protested a council decision in April to trap and kill the prolific fowl by 
putting them in a cloth bag and tying it to the tailpipe of a car with its 
engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the measure was necessary to rid the city's business 
district of birds that mess awnings, sidewalks and ledges and that may present 
health hazards to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The council backed away from the plan and asked the city staff for alternative 
means to deal with the burgeoning pigeon population after more than 120 callers 
to City Hall complained about the eradication method. 
</P>
<P>
 During its weekly meeting Tuesday, the council also authorized city staff to 
advertise for bids from companies that eradicate birds to find a long-term 
solution to reduce a downtown flock, now estimated at 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will accept proposals that suggest a number of pigeon eradication 
plans including bird seed spiked with contraceptives, trapping and relocation, 
and the use of ultrasonic devices, said George Miller, director of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials want to control the pigeon population in an area bordered by 
Colorado Street to the south, Glenoaks Boulevard to the north, Central Avenue 
to the west and Maryland Avenue to the east.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also states that pigeon eradication is needed at Fire Station 21 
and in the Civic Center Plaza at the Perkins Building. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 A motorist was killed in Van Nuys after his speeding car slammed into a parked 
car and spun out of control, hitting two other vehicles and sending a second 
driver to the hospital, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Gonzalez, 23, of Van Nuys was driving south on Woodman Avenue near 
Valerio Street about 11:50 p.m. Saturday when his vehicle sideswiped a parked 
car and careened into oncoming traffic, Officer Frank Zdroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it spun across the road, Gonzalez's car was struck broadside by a 
northbound car driven by Hamik Lementsyan, 43, of Van Nuys. The impact from 
that crash knocked Gonzalez's car into yet another parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics from the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department. Lementsyan was taken by ambulance to Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, where he was in stable condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Gonzalez appeared to be driving as fast as 80 
m.p.h. before the initial crash. Zdroy said the speed limit in the area is 35 
m.p.h. AARON CURTISS

<P>
 A 1-year-old Pacoima girl died over the weekend after her uncle accidentally 
backed a pickup truck over her in the family's driveway, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Cruz was crushed beneath the wheels of a truck driven by Eduardo 
Maya, 25, about 10 p.m. Saturday in the 11800 block of Chadron Avenue in 
Pacoima, Officer Frank Zdroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maya told police that he was watching a movie in the house when the child's 
mother asked him to help move some vehicles in the driveway. Guadalupe 
accompanied her mother outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Maya, who does not have a driver's license, said that when another car parked 
behind the truck backed out, he followed. But when he had pulled the truck 
halfway into the street, he said, he saw Guadalupe lying on the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he became sick and could remember nothing else about the incident. The 
girl was rushed by her parents to Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, but 
she was pronounced dead about 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Zdroy said Maya was not cited or arrested by police for driving without a 
license because the incident occurred on private property. AARON CURTISS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; LEADERS CRITICIZE YAROSLAVSKY'S EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some community leaders have criticized Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky's recent work on two important community issues -- parking and the 
proposed widening of the Van Nuys Boulevard-Ventura Boulevard intersection in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky issued a news release last week saying that his office had helped 
find replacement parking for a soon-to-be-closed public lot and contributed to 
the resolution of the controversial widening issue. Ventura Boulevard will be 
widened for 150 feet west of Van Nuys Boulevard, rather than for a total 580 
feet east and west of Van Nuys Boulevard, as originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But community activists say they are unhappy that alternative parking 
replacing the public lot on Cedros Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard has been 
secured only through Nov. 23. The replacement parking is at La Reina Fashion 
Plaza in the 14600 block of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists also have complained that the widening -- which necessitates 
narrowing a sidewalk to make room for an additional left-turn lane -- impedes 
their goal of making the area more attractive to pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky labeled the complaints "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased that there is a resolution to this and everybody's 
concerns have been taken into account and that's it," he said. "The most 
important thing is that the community is going to be served. The most 
dysfunctional intersection in Sherman Oaks is going to be made functional 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the widening, Tom Grant, a board member of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. and a member of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review 
Board, said he objects to the sidewalk being narrowed. He said that it is in 
the middle of a strip that the planning review board is trying to make a 
pedestrian area under a conceptual street-scape program there. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, an Encino community leader, said the compromise "cuts out 
the heart of the Specific Plan." Under that plan for Ventura Boulevard, he 
said, street widenings are "the single most important improvement to mitigate 
the traffic problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said he 
appreciates that the council office found the alternative parking, but that the 
future concerns him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinder words for Yaroslavsky came from community leader Jeff Brain, who 
pronounced himself "satisfied" with the widening compromise. He said he 
believes that the council office will find replacement parking beyond Nov. 23.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SCHOOL BOARD PICKS APONIK FOR TOP POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Burbank school board has named David Aponik superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Aponik, deputy superintendent since March, will head the school system of more 
than 13,000 students starting July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top priorities are rebuilding Burbank's schools, maintaining a balanced 
budget in difficult financial times and the restructuring of our educational 
programs," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aponik replaces Arthur Pierce, who has resigned effective this month after a 
somewhat stormy seven-year tenure. The school board voted last week to promote 
Aponik. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year veteran of the Burbank schools, Aponik was the only candidate that 
the school board seriously considered for the $93,500-a-year position, board 
member Elena Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of confidence in Dave Aponik," she said. "We've seen him really 
rise to the occasion many times when the superintendent was out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan-born deputy superintendent, 41, has been in charge of personnel 
matters, health services, and labor relations and negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career in Burbank's public schools as a psychologist in 1981 and 
gradually moved his way into management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Aponik studied psychology throughout his college years and graduated with a 
bachelor's degree from UCLA in 1970, a master's degree from Cal State 
Northridge in 1976 and a Ph.D from USC in 1980. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

MOTHER PLEADS GUILTY IN CHILD-ABUSE CASE; COURTS: WESTLAKE WOMAN ACCEPTS 
AGREEMENT THAT WILL KEEP HER OUT OF STATE PRISON. VICTIM, 16, IS CRITICAL OF 
PLEA BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo, the affluent Westlake mother accused of locking her teen-age 
daughter in a back-yard racquetball court, pleaded guilty to felony child abuse 
Tuesday after a judge promised she would spend no more than six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement, which came after a jury deadlocked 11 to 1 last month for 
conviction on the felony, was criticized by the 16-year-old victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she should get more. That's not even a year," the girl said outside 
court. "I was in the racquetball court for two whole years. She's not going to 
know what it's like at all. It is not going to be drilled into that thick skull 
of hers." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo appeared nervous as she entered her guilty plea before Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you plead to inflicting corporal injury on a child?" Campbell asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guilty," the 50-year-old Russo replied softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing was set for Aug. 2, after probation officials complete a background 
report on Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in light blue slacks and a thin white jacket, Russo maintained a stern 
demeanor throughout the hearing and left the Hall of Justice without talking to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But before her plea, as she headed into Campbell's third-floor courtroom, 
Russo made an obscene gesture at a Times photographer. Last month, after the 
jury convicted her on a misdemeanor child abuse charge, Russo hit the 
photographer with her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, James M. Farley, said he was disappointed by the resolution of 
the 13-month case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to see it end this way, I really am, because I don't think she 
committed a felony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the jury deadlocked last month, prosecutors said they would seek a 
second trial unless Russo pleaded guilty to a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office did not challenge the judge's promise not to 
sentence Russo to prison. She could have faced up to six years on the felony 
conviction. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said it was unlikely that any 
judge would have sent Russo to prison, given her lack of a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that the case is resolving, and I think it is resolving on a 
positive note for the victim," Corona said. She disputed the victim's 
contention that Russo was receiving light treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people in custody who could do 180 days standing on their 
head," Corona said. "It's nothing big for them. It's a big deal for Mrs. 
Russo." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Farley said he would recommend that any jail sentence meted 
out to Russo be served in the county's work-furlough program rather than County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Russo has accepted a clerical position with a Westlake real estate 
firm. Being employed is a condition of acceptance into the work-furlough 
program, Farley said. Participants in the program spend nights at a county 
facility but are allowed to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo and her stockbroker husband, Richard, were arrested May 24, 1993, and 
charged with child abuse after neighbors reported seeing Charlotte Russo attack 
the girl, then 15, in the garage of the family's nine-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified about years of suffering at the hands of her mother, who 
she said handled much of the discipline in the household while her father 
logged long hours at work. 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven-week trial, the girl testified for five days -- saying her 
mother had punched, pinched, scratched, bit and forced her to sleep for long 
periods of time in the racquetball court. On many days her diet consisted of 
oatmeal and raw eggs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo also took the stand, denying her daughter's accusations. The mother 
described the girl as a problem child who lied, stole and refused to follow 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said her husband ordered the girl to sleep in the $75,000 racquetball 
court as punishment for violating her no-sodium diet. But Russo said the girl 
slept there only for a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 The case seemed to turn, however, when several neighbors recounted seeing 
Russo beat the victim. One neighbor said she was standing on her balcony behind 
the Russo home several years ago when she saw Charlotte Russo pounding the girl 
in the head with a gym shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo, 49, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse last November and 
served a 30-day jail term in work furlough, officials said. He was also placed 
on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first interview since her testimony, the girl -- adopted when she was a 
year old -- criticized the plea agreement but also said she might consider 
reunification with her family eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, now living in foster care in Moorpark, said she was happy that a 
second trial will not be necessary, but added that her mother does not seem to 
be remorseful. Rather, she said, her mother appears to have pleaded guilty 
because she felt backed into a corner by the district attorney's insistence 
that she plead to a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems as though she didn't have a choice, unless she wants to go to jail 
for three years," the girl said, referring to a possible state prison term. "In 
a way, she admits it but she still hasn't said, 'I'm sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the short interview, which was conducted under the supervision of the 
girl's foster mother, the teen-ager appeared to be in a good mood, often joking 
about her mother's case and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that Russo, a registered nurse, was preparing for a job in real estate, 
the girl said, "I hope she's not going to sell racquetball courts." 
</P>
<P>
 As for reunification with her family -- which includes six other children, one 
who is younger and also adopted, and five who are grown -- the girl said: "Not 
right now. Maybe in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that all her brothers and sisters testified for her mother and said 
they gave her "dirty looks" when she came to court to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew what went on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today marks her first full year with her foster mother, who is married and has 
two children, ages 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like each other," the girl said. "I get along with her family." 
</P>
<P>
 The foster mother, a homemaker and independent nutritional-product 
distributor, said the trial was hard on the girl. "It was very rough on her, 
very rough on her, as you can imagine. Her whole life changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who had not been in public school full time since her mother took 
her out for home schooling several years ago, is scheduled to begin her senior 
year at Moorpark High School in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, things are looking up," the girl said.

BRAVOS GREET THOUSAND OAKS' CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; CULTURE: TICKET BUYERS FLOCK TO 
THE RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY. MAYOR ALEX FIORE SAYS IT'S HIGH TIME THE CITY GOT 
ITS DIGNIFIED DUE. 
</P>

<P>
 The hottest tickets in Thousand Oaks were on sale at The Oaks mall Tuesday 
morning, as about 50 people lined up to reserve seats for events at the 
soon-to-be-completed Civic Arts Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 At a ribbon-cutting ceremony, city officials opened the Civic Arts Plaza box 
office in the mall and then scurried to find places in line before the more 
popular shows sold out.  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents waited three hours before reaching the new ticket counter 
because of the ceremony, but all said they were happy to be able to see theater 
events come to their city.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to this for months," said Geraldine Sanders, who 
arrived at the mall at 8 a.m. to be the first in line for tickets. "This is 
going to be the jewel of the community, and I want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowds gathered in front of the storefront box office, members of the 
city staff, the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Civic Theaters 
Commission joined Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore, who cut the ribbon opening 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of a new experience for the residents of our city and 
adjacent cities," Fiore said. "Let the games begin." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he had already pinpointed seats he wants for upcoming 
performances, but he, like everyone else, had to stand in line before ordering 
his tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for me, and for all these people, this is really a great experience," 
Fiore said. "Here we are, able to buy tickets right here in our own community 
for shows that will take place right here, not in L.A. or Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall box office will be open until September, when it will be replaced by 
the box office at the arts plaza itself. The public premiere will be "Man of La 
Mancha" on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said he was buying tickets for magician David Copperfield's performance 
in December. But the box office has seats available for 13 shows, including 
"Mark Twain Tonight," "The Nutcracker" and a performance of the musical "Little 
Shop of Horrors," which will come to the theater next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets range in price from $5 to $45, depending on the show and the location 
of the seats. Most seats are between $18 and $35. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the arts center is on schedule, officials said. On Tuesday 
workers attached rigging to one face of the building, which will hold a curtain 
made of copper. 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain is expected to be attached to the building in pieces over the next 
three weeks, said Ed Johnduff, the Civic Arts Plaza project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller Forum Theatre will be completed in August and opened in September, 
and the larger Civic Auditorium is expected to be finished in October, Johnduff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we've started selling tickets, we know we've got to deliver on the 
building," he said. "At this point, it looks like we're right on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said that the fact that the building is on schedule and under budget "is 
an impressive feat for this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who waited for tickets agreed, though some were concerned about the look 
of the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to have seen it not so tall, so that it blocks some of the views of 
the city," said Walter Bradley, a Camarillo resident. "But you can't have your 
cake and eat it too. And we're real happy they've finally put a theater in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Davis, chairwoman of the city Civic Theaters Commission, said the box 
office opening represented the end of a long process and the beginning of a new 
chapter in Thousand Oaks history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really completes the city," she said. "We have a house for the seniors, 
we have a house for the teen-agers, we have a library and now we have a house 
for the arts." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza box office is selling tickets for Civic Arts Plaza 
performances. Tickets can also be purchased at any Ticketmaster location. The 
arts plaza box office is located on the first floor of The Oaks mall. It is 
open Mondays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; 
and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, call 449-ARTS.

<P>
 An 80-year-old Sherman Oaks woman was killed Tuesday by a hit-and-run driver 
as she crossed the parking area of a small shopping plaza, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma Lebovitz was struck by a car identified only as a beige or tan Chevrolet 
Nova that was headed north at the time of the 3 p.m. accident, according to 
witnesses, said Officer Bill Mulvihill of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-mall is on the southwest corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Erwin 
Street, Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebovitz was pronounced dead at North Hollywood Medical Center, he said.

VALLEY MAN HELD IN TAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Northridge man is among five suspected graffiti painters scheduled to be 
arraigned on vandalism charges in San Francisco today. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged "taggers," including Jason Drew, 23, were taken into custody about 
2 a.m. Sunday after San Francisco police responded to a complaint of graffiti, 
Lt. Daniel Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived on Clay Street, they saw the five in the area and some 
had paint on their hands, Lawson said. At least four buildings had been tagged 
and damages were more than $5,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is unusual because taggers generally target businesses near or in 
their hometowns, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They generally just spray in their own territory," Lawson said. "This is 
somewhat unique in that their artistic license has been extended a few hundred 
miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested were Kevin Martin, 18; Shawn Buss, 22, and Jesse Rosen, 22, all 
of Simi Valley, and Carter Hogue, 21, of Lake Elsinore. The five were being 
held at San Francisco County Jail.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EXOTIC DANCE CLUB IS THE SUBJECT OF 
COURT-ORDERED COVER-UP; LEGAL: TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER PREVENTS CASTAIC 
JUNCTION DANCERS FROM APPEARING IN THE NUDE. TWO SIDES WILL MEET TODAY TO TRY 
TO SETTLE DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley's only exotic dance club, opening full-time today, 
will not feature anything too exotic -- at least for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 A restraining order prevents Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club from 
presenting all-nude dancing as planned. Instead, the dancing women at the club, 
located near Six Flags Magic Mountain, will be wearing bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Land & Farming Co., the developer that leases the building to the 
club operator, got the court order demanding that the women cover up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family-oriented community and we don't feel this type of 
establishment is appropriate," said Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for the 
developer. She said club officials did not indicate they planned to offer 
exotic dancing when they signed the lease for the building. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her company began hearing rumors the club would be a strip joint a 
few weeks ago, but did not confirm them until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment is allowed by the lease, but none that is "lewd or offensive," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restraining order was obtained Friday in Van Nuys Superior 
Court. A court hearing on the matter is scheduled July 15, although the two 
sides are expected to meet today to try to resolve their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, done up in pink and green, will open at 11 a.m. for lunch and then 
continue on a seven-day-a-week lunch and dinner schedule. The restaurant is in 
a separate area from the lounge where the dancers are to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the club, Stuart Caldwell, was not available for comment late 
Tuesday on the lease, but indicated earlier he intends to challenge the 
restraining order so that he can offer all-nude dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had worked in similar establishments for 11 years and considers 
Santa Clarita the ideal location for a live adult entertainment club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is just screaming for entertainment of this type," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the noise from many, including the building's owner, sounds more like a 
moan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved up here 22 years ago to raise a family," said Andi Karwoski, a 
receptionist for the Valencia Water Co. voicing her objection to the Castaic 
Junction club across the street. "I never felt any need for adult 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Miles, another Valencia Water Co. employee, expressed more disappointment 
than disdain at the nature of the club, located in a building that has housed 
several other restaurants over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping for more of a family place where I could eat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, the club's manager (who would not give his last name), said that 
Castaic Junction will be "high class," with no intimate touching of the dancers 
allowed by customers. The dancers will also not be allowed to date customers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get this idea of men coming and getting their kicks and that's not 
what we're about," Richard said. "You come in, see beautiful women. It's a 
fantasy world." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell said many of the club's estimated 35 dancers are local and include 
college students, working professionals and single mothers. The club manager 
said the swimsuits the dancers will be wearing -- at least at first -- will be 
skimpy. "They're about the limit of what you can wear," Richard said, but he 
added: "You can see as much legally on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Caldwell's enthusiasm over opening the only adult club in Santa 
Clarita, history has shown that sex-oriented businesses have not done well 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The only cable company to carry the Playboy channel took it off the air due to 
lack of viewership. A drive-through condom shop faltered within months of 
opening due to lack of business and pressure from opponents including 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who threatened to videotape customers at the location. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Tellez, assistant manager of a trucking firm adjacent to the club, said he 
might eat there occasionally since it is the closest restaurant to where he 
works. But he waved off the suggestion of going to the club for the 
entertainment, stating he might have done so 20 years ago, but not now. 
</P>
<P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN SENTENCED IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former probation officer and Canyon Country resident has been sentenced to 
10 years in federal prison and a $50,000 fine for producing child pornography 
in Thailand, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Alan Nelson, 46, admitted to traveling to Thailand in November, 1991, 
and photographing four boys under the age of 18 engaged in sexual activity, U. 
S. Atty. Nora Manella said in a prepared statement. Police officials who 
arrested Nelson said he was part of an extensive underground network that 
traded pictures and videotapes of minors engaged in sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson received the sentence Friday after pleading guilty March 14 to six 
counts of producing child pornography. U. S. District Court Judge Manuel Real 
also ordered Nelson be under a three-year period of supervised released when 
his prison term is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson could have received between roughly eight to 10 years in federal 
prison, said Assistant U. S. Atty. Debra Yang. He was indicted on 29 counts, 
many of which were dropped because as part of the plea bargain. The plea did 
not significantly affect Nelson's sentence because he would have served many of 
the counts concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is a former Los Angeles County probation officer who spent the last two 
years of his 15-year career at the Camp Scudder juvenile probation camp in 
Saugus, working with 16- to 18-year-old boys. Officials at the camp said none 
of the boys there were involved in the pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department searched Nelson's 
house June 2, 1992, finding the pictures he took in Thailand as well as other 
child pornography. However, he fled the area before officials could find and 
arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was listed as one of the 10 most wanted fugitives by the U. S. Customs 
Service between July, 1992, and February, 1994. He was arrested in February in 
Joplin, Mo., where he had tried to throw investigators off his trial by using a 
false name, changing his hair color and growing a beard.

SWIMMING POOL SAFETY; SAFEGUARDING YOUR CHILDREN AGAINST BACK-YARD INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two recent near-drownings in the San Fernando Valley illustrate the 
dangers of inadequate safety measures at residential swimming pools. Both cases 
were examples of what often occurs: children can drown or nearly-drown in only 
a few minutes without adequate supervision.  
</P>
<P>
 Most parents probably don't realize the majority of drownings occur when a 
child is last seen in the house or other area of the yard -- nowhere near the 
pool. For this reason, health officials stress isolating the pool from the rest 
of the yard with "barrier" fencing and other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many drowning victims are children under 5 -- in some states drowning is the 
leading cause of death for this age group -- and in California about 100 
children a year drown in their own pools. But older children and those who know 
how to swim are not immune. Statistics show 25% of all childhood drowning 
victims have had swimming lessons.  
</P>
<P>
 A statewide emergency regulation put into effect in February requires barriers 
between house and pool. In the Valley, when a new pool is built, a city 
Department of Building and Safety inspector visits the site to ensure proper 
fencing has been installed. Drowning Statistics 
</P>
<P>
 There were 17 drowning deaths in the Valley in 1993. Nearly 25% of drowning 
victims last year in Los Angeles County were under 5 years of age: 
04,15,06,06,07 1992 1993 1994* Deaths 143 134 49 0-4-year-olds 21 35 7** * As 
of June 23 ** 0-5-year-olds Safeguarding the Pool Health officials recommend 
"layers" of protection to prevent pool injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Fencing: Should be at least 4 feet high and made of chain link, wood, wrought 
iron or masonry. The county department of health recommends height of 5 feet, 
preferably of wrought iron bars no wider than 3 inches apart.  
</P>
<P>
 Self-latching gate: Latch should be at least 4 feet, 10 inches above ground, 
with latche on inside of fence, facing pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Automatic pool cover: Should be ASTM-approved (American Society of Standards 
and Materials) and motorized, in which cover is attached by runners to cement, 
making it difficult for children to fall in. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarm: Install on doors and windows leading to pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue equipment: Life preserver rings, life jackets and shepherd's crook 
should be kept poolside. Inflatable toys should not be considered as drowning 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordless phone: Kept near pool for emergencies, with numbers posted.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervision: Children under 12 should be supervised by an adult who knows how 
to swim and lifesaving techniques. There should always be a caretaker or 
guardian present who also knows CPR. The American Red Cross offers CPR classes; 
call 376-1700. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming lessons: City Dept. of Recreation and Parks recommends and provides 
lessons throughout the Valley for children beginning at age 3. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics says lessons for children under 4 may lead to false sense 
of security. For locations recreation centers where private and group lessons 
are offered, call Valley Region Aquatics at 765-0284. Basic Rescue 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross recommends "Reach or throw, don't go" when a child is 
in danger in a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching assist: If able to reach, use a long object such as oar, paddle, tree 
branch, towel, etc. Keeping weight low, lean away from victim, lying down or 
standing with legs bent and feet comfortably spread. Slowly bring victim in, 
using hand-over-hand grasp on the reaching object. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing assist: Using throwing device such as ring buoy, stay out of the 
water and stand with one foot forward and one back, keeping weight low. Hold 
device in dominant hand and hold extra line in other hand. Use underhand toss, 
aiming device just beyond victim.Enter the water only after above options have 
been attempted. What it Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of adding safety precautions to a 20-by-40-foot residential 
in-ground pool in California: 
</P>
<P>
 Pool: $20,000 Four-sided fencing: $2,094 
</P>
<P>
 Gate: $136 
</P>
<P>
 Power pool cover: $6,000 
</P>
<P>
 Total: $28,230

SCREENING ROOM; HIGHLIGHTING THE DIVERSE SOUNDS OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three music films by Robert Mugge will be shown this weekend at the Sunset 5. 
A Friday and Saturday midnight run of "Pride and Joy: The Story of Alligator 
Records" will be shown, preceded this weekend only by a live performance by Los 
Angeles blues artist Janiva Magness and her band. "Gather at the River: A 
Bluegrass Celebration" and "The Kingdom of Zydeco" will screen in separate 
theaters at 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, beginning this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugge's straightforward and infectious 87-minute film "Pride and Joy" 
intercuts portions of one of the record company's 20th anniversary concerts 
(held at Philadelphia's jam-packed Chestnut Cabaret) with Alligator's founder 
Bruce Iglauer. It also shows, more briefly, Iglauer's recording artists 
including pianist-singer Katie Webster and blues shouter Koko Taylor in 
exuberant performances. The Chicago-based Iglauer, who remarks that blues 
"reaches in and wrings you out," comes across as savvy and dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gather at the River," a 101-minute documentary on last September's annual 
convention of the International Bluegrass Music Assn., held in Owensboro, Ky., 
offers a generous selection of major artists in performance and in interviews, 
ranging from living legends like Ralph Stanley and Doc Watson, to bands from 
Russia and Japan. The well-organized film traces the roots of bluegrass to its 
African and Celtic sources. But for all the repeated credit given African 
Americans, not one is on view, let alone in performance, in the entire film. 
Legendary singer Hazel Dickens, specially honored at the event, speaks of 
bluegrass as having been a "white male dominated" art form -- and from the 
looks of things, it still is. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of bluegrass express the need to preserve its traditional form yet 
continue to grow, and we're given the impression that both impulses are being 
accommodated harmoniously. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the 75-minute "Kingdom of Zydeco," that's not the case with the 
black Creole music scene in southwestern Louisiana. The music may be 
irresistible but the crowning of veteran accordionist Boozoo Chavis as zydeco's 
new king in April (following the deaths of the legendary Clifton Chenier in 
1987 and his successor, Rockin' Dopsie, last August) sparked a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis was crowned zydeco's new king by Lou Gabus, founder and president of 
the Louisiana Hall of Fame, who insists that Dopsie designated Chavis as his 
heir. However, many African American Creoles disagree with the selection and 
believe they should have been able to vote for the new king. It is believed 
that if they had been allowed to vote, the title would have gone to the young 
and burly Beau Jocque, currently the most popular zydeco musician on the scene. 
Jocque sings in English and has a much faster tempo than the still enormously 
vigorous 63-year-old Chavis. (213) 848-3500. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Besson's "Atlantis" (at the Nuart Sunday through Tuesday) plunges us into 
a shimmeringly beautiful undersea world teeming with constant movement -- 
rapidly darting schools of tiny fish; stately, leisurely enormous sharks; 
waltzing manta rays and lively, playful sea lions. Eric Serra's soaring score 
echoes every change of tempo in this vast, eerie universe with its constant 
play of light and shadow as the camera plunges into deep, ominous crevasses 
illuminated by only the slightest slivers of light. Besson and his cameraman 
Christian Petron photographed at locales all around the world, but the film has 
a rhythmic, flowing sense of unity, climaxing in a stunning finish symbolic of 
the birth of life itself. A distinctive, poetic experience from the director of 
"Subway," "La Femme Nikita" and "The Big Blue." (310) 478-6379.

IRS BEGINS PLAN ON RESTAURANT WORKERS' TIPS; TAXES: PARTICIPANTS ARE PROMISED 
RELIEF FROM GRATUITY INCOME AUDITS. BUT O.C. GROUP SAYS IT PRESSURES EMPLOYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Never one to pass up a good tip -- or even a measly one -- the IRS on Tuesday 
launched a nationwide program to increase tax revenue from restaurant workers' 
often-underreported gratuity income. 
</P>
<P>
 As do many government plans, the voluntary Tip Rate and Education Program 
requires owners of participating businesses -- principally restaurants, bars 
and cocktail lounges -- to fill out a batch of new paperwork. Restaurant owners 
also would have to encourage their employees to sign up in order to make the 
plan work. 
</P>
<P>
 That has fueled opposition from the National Restaurant Assn. and most of its 
state affiliates, including the California Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem with it is that the IRS seems to be putting pressure on employers 
to force their workers to report higher tips," said Michael Rhodes, president 
of the association's Orange County chapter and owner of Frontier Restaurants, 
an Orange-based chain that operates the Knowl-Wood and Russell's Famous 
hamburger chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service says it is offering a pretty big carrot: 
Restaurants with at least 75% employee participation are being promised relief 
from the agency's tip income audits. And employees who participate and report 
tips at or above the agreed-upon rate for their restaurant also would be 
exempted from tip audits, which can involve an IRS check of financial records 
as far back as 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees found to have underreported tip income are assessed back taxes and, 
potentially, penalties; their employers are required to pay federal Social 
Security taxes on the unreported tip income. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit exemption might make some employees happy, but restaurant owners, 
Rhodes said, see it as a cudgel, not a carrot. "It puts the restaurateur in the 
middle by pressuring us to force our employees to report more tip income" in 
return for relief from potentially costly tip audits, he said. "The employer 
should not be serving as a tax collection agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, whose 13 restaurants are mainly fast-food types in which tipping is 
rare, said his industry also is irked because "car washes, beauty shops and all 
the other places" where tips are a big part of employees' income aren't 
included in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the National Restaurant Assn. has begun lobbying in Washington for 
congressional action either to do away with the plan or to revise it to relieve 
employers of responsibility for employees' tip reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the food industry, servers, bartenders and others who deal directly with 
the customer now are presumed by the IRS to make at least 8% of their income 
from tips. "If you don't report at least 8%, you know they are coming after 
you," said Robby Robfogel, manager of the Crab Cooker in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the traditional tip in a restaurant is 15%, that leaves a big 
potential gap that the IRS wants to close. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan offers participants a personalized tip reporting rate based on 
their employers' reports of each restaurant's tip income over a previous 
six-month period and the way it is usually divided among that restaurants' 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rate reflects the unique characteristics of each restaurant and is a 
fairer way to report tip income," said Jesse Cota, director of the IRS's Laguna 
Niguel district, which covers Southern California from the South Bay area to 
the Mexican border -- an area with more than 1,000 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate will differ for each restaurant and in many cases will differ among 
employees because part of the calculation reflects the number of customers 
served who do not tip, tips that employees share with other restaurant 
employees, such as busboys and dishwashers, and the difference in the amount of 
tips received during different work shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Food servers on dinner shifts, for example, typically earn more in tips than 
do lunch shift servers, because the costs of the meals are often higher and a 
higher percentage of diners leave tips. 
</P>
<P>
 While food servers likely would end up paying more taxes because of the 15% 
tip standard, others in the restaurant industry might get a break, Cota said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that the hostess who handles carryout orders does not receive 
tips at the same rate as regular food servers. Charging the hostess the same 
tip rate as a food server is not an accurate reflection of tip income." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE TO CALL: Restaurant owners and employees who receive tips can 
telephone the IRS at (714) 643-4069 for an information brochure about the Tip 
Rate and Education Program.

NASA CHIEF CHECKS OUT SPACE STATION'S PROGRESS; TECHNOLOGY: PROJECT 'LOOKS VERY 
GOOD' SO FAR, DANIEL GOLDIN SAYS AFTER PAYING VISIT TO O.C.'S MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
AEROSPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA's top administrator visited McDonnell Douglas Aerospace here Tuesday for 
a progress report on the space station and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel S. Goldin, who said he was pleased by last week's resounding vote of 
confidence by the U.S. House of Representatives for the space station, gave a 
qualified thumbs up to McDonnell Douglas' efforts as a primary contractor on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Douglas is coming along," he said. "In fact, we heard (Tuesday) that they are 
changing the management concept on the space station, and the transition is 
almost complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin said McDonnell Douglas will create "integrated product teams" to which 
NASA will spell out what it wants, and the contractor will figure out how to 
get those things done. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the space station, he said, "it looks very good, but I am from the old 
school. When it comes out, when it gets launched, then I give all the 
accolades. Right now, we want to keep everybody's feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The space station, which survived a redesign in the past year to a less 
ambitious project, has been under attack as too expensive, with opponents 
saying it will cost $70 billion. Last week, the House voted 278 to 155 to fund 
the station for one more year. That contrasted with a one-vote margin of 
victory in the House last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin said he does not expect the Senate's space station vote, scheduled for 
July or August, to be an easy win. He said the prospects of getting the station 
built are improving, however. Contractors will actually produce 25,000 pounds 
of hardware for the project this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldin said no further cutbacks are expected. Last year's redesign resulted in 
a reduction of McDonnell Douglas' employment on the project from 3,000 workers 
to 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've eliminated jobs in government and industry, which is the right thing to 
do," Goldin said. "We are not a jobs program. We are a program about the 
future. You can't help future generations if you just protect jobs in the 
present." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin praised Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) for his support of 
the space station before the House vote. Rohrabacher, who invited Goldin to 
tour the McDonnell Douglas facility and accompanied him Tuesday, threw his 
support behind the station when NASA agreed to get help from the Russian space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Goldin complimented McDonnell Douglas for its work on the 
experimental DC-X rocket, which could be launched in 1996 as a reusable space 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a DC-X prototype experienced an explosion during its fifth test 
launch. Instead of crashing, however, the rocket returned safely to the testing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was any normal aircraft or space vehicle, it would have crashed," 
Goldin said. "I don't consider this a failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Klevatt, program manager for the DC-X, said investigators will release a 
report Friday on the cause of the explosion. He said he gave Goldin a briefing 
on the program.

BELLS WANT '82 CONSENT DECREE AXED BY COURTS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: FOUR 
COMPANIES WILL SEEK ACTION ON THE AGREEMENT THAT KEEPS THEM FROM LONG-DISTANCE 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After scoring a partial victory in the House last week with a bill that would 
eliminate key restrictions on their business activities, four of the regional 
Bell operating companies were expected to file a motion in federal court today 
seeking to throw out entirely the decade-old consent decree governing the 
breakup of the Bell system. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree, overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Harold H. Greene, prevents 
the seven Baby Bells from offering long-distance service or manufacturing 
telecommunications equipment and requires them to seek court permission before 
they can enter many new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology and competition have rendered (the decree) obsolete, and it's time 
to bid it farewell," said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The consent decree, designed to balance the interests of the Baby Bells, AT&T 
and consumers by specifying which companies could be in which businesses 
following the Bell System breakup, has given Greene extraordinary regulatory 
authority over the telecommunications industry. The Bell companies have been 
fighting it almost from the day it was signed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 A key goal for the Bells is to gain entry into a $70-billion long-distance 
market now dominated by AT&T and MCI. Although the recently passed House bill 
provides for Bell entry into that market, a similar bill moving through the 
Senate, sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), could set higher obstacles 
to Bell entry into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell companies have said they would rather have no telecommunications bill 
rather than be kept out of the long-distance business. If legislation allowing 
them into long-distance does not pass, they could accomplish the same objective 
through a successful challenge to the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already experiencing severe competition in our local markets, and we 
want these restrictions (on Nynex Corp. activities) taken off," said Bob 
Varettoni, a spokesman for Nynex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only Bell Atlantic Corp., Bell South, Nynex and Southwestern Bell 
Corp. are part of the motion, the other three Bell companies -- Ameritech, 
Pacific Bell and U.S. West -- are expected to make statements supporting the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics question whether the new judicial initiative will be effective. "The 
Bells have been trying to get rid of the decree since five minutes after it was 
signed," said William Baxter, a Stanford Law School professor who as head of 
the Justice Department's antitrust division led the push to dismantle AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said he doubts the courts will overturn the decree and suggested the 
Bells may be trying to influence deliberations in the Senate by "trying to 
convince people it doesn't matter because the regulations will be neutered 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance companies are fiercely opposed to Bell entry into the market, 
contending that the Bells would gain an unfair advantage through their control 
of the local exchange. The long-distance firms, led by AT&T, say they would 
support a relaxation of the restrictions only after robust competition 
developed in the local telephone business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell companies have bolstered their court motion with affidavits from 
dozens of prominent economists and industry experts. In a 10-page statement, 
Gary Becker, 1992 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, argues that the 
consent decree "improperly restricts entry and harms consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul MacAvoy, a Yale economist who has worked as adviser in several 
administrations, says in his statement that the oligopoly in long-distance 
markets has enabled AT&T and MCI to set prices "at non-competitive levels as if 
in tacit collusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell said it did not participate in the suit because its primary 
concern is with winning approval to offer long-distance calls within 
California. "We are going the legislative route locally and federally," said 
Jerry Kimata, a spokesman for Pacific Bell.

 Day and night, the freight trains rumble nonstop through the Rio Grande town 
of Laredo, funneling auto parts, grain and plywood into Mexico's industrial 
heartland and sending Mexican iron ore, glass containers and produce to 
American factories and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Booming trade between the United States and Mexico has doubled rail traffic in 
Laredo since 1989, helping to make it the busiest commercial crossing along the 
2,000-mile-long border. Some 150 miles south of San Antonio, Laredo has become 
a focal point for railroad industry investment plans along the border, 
including new bridges, freight terminals and rail-barges at a combined cost of 
more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market in Mexico is the fastest-growing one we have," said Bob Thruston, 
vice president of Mexico group activities at Southern Pacific Railroad, the 
U.S. line doing the second-biggest volume of business in and out of Mexico, 
after Union Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 While rail traffic of all kinds has grown since 1988, when Mexico began easing 
trade barriers, the pace has picked up dramatically since the North American 
Free Trade Agreement went into effect Jan. 1. The pact has particularly 
benefited U.S. producers of grain, autos, forest products and other goods well 
suited to transport by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroads also stand to benefit from what many expect will be a shifting 
of manufacturing from the maquiladoras concentrated along the border to 
Mexico's north-central industrial belt, which is closer to population centers 
and has a less transient work force. The longer hauls would be more suited to 
rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the railroads see their investments as a race to replace or augment 
overburdened facilities. Laredo and El Paso, the two busiest rail ports along 
the border, are both heavily congested and becoming more so since NAFTA went 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the projects now under consideration: 
</P>
<P>
 * Union Pacific plans to spend as much as $30 million on a new rail bridge in 
Laredo. The Omaha-based line, the largest cargo hauler in and out of Mexico, 
recently completed a modern rail-truck, or "intermodal," freight terminal just 
north of Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe may become the lead investor in a 
$110-million rail-truck terminal planned in New Mexico just east of El Paso. 
The project is being heavily promoted by New Mexico as a way to stimulate 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * CSX is studying the feasibility of spending tens of millions of dollars on a 
new rail-barge service called Sea Cat from the Gulf Coast to Veracruz, a route 
that would resemble a highly successful rail-barge service operated by 
Burlington Northern from Galveston, Tex., to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. railroads also stand ready to invest heavily if Mexico privatizes and 
auctions off its aging and poorly maintained rail lines, as many in the 
industry expect.  
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific, among others, says it would be a bidder in such an auction. 
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe owned major lines in Mexico before being booted 
out several decades ago as symbols of economic colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization of Mexican rail -- and at least partial acquisitions by U.S. 
interests -- seemed likely until Mexico's political upheaval this year. Now 
industry officials say all bets are off until after Mexico's August 
presidential elections. A victorious opposition candidate could slow or reverse 
the foreign investment that has poured into Mexico in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroads saw their U.S.-Mexico traffic grow at a 15% average annual rate from 
1988 through 1992, the last year for which figures are available, according to 
the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But NAFTA has provided a sharp boost. Shipments of finished automobiles to 
Mexico -- two-thirds of which travel by rail -- are up sixfold this year.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving a lot of grain since NAFTA, and there's quite a heavy southbound 
movement of finished autos by Chrysler, Ford and Jeep because NAFTA cut the 
tariff by 50%," said John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the border states see the rail lines as big generators of jobs and 
taxes. Arizona, for example, is working with the Mexican state of Sonora to 
improve rail links between Nogales and the port of Guaymas. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico is trying to launch a major new terminal called Santa Teresa about 
12 miles west of congested El Paso with the cooperation of Mexico and at least 
one U.S. railroad, possibly Santa Fe. Texas is working just as hard to keep any 
new terminal serving El Paso-Ciudad Juarez on Texas soil. (California has 
virtually no rail traffic with Mexico.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Railroads create a potential for tax revenue, a potential for job creation 
and for attracting manufacturers who want to be closer to distribution 
centers," said John Garcia, deputy chief of staff for New Mexico Gov. Bruce 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 Impediments still stand in the way of freer rail traffic, especially the 
inadequate Mexican rail system and congestion in border areas, U.S. rail 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly for those reasons, truckers haul 85% of the cross-border surface 
freight. And truckers will fight hard to retain their grip on the Mexican 
market, despite the increasing "intermodal" transportation networks that 
combine trains, ships and trucks to deliver cargo packed in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 But railroads' freight business is expected to grow as the overall Mexican 
trade pie gets larger under NAFTA and as U.S. companies learn to do business in 
Mexico. U.S. exports to Mexico were up 16% for the first quarter this year and 
imports increased by 22%. Many of the trade categories showing the best growth 
were bulk cargoes served by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. railroads expect their Mexican business to grow from 2.5% of industry 
revenues now to 7.5% by the end of the decade, according to the Assn. of 
American Railroads, a Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. rail industry could use that kind of growth. Although its revenues 
have bounced back over the last decade after some rough times, the railroads' 
share of the surface freight market has not grown since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry experts say true integration of rail service between the United 
States and Mexico won't occur until Mexico privatizes its national rail system, 
known as Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico. The system is so poorly maintained 
that some U.S. lines won't use it for their heaviest cargoes. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. railroads do eventually acquire Mexican lines, it would close the 
circle that began during the Depression, when Mexico began to nationalize the 
mostly U.S.-controlled railroads, according to John A. Kirchner, professor of 
geography and transportation at California State University, Los Angeles. U.S. 
railroads built the Mexican lines in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at a Mexican route map today, you are struck by the fact that the 
major railroads run north and south," said Walter P. Gray, director of the 
California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. "One reason for the arrangement 
was to promote transport of raw materials from Mexico north into the U.S." 
Laredo Rail Traffic 
</P>
<P>
 Improved trade between the U.S. and Mexico is reflected in increased rail 
traffic in congested Laredo, the busiest commercial crossing along the 
2,000-mile U.S. Mexico border. Total loaded cars moving across the border in 
both directions, in thousands:

GM SCORES WITH CUSTOMERS; U.S. AUTO MAKER, EUROPEANS GAIN GROUND ON JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 General Motors Corp. and several European auto makers gained ground on 
Japanese companies in customer satisfaction this past year, but Ford declined 
and Chrysler held steady, according to a widely watched survey released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 GM beat the industry average in the J.D. Powers & Associates index of customer 
satisfaction -- the first American auto maker to do so since the survey began 
in 1981. Analysts attributed GM's progress to the continuing success of its 
Saturn line and a concerted effort to upgrade dealership service. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian auto makers posted an average score of 140, unchanged from last year. 
However, the customer handling component of their score dropped, primarily 
because second-tier auto makers Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Hyundai and Mazda posted 
relatively poor results, said J. David Power III, president of the Agoura 
Hills-based market research company. 
</P>
<P>
 European auto makers -- thanks to significant improvements in quality and 
dealership service by Volkswagen, Volvo and BMW -- finished with an average 
index score of 139, Power said. That was significantly improved from their 
year-earlier score of 130. The European score was also helped by the withdrawal 
from the U.S. market of past low-scorers Yugo, Renault, Peugeot and Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Big Three auto makers averaged a score of 132, the same as last year 
but up from only 94 in 1986. General Motors posted an overall average score of 
136, one point above the industrywide average and up two points from last year. 
Ford Motor Co.'s score of 125 was off six points from last year, while Chrysler 
Corp. remained the same at 128. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back over the past eight years, we can see how the customer 
satisfaction dominance of the Asians has been eroding," Power said. "This is 
where the future battles will be won or lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, strong sales probably hurt customer satisfaction results at 
Chrysler and Ford, Power said. With high sales volumes, dealers have a harder 
time delivering high-quality service to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year Ford made significant improvements, and to retain that kind of 
momentum is very difficult," Power said. "About the only exception to that is 
Toyota, and they have been working at it for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings are based on surveys of 25,000 new car buyers who were asked to 
rate how happy they were with repairs and reliability and how they were treated 
by auto dealers in the first year they owned their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third year in a row, Lexus, Infiniti and Saturn took the top three 
prizes. Lexus and Infiniti, the luxury car lines of Toyota and Nissan, scored 
well above the rest of the pack, with 176 points and 171 points, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturn was a distant third at 155, followed by Acura and Audi.  
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Saturn and 10th-ranked Cadillac in particular helped propel GM, 
but customer service improvements among all GM nameplates were reflected in the 
score, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM has put a lot of focus in the past year to 18 months in terms of improving 
customer satisfaction," said Chris Cedergren, senior vice president with 
AutoPacific Group, an auto marketing consulting firm in Thousand Oaks. 
"Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick and even Chevrolet are putting more focus on trying 
to keep their buyer base happy, and it appears that based on these results, 
those efforts are beginning to bear fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, GM has taken a cue from Lexus and eliminated much of the price 
haggling that traditionally plagues car buyers. Saturn highlights its 
non-negotiable prices in its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a movement into a more honest relationship between the customer 
and the dealer," one analyst said. "With less haggling, the relationship is 
less antagonistic." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar report based on a survey of 10,000 new owners of minivans, pickups 
and sport utility vehicles is expected to be released today. Industry sources 
said it shows Chrysler and Toyota tied for the top position. The Top 10

WELLFLEET, SYNOPTICS TO JOIN FORCES; COMPUTERS: LEADERS IN NETWORKING SAY 
THEY'LL MERGE IN $1-BILLION STOCK SWAP. PLAN MEETS COLD RECEPTION ON WALL 
STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the biggest players in a hot computer industry niche agreed to join 
forces Tuesday as Wellfleet Communications announced that it will acquire Santa 
Clara, Calif.-based SynOptics Communications in a stock swap valued at about $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would create a dominant new player in the computer networking 
business, which has grown explosively in recent years as corporations move away 
from large mainframe computers to flexible networks of smaller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two companies, the combination would fill large gaps in their product 
lines and allow them to keep up with demand for ever-more-sophisticated 
computer networks, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the merger received a cold reception on Wall Street, where shares of both 
companies plunged. And analysts noted that high-technology mergers are often 
difficult to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "To merge the companies (and their product lines) while keeping up with the 
competition is difficult," said Roxane Googin, a computer systems and software 
analyst at Gruntal & Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Wellfleet and SynOptics have both ridden the boom in the computer network 
equipment business, which is expected to grow from an estimated $4.6 billion in 
sales this year to $10.3 billion by 1998, according to the market research firm 
Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in SynOptics, whose products link personal computer users into a 
network, have seen their stock rise from $2.25 in 1988, when the company went 
public, to nearly $40 last year. The company employs about 1,200 people in the 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellfleet, based in Billerica, Mass., sells equipment that allows the exchange 
of information between computer groups. It is the second-largest company of its 
kind and is often cited as the type of firm that will help the Boston area 
regain its strength in high-technology. Under the merger agreement, each 
SynOptics share will be exchanged for 0.725 shares of Wellfleet stock.  
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders of the two companies were not enthused. Wellfleet shares plunged 
$5.19 to $20.06 on Tuesday in heavy Nasdaq trading. SynOptics stock dropped 
$1.125 to $14.625 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 But company executives and some industry observers say the merger is 
essential. Both Wellfleet and SynOptics have fallen behind competitors that 
have been able to offer a wider variety of products, many of which were 
acquired by buying up smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two other larger equipment makers, Cabletron Systems and Cisco 
Systems, announced a strategic alliance that analysts said represented a major 
threat to Wellfleet and SynOptics. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellfleet President Paul Severino will become chairman of the combined 
companies. SynOptics President and Chief Executive Andrew K. Ludwick will serve 
in the same roles at the new company.

 Pickup Trucks Recalled: Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motors of America are 
recalling about 14,400 Ford-built compact pickups to inspect or replace fuel 
lines that may crack and leak.The companies said they have received no reports 
of accidents, fires or injuries related to the defective lines. The Ford recall 
covers about 12,600 1994 Ranger pickups with 3-liter or 4-liter V6 engines, 
including about 1,000 sold in Canada. Ford said fewer than 3,000 of the trucks 
have reached retail customers. Mazda said its recall applies to 1,789 of its 
B3000 and B4000 pickups built for 1994, of which fewer than 400 have left 
dealer showrooms.

 Mexican Imports of Cars and Trucks Surging: Imports rose 1,092% in the first 
five months of the year compared to the equivalent period a year ago, according 
to figures from the Mexican Automobile Industry Assn.Imports totaled 26,608 
vehicles, up from 2,232 a year ago, the association said. Automobiles accounted 
for the bulk of vehicle imports in the period, rising almost 2,500%, to 21,204 
units from 832 units, the group said. Truck imports rose 286% to 5,404 units. 
General Motors de Mexico products represented the lion's share of imports in 
the period at 55.3%; Chrysler de Mexico had a 23.8% share and Ford de Mexico 
had 20.8%.

 Real Estate Investment Pitch Man Sentenced: Morris English Jr., an investment 
con man blamed for at least $30 million in losses, was sentenced to 18 years in 
prison by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian in Los Angeles.Prosecutors, who 
had sought a life sentence for English, said his Wellington Group real estate 
investment company was nothing but a fraud that had cheated some 1,500 people 
from 1985 until its collapse in 1991. English, 47, offered high returns on 
investments tied to real estate trust deeds. He sponsored his own financial 
advice program, "Executive Money," on a Glendale radio station and pitched the 
schemes through seminars, print advertisements and promotional brochures.

SAN DIEGO UTILITY EXPECTS TO POST A SECOND-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a major step back from its strategy of diversification in the 1980s, 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. said Tuesday that it expects to lose money in the 
second quarter because it will take after-tax write-offs of more than $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the write-offs are related to its 80% stake in Wahlco Environmental, 
which makes air pollution-control devices, and its real estate subsidiary known 
as Phase One Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana-based Wahlco has been hurt by less stringent clean-air standards 
that enable polluters to use less expensive alternatives to Wahlco products, 
while Phase One has been hit hard by San Diego's declining real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 SDG&E said a small portion of the write-offs -- about $13 million -- will 
occur because of the uncertainty all California utilities face due to recently 
proposed rate-setting rules designed to be in line with free-market 
competition. In the past, the Public Utilities Commission has set rates by 
fixing a profit based on a percentage of the utilities' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty forced SDG&E to cancel its $450-million South Bay Repowering 
Project, a modernization of a power station in Chula Vista, because it said it 
was no longer certain that the investment would be profitable. The utility is 
writing off the engineering and planning costs related to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other utilities, SDG&E diversified into non-power-generating 
businesses in the 1980s as a way of protecting itself in the then-volatile 
energy industry. It bought Wahlco in 1987 and then sold 20% of the company to 
the public. It acquired Phase One Development in 1986.

 The new government Tuesday ordered a slashing of some of the red tape that has 
blocked foreign businesses from the Japanese market, and the finance minister 
called for even more cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The package to ease regulations on 279 products and services was approved in 
principle in the last days of the previous government, but outgoing Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata left final approval to the new government, which was 
formed last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A major part of the package is wider acceptance of foreign test data on home 
building materials, automobiles, food products, pharmaceuticals and other 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 New Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama is to explain the plan's details to 
President Clinton this weekend while both are at the Group of Seven summit in 
Naples, Italy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has announced deregulation on 781 other items in the past year as part 
of measures aimed both at stimulating Japan's sluggish economy and reducing its 
giant trade surplus, which reached $59 billion with the United States alone 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge surplus is one of the factors contributing to the yen's rise against 
the dollar. The strong yen stifles Japan's export-driven economy by making its 
products more expensive to foreign consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar last week fell to below 100 yen for the first time since World War 
II. It closed at 98.70 yen in Tokyo in late-morning trading today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This package is a step in the right direction, but more steps are necessary" 
to give foreign competitors a better chance at success in Japan's market, said 
Jason James, an economist at securities firm James Capel Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new finance minister, Masayoshi Takemura, was among the critics who 
called the package insufficient. He urged other Cabinet members to promote 
deregulation more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Masaru Takagi, chief economist with Fuji Research Institute, said the new 
Murayama government should make Tuesday's package the starting point for 
further deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is still how to increase domestic demand and thus reduce the 
trade surplus through deregulatory measures," Takagi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama told a news conference Friday that he would continue to promote 
economic reform and domestic consumer demand to try to increase economic 
expansion and ease trade friction. 
</P>
<P>
 The package calls for formulating a five-year deregulation action program by 
the end of the fiscal year, next March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much power Murayama's government will have to push new 
deregulation. The government is an uneasy coalition of Socialists and the 
conservative Liberal Democratic Party, and Murayama has said he will call 
national elections soon.

TEXACO TO SELL MANY U.S. FIELDS, SLASH JOBS; ENERGY: THE PLAN REFLECTS THE OIL 
INDUSTRY'S SHIFTING EMPHASIS FROM DOMESTIC TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Texaco Inc. said Tuesday that it will streamline its operations by selling or 
trading off about half its producing oil fields in the United States and 
eliminating 2,500 more jobs over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves, expected to reduce costs by about $300 million and boost efficiency 
by dropping unneeded supervisory positions, will result in a $165-million 
charge against second-quarter earnings, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Future activities will be focused on those remaining core U.S. oil and gas 
assets, which account for more than 90% of the profits, cash flow, production 
and reserve base in the U.S.," Texaco Chairman and Chief Executive Alfred 
DeCrane said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco's U.S. fields, which number more than 600, accounted for 58% of the 
company's 728,000-barrels-a-day crude oil production last year and 88% of the 
1.97 million cubic feet of natural gas it pumped daily, according to the Value 
Line Investment Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the streamlining program will involve its oil and gas 
production, transportation, refining and marketing operations both in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCrane said the savings expected to be realized will be redirected to growth 
markets in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The company "is trying to show investors (that Texaco) can do more" in the way 
of cost cutting, said William Randol of Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is coming from Wall Street," said Rasario Ilacqua of Rothschild 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco's move reflects a trend among U.S. oil companies toward emphasizing 
foreign operations, where opportunities to expand sales and make new oil finds 
are considered better. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp. said it was considering selling its 
producing properties in California so it could better pursue projects in Asia 
and other regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said it was engaged in discussions involving its interests in 69 oil 
and gas fields, including 10 producing platforms off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco's willingness to sell marginal U.S. oil and natural gas fields is its 
reaction to a problem "endemic in the entire industry": that of getting a 
better return from exploration and production investments, according to 
Ilacqua. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects to see Texaco and the major oil companies "invest in 
opportunities overseas that are more attractive" than those in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Through consolidations and other moves in the past two years, Texaco's work 
force has been cut more than 13%, to about 38,000 employees. The figure 
excludes reductions related to sales of assets such as Texaco Chemical Co., 
which was acquired by the Huntsman organization in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned payroll cut will be accomplished through attrition, retirements 
and layoffs, the White Plains, N.Y.-based company said, adding that where 
possible, it will reassign employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In its U.S. refining and marketing operations, Texaco said it will consolidate 
units, eliminate layers of management and cut administrative and support costs 
more than 20%. The company said it is already streamlining its refining and 
marketing operations in Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco also said it is receiving bids for its interests in refining and 
marketing operations in Nigeria and other West African countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco's stock rose 75 cents to close at $60.875 a share Tuesday on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

 Superior Industries Claims Patent Victory: The Van Nuys-based maker of 
automotive wheels said it has won a civil action filed against the company by 
Motor Wheel Corp., alleging infringement of two Motor Wheel technology 
patents.Superior Industries International Inc. said that a U.S. District Court 
jury in Michigan found it has not violated either of the patents and that Motor 
Wheel is not entitled to damages. The action was served against Superior 
Industries on Feb. 4, 1993. Motor Wheel, a closely held automotive wheel 
producer based in Lansing, Mich., had no immediate comment on the verdict.

 Treasury Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.31%, up from 4.20% last 
week. Another $12.1 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.74%, up from 4.60%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they were sold at 4.32% on May 9. The six-month bill rate was the highest 
since May 9, when it averaged 4.60%. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors: 4.42% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,891.10, and 4.92% for a six-month bill selling for $9,760.40.

POST-4TH FED WATCH MAKES FOR DULL SESSION

<P>
 Stocks inched higher Tuesday as bond yields dipped in light post-holiday 
trading, and as financial markets nervously awaited the outcome of a Federal 
Reserve Board policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell against major 
European currencies as doubts grew that a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations will come up with a major rescue plan for the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks churned in an uneventful session, with the Dow 
industrials adding 5.83 points to 3,652.48. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advances narrowly outnumbered declines on the Big Board, 
where volume was a slow 195.4 million shares. Many investors and traders had 
not yet returned from Monday's Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the few players in the market were apprehensive about the 
outcome of the Fed policy meeting, which began Tuesday and continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been speculation that the Fed might lean toward raising 
short-term interest rates again to keep inflation at bay and help prop up the 
sagging dollar, many analysts expect the central bank to pursue a steady policy 
course for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the Fed probably wants to see this Friday's government 
report on June employment to get a better handle on the economy's strength. A 
big gain in jobs in June could convince the Fed that the economy warrants 
slightly higher interest rates to moderate its growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields finished a bit lower Tuesday, helped by another 
steep fall in grain prices. The Commodity Research Bureau index slid 3.30 
points to 226.73 as grain prices sank on news of more Midwest rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling commodity prices reduce inflationary pressures, which in turn can take 
upward pressure off interest rates. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond 
eased to 7.58% from Friday's 7.60%. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading the dollar gained against the yen, to 98.90 yen in New 
York from 98.55 Friday. But the dollar fell to 1.580 German marks from Friday's 
1.596. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the day's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks failed to respond well to news that computer networker 
Wellfleet Communications intends to buy SynOptics Communications. Wellfleet 
dove 5 3/16 to 20 1/16; SynOptics fell 1 1/8 to 14 5/8. Some analysts 
questioned SynOptics' value to Wellfleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other falling tech issues, Cabletron Systems fell 2 to 96, Newbridge 
Networks lost 7/8 to 34 1/2 and Cisco Systems eased 5/8 to 22 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks were strong. Light, sweet crude oil futures for delivery in 
August rose 9 cents per barrel to $19.62. Texaco rose 3/4 to 60 7/8 after 
unveiling a corporate restructuring. Among other oils, Arco gained 1 3/8 to 
103, Phillips jumped 1 3/4 to 33 1/2 and Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 82 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing rose 3/4 to 47 1/8 on the company's report that it delivered 67 
commercial airliners in the second quarter, slightly more than some analysts 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, a rebound in the dollar against the yen buoyed Tokyo markets, 
leading the Nikkei average up 202.44 points to 20,834.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's DAX average ended at 2,032.69, down 21.71 points, while London's 
FTSE-100 index lost 5.4 points to 2,965.0.

 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 8.52 points to 2,276.06.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: LOSSES PILED UP FOR 'GREEN' FUNDS AS TRASH DIDN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every dog is supposed to have its day, but not so yet in this decade for 
mutual funds that specialize in environmental stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The average environmental fund lost 10.5% of its value in the first half of 
this year, according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical. That was nearly double 
the average loss of general stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, lagging the market -- by a huge margin -- is the only way 
environmental funds have distinguished themselves since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the 10 environmental funds tracked by Lipper eked out a paltry 3.3% 
average gain, while the average general stock fund rose 12.5%. In 1992, the 
environmental funds lost 6.2%, on average, while the typical stock fund gained 
8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The painful lesson learned by investors in these funds is how long a market 
slump can drag on once an industry's fundamentals go bad. The experience also 
may be educational for investors who've bet heavily on other relatively narrow 
sectors, such as utilities and emerging-market stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the environmental funds' miserable record, of course, is that 
this was to be the "green" decade; pollution control and cleanup were expected 
to be booming businesses worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by 1989 the environmental business was suffering from the same 
excessive hype that had been directed at oil companies a decade earlier. Just 
as oil in 1979 was undoubtedly going to $100 a barrel within a decade, so too 
demand for "green" services was surely going to explode in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. With the recession that began late in 1990, the major U.S garbage 
haulers, such as Browning-Ferris Industries and WMX Technologies, suddenly 
discovered that landfills -- allegedly in short supply -- really weren't after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always thought that you can't lose because there's always going to be 
garbage," says Maurice Schoenwald, whose $30-million, 12-year-old New 
Alternatives fund in Melville, N.Y., was the first environmental fund. "But if 
business is bad, there's a lot less garbage," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition among haulers became so tough for Browning-Ferris that its 
operating earnings fell from $1.95 a share in 1990 to $1.25 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling, too, began to reduce the supply of garbage. Yet playing the 
recycling stocks, such as Thermo Fibertek, a maker of paper-recycling 
machinery, also bombed as parts of that business became too successful: For a 
long while, there was more paper being recycled than could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cleanup of toxic waste sites and installation of pollution-control 
equipment never reached the levels many analysts had projected for the early 
'90s. The recession had a lot to do with that, says John Schroer, manager of 
the $40-million Invesco Environmental fund in Denver. "Dealing with 
environmental companies is something waste-producing companies don't want to 
do," he notes. When profits are down, installing new equipment becomes even 
less of a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Gas & Electric learned that the hard way via its Wahlco 
Environmental subsidiary, for which SDG&E took a big writedown Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, hazardous-waste disposers such as Rollins Environmental and 
Chemical Waste Management have been hurt because waste producers have complied 
with anti-pollution rules, but with cheaper solutions -- such as burning 
hazardous stuff in kilns that power cement plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest disappointment for green firms, however, has been the 
waning federal commitment to the pollution fight, many analysts contend. "The 
enforcement of environmental regulations has diminished," Schoenwald laments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hazardous-waste cleanups have become bogged down in litigation, he says. 
An overhaul of the "Superfund" toxic-waste cleanup law -- to speed action and 
end haggling over cleanup costs -- is making its way through Congress, but 
analysts see no final action until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some bright spots. Schroer says the garbage haulers, like WMX 
and Attwoods, are turning as landfill fees rise in some parts of the country as 
the economy gains. Schoenwald has big bets on up-and-coming green firms such as 
fuel cell maker Energy Research, windmill firm Kenetech and plastic recycler 
Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
 Given their long slide, environmental funds may now constitute the ultimate 
contrarian bet. But then, as in 1991, '92 and '93, you could still be early. 
The 'Green' Decade? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite expectations that environmental cleanup and pollution control would be 
major growth industries in the 1990s, stocks of many companies in those 
businesses have performed miserably. A look at average annual returns for 
'environmental' stock mutual funds and for general stock funds: 03,07,15,13

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; A TINY 
BOILER TO KEEP PCS COOL 
</P>

 As computers become faster, heat buildup in the tiny spaces between circuit 
boards and semiconductors is becoming a big problem for computer designers. The 
conventional solution is to space circuit boards farther apart and use fans to 
dissipate heat. But computers perform much better when their components are 
close together, and simple air cooling does not keep up with the required heat 
removal. That's why Digital Equipment Corp., which makes the superfast Alpha 
chip, turned to researchers at Pennsylvania State University's College of 
Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers there came up with a tiny alcohol-and-water boiler to cool 
high-heat areas inside the computer. First, an alloy is made by mixing very 
small particles of tungsten and copper with small amounts of activators. The 
mixed power is then injected into a mold to form a mini-boiler, then heated to 
form strong bonds between the particles. Liquid alcohol in the boiler is heated 
by the waste heat generated by the circuit board. The alcohol boils and is 
converted into alcohol vapor, which rises in the columns of the boiler. 
Converting from liquid to vapor cools the board, much like evaporation of sweat 
cools the skin in summer. 
</P>

 Here's to Blue and Green: Blue and green may be commonplace colors in nature, 
but they are a much-sought-after rarity in the world of lasers. Blue-green 
laser diodes are desirable because they have shorter wavelengths than the 
common red diodes, and such short wavelengths would make it possible to burn 
smaller pits into the surface of an optical storage device such as a compact 
disc. More pits equals more capacity, which equals longer recording time. 
That's why corporate and university laboratories around the world are racing to 
develop a low-cost, low-power semiconductor laser that emits light in the 
blue-violet and green ranges.  
</P>
<P>
 Eagle-Picher Laboratory in Miami, Okla., working with the Department of 
Physics at North Carolina State University, recently announced development of 
an extremely bright diode in the pure-green region of the spectrum. With 
backing from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Eagle-Picher 
combined its technology for producing high-quality, zinc-selenide crystals with 
fabrication techniques developed at NCSU.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the technology will be ready for commercial use, researchers must find 
ways to lengthen the useful life of the diodes. Researchers at Japan's Hitachi 
Ltd. report getting blue laser results from conventional red lasers by forcing 
light from the red laser through an optical fiber with a diameter only a tenth 
of the wavelength of the light beam. The process is years away from 
commercialization, but if successful, it could be used to carve out pits on an 
optical disc even smaller than those produced by a blue laser.

 Molecular Fingerprints: Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have come 
up with a way to identify companies responsible for oil spills or underground 
storage tank leaks by using non-radioactive tracers first developed for nuclear 
research. The tracers consist of organic molecules in which one or all of the 
hydrogen atoms have been replaced with deuterium (hydrogen with an extra 
neutron), and they provide unique, identifiable fingerprints. Because they are 
composed of the same chemicals as the host products, these molecular tags will 
not interfere with chemical processes.  
</P>
<P>
 This new technology could be used to run diagnostic tests on a leak at a 
natural gas facility without shutting down operations. Used in pipelines, it 
could show whether gas and oil is being stolen via illegal pipeline taps.  
</P>
<P>
 The tags could also determine whether underground storage tanks are leaking or 
identify the source of unreported oil spills at sea. Los Alamos is talking with 
oil and gas industry representatives about applications.

 Imaging Without X-Rays: Anyone who has ever held their hand over a flashlight 
knows that light can pass through a substantial amount of body tissue. But 
because the tissue scatters the light so strongly, detailed information about 
any interior structures, such as bones or possible tumors, is lost when the 
light emerges. A small fraction of the light, called ballistic light, does go 
directly through tissue without scattering and can reveal what lies under the 
skin. A USC physicist and his collaborator at the Eidgenoessische Technische 
Hochschule in Zurich, Switzerland, have figured out how to separate this gleam 
of ballistic light from the scattered light.  
</P>
<P>
 The method, which has been patented, takes advantage of the fact that 
ballistic light takes a straight path through tissue and thus emerges a few 
pico-seconds before the scattered light. A time-resolved hologram -- which is a 
kind of holographic movie of all of the light passing through the tissue -- is 
created, and by playing back only the early portion of the movie, doctors could 
see only the ballistic light.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be a long time before light replaces X-rays, however. To date, the 
technique has been able to render images only through tissue less than a 
centimeter thick. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; APPLE'S EWORLD: STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE

<P>
 If looks were everything, Apple's new eWorld on-line service would be a sure 
winner. But it will take more than just a pretty interface to compete with 
established services such as Prodigy, Compuserve, and America Online.  
</P>
<P>
 On-line services, like people, need more than just good looks to be 
interesting and compelling. And eWorld -- currently available for the 
Macintosh, with a Windows version expected next year -- still has a way to go 
in making itself a sophisticated and knowledgeable conversationalist. 
</P>
<P>
 EWorld is the first in a wave of new on-line services to be launched over the 
next year by some of the biggest names in the computer industry. Microsoft is 
expected to make its entry by early next year and may include the access 
software with its next-generation personal computer operating system, 
code-named Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 Computer magazine publisher Ziff-Davis will launch its Interchange service 
this fall, with content initially focused on computers. Delphi, now owned by 
publisher Rupert Murdoch, is in the process of reinventing itself with an 
easier-to-use graphic interface and a host of new services aimed at 
non-technical consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 All this activity is unsurprising in light of how quickly the on-line services 
market is growing. CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy together serve about 
5 million users, with Genie and Delphi lagging significantly behind. About 25 
million people worldwide are connected to the Internet, a global network of 
networks linking many different computer systems and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The newer players such as eWorld can bring some fresh approaches to their 
services by working with newer equipment, more sophisticated software and novel 
interface designs. But that's not enough. An on-line service's interface, like 
a newspaper's design, is just a starting point. The coin de realm is content. 
And when it comes to content, eWorld has a lot of room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a surprise, for building content takes time and requires myriad 
relationships with information providers.  
</P>
<P>
 EWorld's initial start-up screen features a town square metaphor to help you 
navigate the system. Instead of the usual pull-down menus, buttons or icons, 
you click on buildings, such as the "Newsstand" and "Learning Center." 
Whimsical sounds, such as traffic noise on the town's main street, provide a 
diversion and some comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall metaphor is cute and the service's look and feel is pleasing, 
but they really don't add that much to the service's usability. From the 
standpoint of ease of use, eWorld is on a par with America Online and Prodigy. 
Even CompuServe, which was once considered one of the most complex on-line 
services, has streamlined its interface so that it is also now fairly easy to 
use.  
</P>
<P>
 EWorld's "Arts and Leisure Pavilion" takes you to the entertainment features, 
recipes, Fodors travel, TV reviews and other leisurely pursuits. The "Learning 
Center" is the gateway to Grolier's Encyclopedia but (so far) nothing else. 
Other options appear on the menu, but when you try to use them you're advised 
that they'll be "added shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Computer Center" takes you to Apple's customer service center, where you 
can download software from ZiffNet/Mac and where vendors provide technical 
support for Mac and Newton users. The "Newsstand" provides access to Reuters 
and USA Today and commentary from a handful of syndicated columnists. Many of 
the sections have a chat area where you can participate in a live interactive 
conversation with other members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 EWorld, like all the major on-line services, also offers electronic mail, 
including the ability to exchange messages via the Internet with users of other 
services. EWorld costs $8.95 a month, which includes two hours of 
non-prime-time use; additional hours cost $4.95, plus a surcharge of $2.95 for 
access during prime time. Macintosh users can order a free start-up kit by 
calling (800) 775-4556.  
</P>
<P>
 EWorld will have to work diligently on getting content in place if it hopes to 
be a player in the long term, for the established on-line services are hardly 
standing still. America Online this year added several new databases, including 
the full text of Time magazine. It has also become the first major commercial 
on-line service to offer access to Internet news groups (forums) as well as 
menus (called gophers) that provide access to other Internet resources. America 
Online eventually plans to offer full Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, legendary for its depth and its hundreds of highly sophisticated 
reference sources, has recently issued a newer and more straightforward version 
of its Windows software. The company last month began distributing an optional 
CD-ROM that adds sound, video clips and multimedia elements to the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy, where I write a regular computer column, is expanding its editorial 
offerings and adding some innovative features to its interface. The company has 
established a relationship with news organizations, including the Atlanta 
Constitution and Times Mirror Co. (the publisher of the Los Angeles Times) to 
provide local news and community information. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy is the first service to routinely provide photographs with its news 
stories and, late last month, began integrating sound clips into some of its 
editorial offerings. It takes about four minutes, at 14,400 bits per second, to 
download a two-minute sound clip. But Prodigy does it in background so you can 
use other parts of the service -- or other Windows programs -- while the sound 
file is being transferred over the phone line.  
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy's use of sound and CompuServe's CD-ROM provide a glimpse of what is to 
come. Fiber optics, cable and other technologies will make it possible for 
services to offer rich libraries of audio and video material -- including 
perhaps full-length movies and documentaries. It will also become practical for 
people to send voice mail and even video mail as we cruise along the gradually 
widening digital highway.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; NUCLEAR 
FUSION'S NEW DIE-HARD APPLICATIONS

 Artificial knee joints that last a lifetime . . . automotive bearings that 
never wear out . . . industrial machinery with surfaces so hard they're almost 
immune to damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking? Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the 
University of Wisconsin and General Motors think not. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a particle accelerator first built for the New Mexico lab's effort to 
develop small magnetic fusion reactors for space, the three organizations are 
trying to develop large-scale applications for a process known as ion 
implantation. Nuclear engineer John Conrad of the University of Wisconsin 
invented the process a decade ago, but until recently it was applicable only to 
very small items, such as ball bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad is working with the lab and GM under a $14-million program to revamp 
ion implantation to industrial applications. The large accelerator at Los 
Alamos is being used to see if equipment weighing several tons can be treated 
with the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Ion implantation is not just another way of coating a piece of equipment. It 
alters the outer layer in such a way that it produces an incredibly hard 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The target is placed inside the accelerator's vacuum chamber, and the chamber 
is flooded with gas at low pressure. Oscillating radio waves strip the gas 
atoms of electrons, producing positively charged particles, or ions. Short 
pulses of negative charges are applied to the target, attracting the ions like 
a huge magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 The ions strike the target with such force that they bury themselves in the 
surface of the target, physically and chemically transforming the outer 
thousandth of an inch into a much harder material. That could extend an 
object's life span as much as a hundredfold, researchers believe. LEE DYE

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; HATCHERIES HAIL NEW 
STUDY TOOL: IDENTITY 'TAGS' FOR FISH; CONSERVATION: NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP 
ESTABLISH WHETHER STOCKS ARE INTERBREEDING -- AND IF IT MATTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Commercial fish hatcheries in Alaska are using a new technology that will 
enable them to identify every one of the hundreds of millions of fish they 
release into the sea each year, and scientists believe the program could have 
major implications for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Every salmon released by the privately operated Douglas Island Pink and Chum 
Hatchery here, for instance, carries a novel biological marker that allows 
technicians to identify an individual fish years later just as clearly as if it 
had the hatchery's logo stamped on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, developed almost simultaneously in the states of Washington 
and Alaska, is expected to help scientists determine if hatchery fish are 
commingling with wild stocks so much that the genetic pool may be shrinking. 
Some fear that this could impair the ability of wild fish to survive 
environmental changes and resist disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The development comes at a time of upheaval in the fishing industry. Fish 
stocks are so low that salmon fishing has been banned in Washington state this 
year and severely curtailed in Oregon. In Alaska, however, salmon are running 
in record high numbers -- so high, in fact, that the market is glutted and 
fishermen complain that prices are too low to cover their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining stocks of wild fish have led some depressed areas, especially in 
Washington and Oregon, to rely more on hatcheries to replace fish stocks wiped 
out by dams, pollution and overfishing. But that raises the question of whether 
increasing the percentage of hatchery fish will weaken the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are concerned about the possibility of there being inferior 
hatchery fish breeding with superior wild fish, and that you could reduce the 
genetic pool," said Ladd Macaulay, executive director of Douglas Island Pink 
and Chum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no science behind it," he said, adding that no one has been able to 
prove that the gene pool is being weakened. "It's goofy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others don't dismiss the idea so easily. The Juneau hatchery's fish stock 
originated from eggs collected from just 25 wild salmon, so the entire 
population of fish produced by the hatchery consists of relatively few 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to reduce the risk of shrinking the gene pool, according to fisheries 
scientist Robert Burkett of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, is to 
restrict hatcheries to areas where the fish are less likely to stray into 
nearby rivers and reproduce with wild stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't prevent some of them from straying, but you can site your hatchery 
in a spot where its zone of influence is not going to carry over into some 
major producer of wild stock," he said. But he quickly added that it is 
impossible to place a hatchery anywhere in Alaska without being relatively 
close to at least some streams that produce wild stock. Major rivers, however, 
can be avoided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett conceded that geneticists have found evidence that some different 
genes are showing up in the wild population.  
</P>
<P>
 "But what does that mean?" he asked. "Is it bad, something neutral, something 
good? That's the difficult thing to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Macaulay, who believes there is no evidence that hatcheries are weakening 
the gene pool, thinks more research is needed. And to do that, scientists need 
a clearer understanding of what happens to hatchery fish after they are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcheries have marked some of their fish for three decades, using coded wire 
pins that are shot into the snout of the fish before it is released. But that 
is an expensive process, and it is practical only for larger fish such as the 
Chinook or coho, known also as kings and silvers. Much of the salmon stock 
consists of sockeyes, pinks and chums, and these fish are released as fry so 
small that attaching the coded wire is extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're releasing hundreds of millions of fish each year, and they are fry -- 
just little guys," said Macaulay, whose hatchery literally started in his back 
yard many years ago. "How are you going to mark enough to tell you anything? 
Mechanically, that's almost impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with biologists at the Juneau Center for Fisheries and Ocean Sciences 
of the University of Alaska, the hatchery has installed equipment that enables 
it to mark every fish, no matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
 The program grew out of research, begun in Washington, which showed that 
salmon are affected by even slight changes in water temperature almost as soon 
as the eggs hatch. The first bone to develop in the fry is the otolith, a small 
disk in the inner ear, Macaulay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiments revealed that the otolith forms rings, almost like the rings of a 
tree, as it grows. Changing the water temperature by a few degrees creates a 
distinctive ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers ran samples of fry through tanks containing water of various 
temperatures and determined that the changes created marks on the otolith that 
Macaulay likens to the bar code on a candy wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single fry had that mark," he said. "So we knew that for the first time 
in history, all our fish were marked, and that became pretty exciting to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology is "very significant," according to Burkett, because it 
allows hatcheries to mark their entire production, "and that makes things much 
more simple." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The code can be tailored to each batch of fish, to record the specific 
hatchery, the date the fish was released and even the age of the fish at the 
time of release. By sampling salmon from commercial fishing boats, or in the 
thousands of rivers and streams in Alaska, fishery managers will be better able 
to gauge the success of the hatchery and determine how many hatchery fish are 
straying into wild streams. 
</P>
<P>
 The first marked fish began returning to the Juneau hatchery in 1992, and 
early results have yielded some surprises. Some straying is expected, but 
records for 1992 and 1993 suggest that the extent of commingling may be 
influenced by the strength of the overall return. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher proportion of hatchery fish strayed into a nearby creek during 1993, 
when returns were weak, than during 1992, when returns were exceptionally high, 
Macaulay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's strange to us," he said. "We don't know what to make of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take years of study to determine just how much of an effect -- if any 
-- hatcheries are having on wild stocks, but now, at least, managers believe 
they have the tool to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Washington and Oregon fishing industries may be facing extinction, 
catches in Alaska are at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many fish that prices are so low that some hatcheries aren't 
covering their operating costs, and fishermen aren't making their boat 
payments," said Burkett. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the waters of Alaska are rich in salmon now, other years have been 
exceedingly lean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early '70s was such a time," Burkett said, when about 21 million fish 
were harvested annually. In those lean years, the state started about two dozen 
hatcheries since turned over to private operators.

 If you're looking for the University of Minnesota's famous peanut noodle 
recipe or want to browse an on-line dictionary of computing or desperately need 
information about California lighthouses, you can sit down at your computer, 
issue an arcane series of commands and eventually find this data on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can use the Lynx program to plug into the World Wide Web (WWW), a 
library of data stored on the Net and arranged according to the conventions of 
hypertext.Hypertext lets you jump from a highlighted word or sentence to other 
relevant information, thus making it easier to find what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 To use Lynx, you'll need to dial into the Internet using a communications 
program capable of VT-100 terminal emulation, since Lynx assumes you're using 
that kind of terminal. Then simply type "lynx" at the prompt. Lynx will take 
you to its opening page and present a menu of exotic islands of Net resources 
to explore. When traversing the WWW, the arrows on your key pad take on a 
special significance: The left and right arrows move you between levels of 
content (from the general to the very specific), while the up and down arrows 
move you between topics (recipes, books or software, for example). 
</P>
<P>
 As you spelunk the deepest recesses of the Net with Lynx, you can place 
bookmarks in places you want to return to by typing "a", and you can view these 
bookmarks later by typing "v". To get help while using Lynx, type "?". 
</P>
<P>
 If the service you use to access Internet doesn't have Lynx, you can ask your 
provider to obtain a free copy of Lynx via anonymous ftp from ftp2.cc.ukans.edu 
in the /pub/lynx directory. ADAM S. BAUMAN

WAHLCO ENVIRONMENTAL TO REPORT SECOND-QUARTER LOSS; INDUSTRY: THE SANTA ANA 
COMPANY, WHICH WILL CLOSE SOME OF ITS FACILITIES, WILL TAKE A ONETIME 
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $56 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major retrenchment, Wahlco Environmental Systems Inc. said Tuesday that 
it is closing some manufacturing facilities and will report a second-quarter 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it will take a onetime restructuring charge of $56 
million for the three months ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the company had said earlier that it had overestimated the market for 
its pollution control products, Tuesday's announcement was no surprise to Wall 
Street. The company's stock lost 12.5 cents a share to close at $2.625 in light 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime charge consists mainly of a $50.4-million write-down of goodwill 
-- intangible items that can include such things as the value of a company's 
name, reputation and customer list, and the marketability of its products. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlco, which is 80% owned by a unit of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., designs 
and manufactures air pollution control and power efficiency equipment and 
provides related services to electric utilities, refineries and industrial 
manufacturers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had been growing until two years ago. Its 1991 revenue of $88.8 
million was more than double the $40.6 million it reported for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said last year, however, that both earnings and sales were 
being hurt by a shrinking market. They blamed the slump in part on lack of 
compliance with the 1990 federal Clean Air Act amendments -- rules that have 
been bitterly opposed by many businesses because of their complexity and the 
high costs of cleaning up industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 After posting a profit of $11.6 million for 1991, Wahlco reported a loss of 
$12.8 million for 1992 and a loss of $10.9 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To help cope with the sluggish market, company officials said, Wahlco has 
trimmed its payroll by about 300 positions through layoffs and attrition in the 
past year. It now employs about 550. The company also is reducing total 
manufacturing square footage by half. That accounts for about $5 million of the 
second-quarter write-down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlco also said it is in escrow on the sale of its 36,380-square-foot 
manufacturing plant in Montreal, and is negotiating to lease its 
68,000-square-foot building in Fairmont, W.Va., to another business. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is based in Santa Ana, said it wants to cut its sales, 
general and administrative costs by about $10 million a year beginning in the 
current quarter. Those costs totaled $26.3 million for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Henry N. Huta said that orders for some of the company's 
products have begun increasing.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: CARELINE COMPLETES 3 AMBULANCE SERVICE PURCHASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CareLine Inc. said Tuesday that it has completed its previously announced 
acquisitions of three Philadelphia ambulance services. Terms of the purchases 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The three companies -- Metropolitan Ambulance Inc., Procor Ambulance and 
LifeLine Ambulance -- provide non-emergency medical transportation in the 
greater Philadelphia market. All emergency medical transportation there is 
handled by the fire department. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies had combined 1993 revenue of more than $15 million and employ 
about 450 people. 
</P>

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL; TACO BELL'S NEW CHIEF HAS GOOD TASTE IN RESTAURANT VENTURES 
</P>

 Newly named Taco Bell President Kenneth T. Stevens evidently knows good food 
when he tastes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being appointed president of the Irvine-based company on June 27, 
Stevens had served as Taco Bell's executive vice president and was charged 
with, among other things, developing the fast-food chain's non-traditional 
restaurant ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was a senior vice president and treasurer for PepsiCo, Taco Bell's 
parent corporation, before joining the fast-food company. He is credited with 
steering PepsiCo toward its 50% stake in California Pizza Kitchens, a popular 
Los Angeles-based restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken identified and cultivated that investment," one Taco Bell observer said. 
"It's seen as a real feather in his cap."

CONSULTING FIRM REPORTS BIG JUMP IN O.C. NEW-HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that the Orange County housing market is gaining strength despite 
rising mortgage interest rates, sales of new homes jumped 31.5% for the second 
quarter, a real estate consulting firm reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,430 new homes were sold during the past three months, compared 
to 1,845 transactions for the same period of 1993, Meyers Group, a Newport 
Beach consulting company.Sales were up 37.5% from the first three months of 
this year, when 1,767 new houses and condominiums sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combined with an adequate supply coming into the market and good sales 
volume, this quarter's figures show a very healthy marketplace in Orange County 
for new homes," said Buck Panchal, senior consultant with Meyers Group.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the increase in sales was in the detached housing, Panchal said. Sales 
of so-called high-density detached homes, or single-family homes located close 
together, were responsible for some of that increase, he said.

J.M. PETERS BUYS ESTATE-SIZE LOTS FOR $26 MILLION; HOUSING: NEWPORT BUILDER 
SAYS IT PLANS TO MAKE 125-ACRE ACQUISITION IN TARZANA THE 'JEWEL' OF ITS 
SOUTHLAND OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 J.M. Peters Co., the Newport Beach home builder, has paid $26 million in cash 
for 175 estate-size housing lots in a Tarzana community in the Santa Monica 
Mountains, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Mulholland Park, the 125-acre gated community with a view of the San 
Fernando Valley was sold to J.M. Peters by Bank of America, which took over the 
property from a development partnership in a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland Park was designed for luxurious custom residences, with lots 
ranging from 10,000 square feet to 17,000 square feet. J.M. Peters will reduce 
the lots to between 3,500 square feet and 5,500 square feet and build homes 
priced from $500,000 to $1 million each.  
</P>
<P>
 "As our initial project in post-recession Los Angeles County, we are sparing 
no effort to make Mulholland Park the jewel in the crown of our entire 
Southland building program," said Dale Dowers, chief operating officer. Work 
will begin at the end of this year, Dowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-May, J.M. Peters sold $100 million of junk bonds to pay down debt and 
buy land. The company, like most Southern California home builders, has been 
hard hit by the real estate downturn. Since posting a string of losses in the 
early 1990s, however, the company reported a $3.9-million profit for its latest 
fiscal quarter.

BIG O HIRES PAINEWEBBER TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big O Tires Inc. said Tuesday that it has hired PaineWebber Inc. to "evaluate 
alternatives for enhancing the company's value."In a news release, the company 
said it gave Paine Webber a date in September by which to provide an assessment 
of its current financial model and business plan and suggest other alternatives 
open to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was forced by shareholders unhappy with the performance of the 
company's stock. Last month, Big O's management lost a proxy fight led by the 
company's biggest shareholder, Kenneth Pavia of Balboa Investment Group LP in 
Newport Beach, who wanted the company to hire an investment bank.

 Space Program: Space fanatics can stage their own space extravaganzas with a 
new, improved version of "Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space," a computer program 
from Interplay Productions in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer game has been available on floppy disks but is being produced in 
a new CD-ROM format that includes "a lot more video footage, including footage 
from the Soviet space archives," said Interplay Productions spokesman P. Kevin 
Horn. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed for "anyone from age 13 on up who's got a love of 
space," Horn said. Players get to choose their own teams of engineers, 
scientists and astronauts. And, they must contend with alien forces in Congress 
(extraterrestrials in disguise) who want to eliminate space-exploration 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be successful in space but unless you are in good graces with 
Congress, you might not get more money," Horn said. "And, you can finally land 
a man on the moon only to have the (space capsule's) door not open. I've had 
that happen, where I get to the moon and I'm not able to get out because I 
didn't have the funding for a door latch."

A LEGACY SURVIVED; MIKAL GILMORE TELLS THE PAINFUL HISTORY OF A FAMILY -- HIS 
OWN. NOW, YEARS AFTER HIS BROTHER GARY WAS EXECUTED, HE WRITES VIVIDLY OF 
LIVING THROUGH IT ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What could be more purely Americana? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a photograph that could be found hanging above a mantelpiece. Maybe 
slipped inside a gilded frame centered atop the TV. Father in straw hat, mother 
in cloth dress, stern faces and seen-too-much eyes peering far beyond the lens, 
into an expanse -- probably the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the symbolic pitchfork and wood-frame farmhouse looming in the 
background, front-and-center stand three healthy boys -- smiling or goofing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what lies behind this photograph, between the covers of journalist Mikal 
Gilmore's raw yet eloquently rendered family album of memories, "Shot in the 
Heart" (Doubleday, 1994), is Americana turned on its head, Americana 
unflatteringly exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a poignant testament to how three spirited young boys, within a few 
decades, would leave their mark: one dead, another an anonymous recluse and the 
third on Death Row, demanding to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gilmore story is more than a window into an ugly aberration. It is a 
disturbing mirror of the violence that echoes down through generations, simmers 
behind fragile appearances. How many American families, behind smiles or stoic 
stances, could tell heart-rending stories of wreckage and ruin?  
</P>
<P>
 Absent from this photograph, as well as from some of the more awful and 
relentless violence of the family's early years, the youngest Gilmore 
approaches the book at first as an outsider looking in -- curious and detached, 
thirsty to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family I grew up in was not the same family my brothers grew up in," 
writes Mikal. "They grew up in a family that was on the road constantly, never 
in the same place longer than a couple of months at best. They grew up in a 
family where they watched the father beat the mother regularly, battering her 
face until it was a mortified, blue knot. They grew up in a family where they 
were slapped and pummeled and belittled for paltry affronts."  
</P>
<P>
 Structurally, Mikal's testimonial unfolds as a vivid diptych. Panel One begins 
with a macabre history of Mormon blood (his mother's religion), then flows into 
his own family's bloodlines -- the mysterious and incessant hauntings, the 
anger and violence. It is a history tangled -- part fiction, part augmented 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The second panel details the stifling life just after Mikal's now-infamous 
brother, Gary, murdered two Mormon men in Provo, Utah, and then -- equally 
alarmingly -- implored to be put to death by firing squad. To spill his blood 
on Morman soil, "as an apology," Mikal writes, "to God.' 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gilmore got his wish on Jan. 17, 1977, at the age of 36. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, Mikal Gilmore, eight years younger, found himself 
involved in an intricate push-me-pull-you tango with his family and its knotty 
history. He tried walking away, staving off the pain, but was ultimately unable 
to escape the broad cast of their shadows, the persistence of their closeted 
ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 He bumped around the Pacific Northwest a bit and then set down roots in L.A., 
embarking on a serious career in journalism. After a stint with an underground 
paper in Oregon, he began writing about pop culture and music for the L.A. 
Weekly, the now-defunct Herald Examiner and Rolling Stone.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is less generally known," Mikal says in his prologue, is the ". . . 
story of the origins of Gary's violence -- the true history of my family and 
how its webwork of dark secrets and failed hopes helped create the legacy that, 
in part, became my brother's impetus to murder." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that Mikal would escape this "bad legacy," this family's grim 
haunting, that left two brothers dead at an early age, another who effectively 
turned into a wandering ghost. Both mother (branded the family's black sheep 
for marrying a man who was first "too old" and, even worse, not Mormon) and 
father (whose mercurial moods and criminal record kept the family Ping-Ponging 
across the country) in their later years saw Mikal as a symbol of their last 
chance, the only hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My mother) wanted me to survive our bad legacy, to be her best work, and yet 
in order to do that, I felt I had to leave her behind, and of course that hurt 
her," Mikal writes. "You cannot move into a new world and still stay bound to 
the demands of the old world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new world that Mikal has found himself the center of circles back, he's 
learned, to the old one, demanding closure of sorts. Sitting in a corner of 
West Hollywood's Book Soup Bistro, unassuming in faded denims and a white shirt 
upon which rests a small, cubelike silver crucifix dangling from a simple 
chain, Mikal takes sips from a small glass of Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the horrors related in his book, a sense of placidness prevails; it is 
in the ease with which he moves his limbs, the slow scan of his blue-green 
eyes. The only signs of fatigue or world-weariness materialize as circles, like 
faint ash, beneath his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is recalling one of his darker moments -- the eyes still calm, the face 
unchanging -- the brick wall he hit, the moment that sent him on his search. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought: What the hell happened? What happened that we would all be 
essentially childless or without family?" says Mikal of his siblings -- Frank 
Jr. and the late Gary and Gaylen, who died as the result of a stabbing. "And 
that was (when) I began to think about what happened in my family's history, 
that I wanted to understand. I certainly felt that I couldn't go on with my 
life . . . in any kind of productive way without understanding that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal speaks as he writes: with a sense of cool detachment alternating with 
unblinking emotional clarity about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been surprised that the press and public correctly interpreted his 
intentions: to write not a true-crime expose about Gary, but rather he 
stresses, "a book . . . which is about a history of a family, and family 
patterns and examined legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time of Gary's execution, Mikal recalls something worse than a 
nightmare -- the media circus that circled him and his mother and brother Frank 
Jr. Those memories, still vivid, almost halted the project before it began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a lot of shameless ugliness on the part of the media at that point. I 
saw invasions of privacy and violations of grief. . . . I felt invaded by it. 
Particularly in terms of what I saw it do to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 It extended beyond the press, to neighbors and strangers. "People during that 
time had no hesitancy to ask the most personal and inferring questions about an 
experience like that. And that was a large part about why I kept myself away 
from this thing for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 The story finally told, Mikal braced to confront battalions of reporters with 
microphones and news cameras. Those, he admits, have yet to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly was a dark story and a difficult story," Mikal says, "and I 
expected that for that reason it would be difficult and inaccessible for some 
people. And I also thought, given the current climate of this sort of 
hysterical search . . . of easy solutions to crime problems, and the things 
that frighten us, that this book, which is fairly non-judgmental at a certain 
level would be very coolly, at best, received given that climate." 
</P>
<P>
 His journalist status aside, Mikal believes one of the major things that makes 
this time a little different is his brother's place in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a book about something that happened 17, 18 years ago, and there 
really is no news value to it unless someone looks at more topical things to 
relate it to: domestic violence, which is news and should have been news long 
before this happened. Or questions about the death penalty. . . . Those are 
sorta the newsy aspects. Gary's not news." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Gary's name and infamy had retreated from the spotlight, the book's 
larger themes about domestic violence and the prison systems have particular 
resonance. For Mikal, it is a life now assigned a larger context, with a 
community who can and do commiserate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly have had my share of people . . . all along . . . say: 'You grew 
up in this weird, freak family. . . . How did you survive?' . . . But it was 
not a unique family, it wasn't singular in terms of patterns," Mikal explains. 
</P>
<P>
 This insight, however, was something he grew into, with time and exposure to 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, I felt like we were the . . . Addams Family, I really did," 
he says with a wry laugh. "I felt like we were monsters. . . . It wasn't until 
later, much later, that I really began to see that this stuff happens all over 
and nobody talks about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do we think all of this violence is coming from? . . . It's coming from 
people who come out of homes. And if home and families are such great and ideal 
structures, then why are they spawning so much violence and fear we see in 
society right now? It's an obvious thing, but it took me a long time to see." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the survivor's badge, so frequently pinned to him, that makes him 
uneasy. And ironically his survival may have much to do with the blood he feels 
is "bad," the blood he has reservations about passing on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of survival," he says, the thought suspended as if over a chasm, 
"I just figured I just survived for whatever reasons. . . . It was that old 
Mormon stock. They put up with a lot of stuff, they survived a lot of stuff. A 
tough and abiding people, maybe some of that carries over into the blood as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal, who wrote this family memoir in the same room where he stores a green 
jar with chips of Gary's bones -- sifts through his own life's fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to survive," he says, "but certainly it is not without costs. You 
obviously survive with less of yourself than was there before." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he approached this book as a family obituary, of sorts, he unwittingly 
recovered a missing piece: His oldest brother, Frank, who had effectively 
erased himself from the terrain. He found him living in a rooming house in 
Portland, Ore., doing day labor to get by. "This is as much Frank's book as 
mine," says Mikal, who describes his brother as deeply shy and reclusive, "and 
without his voice and his involvement, the story . . . would have been much 
less worthy. The one thing I got from doing this was the last thing in the 
world I expected -- the sense of a living family." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal is protective of his brother's privacy. Some of it comes from his own 
leanings. Life as a recluse, a cleverly altered identity, were notions that 
that the youngest Gilmore also flirted with. Thinking back, he says, his voice 
soft, distant, "There were long seasons of it seeming all pervasive, 
inescapable. I had long periods when I just wanted to leave the world, leave it 
all behind." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while it seemed that attention would never dim -- from a punk anthem and 
"Saturday Night Live" skits to a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Norman Mailer 
("The Executioner's Song") and a tie-in TV movie, Gary's dark memory proved 
ubiquitous -- inescapable for those who survived him. Reinvention, Mikal says, 
"was a kind of escape-valve fantasy that I resorted to many times." 
</P>
<P>
 What stopped him was the immeasurable expense. "I never really considered it 
for a couple of reasons: I wanted to hold on to my name as a writer. . . . I 
thought I had already paid a lot for Gary's acts and for his infamy, and my 
writing was in some ways the only thing I really had in the world that was 
mine, that could not be taken away from me and I did not want to lose that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the more sobering reality was this: "I would always be Gary's brother. I 
could not cut off the past just because I changed my name. I would always be 
somebody who came from this family. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mikal Gilmore, it is this haunting that persists -- the ill deeds, the 
bitter lot. Not the ghosts and inexplicable presences his mother felt at every 
turn. Mikal prefers to ascribe them to the dream realm, those dreams so real 
they feel like experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the family is haunted, that's for sure. I think those were the 
mythological extensions of that haunting, the stories of memories. It was 
easier to live with the idea that there was a real hell around us at the time 
than to deal with the real hell inside of us, and inside of our home." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence as Mikal relates in the book often came out of nowhere -- 
prompted, it seemed, by nothing. Thanksgiving dinners that ended up on the 
floor. Family road trips that became "a thousand miles of arguing and 
slapping." 
</P>
<P>
 And in one of Mikal's at once perplexing and wounding memories: "I went up to 
my mother. I hugged her, kissed her cheek -- things we were all forbidden to 
do, and had always been forbidden to do," he writes. "Next thing I knew, I was 
shoved across the room. 'Keep away from me, you little bastard,' she yelled." 
</P>
<P>
 For these reasons, Mikal finds little difference between the institution of 
family and that of prison. "I always felt like Gary never really left home 
'cause the prison was an extension of the family for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out on the other side, Mikal Gilmore, too, has served a sentence. "I 
think my definition of family hasn't shifted, my definition of love has. . . . 
Family has always been this community of hell that you are most closely bound 
with. As an idea, it is something that I have very long envied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was a kid, you know the stupid little plaques that say, 
'The family who prays together stays together,' and I saw that once at a 
service station . . . and I thought, 'Wow, there's an idea . . . ' and I made 
my mother buy it for me. When people were arguing in our house, I used to walk 
around and show it to them. I wanted us to be that family, who was always on 
our knees praying together and that would bring peace. And of course that would 
never happen. . . . There wasn't a chance in hell that it would happen. I saw 
my life as an impossible ideal, impossible to attain." 
</P>
<P>
 His long-held wish has been, he says, to have a better family than he grew up 
with. "I always wanted my own family. I wanted children very much. I think from 
the time I was 15 or 16." But Mikal says that in his search for an ideal -- a 
relationship that flourishes and the bounty of children -- he has come up with 
empty hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't figure out why the ravages of failed romance or love . . . 
happened. I couldn't understand why. . . . And that sort of added to my hatred 
of family, because family was something other people had." 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances around a particularly painful break-up broke him like a dry 
twig -- the dull ache of a turning point that led him to begin the book. "It 
felt like the last disappointment I could afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Since all of that, Mikal admits that he has been spiritually on the mend. 
Other relationships -- friendships, romances -- have helped to fill the cold 
hollow in his own heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there are ways that I have become . . . a better partner. In 
some ways maybe worse, because there is part of me that flinches, or (is) 
reluctant for outright full commitment because of certain fears . . . the 
thought (of) how much I had lost and I could not lose again." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one thing, however, he still works to reconcile. "The one thing that 
I thought that I would never do is start a family at the age of 50. That's the 
one thing that I've always held against (my father) and found hard to forgive 
-- that he would start a family at such an old age when he could not be there. 
I would never do that, and I'm 43. So the older I get, the more it seems like 
too close." 
</P>
<P>
 And if good fortune turns the corner just as the calender announces age 49, 
"I'm sure in many ways that would be a great thing," he says with an uncertain 
smile, eyes fixated on something out of view. "But it would also seem like one 
of life's nasty tricks."

ALL HOT AND BOTHERED; YOU AREN'T IMAGINING THAT STRONG CASE OF SUMMER LUST. 
SCIENCE BACKS YOU UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marieke Veltman, toned and tanned in a bikini, is taking in summer's sensual 
stimuli: a sunny afternoon, a balmy breeze and buffed men who are practically 
au naturel . 
</P>
<P>
 She points to a guy in a skimpy swimsuit cooling off at a public shower at 
Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades. Rob Heidger, 25, of Santa Monica 
has what she likes in a man: "Strong back, broad shoulders and a nice tushy." 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman, 22, playfully calls it a case of summer lust. 
</P>
<P>
 With its longer days and hotter nights, summer has a reputation for arousing 
the sex drive, stripping away inhibitions -- and sometimes clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a scientific basis for these seasonal surges in urges, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyndon McGill, author of "The Mating Game," (Sundial Press, 1992), and 
lecturer on male-female communication, says that during the shorter, darker 
days of winter, some men and women suffer from depression caused by seasonal 
affective disorder. This affects a person's hormone rhythms, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the winter months, our urges are more repressed. We're in the survival 
urge mode. But as the weather shifts from cloudy to sunny, estrogen levels 
shift from low to high gear. Come summer, we're no longer planting the fruit, 
we're picking it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, Winnifred B. Cutler, author of "Love Cycles: The Science of 
Intimacy" (Villard, 1991), writes that men register higher levels of 
testosterone duringthe warmer months, attributing the increase to "the position 
of the Earth in its orbit around the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen E. Fisher, the author of "Anatomy of Love: The Mysteries of Mating, 
Marriage and Why We Stray" (Fawcett-Columbine, 1994), says sights, sounds and 
scents propel our passion. "The smells of summer -- fragrant flowers, lush 
grass, trees, fresh air, oils that mix with the skin and travel more in the 
humid air -- all make for a lusty season." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, a research associate in the department of anthropology at the American 
Museum of Natural History in New York, says we can blame our increased interest 
in sex on the limbic system, a part of the brain that "governs our strong 
primitive emotions such as anger, jealously, fear, disgust and, of course, love 
and lust." 
</P>
<P>
 She says one of the hallmarks of humans is that we can respond sexually year 
round. "But in the summer, things happen that can trigger more sensual 
feelings," she says, adding that revealing clothes ranks way up there. "Women's 
swimsuits are skimpier than a bra and panties. A man's bathing suit is no more 
than skivvies. It's no wonder people are going from the beach to the bed." 
</P>
<P>
 For many -- young and old -- summertime conjures up the feeling of "school is 
out," says Dennis Palumbo, a therapist who practices in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer, he says, triggers romantic fantasy because there is an impermanence 
about the season. "Summer is going to end and some people are thinking, 'I've 
got to have a summer fling before September.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But while summer casts its romantic spell, health officials warn not to fall 
prey to summer flings without practicing safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it takes is a single act of unprotected intercourse to get gonorrhea, 
chlamydia or AIDS," says Dale Kay of the American Social Health Assn. Kay also 
is director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD national hot 
line, which answered more than 45,000 calls about sexually transmitted diseases 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is this," Kay says. "If you are going to have sex with a 
stranger these days, you should not expect honesty. You should expect to wear a 
condom." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Glickman, founder and president of Condomania, says his shops in Los 
Angeles, on Melrose Avenue, and in New York's Greenwich Village sell 30% more 
condoms during summer than any other season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Richwald, director of the Los Angeles County Sexually Transmitted 
Disease Program, said that at the end of the summer, "student health services 
at schools, private doctors' offices and STD clinics see an increase in 
venereal diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Starr, 23, of Venice, has fond memories of last summer. While 
vacationing in the Bahamas with a group of girlfriends, the 
actress/model/waitress met "a really nice guy" who happened to be a dead ringer 
for actor Andy Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fling at first sight, Starr recalls while soaking in the rays on the 
beach in Pacific Palisades, her cellular phone nearby just in case her agent 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Waterbury, 22, of Santa Monica, is all ears while plopped nearby on the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw each other on the beach and it just went from there," Starr recalls of 
the two weeks that included water-skiing, dancing, gambling, boating and long 
walks along the moonlit beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fantasy fulfilled. We never stayed in touch because that was how we 
both wanted it," she says. "But it will always be a great memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr says that if she finds herself romantically attracted to a guy this 
summer, "he's gonna know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterbury and a friend, Tony Zapata, decline to join a volleyball game, 
deciding that Starr is more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll send out vibes with a look," she says, now in a breathlessly friendly 
voice, "or with a 'Hi, how are you?' . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If he walks up to me, I know he's interested," she says. "But I'm never out 
of control. I don't go out with millions of guys. I'm not like that. It's 
summertime and I believe in just having a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Zapata, a 24-year-old professional volleyball player nicknamed "Sexy 
Mexy" by his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a tan on his 6-foot-5 frame, Zapata chalks up the season's sensual 
stirrings to pheromones, which he defines as "a sexy scent of confidence . . . 
spinning like those dirt things around Pigpen. You know, the Charlie Brown 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 "It breaks down to lust, and that's a feeling you can't avoid, you can't 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially on the beach, where "the menu definitely increases at summertime 
and you're bound to order every now and then," he says, quickly adding that 
he's presently romantically attached and is a safe-sex advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Waterbury, whose nickname is "Lust or Bust," adds: "Have I felt 
lusty this summer? How about in the last 17 seconds? I forget what the 
statistic is, but I remember reading somewhere that males have a sexual thought 
every 17 seconds, and I kind of tend to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the summer, my thoughts go from volleyball to girls, from volleyball 
to girls, from volleyball to girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Waterbury says he evaluates every opportunity for romance "very 
carefully, and gosh, sometimes I bite, sometimes I don't. I'm not gonna call it 
an everyday occurrence, but summer flings are pretty much unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Unger, 24, of Pacific Palisades, says sexual restraint should be 
observed, especially when "the heat is on and the clothes come off and 
everyone's tanned and looking good. Eyes are going everywhere, and that brings 
a lot of attraction to different people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as the heart turns fonder in the summer, therapist Pat Allen, co-author of 
"Getting To I Do" (William Morrow, 1994), says: "Don't touch until you talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about protection. Insist on it," Allen says she instructs at 
relationship seminars in Los Angeles and Orange counties. "Ask if the other 
person has had an AIDS test. Ask, 'Is this summer fling going to be monogamous 
for the next few weeks or months?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Just remember that you can't trust people -- not this summer or any other 
time of the year. If someone says to you, 'I don't have AIDS or an STD,' you 
have to then negotiate the best, safest deal you can and that means protected 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the shower, where the svelte Veltman is ogling Heidger, he likes what 
he hears. His friends coax him near Veltman, whom he has noticed on the beach, 
he later admits. Pretty soon, the two are flirting, egged on by beach pals' 
hooting and hollering. 
</P>
<P>
 But Veltman makes it clear she's not "one of those people to have a one-night 
stand because it's too dangerous." The last two summers she had a steady 
boyfriend. This summer, "if romance happens, that would be cool."

90'S FAMILY; REAL LIFE; FAMILY TRIPS MAY HURT A BIT, HELP A LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's talk to a father of two girls, 15 and 11. He's a college professor who 
freely describes himself as impatient, controlling, demanding, judgmental and 
critical. And that's when he's at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, hoping to experience a "nice bonding kind of thing as a family," he 
agreed last summer to a $7,500, 28-day, 5,500-mile tour of Colorado, Wyoming, 
Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Traveling in a car . Sleeping together in one room . 
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with the 15-year-old was already iffy and volatile. The idea 
was definitely his wife's. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many planners of family vacations, he thought perhaps that being thrown 
together without possibility of parole might give them a chance to communicate 
and improve matters. But unlike many, he already knew it could just as easily 
turn into disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a high risk, high potential return kind of thing and left to my own 
devices, I would not have risked it."  
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he said he is glad they did it, even though the results were 
"mixed. Very mixed."  
</P>
<P>
 He still remembers barking when the rental car wasn't ready, losing his temper 
when waitresses were too slow. The final night of the trip he blew up at 
dinner, forcing one embarrassed daughter to flee the restaurant because she 
didn't understand why he insisted on moving away from a noisy family at the 
next table.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the scenery was wonderful and they did accomplish some 
family bonding during a white-water rafting trip that they loved and he 
endured. He said the trip forced him to accept his children's feelings even 
though they defied adult logic. And he gained a respect for their ability to 
travel without complaining. They didn't whine, nor beg for silly souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, he said that despite the painful moments, once they got home, a 
warm glow began to surround the trip. Now, their photos and mementos elicit 
fond memories, not recollections of the hassles.  
</P>
<P>
 Whenever anything went wrong, he says most of the time it was due to his own 
low boiling point. To other parents he advises: "Make even more of an effort to 
be patient, tolerant, understanding and flexible. . . . And travel light." 
</P>
<P>
 This father's balanced expectations for the trip are just about the only thing 
that set his experience apart from many others, therapists said.  
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Alan Entin of Richmond, Va., said the main problems with family 
vacations are the variety of conflicting and often unrealistic expectations of 
the travelers, and the fact that no family is used to spending 24 hours a day 
together. "We think things will be different when in actuality, we bring all 
our past experiences with us. It makes for an explosive situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, vacations rank with death, divorce and marriage as one of life's 
major stressful situations, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sullen teen-agers present the biggest challenge, said Claremont psychologist 
Cathleen Brown. Her advice? Leave them at home.  
</P>
<P>
 She also suggests bringing along the kids' friends. Or teaming up with other 
families for group vacations. Or stopping off to visit relatives. "The nuclear 
family on vacation is just too tight knit," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For younger children traveling in a car, she suggests bringing along plenty of 
games, drawing pads, puzzles, puppets and books. In addition, she advises 
awarding points for such behavior as positive observations or comments, jokes, 
silence or sleeping. Subtract points for arguing, complaining, whining and 
hitting. The points can then be traded for extra treats.  
</P>
<P>
 One tempting option, sending them off to camp by themselves for the whole 
summer, is just "chickening out," Brown said. Despite the pitfalls, family 
vacations are worth it and turn into lifelong, fond memories no matter how 
frustrating they are.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, kids forget the really bad part. Parents would be wise to look 
at it like a kid and just remember the funny things and the good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Vacations, she said, "are one of those things that looks really good when 
you're planning it and is nice in retrospect. The only hard time is right when 
you're there."

FIRST PERSON: 90'S FAMILY; IT'S SINK OR SWIM -- FOR DAD TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED STOCKLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Daddy, help me! Help me!" screamed Lauren, my 4-year-old daughter. "Daddy, 
just give me a hug and a kiss, Daddy, please." 
</P>
<P>
 I fought the instinct to snatch her from the arms of a man I had just met who 
was carrying her off into the deep end of a swimming pool. Instead, I did my 
best to smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was Mike O'Brien and I had no doubt that he could be trusted with my 
first born. In 1984, he won an Olympic gold medal in the 1,500-meter relay. 
Today he's teaching my two daughters and six other Barney-generation kids to 
swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I let you go," said O'Brien, making strong eye contact with Lauren, "I 
want you to kick your feet and look for my hand under water." 
</P>
<P>
 "No!" screamed Lauren, desperately clinging to him, "I want my daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready, one . . . two . . . three . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He let her go and down she went. I've seen bricks that float better. And he 
let her stay under water for a painfully long time, at least three or four 
seconds, then he pulled her out, kicking and screaming, gasping and coughing. 
</P>
<P>
 I was having doubts about the whole idea. It seemed to border on cruelty. In 
the old days didn't they used to dunk people as punishment? These swim lessons 
seemed almost as abusive. I questioned our motives as well. Were we forcing 
these kids into the pool for their good or so we could brag to the other 
parents? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it sounded like a good idea at first. O'Brien teaches swimmers of 
all ages and guarantees that after 10 days of lessons, toddlers will be able to 
swim. No other swim program we investigated could do that. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were other things we liked about O'Brien's method: The kids are in 
the water from the first day; no kick boards, goggles or water wings are 
allowed, just a swimsuit. O'Brien wants the parents to be there, but we're not 
allowed to interfere. The kids must learn to swim, whether they want to or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not a choice that the child should be making," O'Brien said. "The 
parents know what's best, and the parents should decide." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien prepared us for the screaming and crying, but what we weren't prepared 
for was watching our children reach a major developmental milestone before our 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time our kids have really had to do something difficult," said 
Camille Guice, a mental health professional with two kids in the water. "It's a 
real challenge because we can't do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 And neither can O'Brien, but every step of the way he is pushing them, 
encouraging them and challenging them. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was Lauren's turn to rest, he held her a few feet from the wall, 
counted to three and let her go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kick your feet," he said to the stream of air bubbles bursting on the surface 
above her head. "Reach for the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 It took two tries, but she made it safely to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you do it?" O'Brien nearly had to shout over her screaming. "I think you 
did, you did it yourself!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Katherine's turn. She turned 2 in February and she can really 
scream. I tried not to let her crying get to me, but on the inside I felt like 
one of those Looney Toon characters who's getting his blood pressure checked 
and the mercury climbs past the "Red" zone into the "Deadly" zone, when the 
machine explodes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the third lesson, Katherine started crying the moment my wife, Jane, got 
out the swimsuits. She kept crying until we got to the pool. But as soon as she 
saw O'Brien in the water, she stopped crying, put on her swimsuit and climbed 
into the pool, splashing playfully. 
</P>
<P>
 From the very first lesson I observed in the children an emotion that I had 
never seen in them before. They seemed stronger and more grown-up. Confident, 
almost cocky. And quite pleased with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to swim is unlike anything our kids have ever done. Swimming is not 
easy. It's scary and dangerous, with a built-in set of rewards and punishments.

<P>
 And if the child doesn't learn, if she doesn't try, she'll sink and swallow 
water. For those moments underwater, she'll feel isolated and alone and 
panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if she does listen and try, she'll learn to keep her head out of the 
water, to jump in from the side and swim underwater, and to swim across the 
pool. In the end, that made it worth all the screaming.

90'S FAMILY; A KID'S BEST FRIEND; PETS CAN TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. 
BUT THEY MAY BE LONGTIME COMPANIONS, SO CHOOSE WISELY.

 A Manhattan Beach hamster turned its exercise wheel for the last time 
recently, but the only family member in mourning was its owner, Matthew Zarro, 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hampy gave me the willies," confessed Matthew's mother, Tina Zarro. "It was 
constantly escaping for days at a time, chewing stuff up and pooping in its 
food. I was always digging it out from under the bed." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Matthew and millions of other children, it's these very same qualities 
that make hamsters and their guinea pig and rat cousins so endearing. An 
estimated 58% of American households have a pet of some kind, be it rodent or 
rabbit, fish or fowl, feline or canine. Experts agree that pets help teach 
children important lessons -- about responsibility, compassion and the natural 
cycle of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Cats, with a U.S. population of 62 million, outnumber dogs by about 7 million. 
But when it comes to choosing an affectionate companion for youngsters, dogs 
still rank No. 1 in the hearts of many families. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dog doesn't care if a kid gets a C on a report card or his room is dirty," 
said animal behaviorist Warren Eckstein, whose book "How to Get Your Dog to Do 
What You Want" (Fawcett Books) is scheduled to be published in the fall. "A dog 
is rah, rah, rah all the time. With the pressure on kids these days, dogs are 
always there." 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other pet, a dog supplies a child with its own cheerleading 
section. Because of the close bond that forms between kids and their dogs, 
experts recommend that families take their time and choose a pet carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 For families with young children, certain hardy, mellow breeds such as golden 
retrievers and Labrador retrievers are widely regarded as excellent pets, while 
such breeds as toy poodles, Pekingese and Yorkshire terriers are generally 
considered too fragile. But contrary to popular belief, some of the largest 
dogs -- St. Bernards, Newfoundlands and Great Pyrenees -- can be patient with 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like larger people, larger dogs are aware that their size provokes fear and 
compensate by being gentle," Eckstein said. "It's not uncommon to see a very 
big dog being bossed around by a small dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Stereotypes are constantly being proved wrong. "You got what ?" shocked 
friends asked when they learned that Lisa and Stephen Nesbitt of Santa Monica 
had replaced their sons' nippy cocker spaniel with a Rottweiler. A stint at 
obedience school helped turn 85-pound Alice into a loving pet and excellent 
guard dog. While solicitors take three steps back when they see Alice at the 
door, she thinks of herself as one of the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many owners compare the responsibility of raising a puppy to that of 
raising children. From "puppy-proofing" a house to providing consistent 
discipline and lots of love and affection, dog-rearing tips sound a lot like 
parenting advice. "You can't go in blindly when you bring a puppy into the 
house," said Alice's owner, Lisa Nesbitt. "Puppies require a lot of care and 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs have a keen ability to read and respond to human emotion, including 
stress and depression. For years, dogs have been comforting hospitalized 
children such as those at Long Beach Memorial Miller Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "A visit from a dog transforms the hospital from a very structured and 
demanding place into a more normal environment," said Rosemarie Mills, a child 
life specialist at the hospital, whose cocker spaniel, Mikey, often cheers 
young cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs have a real sense for what's going on and are very therapeutic. They 
bring out a lot of nurturing in the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Like children, dogs don't come cheap. Between veterinary bills, food, 
training, grooming and toys, owners can expect to spend a minimum of $11,500 
over the average dog's 11-year life span, according to the American Kennel 
Club. This does not include the purchase price, which can range from $50 to 
$5,000, or any unusual medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the best place to find a puppy? If a family has no particular need for 
a pedigree, adopting a dog from a local shelter is a good choice. "Not only do 
they make wonderful pets, you are also saving a life," said Dr. Jan Feingold, 
an Oxnard veterinarian. The best source for a purebred dog, Feingold said, is a 
reputable local breeder: "Breeders will stand by the dog if there is a problem 
and can assure you of its lineage and vaccination record." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a litter of adorable puppies, how does one choose? For an 
indication of how a grown dog will look and behave, ask to see the dam and 
sire, experts said. Then observe how a puppy interacts with its litter mates 
and people. "I don't want the real shy puppy that is hanging out in the back or 
the one jumping all over me," Eckstein said. 'I always want the dog in the 
middle; the one who greets me and then backs off." 
</P>
<P>
 For a 7- or 8-week-old puppy, the first few days away from its litter mates 
are very lonely. Owners can help by lavishing the puppy with attention and 
providing a place for it to sleep inside. At night, crying puppies often find 
comfort in radio music, said Lowel Davis, a Covina dog judge and Great Dane 
breeder. Although the ideal age for spaying and neutering is a subject of 
debate -- 9 to 10 weeks or six to seven months -- the procedure should 
definitely be done well ahead of a dog's first year, Davis added. 
</P>
<P>
 If a dog has been the "only child" in the house, it may become jealous of a 
new baby. Pet experts advise preparing a dog for a baby's arrival by 
socializing it to children and familiarizing it with typical baby sounds and 
smells. Most experts agree that an infant should never be left unsupervised 
with a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Because dogs mature quickly, training should begin as early as 8 weeks. "By 
the time the puppy is 4 months old, he is already in the terrible twos," said 
Eckstein, who recommends training a puppy in the house. "Obedience class is 
fine, but the dog usually responds like Rin Tin Tin in class and when you get 
home it becomes Cujo the killer dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their highly social nature, dogs will do whatever it takes to get 
attention. "Whether they are out in the back yard catching a Frisbee until they 
pass out, (or the family is) barbecuing or watching TV, dogs want so much to be 
included," Eckstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are times that even a dog must draw the line. For Marcie, the Zarro 
family's yellow Labrador retriever, that line is represented by a water-ski 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcie loves swimming and Jet Skiing with the kids, but the minute one of us 
gets in the water to ski, she goes crazy," Tina Zarro said. "She leaps off the 
boat and grabs at the skier. I think it's her maternal instinct trying to 
rescue a member of her pack." Dog Days of Summer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Debra Haffner, executive director of Sexuality Information and Education 
Council of the United States -- an advocacy organization and clearinghouse on 
human sexuality in New York -- says there are five criteria for a sexual 
relationship between adults this summer, whether it's a one-night stand, a 
vacation fling or a marriage: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The relationship should be consensual. 
</P>
<P>
 2. It should be non-exploitative, meaning "no one is using each other." 
</P>
<P>
 3. It should be honest. The relationship should mean the same to both parties. 
"Whether it's love or a one-night both partners should know and communicate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 4. It should be mutually pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Both parties should have the right to know about each other's sexual 
history. They should also practice safe sex. That means using condoms and being 
protected against sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS and pregnancy. MICHAEL

JAZZ TRADITIONALISTS BANDING TOGETHER; NEW ORLEANS: PRESERVATION HALL 
CLARINETIST MICHAEL WHITE IS DELIGHTED BY A NEW GENERATION'S INTEREST IN THE 
MUSIC. THE GROUP PLAYS THURSDAY AT THE IRVINE BARCLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When traditional-jazz clarinetist Willie Humphrey died last month in New 
Orleans at the age of 93, he took a little of his art with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Humphrey, credited before his death as being the oldest regular performing 
New Orleans musician, was only 6 when the man often credited with inventing 
jazz -- cornetist Buddy Bolden -- was committed to a Louisiana state mental 
hospital, effectively ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Humphrey, who was born a year after Louis Armstrong, would be 
considered among the second generation of New Orleans jazz musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 His death leaves a gnawing question: Will future generations of players keep 
traditional New Orleans jazz alive? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is yes, according to 39-year-old clarinetist Michael White, who 
regularly performed with Humphrey as a member of the Preservation Hall Jazz 
Band. In a phone call last week from New Orleans, White, who appears with the 
Preservation Hall band Thursday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, says keeping the 
music alive is a struggle, but a new generation is responding to it as never 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I discovered New Orleans music at, I guess, a relatively late age, I 
discovered something that was really very beautiful and very spiritually 
powerful. I can understand why it has fans all over the world, often in 
countries where English isn't even spoken, where you'd never think you'd find 
New Orleans jazz. It's like a religious cult." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who's been associated with Preservation Hall for about 12 years, began 
playing in brass marching bands in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played the traditional parades -- funeral parades, club and church 
parades. The brass band tradition is New Orleans music, but it has a different 
instrumentation and a smaller repertoire than small-band jazz. It was mainly 
ensemble music and did not allow for a lot of solo playing. So I spent my first 
years as a jazz musician without ever having played a solo." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime around 1978, White purchased a recording of clarinetist George Lewis, 
who was born in 1900. It pointed him down a new path. "That particular 
recording was very influential because it showed me a different direction 
toward smaller-band orchestral playing and the authentic traditional style 
outside of the brass bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ensembles were one of the most important aspects of New Orleans jazz," 
he said. "The smaller-band playing is more intricate and my role on clarinet 
became more important because I had to play more harmonies with the trumpet and 
because I played solos and improvisation. Also the repertoire is larger." 
</P>
<P>
 As is common in any art form, White learned from his elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to know people like Kid Thomas Valentine, born in 1896, and Sweet Emma 
and Percy Humphrey (Willie's surviving brother) very well. They got to be very 
close personal friends and I gained a lot from them. The elements of teamwork, 
sharing and constraint, those are very difficult to find these days. But that's 
what this music is all about and that's what they taught." 
</P>
<P>
 White has done as much as anyone of his generation to further the cause. Along 
with his work with Preservation Hall, he leads his own Original Liberty Jazz 
Band, a group that has recorded two albums for the Antilles label. Both 
included appearances by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The band makes annual New 
Year's Eve appearances at New York's fabled Village Vanguard club. 
</P>
<P>
 White also has directed the New Orleans music program for the Lincoln Center 
Jazz Orchestra for the last five years and has assembled concerts on the music 
of Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver. He is currently compiling a concert of 
music from "cornet kings" prior to the Louis Armstrong period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if New Orleans jazz is to continue it's up to the people of my 
generation to make it happen. While I'm not optimistic about it, I haven't 
given up by any means. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that the music no longer pertains to the living 
culture. But you could say that about all forms of jazz -- swing, be-bop -- you 
could even say that about free jazz and Ornette Coleman. He started that in 
1959, some 35 years ago. Is the music of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie 
relevant? Is the music that John Coltrane played still valid? Of course they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping traditional music alive means more than just preserving it. "Even when 
we do theme concerts from the '20s -- and nobody in New Orleans does these 
things, by the way -- we're not trying to copy exactly what Johnny Doods or 
Jimmie Noone played," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of the music in New Orleans itself is a matter of consternation for 
White. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm in New Orleans playing for a bunch of tourists," says the 
well-traveled White, "I could play the greatest Jelly Roll Morton and King 
Oliver music that there is and somebody would still say, 'Play 'The Saints Go 
Marching In' or 'Closer Walk With Thee.' The tendency in New Orleans is to 
simplify things and give 'em what they want. So people tend to play no more 
than eight or 10 tunes. I would give up if I had to play 'Bourbon Street 
Parade' every night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But White, who teaches jazz history at Xavier University, sees hope for the 
music in his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember I'm dealing with the hip-hop generation. But I've been 
amazed by my students. And they get great satisfaction when they see people 
pictured in the textbooks, residents of New Orleans, sitting right there in 
class with them, telling them about the music. That's when you can see there's 
a future for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Preservation Hall Band is a big part of that future. The ensemble that 
plays the Irvine Barclay this week (there are three touring Preservation bands) 
includes its share of veterans, but, in addition to White, contains 
thirtysomething pianist John Royen and is led by 39-year-old trumpeter Wendell 
Brunious. Brunious co-led the band with veteran New Orleans trumpeter Kid 
Thomas Valentine, until he died in 1991. This is how the torch is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Preservation Hall Jazz Band plays Thursday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 8 p.m. $20 to $24. (714) 854-4646.

VIOLA'S ADVENTURES IN 'TWELFTH NIGHT'; THEATER: SHAKESPEARE ORANGE COUNTY FINDS 
A WONDERLAND OF REFERENCES, OR WHAT YOU WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orson Welles was the first director to use what is called today a "concept" 
with a Shakespearean play. He placed his late 1930s WPA production in Haiti and 
called it "The Voodoo Macbeth." It fit beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many directors have pasted on concepts that neither amplify nor 
clarify the Shakespearean text, and the fit is often uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while, however, a director's concept will serve the Bard's work in 
such a way that the text is not only made more accessible to its audience, but 
adds a further note of entertainment to the narrative.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Southland productions of a Dr. Seuss "Midsummer Night's 
Dream" and a "Star Wars" version of "A Comedy of Errors" have entranced 
audiences. Shakespeare Orange County's second offering of its summer season 
Thursday at the Waltmar Theatre in Orange shows every sign of being as 
intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bard's "Twelfth Night," subtitled "Or, What You Will," the heroine 
Viola survives a shipwreck and washes ashore in a strange land called Illyria, 
"a kind of crazy place," according to director Carl Reggiardo. A few months 
ago, when he began thinking about his production of "Twelfth Night," he started 
with an idea that had piqued his fancy for several years. Viola's impressions 
of Illyria must have been very much like Alice's reactions when she dropped 
down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two characters kind of melded in my mind," Reggiardo said. "I thought 
I'd take it a step further and go back to Lewis Carroll's books, 'Wonderland' 
and 'Through the Looking Glass,' and see if I could really draw a line between 
the characters and situations in those books and times, and 'Twelfth Night.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He found more than he had bargained for. In a close examination, he realized 
that both authors not only loved language, but loved playing with language. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found," he explains, "that with the White Rabbit, with the Mad Hatter, with 
the March Hare, the way they spoke, the things they said, were very close to a 
lot of the dialogue in 'Twelfth Night.' Not the same ideas, but the style of 
speaking, in puns, in non sequiturs, curiously worded, very hard to define. The 
characters in the play do that a lot. The play's famous for all that unusual 
dialogue from Feste or Toby Belch. It works right in with the contrariness of 
how the 'Wonderland' characters speak and why Alice gets upset with them 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors have also noted how close Carroll's dialogue is, even in content, 
to Shakespeare's in places. This affinity convinced Reggiardo that the idea 
would work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Reggiardo started rehearsing, he told the cast that the play's subtitle, 
"What You Will," might be better than the actual title. "Twelfth Night," the 
last day of Christmas, was a season in Elizabethan times of celebrants changing 
costumes and pretending to be someone else for the festivities. To Reggiardo, 
that fits just fine with similar carryings-on in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly fits in with what we're doing with Alice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The text of the play and Shakespeare's language is foremost in any production 
of his plays, and Reggiardo firmly believes in a director's respect for the 
work. The production will be according to Hoyle, and to the playwright. The 
effect comes from the visual. The architecture will be Renaissance, as will the 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. It might be better to say the costumes are Renaissance-plus, to 
bridge the connection between Alice's world and Viola's. The dissolute Toby 
Belch will be more egg-shaped than potbellied. He's Humpty-Dumpty. Malvolio 
wears a wig that simulates ears as an iambic and scurrying White Rabbit. Two 
servants echo Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee, dressed the same, behaving the same, 
moving the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costume designer Cathy Crane-McCoy, whose job it is to keep the clothes in 
period and yet to mirror the famous John Tenniel illustrations, says it has 
been a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been taking the Tenniel look and sort of reconfiguring it into a 
Renaissance look." 
</P>
<P>
 She has added a brim to a tall 16th-Century hat for jester Feste as the Mad 
Hatter and padded an actor for "a more oval feel" rather than just "putting an 
egg on stage" for Belch's Humpty. None of it could be any more outlandish than 
the exaggerated costumes Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch gave his 
contemporary subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Crane-McCoy adds, "More subliminal statements work the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I didn't want to hit people over the head with. I like things 
that creep up on you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Reggiardo, when directing Shakespeare, finding a concept isn't his first 
choice, unless it has a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem to fit this particular play," he says. "It might make the play 
more accessible to the audience. A little bit of fun is added, and as they 
recognize these 'Alice' references, they can use those to give them entree into 
the characters and situations of 'Twelfth Night.' And it will help younger 
audience's follow Viola's predicament more easily and more closely."

FRESH IDEAS PAY OFF AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: STRONG OPENINGS BOOST CONCEPT FILMS 
SUCH AS 'SPEED,' 'THE SHADOW' AND OTHER ORIGINAL IDEAS, WHILE STAR VEHICLES 
STALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Concept is selling, stars are not. That's the assessment of what is hot on the 
big screen by industry pundits a couple of weeks shy of summer 1994's half-way 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed" and "The Shadow" are concept movies that had strong openings, although 
neither had much audience buzz until advertising and/or sneak preview 
promotions began. "I Love Trouble" and "Wyatt Earp" had a great deal of 
awareness, due to the supposedly sure-fire presence of, respectively, Julia 
Roberts and Kevin Costner. Neither bowed to the kind of business that paying 
$7-million-plus star salaries should guarantee. Even stars in cost-inflated 
sequels to major hits, like Eddie Murphy and Billy Crystal, did not bring home 
the bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 Concepts that appeared original, even if it was a live-action version of an 
old animated TV series like "The Flintstones" or an original all-animal 
inhabited animated movie like "The Lion King" caught fire. If the idea was a 
retread, like "Baby's Day Out" (known as "Home Alone" with an infant), there 
were few takers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that temporary truism is about to be upended, predicts one studio head, as 
Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"), Arnold Schwarzenegger ("True Lies"), Harrison Ford 
("Clear and Present Danger") and Jim Carrey ("The Mask") blaze into theaters 
with both barrels blaring in conspicuous star vehicles. "You ain't seen nothin' 
yet," says Tom Sherak, 20th Century Fox's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if he's right, predictions are that last year's record will be shattered 
-- even without a "Jurassic Park" $346 million in the mix. "It'll certainly 
come close," forecasts Richard Cook, Disney's distribution chief. One reason is 
that this year there's less front-loading: The studios usually bring the best 
wine out first. By mid-July, they're scooping out the dregs. For various 
reasons, including the fact that such films as Schwarzenegger's "True Lies" 
weren't ready, the summer will get a back-end boost. That's good for summer and 
for the year's box office in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even taking 'Jurassic' into account, the first six months of 1994 are about 
even with last year," says John Krier of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box 
office. "Now we have a chance to pull ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Fourth of July weekend was only about 10% behind last year when 
three major front-loaders, "Jurassic," "Sleepless in Seattle" and "The Firm," 
were already in theaters. And it was leagues ahead of most other summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of this summer's films, "Lion King," "Flintstones" and "Speed," have 
already, or will eventually gross more than $100 million. "Maverick" will come 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney continues to astound itself with its animated blockbusters. Cook never 
expected to top $100 million with "The Lion King" only 11 days into its 
national release. He is cautious about quoting the film's upside potential, 
although the industry consensus is that $250 million is attainable in the 
United States and Canada alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And since schools have just let out, there are two full months of 
seven-days-a-week business to lift "Lion" to be the year's biggest grossing 
film. As impressive as those figures seem, with animated films, theatrical box 
office is just the start.  
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme is the disaster of "Wyatt Earp," a $60- million film, 
which has grossed only about $15.6 million so far, not even enough to cover its 
marketing costs. It is Costner's second consecutive disappointment, following 
"A Perfect World," which did not work domestically although it cleaned up 
overseas. Why did it fail while "Maverick" will gross more than $90 million? 
What does that say about the Western genre? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely nothing. "Maverick" is a brand name from the TV series and also had 
such stars as Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster. The concept sold, the stars didn't 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warners made a mistake releasing 'Wyatt Earp' in summer," says an executive 
from another studio, trafficking in hindsight. At least marketing-wise, he 
argues, the three-hour film had better potential as a fall prestige event 
movie, like "Dances With Wolves." A little more distance from last Christmas' 
surprise hit "Tombstone," which told the Earp story and grossed about $55 
million, would have also been wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyatt Earp" illustrates the dilemma of studios promising audiences and 
exhibitors their biggest guns in summer and/or Christmas and spending the farm 
to deliver.  
</P>
<P>
 "I Love Trouble" is another example, and even more baffling. The $40-million 
production delivered only $7.5 million in its debut (just under $10 million in 
five days), which seems inconceivable in a romance-parched summer -- and for a 
film that stars Roberts, one of Hollywood's biggest box-office draws. 
</P>
<P>
 Even stranger, it was beat out by "The Shadow" and "Blown Away," neither of 
which appeared to have as strong a commercial edge. It barely knocked out 
"Wolf," the Jack Nicholson/Michelle Pfeiffer pairing, which has been the 
dominant adult (the over-25 audience) title for the summer so far, with about 
$50 million grossed to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer again was confusing marketing, says one source close to the Disney 
romantic film. "Shadow" and "Blown Away" plugged away at the young male 
audience, "Speed" notwithstanding. Both films topped $10 million for the 
weekend. "Wolf" went after grown-ups and stayed on their tail. Early ads for "I 
Love Trouble" indicated a romantic comedy. The trailer sold the film as an 
action comedy. And the more recent TV campaign changed the emphasis to romantic 
thriller with shades of Roberts' last film, "The Pelican Brief." 
</P>
<P>
 "In doing so, Disney lost Roberts' key female audience and failed to attract 
males," says a competing studio executive. Cook indicated that the shift over 
the next week will be back to romantic comedy for "I Love Trouble."  
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders suggest that the other summer casualties all fit into the 
deja vu category. Films such as "Renaissance Man," "Getting Even With Dad," 
"Little Big League" and "The Cowboy Way" seemed derivative of other more 
successful predecessors.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 'MODELS INC.': PERFECT FOR SGTV; SG STANDS FOR 
SUPERB GARBAGE, RAISED HERE TO AN ART FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone is here. I feel so unbelievably average -- Gorgeous model attending 
Malibu party in "Models Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's "Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric" and CBS' "America Tonight" are 
turning 9 p.m. Wednesdays into television's gathering place for Inquiring 
Minds. If recent tradition holds, you know what that will probably mean 
tonight: O.J. time. 
</P>
<P>
 So do yourself a favor and tune in something that promises to be infinitely 
more fun, if just as witless. Fox has the real America tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's releasing no episodes of its new summer series, "Models Inc.," for 
preview. Obviously, the producers don't want to be embarrassed by advance 
praise for their depiction of the "intrigue, envy and heartbreak" of "the 
glamorous world of modeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice try, but it won't work. In advance of tonight's second episode (at 9 on 
KTTV-TV Channel 11), here's the word on last week's 90-minute premiere for 
those who didn't watch: It was so unbelievably below average that it was 
endearing. Just missing greatness, it was not quite bad enough to be hilarious, 
but plenty bad enough to be amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Which was probably the intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of television is garbage, yet very little of it Superb Garbage (SG), 
television that knows it's garbage and wants to be garbage, all the while 
sculpting garbage into art. "Dallas" and "Dynasty" were quintessential SG, for 
example, mountainous mounds of richly satisfying rubbish, utterly transcendent 
in their manifestation of this underrated genre. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to delivering a message about the way certain segments of Los 
Angeles live, Aaron Spelling's "Models Inc." is in a hallowed category with his 
famed "Hollywood Wives," which first ran on ABC in 1985. Arguably the most SG 
miniseries of our time, it was so unabashedly mindless that watching it was 
pure joy. Remember? 
</P>
<P>
 " Movie star Ross Conti slept with his makeup girl before sleeping with 
playgirl Karen Lancaster, daughter of a superstar who once slept with a 
15-year-old girl on his dressing room floor. Scheming sex priestess Gina 
Germaine slept with studio head Oliver Eastern and then with director Neil Gray 
. . . who had heart failure in bed with Gina while his wife, Montana, was in 
bed with aspiring actor Buddy Hudson, a former prostitute who didn't know that 
he and his homicidal twin were the illegitimate sons of Ross Conti and super 
agent Sadi Lasalle.  
</P>
<P>
 " Then they all did lunch. "  
</P>
<P>
 Although "Models Inc." doesn't yet reach that level of artistic trash, it 
definitely has SG potential. A spinoff from Spelling's "Melrose Place" on Fox, 
"Models Inc." portrays "beautiful young women struggling to succeed in one of 
the most competitive, yet sought-after professions." Real-life models naturally 
will recognize it as being accurate to the smallest detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The young, exquisite models have a matriarchal leader. Their mentor and 
landlord (they live in her Malibu house) is glamorously ruthless agency owner 
Hillary Michaels (Linda Gray), who was introduced last season as the mother of 
the nasty Amanda on Fox's "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week on "Models Inc.," before even 10 minutes had elapsed, magnificent 
model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov) was removing her dress on the beach and 
sinking to the sand with handsome photographer Brian Peterson (Cameron Daddo). 
Or was it Teri and handsome Eric Dearborn (David Goldsmith)? Or Brian and Eric? 
At this stage, everyone was looking alike. In any event, the next day, Teri 
told Hillary she was leaving the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hillary and Teri quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Hillary and Brian quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then beautiful model Julie Dante (Kylie Travis) told a handsome photographer 
named Josh she'd "do anything" for a shooting session. Then she came on to her 
former lover, Hillary's handsome son, David (Brian Gaskill). 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brian met Teri at a bar, and they quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Julie, beautiful new model Sarah Owens (Cassidy Rae), beautiful model 
Linda Holden (Teresa Hill), Teri and her beautiful sister, model Carrie 
(Carrie-Anne Moss), were splashing around in a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri and Carrie quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Julie and Josh had sex on his mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Sarah's first modeling assignment at a motorcycle show ended badly when 
the client came on to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Linda kicked out Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Julie and Sarah quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary revealed that she walked out on her own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie and Sarah quarreled again. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie and Carrie quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian and Hillary quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Teri quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian and David quarreled. 
</P>
<P>
 At her farewell party, in an unforeseen plot twist, Teri quarreled with no 
one. However, Teri did tell Carrie to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Teri was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie called Josh a "pompous windbag and an immoral creep." 
</P>
<P>
 David came on to Sarah. On the screen together, these two kids were every bit 
as torrid as George and Gracie. What an acting clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Julie told Sarah, "You're finished, bitch!" 
</P>
<P>
 When the premiere episode ended, "Models Inc." rolled in highlights of 
tonight's intrigue, envy and heartbreak, with Hillary becoming a suspect in 
Teri's murder, and just about the entire unbelievably above-average looking 
cast attending Teri's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Where naturally they quarreled.

A ROLLER COASTER RIDE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT; TELEVISION: DEBORAH NORVILLE HAS 
RE-EMERGED AS CO-ANCHOR OF 'AMERICA TONIGHT' ON CBS AFTER A TROUBLE-FILLED 
TENURE AT NBC'S 'TODAY' SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deborah Norville comes sweeping into the small offices at "America Tonight," 
her new CBS newsmagazine, apologizing for being late. Dressed in a coat-dress 
and brown pumps, her blond hair short and tousled, Norville looks looser and 
much happier than her days as anchor on "NBC News at Sunrise," where she 
regularly looked perfect at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, in makeup and set hair, polished nails clicking away at her 
computer, the rising star gave controlled answers in her first national 
interview (for People magazine) that revealed little of herself -- other than 
that she thought it was a "tragedy" that more American women didn't sew their 
own clothes. (The statement was hooted at by NBC News employees.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what do you want from me?" she says, laughing at the recollection. "I 
was 28 years old, you were from People magazine, and I was scared. When I left 
WMAQ (the Chicago station where she had been an anchor), people there told me, 
'Walk close to the walls at NBC -- they'll be out to knife you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it was NBC's own management that inadvertently did her in. 
</P>
<P>
 Touted as the next "golden girl" in broadcasting when she joined the network 
in 1987, Norville was given the newsreader job on "Today" in 1989 in a move to 
attract younger viewers. But co-host Jane Pauley thought management was trying 
to push her aside, so she quit the morning program. Norville took over, but 
many viewers saw her as "the other woman" who had forced Pauley out, and the 
show's ratings tumbled. Norville left on maternity leave in 1991 and didn't 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the 35-year-old Norville has re-emerged as co-anchor of "America Tonight," 
which is being given a 15-week summer tryout. She has won praise from TV 
critics for her early work on the show, and even if the program does not win a 
permanent berth on the schedule, CBS News President Eric Ober says, "Deborah is 
a strong, smart reporter and anchor. She's got an unlimited future here with us 
at CBS News." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of her professional happiness, Norville and her husband, businessman 
Karl Wellner, are expecting their second child in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through the loop-de-loop roller coaster ride in my career, and I'm 
still standing," Norville says proudly. "My experience on the 'Today' show was 
personally devastating. I was totally unprepared for what happened, and I 
didn't know if I would ever work in television again after all the publicity. 
Instead, I've survived. I wouldn't wish my experience on anybody, but I think 
it has made me a stronger person and a better journalist." 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the "Today" show debacle, Norville says, reporters trailed 
her in New York and all the way back to her childhood in Dalton, Ga. "There was 
one man -- from a respectable publication -- who bought a news documentary I'd 
made in college and asked a plastic surgeon to look at it to see if I'd had a 
nose job. If he'd called me, I could have told him this nose is my own." 
</P>
<P>
 She believes the depiction of her as "the other woman" was unfair and sexist. 
"If it had been a man, I don't think they'd have written about a 'younger, 
blonder' anchor taking over," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After her departure, she kept a low profile for a while -- even living with 
her family in France for three months -- then accepted an offer from ABC radio 
to host a talk show out of her home. Unseen by her listeners, her looks not a 
focus, she thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed talking to listeners, offering my opinions and having my son, 
Nicholas, nearby," she says. "Doing the show restored my self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, CBS News hired Norville as a correspondent for the newsmagazine 
"Street Stories." Although she had won Emmys in Chicago for her hard-news 
reporting, her hiring was greeted with skepticism at CBS by those who knew her 
only by her looks and from the "Today" show drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised by what a good reporter she is," said Howard Rosenberg, 
an investigative producer for "60 Minutes" who worked with Norville on several 
"Street Stories" assignments (and is no relation to The Times' television 
critic). "She is smart, she's well-prepared and she asks the right questions. 
And she's nice. Everywhere we went, people asked her for autographs. On one 
story we did, a bunch of postal inspectors lined up after the interview to get 
her autograph!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Street Stories" died, but in May CBS named Norville and Dana King, formerly 
anchorwoman on ABC's weekend "Good Morning America," as the co-anchors of 
"America Tonight," which premiered June 1. The show has had a tough time in the 
ratings in its kamikaze time slot opposite ABC's top-rated "Home Improvement" 
and the NBA playoffs on NBC, but CBS executives say they are pleased so far. 
With three newsmagazines already on the fall schedule, however, the best that 
"America Tonight" can hope for is a mid-season return. 
</P>
<P>
 Norville likes to do upbeat, human-interest pieces, although she says these 
are not the only kind of stories she wants to do. "This is not a nation of 
pessimists, deflated by defeat," she explains. "If I spot a wedding party when 
my husband and I are out driving, I make him stop the car so we can see. 
Journalists ought to focus on the weddings, metaphorically, as well as the car 
wrecks that we see." 
</P>
<P>
 Norville reported 10 stories before the show premiered, and she says it is 
difficult dealing with "mommy guilt." Her 3-year-old son calls her work "mommy 
movies." But the other day he said he wished she wouldn't make "so many 'mommy 
movies.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "This is my work, and it includes travel, but it's tough on all of us here 
with small children," Norville says. With a second child, she expects the tug 
will be stronger. But she plans to continue working during her pregnancy and to 
return to CBS after a maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
 TV news chews up its female stars so rapidly that one TV critic, noting 
Norville's debut on "America Tonight," compared her to Lazarus, who was raised 
from the dead in the Bible. "I'm a little young for that," she says, laughing. 
"I love reporting, and I love this show. After what has happened in my career, 
I've found it's best not to sweat out the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * "America Tonight" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

LOOKING TO MAKE ALL THE WRIGHT MOVES; MOVIES: ROBIN WRIGHT, NOW STARRING IN 
'FORREST GUMP,' TRIES TO JUGGLE FAMILY LIFE AND RISING FAME ON THE BIG SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress Robin Wright lounges casually on a love seat confessing to her 
addictions. Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I've become a mom, I've had to give up coffee," she complains in a 
raspy whisper, fighting a case of laryngitis this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, she admits, unpredictable mood swings have recently been a problem 
around the Pacific Palisades house she shares with longtime lover, Sean Penn, 
and it's not because his ex-wife, Madonna, has been calling Penn late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my gawd!" exclaims Wright. "I've become a total psychopath! I'm only 
recently off caffeinated, and I'm on decaf." Her face looks pained at the 
sacrifice. "Ohhhhhh," she moans. "I can't do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's bad enough she is forcing herself to cut down on her other addictions, 
which include near-pathological chocoholic tendencies and more than the 
occasionally sneaked cigarette. Those are simply among the prices of 
motherhood, if not fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your life ends when you hear those things from a doctor that you must give 
up," she grumbles. "But what's more important? That I stop destroying people 
around me from my neurosis, or do I live in my vice because I might die 
tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she flashes a devastatingly mercurial grin. "That's the juggling 
act of being a mom." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview at a messy suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los 
Angeles, the 27-year-old actress spoke openly about the duality of life as 
nomadic actress and protective, worry-wart mother (of a 3-year-old girl, Dylan, 
and a 10-month-old boy, Hopper), her life with Penn, and her performance 
opposite Academy Award winner Tom Hanks in the sprawling comedy-drama "Forrest 
Gump," which opens today.  
</P>
<P>
 The film, based on the acclaimed Winston Groom novel of the same name, is a 
madcap parable chronicling the life of a not-so-bright Southerner who leads an 
extraordinary life spanning three decades of American history. Gump's journey 
makes him a participant in significant and often turbulent turning points in 
history, including the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. Wright plays 
the sensitive, rebellious Jenny, the great love of Forrest's life, who is 
almost done in by the protests, politics and confusions of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a lost soul who finds herself," says the actress, who is dressed 
casually in a black sweater, khaki pants and beat-up tennis shoes. "But she is 
not a tragic figure, at least not more than any other girl going through her 
20s and that catharsis," she says. "Maybe the difference is that we get to see 
her through every transformation over 30 years in a movie, as opposed to a 
therapy session." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump" director Robert Zemeckis observes, "Robin exudes a kind of 
strength and, at the same time, a vulnerability. She doesn't bring any of her 
stardom to the role. You don't look at her on-screen and think that this is 
Robin Wright's interpretation of the character. She's a real chameleon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas-born Wright, who started modeling at 14, was raised by a single 
mother who worked for Mary Kay Cosmetics. In just seven years Wright has gone 
from a daytime soap ingenue on "Santa Barbara" to cinematic leading lady in 
"The Princess Bride," "State of Grace," "The Playboys" and "Toys." Many 
Hollywood insiders believe she could wind up on the A-list of actresses. But 
she has, like her "Forrest Gump" character, been through periods where she 
didn't know who she was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still going through it," she says flat out. "And I don't know, because I 
probably haven't hit it, you know, that point where you go (raising her 
eyebrows knowingly) . . . A-H-H-H-H! Now I've reached that point of completion 
in myself!" 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses for a moment mulling over the prospect of truly knowing herself, 
then says wistfully: "I wonder if that's ever true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin is devoid of any pretense," says co-star Hanks. "In her life and in her 
work, she lacks any ulterior motives, which is rare. She's also a good deal of 
fun. Of course, it's not as if we did tequila shots or anything in between 
set-ups!" 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, Wright seems to have been a calming influence on 
Sean Penn's once notorious public behavior. She is incredulous of the media's 
depiction of their relationship as a latter-day beauty and the beast, or the 
accompanying rumors that imply Penn plays Svengali over his girlfriend's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard stuff over the last few years to the effect (that) Sean makes my 
decisions for me professionally, and that he's this strong force, and I'm this 
quiet. . . ." Her voice trails off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so individual," she says. "The way we orchestrate our lives, approach 
situations, deal with business. Completely different -- and yet, I've helped 
him with so many things in his personal life. Of dealing with things where they 
may say that I've 'tamed the beast.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met in 1988 before making the film "Loon." Penn subsequently backed 
out, while Wright went on to a romance, both on and off screen, with Penn's 
replacement, Jason Patric. Wright and Penn met again when they starred in 
"State of Grace" two years later. The connection they felt was immediate, 
although both claim the romance did not blossom until after the filming 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn wasn't the only one who changed as a result of the relationship. "He 
helped me to believe that I could be strong and stand up for myself," Wright 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The press has hounded the couple about marriage plans ever since they first 
appeared in public together in 1990. If there are any plans, she's not about to 
talk about them. She's too busy playing Mom to their son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, motherhood has changed her perspective on life. "I think it grounds 
you," she says. "But I think it would be the equivalent of feeling yourself 
having grown up. Suddenly, you have kids and zip, you're there." 
</P>
<P>
 The pull of motherhood always enters into Wright's decision to take on new 
acting assignments, including the decision to do "Gump," even though her son 
was only 4 weeks old when filming began. "People asked me, 'How could you?' . . 
. That was a major thing, but there was something about the script. I knew it 
was going to be great, so I dealt with the circumstances. I was just really 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the actress remains persnickety about her selection of 
projects. She turned down lead roles in "The Firm" and in the 
sequel-to-the-sequel "Batman Forever." She withdrew from the role of Maid 
Marian opposite Kevin Costner in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" after learning 
she was pregnant. She turned down a part in "Born on the Fourth of July"; after 
discussing the project with director Oliver Stone, she reportedly informed him 
he had a problem with women. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no such problems with "Gump." She felt so comfortable with Hanks 
and the rest of the cast that she was even at ease during a prolonged nude 
scene, in which she warbles "Blowin' in the Wind" wearing only a G-string, a 
guitar and a lot of hair spray, and during a love scene with Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 She rolls her eyes remembering shooting the love scene. "It's always awkward. 
Always odd. Always sweaty." Wright takes another long drag from her cigarette. 
"It's uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright most recently has completed work on "The Crossing Guard," her first 
film with Penn, who directed the film, since "State of Grace." Jack Nicholson 
and Anjelica Huston star, and Wright plays the love interest of David ("Indian 
Runner") Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear from older people that, with experience, you feel that things that 
used to burden you in your 20s don't anymore. It's a bit easier to figure 
things out and not let it abuse you, like Jenny (in "Gump") has let things 
abuse her. Even though she knew it was not the right path, she had to do it 
anyway. That was her fate. I can't wait to get to that point where I can say, 
'Yeah. It happened. That's life.' "

O.C. ATTORNEY COULD LOSE PACT TO DEFEND POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney William W. Stewart, recently criticized for his firm's handling of 
criminal cases involving indigent defendants, could lose his lucrative county 
contract for providing legal assistance to poor people today when judges of 
Orange County Municipal Court's Central District consider a reorganization 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Central District Presiding Judge Gregory H. Lewis said he will propose that 
the contract -- worth $700,000 to $1 million per year -- be put out for bids so 
that the huge caseload can be handled by as many as three law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a year remains on Stewart's contract to defend poor people accused of 
crimes, Lewis said the proposal is not related to judges' complaints that 
Stewart has been "subletting" many of the cases he has been assigned to other 
attorneys, and spends part of his time thousands of miles away tending to an 
import-export business he operates in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis acknowledged that some judges in the Santa Ana-based Central District 
have experienced delays in getting contract defense attorneys to their 
courtrooms. He said the new contract plan would provide "greater coverage" in 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who has held his county contract for 15 years, said he would not 
fight Lewis' proposal and planned to be one of the bidders should the jurists 
decide in favor of the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Santa Ana-based attorney denounced the criticisms 
leveled against him by Municipal Judges Margaret R. Anderson and Pamela L. 
Iles, calling them "idiots from other courts" who are pursuing personal 
"agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Iles, of the South District court in Laguna Niguel, could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday. But Anderson, of the Harbor District court in Newport Beach, 
fired back at Stewart. She said his comment, in the words of Shakespeare, was a 
"tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Iles, both members of a county advisory committee examining the 
defense of indigents, have said that Stewart has been allowed to tend to his 
South American lobster and flower businesses by farming out hundreds of cases 
to other criminal lawyers who share in the annual fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has said that he has not appeared in court very often during the past 
four years, and court officials confirm that the attorney sometimes 
communicates with the county court system by telephone or fax from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Stewart acknowledged that the press of outside business has been a 
factor in his decision to go along with the planned contract change. He said 
that some judges have been planning the changes for months, and that the 
proposal should not be interpreted as linked to the concerns expressed by 
Anderson and Iles. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart also said the reorganization had nothing to do with bankruptcy papers 
filed by his real estate firm, which owns downtown Santa Ana property, 
including the building housing his law office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of lawyers would like to have the contract I've had," Stewart said 
Tuesday. "I'm used to taking shots from lawyers. It's nothing new. I have 
worked well with the court for a number of years. I would hope to be a major 
part of any reorganization." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, county officials who were to launch a review of Stewart's operations 
based on the concerns of Anderson and Iles said they were surprised that any 
changes were being proposed before the contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is rather intriguing," said Ron Coley, who handles court management and 
budget matters for the county administrative office. "It would seem to speak to 
some dissatisfaction with the way the contract is being carried out. It's 
strange to me that they would be seeking any change in mid-stream, unless 
something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Coley said the county still planned to study Stewart's business arrangements 
with the Municipal Court's Central District. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally handles the defense of indigents, but 
in criminal cases with more than one defendant, or in which public defenders 
have other conflicts of interest, assignments are made to private attorneys 
under contract to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, Stewart's firm has held the contract for conflict cases 
originating in the county's court system in Santa Ana. Stewart's firm handled 
about 1,270 criminal misdemeanor and felony cases last year, for which the firm 
was paid more than $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over Stewart's relationship with the local court system has 
come at a time when the county has been engaged in a volatile debate over how 
to lower the cost of providing attorneys for people who cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lewis said he had met with Stewart to discuss the new contract, which 
will be considered at a noon meeting of the Central District judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should not be taken as a comment on his performance," Lewis said, 
referring to Stewart's long hold on the contract. "Bill Stewart is an ethical 
representative of the Bar. He is a gentleman and has conducted himself as 
such." 
</P>
<P>
 Without mentioning Anderson or Iles by name, Lewis said it was "regrettable 
that one or more parties may have made statements that attacked Mr. Stewart's 
honesty or integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are making statements about a contract that operates in my court 
-- not anywhere else." he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this to get greater control of our caseload," Lewis said. "The 
availability of different law firms will help with that. I think it will be a 
better business decision to proceed."

NO HOLIDAY FOR HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and city officials were left to wonder Tuesday what more could have 
been done to stem the outbreak of Fourth of July melees that included furniture 
burning in the streets and firecrackers, bottles and rocks being hurled at 
officers and passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people were arrested in the city's downtown during three hours 
late Monday night and early Tuesday. In all, 139 arrests were made throughout 
the day and night for a variety of offenses, including public drunkenness, 
resisting arrest and failure to disperse. No serious injuries were reported, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other beach cities reported a relatively calm July 4, including Newport Beach, 
where 81 people were arrested Monday mostly for alcohol-related offenses, 
police there said. In Seal Beach, only two people were arrested, both on 
drunk-driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even have any minor incidents," Seal Beach Police Sgt. Dean Zanone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene in downtown Huntington Beach late Monday night, however, was far 
from quiet, reminding some residents of the near-riot during last year's Fourth 
of July, which resulted in more than 40 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Krysten Olson, who watched the action unfold from her front yard at Olive 
Avenue and 11th Street, said, "People walked a couch down the block and lit it 
on fire. People were cheering it on. There were about 200 people going down the 
street, drinking and throwing fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble started about 10:30 p.m. when a crowd of about 500 people gathered 
near Main Street and Olive Avenue. Police arrived and dispersed the crowd, 
which then broke into several smaller groups and spread throughout downtown, 
Huntington Beach police Officer Mike Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned into a game of cat and mouse," Corchoran said. "We would split one 
group up and then there would be two or three other things starting up. We had 
to do that for more than three hours until we dispersed all of the problem 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, police sprayed some stubborn revelers with water from a truck to 
clear several downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to dampen their spirits and basically it worked real well," 
Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corchoran said this year's disturbances appeared to be much more calculated 
than last year's Fourth of July, when 50 officers arrived downtown in riot gear 
to break up a roving party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was like one big thing and this year was more like a myriad of 
little things," he said. "I think what's behind it is that people are almost 
expecting something like this to occur. So, you have individuals who flock 
anywhere where there is potential for recognition and notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to avoid a repeat of last year, the city's entire 230-member force 
was on duty throughout the weekend at a cost of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the cops did the best that they could," said resident Tim Wuerfel, 
26. "They are outnumbered every year. The biggest problem is that so many 
people come to this area. A lot of these people get together and they think 
they can do whatever they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, a downtown resident, also 
praised the efforts of police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a fantastic job," she said. "We made it clear that we didn't want 
any lawbreakers to come to Huntington Beach on the Fourth of July. They did a 
great job of enforcing the law." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was happy with police, including some residents who felt 
officers were too quick to arrest people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they overreacted in some instances," said 52-year-old resident Jay 
Scannell. "They nailed everyone. They were really in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Ed Grande, 32, was among those who spent the night in jail. He was 
still angry about the experience after returning home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people deserved to be in that jail, but I wasn't one of them," 
Grande said. "I sat on a bike, took a swig on a beer, put the beer down and 
rode away. When I got back, they said I was drunk in public and arrested me. 
They were just harassing me. I could see them giving me a ticket for drinking 
in public, but to arrest me and take me to jail, I wasn't too happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the arrests, police also impounded about 250 bicycles from 
riders who didn't have a city-required license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose was to prevent mobility," Corchoran said. "You had party-goers 
going from one party to another on bicycle. We wanted to prevent them from 
going to the next party and creating more problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people trickled into the Police Department Tuesday morning to 
retrieve their bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know why I came back here to pick this piece of junk up," Ryan 
Litten, 20, said as he put a rusted blue beach cruiser into the back of his 
pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Litten and others were required to show proof of ownership as they picked up 
their bikes and had to pay $3 to obtain bicycle registration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew about the law as far as having a license, so next year I'll definitely 
have it," said Litten. "I was just riding around, watching all the people. I 
was having a grand ol' time. I think (the police) were trying to take a stand 
and show everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, where there were near-riot conditions two years ago, things 
were relatively calm, despite 81 arrests on Monday, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we felt that this year was quieter than the past several years," 
Gonis said. "Because it was quiet, we had more time to deal with calls and, as 
a result, arrests went up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said more than 60 of the arrests were for alcohol-related offenses. 
Police also issued "several hundred" citations for minor alcohol offenses, such 
as alcohol possession and carrying open containers in cars between Friday and 
Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said there were no significant injuries or damage to report from the 
July 4 activities that drew hundreds of thousands to the beach city. Police 
maintained a strong presence, with about 200 officers roaming the streets and 
beach during the weekend at a cost to taxpayers of about $100,000.

2 DESCRIBE SCENE AT SIMPSON ESTATE ON MURDER NIGHT; COURTS: TESTIMONY COULD 
UNDERCUT PARTS OF ACCUSED'S ALIBI BY RAISING DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER HE WAS HOME. 
DEFENSE ATTACKS LIMOUSINE DRIVER'S STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two witnesses who saw O.J. Simpson soon after his ex-wife and a friend of hers 
were knifed to death took the stand Tuesday to describe the scene at his estate 
on the night of the killings, giving testimony that could undercut elements of 
Simpson's alibi by raising doubts about whether he was home when the murders 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither limousine driver Allan Park nor guest house tenant Brian (Kato) Kaelin 
testified to anything that directly linked Simpson to the crimes he is accused 
of committing -- the double slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman on the night of June 12. But their accounts, which came on the third 
day of a preliminary hearing being broadcast to the nation, bolstered the 
prosecution's efforts to show that Simpson could have committed the murders and 
still rushed home to meet the airport limousine about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With families of the victims listening intently from a few feet away, Park 
said he arrived at Simpson's home about 10:25 p.m. and unsuccessfully began 
buzzing the intercom at the gate about 10:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no answer," Park said. "I continued to buzz the bell a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he was waiting for someone to come to the door, Park said, he saw a 
figure stride across Simpson's driveway toward the house about 10:55 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Park could not identify that figure -- even to say for sure whether 
it was a man or a woman -- he did say it appeared to be a black person about 6 
feet tall and about 200 pounds. Moments after that person disappeared inside, 
Simpson answered the buzzer, apologizing for having overslept, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro, who has generally treated witnesses 
gently, aggressively attacked Park's testimony, opening his questioning by 
asking the limousine driver whether he understood the importance of the court 
proceedings and continuing to challenge Park's recollections throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Shapiro reminded Park that they had spoken over the phone and 
that Shapiro had recorded the conversation, though Park said he had been 
unaware that he was being taped. Park conceded that his account in court 
Tuesday differed slightly from what he told a grand jury last month: There he 
testified that it was a man he saw walking quickly across the driveway but he 
defended his current recollections as the more precise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than a dozen witnesses have taken the stand during the highly 
charged preliminary hearing, Park was the first to testify about seeing Simpson 
in the hours after the killings. He declined to offer an opinion about 
Simpson's behavior, however, saying he did not know the superstar well enough 
to judge whether he was acting strangely. 
</P>
<P>
 Park was followed to the stand by Kaelin, a friend of Simpson's who had seen 
the celebrity off and on during the day of the killings but who also demurred 
when asked whether Simpson's behavior seemed unusual that evening -- saying 
only that Simpson appeared in a hurry to catch his plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin, a little-known actor who fidgeted and laughed nervously on the stand, 
said he had known Nicole Simpson since meeting her in Aspen, Colo., in late 
1992 and had lived in a guest house on her property until earlier this year. 
When she moved to the condominium where she would later be murdered, O.J. 
Simpson suggested to Kaelin that it was inappropriate for the young actor to 
live in such close quarters with her while the couple was trying to reconcile, 
Kaelin said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kaelin, O.J. Simpson instead suggested that the actor move into a 
poolside bungalow on the athlete's Brentwood estate. Kaelin took Simpson up on 
the offer and said he has lived there rent-free for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the slayings, Kaelin testified, he spent the early evening 
with Simpson after the athlete returned from a recital by his daughter. He said 
the two chatted for a while, with Simpson commenting on the tightness of the 
dress his ex-wife had worn. Kaelin said he and Simpson then headed for a 
McDonald's restaurant. They went in Simpson's Rolls-Royce, picked up food at 
the drive-thru window and returned about 9:45 p.m., Kaelin testified, adding 
that he then went to his room to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing his food, Kaelin said, he called a few friends but was 
startled about 10:40 p.m. by three loud thumps on an outside wall of his room. 
One was so sharp it knocked a picture loose, he said. Police would later 
discover a bloody glove lying on a walkway in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin, whose account was bolstered by a friend of his -- a young woman who 
said she had been speaking with him on the phone at the time -- said he went 
out to investigate the source of the noises and ran into Simpson on the other 
side of the house. That was about 11 p.m., Kaelin said, and it was the first 
time he had seen Simpson since the two parted after their fast-food dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 With their testimony, Park and Kaelin helped sketch the broad outlines of the 
case against the Hall of Fame athlete, establishing key times as prosecutors 
attempt to show that he had the opportunity and means to commit the brutal 
homicides. They have yet to show that Simpson was at the scene, but police 
expect physical evidence -- in particular, blood samples recovered from the 
murder scene -- to fill in that gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, they're effectively establishing a story line," said Peter Arenella, 
a UCLA law professor who is monitoring the hearing, of the prosecutors. 
"They're attempting to show that Mr. Simpson could have committed these 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that effort, prosecutors hope to establish that several scratches 
and cuts to Simpson's hands and arms were suffered during a struggle at the 
murder scene. In questioning Kaelin on Tuesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
repeatedly asked him whether he had seen any injuries to Simpson during the day 
of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin said he had not, testimony that could narrow the window in which 
Simpson might have gotten those cuts. His lawyers have said Simpson received at 
least one of them when he smashed a glass in a Chicago hotel room upon 
receiving the news of Nicole Simpson's death, but that explanation would not 
account for any blood matching Simpson's that turns up either at his house or 
at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prosecutors hope to establish that Simpson had a motive to commit 
the crime. Police sources have said authorities believe that Simpson killed his 
ex-wife after she told him that she would never get back together with him, and 
Tuesday's hearing featured the first testimony supporting that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning Clark, Kaelin said he had talked with Simpson on the 
afternoon of the killings and that Simpson had offhandedly mentioned that he 
and his ex-wife had abandoned hopes of reconciling. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kaelin, Simpson said something to the effect that "it was over, 
that the relationship was over. They were not together anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as those witnesses added details to the case against the internationally 
known athlete-turned-actor, prosecutors aggressively contested a move by 
Simpson's attorneys to limit the evidence against him. The defense motion, 
filed last week, seeks to suppress evidence seized during a search of Simpson's 
home and the grounds around it hours after the killings -- evidence that 
includes a bloodstained glove and blood samples recovered from inside and 
outside his Ford Bronco, which was parked on the street in front of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers say the police improperly jumped his fence and that, once on 
the property, they searched for evidence without a warrant. They also maintain 
that the warrant the police eventually secured was obtained only after officers 
misrepresented the reason for Simpson being out of town, saying he was 
"unexpectedly away" when they allegedly had reason to know that he was on a 
planned business trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the police actions, prosecutors called Detective Mark Fuhrman, a 
19-year LAPD veteran who works in the department's West Los Angeles station. 
Fuhrman spent nearly three hours on the stand Tuesday, testifying that 
detectives went to Simpson's house to notify him or any relatives about the 
murders and to find someone to care for the two children whose mother had just 
been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they arrived at Simpson's home about five hours after the bodies were 
found, the detective said he spotted a small mark on the Ford Bronco that he 
believed to be blood and that he also spied a shovel and a folded sheet of 
heavy plastic inside the vehicle. Combined with several other observations, 
what he called "the totality of the circumstances," Fuhrman said those 
discoveries led investigators to believe that there might be more victims 
inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: We got a real -- we got an emergency. We got a problem," Fuhrman 
testified that he told a colleague at the scene. "We don't know if we have 
people inside that are in danger, dying, bleeding to death. We have to do 
something. I don't care whose house this is. We have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's testimony was challenged by Simpson lawyer Gerald Uelmen, a former 
law school dean and former federal prosecutor who suggested that the real 
reason investigators entered Simpson's property without a warrant was because 
they believed he had committed the crime and were eager to gather evidence 
against him. The distinction is crucial because police officers may only enter 
private property with a warrant or under special circumstances such as the need 
to prevent a crime from being committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen attempted to raise doubts about whether Fuhrman could have deduced that 
the small red mark on the Ford Bronco was blood as opposed to any other red 
substance. Does blood, Uelmen asked with a hint of sarcasm, "look different 
than dried taco sauce?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take too much note of dried taco sauce, so I couldn't really say," 
Fuhrman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their written statement opposing the effort to suppress the evidence seized 
under the search warrant, prosecutors stressed that under the circumstances 
police had not only the right but the obligation to enter the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a dereliction of duty," prosecutors wrote, "had the 
officers not conducted an additional investigation, including an entry onto the 
premises, to notify defendant Simpson of the murder of his ex-wife, the 
necessity to place his young children in the custody of a relative, and to 
determine whether or not there were additional victims, hostages or suspects at 
the location."

 Despite the questioning by Uelmen, Fuhrman stood fast in his insistence that 
detectives only jumped the fence and let themselves onto Simpson's property 
because they believed there could be other victims or crimes being committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an emergency situation," Fuhrman said. "We had exhausted every attempt 
to reach anyone inside. We could not just let somebody die." 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the property, they found two guests in bungalows along the pool -- 
Kaelin and Simpson's daughter Arnelle. Fuhrman said he struck up a conversation 
with Kaelin, and when Kaelin mentioned the thumping sounds he had heard, the 
detective inspected the area behind Kaelin's quarters. It was there, Fuhrman 
said, that he came upon a dark brown glove lying on a walkway and matching one 
found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell adjourned Tuesday's session with 
the search warrant issue still being discussed, so it is likely to lead off 
today's session as well. Assuming that she rules on the issue of the search 
warrant's validity, she could determine whether the bloody glove and other 
evidence -- such as blood-red stains found on the driveway and in Simpson's 
bedroom and bathroom -- will be admissible during this hearing or at a trial, 
should one be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 In their motion Tuesday, prosecutors said they do not intend to use any 
information seized under search warrants at the preliminary hearing, which is 
intended to decide whether Simpson should stand trial, not whether he is guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt. But some of the items recovered from his estate were 
spotted before a warrant was issued -- others, such as the blood found on the 
Ford Bronco, were found outside the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts disagreed over whether the wording of the prosecution motion 
means that government lawyers will avoid introducing all of that evidence 
during this hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agreed, however, that prosecutors probably were signaling that they do 
not intend to use items taken from inside the house, but that they still would 
reserve the option of using other items found outside the house, such as the 
bloodstains on the Bronco.

 * RELATED STORIES: A4, A5 At the Simpson Estate 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what limousine driver Allan Park testified he saw at O.J. Simpson's 
Brentwood home the night that Simpson's ex-wife and a friend were murdered two 
miles away. The time frame is crucial because Simpson has said he was at home 
waiting for the limousine at the time the victims were stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LIMO DRIVER 
</P>
<P>
 1) 10:25 p.m.: Park arrives at Rockingham Avenue gate. Does not remember 
seeing a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 2) 10:40 to 10:50 p.m.: At Ashford Street gate, buzzes intercom several times. 
No response. 
</P>
<P>
 3) 10:55 p.m.: Calls his boss at limo company. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Shortly before 11 p.m.: Sees a person "six feet, 200 pounds, black, wearing 
dark clothes" walking across a driveway toward the house. 
</P>
<P>
 5) About 11 p.m.: A man (Brian Kaelin) emerges from a path at the side of the 
house and waves. About 15 or 20 seconds later, Park again buzzes the intercom 
and Simpson answers. 
</P>
<P>
 6) 11 to 11:15 p.m.: Simpson helps load five bags into limo. 
</P>
<P>
 7) 11:15 p.m.: Limo exits Rockingham gate bound for LAX, where they arrive at 
11:35. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GUEST HOUSE TENANT 
</P>
<P>
 Brian (Kato) Kaelin, who was staying in one of Simpson's guest apartments, 
says he was talking to his friend on the phone the night of the murders. Here 
is his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 A) 10:40 p.m.: Hears three "thumping" sounds outside that he believes to be an 
earthquake or a prowler. 
</P>
<P>
 B) About 11 p.m.: Goes around front of the house to check on noise. Spots limo 
driver at gate. Continues around front of house to check on thumping noise. 
</P>
<P>
 C) 11 to 11:15 p.m.: Helps load baggage into limo.

U.S. MAY EASE LIMITS ON TIES WITH TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is preparing policy changes that will give the 
government of Taiwan greater leeway in dealing with the United States than it 
has had for 15 years, Administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, which await final approval by President Clinton and could be 
announced in the next couple of weeks, would ease some restrictions imposed on 
Taiwan when the United States established diplomatic relations with its enemy, 
the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the procedures (for dealing with Taiwan) have become anachronistic," 
one Administration official said. "The basic thrust of what we will do is to 
re-establish U.S. interests as the basis for relations with both Taiwan and 
China. What we're trying to do is establish some principles and a position we 
can use with both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's primary goal is to make it easier to conduct business 
with Taiwan, which is now the United States' fifth-largest trading partner and 
has more than $80 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, second in the world 
behind Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledge that they have held up the proposed 
changes to see if they can minimize the fallout from China, which still 
considers Taiwan a renegade province. "There is still some concern here about 
how the Chinese will react," one U.S. official admitted. "They're not happy 
with what they've heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes being proposed are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Permitting some American Cabinet officials to visit Taiwan and some Taiwan 
Cabinet members to visit the United States. Although there have been 
exceptions, Cabinet-level visits between the two governments generally have 
been forbidden for 15 years on grounds that they might be interpreted as 
suggesting U.S. recognition of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing Taiwan's offices in the United States to use an identifiable name, 
like "Taipei Representative Office." For 15 years, Taiwan's offices in 
Washington and around the United States -- which serve as its unofficial 
embassy and consulates -- have been called the "Coordination Council for North 
American Affairs." The name is so confusing and nondescript that Taiwan 
officials complain they get calls intended for Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permitting Taiwan officials to meet with their American counterparts in U.S. 
government buildings. Since 1979, the United States has generally required 
representatives of Taiwan to meet American officials in other locales, such as 
hotels and restaurants, to emphasize the unofficial ties between the two 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these measures, several Administration officials cautioned that there 
will be no change in the fundamental principles underlying American ties with 
China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not changing the basics of our one-China policy," one U.S. official 
explained. "There will be no change in our views about sovereignty. . . . What 
we're trying to do is adjust the details of the relationship in ways that allow 
us to carry on appropriate relations with both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nationalist government has been based in Taiwan since Gen. Chiang Kai-shek 
fled to the island in 1949 at the end of China's civil war. Chiang claimed, 
with U.S. backing, that his Nationalists, rather than the Communist regime in 
Beijing, were the legitimate government for all of China. 
</P>
<P>
 But during President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972, he signed 
the Shanghai Communique, in which the United States agreed not to challenge the 
idea that Taiwan was part of China. Seven years later, President Jimmy Carter 
broke off formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations 
with Beijing. Since then, unofficial ties between the United States and Taiwan 
have been carried out through special organizations set up for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has no embassy in Taipei but set up the American Institute 
in Taiwan, staffed by foreign service officers on leaves of absence; it 
performs many functions of an embassy. Similarly, Taiwan's offices in the 
United States have no formal diplomatic status. 
</P>
<P>
 The first major changes in American policy toward Taiwan took place in the 
last year of the George Bush Administration. In the 1992 presidential campaign, 
Bush cleared the way for the sale of a major new weapons system, F-16 
warplanes, to Taiwan. And after the election, when he was a lame duck, Bush 
dispatched U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to Taipei, the first Cabinet 
officer to visit since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 As governor of Arkansas, Clinton visited Taiwan five times, more than any 
other place outside the United States. But in his first 18 months in office, 
his Administration has generally held the line on policy toward Taiwan, arguing 
repeatedly that all changes were on hold while U.S. officials conducted a broad 
policy review. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, the Administration was deluged with criticism from Congress 
when Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, sought permission to stop overnight in 
Honolulu on a trip from Taipei to Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department gave permission for Lee's plane to refuel in Hawaii but 
not for Lee to spend a night there; no U.S. official was sent out to greet Lee 
at the airport. Administration officials feared worsening strained relations 
with Beijing in the weeks leading up to the Administration's decision on 
whether to renew China's trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both China and Taiwan have been carrying on their struggles against each 
other over and through us," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say there will be no change in U.S. policy concerning 
arms sales to Taiwan. Under an agreement signed by President Ronald Reagan in 
1982, the United States has agreed to limit arms sales to Taiwan to $800 
million a year and, over some indefinite time period, to phase out the sales.

ARAFAT TELLS NEW CABINET TO START KEY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat established the first Palestinian government here 
Tuesday and immediately gave his Cabinet a list of priorities, including job 
creation, new housing and a massive cleanup of the Gaza Strip after 27 years of 
Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said Arafat wanted not only to inaugurate the 
Cabinet of the new Palestinian Authority, agreed upon in negotiations with 
Israel, but also to launch key projects that could make a difference, and 
quickly, in Palestinians' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the decisions approved at the first formal meeting of the authority 
council were measures to build as many as 30,000 houses and apartments in the 
Gaza Strip with low-cost financing but private construction; to clean up Gaza, 
transforming it from a giant garbage dump into something safer and healthier, 
and to start a jobs program to tackle Gaza's 80% unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat -- on his first day back in the West Bank since 1967 -- also ordered 
ministers to prepare annual budgets, to develop organizations for their 
departments and to review the complex network of military regulations the 
Israelis ruled with to see which should be dropped, modified or retained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are starting to roll," Shaath said after the Cabinet meeting. "Things will 
be difficult for a very long period -- we know that -- but the key point is 
that, for the first time in our history, we have our own government in at least 
a portion of our land. Secondly, we will take advantage of the momentum this 
gives us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sworn in as chairman of the new Palestinian Authority, which will govern the 
Gaza Strip, the Jericho district in the West Bank and eventually the whole West 
Bank under agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
Arafat said that he hopes the period of autonomy will bring the Palestinians to 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle must continue and this intensified work must continue until we 
establish our independent state with Jerusalem as its capital," Arafat told a 
welcoming rally. "God willing, we will all pray in Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO resume their negotiations in Paris today on the next phases 
of Palestinian autonomy, including extension of self-government throughout the 
West Bank and national elections to be held before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the talks, the focus of much of the Cabinet meeting Tuesday, 
should accelerate development of Palestinian autonomy by broadening the 
authority's powers and hastening the withdrawal of Israeli forces from towns 
and villages in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this trip to Jericho, Mr. Arafat became even more dedicated in his 
commitment to the peace process and to his people," Shaath said. "The Gaza 
Strip is now the place where the main effort must go for the million people 
living there. Jericho is symbolic, a symbol of the integration of Gaza and the 
West Bank and Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the agenda is the issue of an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Palestinian 
prisoners, especially Muslim militants, still in Israeli jails. "We say to our 
prisoners and our detainees, we tell them: 'Patience, patience and God will 
help,' " Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
 In taking the oath of office as head of the autonomy government, the 
64-year-old former guerrilla commander, dressed in his usual olive-drab 
military uniform and checkered head scarf, placed his right hand on a Koran, 
Islam's holy book, and swore to "do my duty faithfully and honestly." He then 
administered the oath to 12 ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet is a mix of business people, politicians and academics. It 
includes one Christian, Tourism Minister Elias Freij of Bethlehem, and one 
woman, Social Welfare Minister Intisar Wazir. Rabbi Moshe Hirsch, of the 
anti-Zionist Neturei Karta group, assumed an advisory post on Jewish affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the start of the new government was far from perfect Tuesday. Of 24 
members Arafat intends to appoint to his Cabinet, he has been able to fill only 
17 positions. Of these, four were absent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, the most prominent Palestinian leader in the West Bank, 
declined to join the Cabinet formally and did not take the oath. He explained 
that he wants to be free to deal with the future of Jerusalem, perhaps the most 
sensitive issue in future negotiations with Israel, which has said he cannot be 
a Palestinian minister and operate in the holy city. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's own arrival here was upset when rally marshals could not contain the 
small but unruly crowd, which broke down a double fence to get closer to him. 
The chaos grew when the crowd refused to heed calls to sit when Arafat spoke 
and even to remain silent so his hoarse, raspy voice could be heard. The 
113-degree heat of Jericho, the lowest town in the world at 839 feet below sea 
level, caused dozens to faint. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and other Palestinian officials attributed the small turnout of fewer 
than 10,000 -- more people had celebrated through the night in Jericho in 
anticipation of his arrival -- to blockage of the roads Tuesday morning by 
Jewish settlers, who battled Israeli troops and police in their effort to halt 
traffic into Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers said they had cut roads at 19 points with human chains, 
stone-throwing and barricades of burning tires. There were delays, but police 
reopened most roads by midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to stop the Arabs from coming through," said Joel Adams, 29, a 
resident of the Mitzpeh Jericho settlement who manned a barricade on the road 
from Jerusalem to Jericho. "We wanted to show the government we don't want 
terrorists here. . . . This is a desperate means, obviously, (but) normal 
people live here -- doctors, lawyers -- and these are not crazy fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Jewish settlement Naama, north of Jericho, farmers continued 
working fields and vineyards, annoyed with protests and clashes between 
militant settlers and troops attempting to keep the road open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problem with Yasser Arafat visiting Jericho," Ilan Rosenblum said 
in Naama. "Let him live in Jericho, run his autonomy from Jericho. I am very 
much against the confrontations between the settlers and the soldiers. I think 
it only weakens our position." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat himself was in a "mood of nostalgia, a pensive mood," according to 
Shaath, as the chairman flew on an Egyptian military helicopter from Gaza City 
north along the Israeli coast, then inland over Tel Aviv and north of Jerusalem 
to Jericho -- a return to the West Bank after 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said his government will push for 
peace with the Palestinians and Israel's other Arab neighbors despite the 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the protests and with all the shouting, we will continue with the 
peace process," Rabin told the country's large trade union federation. "We got 
a mandate from the people, and we will go on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to continue the process, to continue to reach a reconciliation with 
the Palestinians, with Jordan, with Syria and with Lebanon, and for this 
purpose we are ready to take risks upon ourselves for the sake of great 
prospects." 
</P>
<P>

the Jerusalem-Jericho highway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

KARDASHIAN-SIMPSON BOND STANDS TEST OF TIME, TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since they met on a tennis court 25 years ago, Robert Kardashian has become 
one of O.J. Simpson's closest confidants. Now their relationship goes beyond 
close -- Kardashian has become the link between the former football superstar 
charged with murder and the outside world, including his lawyers, the media and 
assorted friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Kardashian who talks to Simpson daily, appears in court during the week 
and makes jail visits on the weekends. It was Kardashian who read the farewell 
letter written by Simpson to a rapt nationwide television audience almost three 
weeks ago and it was Kardashian who recently reactivated his law license to 
help defend Simpson, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know O.J. better than anyone on the legal team," Kardashian, 50, said in an 
interview. "There are so many things I know about his personality. My job is 
really strategy and liaison between the lawyers and O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian leapt into public attention June 17, when Simpson bolted from 
Kardashian's Encino home just as the football great was to surrender to police 
on charges of murdering his ex-wife and her friend. Later that day, Kardashian 
appeared on national television to read the rambling and emotionally charged 
letter from Simpson. As day turned into evening, and Simpson and former 
teammate Al Cowlings were leading authorities on a 60-mile pursuit, Kardashian 
tried to talk Simpson in by cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian said his jailhouse visits, which have become staples of weekend 
television coverage of the case, are wrenching. "I've never been to a jail 
before. It's extremely depressing. It makes me sick every time I go down 
there," Kardashian said. "We can't have any physical contact. I want to hug 
him, I want to show him that I care. It's very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going 20 hours a day on this," Kardashian said. "But he's going through 
worse hell than I am. I can't complain. I sleep in a real bed at night. Look 
where he's sleeping . . . he's in a cage." 
</P>
<P>
 In happier times, the two men shared many things: college ties, enjoyment of a 
jet-set lifestyle, business ventures, family fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have an intense commitment to USC. Though they were not there at the same 
time, they frequently attended alumni events and contributed to the school. 
They even opened a fashion boutique on the campus -- called jag O.J. -- which 
sold high-priced jeans and other clothes for a couple of years in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian, a second-generation Los Angeles resident who grew up in Baldwin 
Hills, followed in his older brother's footsteps to USC, which he attended from 
1962 to 1966. Like his brother, Kardashian served as the student football team 
manager, although he did not cross paths with Simpson, who attended USC from 
1967 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation, Kardashian went to the University of San Diego, where he 
received a law degree in 1969. His brother, Tom, says Robert went to law school 
to avoid going into the meatpacking business the Kardashian family owned. 
</P>
<P>
 But law did not hold much interest for Kardashian; he essentially stopped 
practicing in the late 1970s, preferring to concentrate on his start-up 
businesses and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Simpson's court hearings, Kardashian had not been inside a courtroom 
for 20 years. At the request of Simpson's lead attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, 
Kardashian reactivated his license to practice law, which had become inactive 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian and Simpson shared a social life that spanned decades, including 
tennis and golf games, fancy restaurants, and trips to Aspen, Mexico and New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson lived with Kardashian and his brother in Beverly Hills during an 
off-season from the Buffalo Bills in the '70s. Friends say the Deep Canyon 
house was a true bachelor's pad -- complete with frequent parties and social 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian met his future wife, Chris Houghton, in 1978 when she was 17. 
Kardashian was with Simpson when he met Nicole Brown, then 18, at the Daisy 
nightclub in Beverly Hills in 1977. Simpson was an usher at Kardashian's 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 After marriage, the Kardashian and Simpson families grew -- and grew closer. 
</P>
<P>
 With their wives and children, the men traveled together, spending Christmases 
in Aspen, where Kardashian would dress up as Santa Claus. The two couples dined 
together frequently, went to nightclubs and had a wide circle of friends that 
included celebrities from the sports and entertainment worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both went through painful divorces in the early 1990s. (After the Kardashians' 
divorce, Chris Kardashian married Olympic medalist Bruce Jenner.) Kardashian 
said that he believed it was best for Simpson to be away from Nicole and that 
he advised Simpson not to get back together with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was torn, but I wanted him to get on with his life," Kardashian said. "I 
thought that would be better for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always did what he wanted to do," Kardashian said. "But he asked my 
opinion. I gave him both sides of the issue. I never said, 'Don't do this, do 
this.' That's not how we operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Kardashian lives in a spacious, two-story Mandalay Drive home in 
the Encino hills where his fiancee, Denice Shakarian-Halicki, regularly stays. 
He says wedding plans now are on hold as the legal proceedings against Simpson 
unfold. Shakarian-Halicki regularly appears in the courtroom with Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 In business, Kardashian's first big success came in 1973. He joined his 
brother and another investor, Robert Wilson, to found a trade magazine called 
Radio & Records. When the publication was sold in 1979, it went for about $12.5 
million. Kardashian made about $3 million on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investments have not gone as well. "Some click, some don't," said George 
Mason, the senior managing director of Bear Stearns & Co., who some consider to 
be Kardashian's mentor. "I think he's more entrepreneurial. He's not the kind 
who wants to be chained to a desk and take a briefcase full of work home with 
him every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Azoff, the owner of Giant Records who worked with Kardashian in the 
radio syndication division at MCA, said Kardashian is an even-tempered 
businessman who has had some good ideas. "Some have and some haven't been as 
successful," Azoff said. "But he's real dependable and honest and quite an 
entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
 With Simpson and another investor, Joe Leach, Kardashian started the USC 
boutique and a corporation called Juice Inc., which established one of the 
first frozen yogurt shops in Westwood Village, first called Joy, then Forty 
Carats. The group sold the store after a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Kardashian and Simpson also invested in a music video business 
called Concert Cinema, which would screen music videos before the feature film 
in theaters. But the yearlong enterprise became expensive and neither Simpson 
nor Kardashian made money on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Kardashian is running two companies out of his home. Movie Tunes 
supplies movie theaters with music to play and between films, and Hit Tunes 
offers movie theaters vending machines with which moviegoers to buy and listen 
to compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends and family say they are worried about Kardashian. They say he is 
spending all his time either with Simpson, 46, or with the lawyers who are 
defending him. "This is very, very traumatic for all of us," said Tom 
Kardashian, who is four years older than his brother. "It's got to be a real 
strain for him. I want him to lead a normal life and not to be distraught over 
where O.J. is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kraines, who has known Kardashian for 30 years, since they attended 
Dorsey High School together, said he is not surprised at the role his 
schoolmate is playing in the Simpson saga. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have any personal motives -- he believes O.J.'s 100% innocent," 
said Kraines. "I think he truly believes there's a friend in need . . . and it 
does not surprise me that Bob's that type of person. He's not looking to be 
central stage. He's looking for the tragedy to turn out however well it can for 
his friend."

 One friend said that as soon as Kardashian heard about the double murders, he 
was "banging on O.J.'s door to get in and help him." 
</P>
<P>
 Another said that it was not uncommon for Kardashian -- even before the murder 
investigation -- to cancel engagements and make time for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 At a surprise party held at a San Pedro restaurant for Kardashian's 50th 
birthday in February, Simpson presented his friend with an autographed football 
jersey. A friend said the event and the gift meant a great deal to Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved the lifestyle -- the sports, the restaurants, the scene," said the 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Kardashian says he and Simpson have developed a bond that few 
people share. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Kardashian says he is having trouble seeing his friend in jail. "He's 
having a very difficult time. He's in a cage -- seven by nine feet. He's 
innocent until proven guilty and sitting in a cage. . . . It's kind of surreal 
for me."

COLUMN ONE; DEMANDING REPAYMENT FOR SLAVERY; THE REPARATIONS MOVEMENT IS 
GAINING NEW ATTENTION. BACKERS SAY PROBLEMS AFFLICTING AFRICAN AMERICANS TODAY 
ARE ROOTED IN PAST INJUSTICES. OTHERS DECRY THE IDEA AS IMPRACTICAL AND 
SIMPLISTIC.

 Valena Conley has never picked a crop of cotton beneath a slave master's 
watchful eye. Nor has she felt the lash of a whip on her back, or the pinch of 
a chain on her wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 But her forebears suffered these injustices -- and more. And now, 130 years 
after the death of slavery in America, Conley believes the time has come to 
even the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country got rich off our sweat, and we have never been paid what's due," 
said Conley, 70, a former schoolteacher who lives in a tidy but ramshackle 
house in one of Oakland's bleakest neighborhoods. "Slavery is something that 
still bears on the minds and hearts of our people. It's time to set things 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by such convictions, Conley has sued the federal government for the 
enslavement of her ancestors, seeking $110 million in damages. The lawsuit also 
asks the United States to formally apologize for slavery and acknowledge its 
"fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts give Conley little chance of success. But by bringing her plea 
to court, the stout, soft-spoken grandmother has added her voice to a rising 
chorus of African Americans demanding reparations for 246 bloody years of 
forced servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The cry for such a pay-back has echoed across the American landscape since the 
end of the Civil War, when the country's 4 million slaves pinned their hopes on 
promises of being given "40 acres and a mule" once freed. The promises were 
mostly unfulfilled, and subsequent generations of blacks -- including such 
leaders as Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X -- have talked of someday collecting on 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such deep historical roots, the reparations movement has remained 
modest and obscure, scorned by critics who call it foolish and question its 
rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the drive appears to be gaining steam, fueled in part by the 
successful push by Japanese Americans to win redress for their internment 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a recent wave of dozens of lawsuits like Conley's, the 
reparations movement today includes a national organization about to have its 
fifth annual convention, a newsletter and training manuals to help local groups 
rally support for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reparationists have begun withholding federal income taxes -- writing 
"exempt" on their forms -- and a Michigan congressman has introduced a 
resolution calling for a commission to study the effects of slavery and suggest 
remedies, perhaps including cash payments to descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent figures such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King have 
expressed support for reparations, and several cities -- such as Detroit and 
Cleveland -- and the District of Columbia have passed resolutions endorsing the 
basic principle. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another sign of its resurgence, the topic has sparked debate on college 
campuses and has penetrated pop culture -- surfacing in rap music and the name 
of Spike Lee's film production company, 40 Acres and a Mule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awareness and interest are spreading, and at some point, the U.S. government 
will have to stop ignoring us," said Adjoa Aiyetoro, director of the National 
Conference of Black Lawyers, which is developing legal strategies for obtaining 
reparations. "It may not be tomorrow, but I don't believe all this work will be 
for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 As reparationists see it, poverty, family disintegration, crime and other 
problems plaguing segments of the black community are rooted in the capture of 
Africans, their terrifying journey in filthy slave ships and subsequent 
bondage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once emancipated, the penniless freedmen had to cope with racism, educational 
deprivation and a lack of basic survival skills -- in short, a shaky foundation 
on which to build a prosperous future. The effects of such conditions, 
reparationists argue, have persisted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "African Americans are not in this position because we don't have the moxie to 
make it," said Dorothy Benton-Lewis of the Black Reparations Commission, a 
Maryland-based education and lobbying group. "Our ancestors had every single 
payday of their lives stolen so that whites could be unjustly enriched. When 
they died, there was nothing to pass on to the next generation and the next." 
</P>
<P>
 More philosophically, reparationists say the demolition of the slaves' native 
African culture, the splintering of their families by plantation owners and 
their status as chattel contributed to what activist Charles Kahalifa King 
calls an enduring "slave mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sickness among our people, a sickness of the mind that is a 
residual of our state of bondage," said King, president of San Diego's chapter 
of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, known as 
N'COBRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Though few would dispute the heinousness of slavery, the reparations movement 
has no dearth of critics. Many dismiss it as an impractical crusade with no 
chance of success. Clay Carson, who teaches African American history at 
Stanford University, calls it "appealingly simplistic" but unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish things could be resolved so easily. I wish blacks and whites could 
come together, decide on a payment and afterward agree that we're all free and 
clear," Carson said. "Unfortunately, things are far more complicated than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Williams, a conservative black columnist and professor of economics at 
George Mason University in Virginia, objects to reparations on moral grounds. 
It is "perverse," he says, "to suggest that some poor white kid who's the son 
of a coal miner in West Virginia owes me -- someone in the top 1% or 2% of 
income earners in the U.S. -- money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the slave owners owe their slaves reparations," Williams said. "But 
they're all dead, so that's an account that will be settled in another time and 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics accuse reparationists of perpetuating a "victim complex" that 
distracts African Americans from true solutions to their troubles. Although 
slavery may have contributed to the lot of black people today, this argument 
goes, focusing on it is a shameful preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a mugger knocks you down, do you wait for the mugger to come and pick you 
up?" asked Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood 
Enterprise in Washington. "This is escapism, a way to escape responsibility for 
doing anything affirmative to improve your conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Historians trace the concept of reparations to the Reconstruction Era, when 
liberated slaves were led to believe they would receive land and other 
assistance -- such as farm animals and equipment -- with which to homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample evidence to support this belief. In January, 1865, Union Gen. 
William Tecumseh Sherman ordered that plots of land in a strip of coastal 
territory extending south from Charleston, S.C., be awarded to freed blacks. 
Later that year, Congress passed a law reserving 3 million acres in five 
Confederate states "for the use of freedmen," who would be asked to purchase 
their property once they were on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 President Andrew Johnson, however, quickly vetoed the law, and few slaves 
benefited under Sherman's order. Still, those actions -- and other 
Reconstruction Era rumors and promises -- fostered an enduring expectation 
among blacks that land and a mule would someday come their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the freed slaves had been granted 40 acres of tillable land and a mule, 
that would have been plenty for them to make it," said Johnita Scott, a 
preschool director in Baton Rouge, La., who is national co-chair of N'COBRA. 
"Instead, they were forced to find work back on the plantations where they had 
been held captive. The U.S. took a very wrong turn right then and there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades since, blacks have repeatedly sought to collect that 
once-promised assistance. For many, the motivation was spawned by family 
stories of the brutal treatment their ancestors endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts so much to think that one race would do such things to another," 
Scott said. "I think a lot of us are doing this work because we want these 
injustices fully acknowledged. In a way, it's a healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Jenkins, a veteran reparationist from Detroit, agrees. But Jenkins, who 
grew up poor in Tennessee, also says his crusade is an effort to avenge his 
grandfather, Will Mobley, a Mississippi slave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They so-called 'freed' him in 1865, but then they re-enslaved him right away 
as a sharecropper," said Jenkins, who spent his youth working summers as a 
water boy in the Arkansas cotton fields. "When he died, at 103, he had nothing 
to his name despite a lifetime of hard labor. We had to pass the hat just to 
bury him." 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1988, reparationists such as Jenkins fought a lonely battle, facing cold 
shoulders and ridicule, even within their own race. But when Congress 
authorized payments totaling $1.25 billion to 60,000 surviving Japanese 
American internees, things changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started pushing reparations 27 years ago, people laughed at me," 
said Jenkins, 63, a real estate broker. "But when (the Japanese Americans) got 
$20,000 each in tax-free money, they stopped laughing real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Reparationists say the compensation of Japanese Americans is proof that the 
United States will, if pressured, address historic injustices. But others note 
that those payments went to victims of U.S. policy, rather than to descendants 
long removed from the injustice. Moreover, the number of internees was far 
fewer than the millions of African Americans who might be eligible for 
reparations, making their claim more politically realistic given the nation's 
fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the success of Japanese Americans invigorated the reparations 
movement. In 1989, N'COBRA, a national coalition of groups and individuals 
devoted to the cause, was founded. And for the first time in modern history, 
someone in Washington began to show an interest in the idea -- Rep. John 
Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
 Conyers, who pioneered the long fight for a national holiday honoring Martin 
Luther King Jr., has introduced a resolution asking that a congressional 
commission research the effects of slavery and recommend remedies. It is the 
third reparations-related measure he has authored since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 N'COBRA has mounted a petition and letter-writing drive on behalf of the bill, 
which has 19 co-sponsors and the endorsement of half of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. But aides, speaking privately, give the resolution little chance of 
passage anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the controversial nature of the topic, the potential cost of 
reparations -- a sum that could stretch into the trillions -- makes it 
politically unappealing given the national debt and competing budget demands. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the form reparations should take, opinions vary widely. Some advocate 
payments to direct descendants of slaves. A Tacoma, Wash., activist has 
estimated the amount owed each African American to be $198,149, calculating the 
1865 value of 40 acres and a mule plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, favor creation of a reparations fund to benefit all African 
Americans through investments in education, housing, economic development and 
other needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give a man a fish, he might be hungry tomorrow," said Jenkins, the 
Detroit reparationist. "But teach a man how to catch that fish and he can feed 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland, Valena Conley echoes such sentiments, and says she would donate 
any money from her legal efforts to a reparations fund. From her weathered 
doorstep, she sees what she calls the most heartbreaking remnant of slavery, 
"hopeless kids wrapped up in drugs and crime." Reparations, she says, can 
"bring these young people up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to collect money for me, because I don't need it," Conley 
said. "But talk is cheap, and this is something that must be done. . . . If we 
don't fight for it, who will?"

IN TIGHTENING WELFARE, STATE ENCOURAGES MARRIAGE; BENEFITS: 'WEDFARE' GIVES 
PARENTS INCENTIVE TO STAY TOGETHER. IT PUTS CALIFORNIA IN THE VANGUARD OF 
REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the final weeks of budget negotiations, legislators quietly inserted in the 
state's spending plan a major revision in welfare policy that will make 
California one of the few states to provide financial incentives for recipients 
to get married. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, given the name "wedfare" because of its intent to encourage marriage 
and family reunification, would allow welfare families to receive child care 
and medical benefits for up to one year after marriage or upon the reuniting of 
the mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan takes aim at what has been considered one of the prime weaknesses 
of the welfare system -- that it discourages marriage and reconciliation by 
rules that often require families to be cut off from benefits when the mother 
marries or the father comes back to the home after a separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, welfare policy has assumed that because a father has an 
obligation to support his children, the family is not eligible for government 
aid if he is present in the household. In recent years an exception has been 
made for fathers who have a work history and then become temporarily 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) said wedfare will have the greatest impact 
on young parents who may have remained apart because they are poor and the 
father has no work history that would make him eligible for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welfare discourages marriage and it discourages family unification," said 
Sen. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), the author of the plan. "What this does is 
strengthen the family. It helps unite or reunite a family and it adds some 
stability and I think we're all a lot better off for it." 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that over time it would encourage more marriages and reduce 
welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the poor, who see the creation of the wedfare program as the 
only good news in an otherwise dismal budget package for welfare recipients, 
called the plan a modest step toward removing the welfare "marriage penalty." A 
few states, they said, have gone further by making poor families eligible for 
welfare whether or not the father is present in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a good thing," said Casey McKeever, an attorney for the 
Western Center of Law and Poverty, " . . . but there are more ambitious and 
more effective ways of dealing with the marriage penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of wedfare, along with several other changes adopted in preparing 
next year's state budget, completes a cycle of welfare revisions that has 
reshaped California's system during the last four years. And it puts 
California, along with New Jersey and Wisconsin, at the forefront of the states 
that are attempting to reform the much-criticized system. 
</P>
<P>
 For welfare recipients, there have been some improvements in the support they 
receive, but actual cash benefits have steadily declined. Cuts in grant 
payments, including a 2.3% reduction this year, have meant reductions for four 
straight years. In July, 1990, the maximum benefit for a family of three, 
including food stamps, was $820. When the new cuts go into effect in September, 
the maximum benefits, including food stamps, will be $777. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, recipients have been given greater financial incentives to 
go to work and, with this year's revisions, to get married. Last year, the 
Legislature approved changes that encourage recipients to work by allowing them 
to keep more of what they earned before the benefits were reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The work incentives and the gradual reduction in benefits are seen as 
political pluses for Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made revisions in the 
welfare system one of the chief goals of his Administration. This year 
Democrats who attempted to stop benefit cuts were forced to compromise to save 
face when the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Kathleen Brown, proposed a 5% 
cut of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very alarming to me that more and more now, we're in a trend," said 
Watson. "For the last three years we're trying to balance the budget off of the 
most helpless among us, the children." 
</P>
<P>
 She predicted that the change that will have a severe impact on families is 
one approved this year penalizing those who have additional children while on 
welfare. That provision, which goes into effect next January, would not allow 
families to collect additional benefits for children born to welfare mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother with one child, for example, who collects a maximum monthly cash 
grant of $479 would have to live on that same amount even if she had another 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 After Watson produced statistics showing that contraceptives often have a high 
failure rate, the Legislature agreed to make an exception for mothers who get 
pregnant even though they had been sterilized or used an intrauterine device or 
the Norplant process. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said she could not persuade lawmakers to also make an exception for 
mothers who used other prescribed forms of birth control, such as the pill or a 
diaphragm, that failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the penalty provision said it would discourage welfare families 
from having additional children. 
</P>
<P>
 While the penalty for additional children cannot go into effect without 
federal approval, it is expected to have no difficulty winning the endorsement 
of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE WILSON BUDGET: The state budget is a mirror of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
wishes. A3 Welfare Cuts and Gains 
</P>
<P>
 The new budget awaiting Gov. Pete Wilson's signature will affect California's 
poor, especially mothers and children supported by Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children (AFDC). The highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marriage incentive: Mothers receiving AFDC are given an incentive to get 
married or reunite with the fathers of their children through the approval of a 
plan called Wedfare. It allows welfare families to continue receiving Medi-Cal 
and child care benefits for up to one year after marriage provided they meet a 
need standard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trims: Welfare benefits are cut for the fourth year in a row, this time by 
2.3%. Effective Sept. 1, the basic cash grant for a family of three drops from 
$607 to $593 a month. Savings to the state are estimated at $56.3 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional children: To discourage additional pregnancies, mothers will be 
denied additional AFDC benefits for children who are born while they are on 
welfare. A welfare mother of one who gives birth to a second will only be 
eligible for $479 a month -- the maximum for a mother and one child. Savings to 
the state are estimated at $38 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fraud penalties: The penalties for fraud are increased. For example, parents 
found to have received welfare for nonexistent children would be ineligible for 
aid for two years for the first offense. Estimated savings: $6 million in the 
coming budget year and $20 million in the following year.

RISE OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS DIVIDES CONSERVATIVE TOWN; TOLERANCE: INFLUX MAKES 
COLORADO SPRINGS NATION'S EVANGELICAL CAPITAL. SOME SEE THREAT TO CITY'S 
TRADITIONS.

 At Rampart High School, things have changed so much that 17-year-old Jennifer 
Fry said it "doesn't seem like a public school any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Students drive cars with religious bumper stickers and wear T-shirts 
emblazoned with depictions of bloody fetuses and religious slogans. One student 
sobbed in the hallways because a friend had not accepted Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 "In class, it doesn't matter what we're discussing, the 'God thing' is dragged 
in a lot," said Fry, an intern at a weekly newspaper that writes critically of 
the growing religious influences here. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're talking about an earthquake in Malaysia, someone will say it's a 
sign of the Rapture. I call it plate tectonics." 
</P>
<P>
 From its beginnings in the mid-1800s as a resort and mining center nestled on 
the eastern flank of Pikes Peak, Colorado Springs has been a bedrock of 
conservative values. It is home to Ft. Carson Army Base, the Air Force Academy 
and the North American Air Defense Command. 
</P>
<P>
 But some longtime residents of this town -- which prides itself on a tradition 
of live-and-let-live libertarianism -- say they are unnerved by a recent influx 
of fundamentalist Christian organizations that have made this community of 
306,000 people the evangelical capital of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now home to 50 national Christian religious groups -- half of which arrived 
during the past decade -- Colorado Springs has become a place where a police 
officer gave a religious pamphlet to a developmentally disabled apartment 
resident who was disturbing the peace and where children were invited to a 
carnival, only to be baptized without their parents' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Springs is also the community that spawned the highly controversial 
Amendment 2, a 1992 statewide initiative barring anti-discrimination laws aimed 
at protecting homosexuals. Amendment 2 was ruled unconstitutional in state 
district court and is now on appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Several leaders of the new religious groups say the concerns are unfounded. 
They came here, they say, because of bargain land and housing prices, 
spectacular mountain vistas and a community already known for its solid 
conservative views. Now they say they want to nest peacefully as good neighbors 
while continuing their evangelical and charity work across the country and 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone suffers from discrimination or intolerance, they say, it is they and 
their children who are forced to live in a secular society and attend "Godless 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of the same people who tangled over Amendment 2 now are 
entrenched in bitter ideological disputes over what should be accepted as 
authentic knowledge in schools and practical values in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tug-of-wars are taking place in hundreds of communities across the 
nation. Typically, evangelical Christians say they are trying to live by 
absolutes derived from Scripture, while liberals say they are merely espousing 
tolerance for cultural and religious differences and subscribing to the 
scientific method. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the clashes here over moral, ethical and religious issues are 
among staunch conservatives who also consider themselves Christians. These 
disputes are impacting daily life in City Hall and in neighborhoods and schools 
throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening here is very unfortunate; it's a strange town to live in 
right now," said attorney Greg Walta, a fundamentalist Christian who has lived 
here since 1968. He said some of the conservative religious newcomers 
"stereotype" people who do not believe as they do, a trend he describes as 
"destructive to our schools and our community." 
</P>
<P>
 In local schools, some teachers say they now choose their words carefully. One 
high school instructor said she prefaces her comments from the lectern with 
"this is only my personal opinion," to avoid antagonizing pupils who cite 
biblical passages to dispute her lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly arrived Christian leaders are not trying to compete with existing 
religious groups or stack school boards or the City Council, said Paul Hetrick, 
vice president of Focus on the Family, a nationally prominent group that 
relocated from Pomona to Colorado Springs in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are designed to support the ministry of churches rather than compete with 
them," said Hetrick, whose organization is by far the largest religious group 
in Colorado Springs, with about 1,200 employees and an income of $94 million 
last year. As a ministry aimed at bolstering family values via the airwaves and 
publications, he added, "we are not conversant in local school issues other 
than looking at newspapers when we get home from work." 
</P>
<P>
 But some other leaders and members of other fundamentalist groups here say 
they believe that there can be no middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on in Colorado Springs is a battle over religious principles," 
said Kevin Tebedo, a native of Colorado Springs and spokesman for the group 
Colorado for Family Values, which sponsored Amendment 2. "The two sides cannot 
come together," he said, because at its root, "Judeo-Christianity is very 
intolerant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus said: 'I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes to the 
Father but by me.' You don't get there through Buddha, Allah, Mary Baker Eddy, 
Charles Darwin or Joseph Smith," Tebedo added. "If you've rejected Jesus Christ 
as your savior, you're going to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Some townsfolk call that a confrontational brand of Christianity and a growing 
threat to the city's cultural diversity, schools, civil liberties and image. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx gathered momentum in 1989 when, in the depths of the state's last 
recession, the city's economic development arm began scrambling to attract new 
businesses and nonprofit groups to help diversify the local economy. One 
staffer of the Economic Development Corp. turned to her network of personal 
contacts among Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 That targeting strategy, which produced a bonanza, was halted this year 
because "we clearly now have a critical mass of those (religious) 
organizations, as well as telemarketing and defense contract firms that we 
didn't have before," said Rocky Scott, president of the Economic Development 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agency will continue to help relocate religious organizations if 
asked, it is now emphasizing high-technology firms because the city badly needs 
independence from declining military spending that supports 50% of its jobs, 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious groups that are here, he added, deserve praise for the 3,000 
positions and estimated $300 million they generate annually. But some longtime 
residents note that these religious organizations are tax-exempt and that the 
jobs they have brought will not make up for further defense cutbacks that may 
target Ft. Carson, which accounts for 20% of local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others point to acrimony on the city's Human Relations Commission as 
evidence of an unintended consequence of the influx -- heightened political 
tensions in a city already polarized by passage of Amendment 2. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 13, the 15-member commission, which has been in existence for nearly 
three decades, was suspended for six months by the City Council, in part 
because the panel had reached a bitter impasse over proposals to meet with 
community groups that advocate civil rights for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are currently reviewing the commission's purpose. Until now, 
that mission seemed clear-cut: work toward the elimination of prejudice, 
intolerance and intergroup tensions, and promote goodwill, community awareness, 
mutual understanding and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore, according to Human Relations Commissioner Vincent D'Acchioli, who 
moved from Los Angeles to Colorado Springs in 1991 to help Every Home for 
Christ set up shop. D'Acchioli objected bitterly to any commissioner appearing 
to sanction gay groups by talking to them. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Acchioli, who compares the local gay rights group Ground Zero to the Ku Klux 
Klan, says he vehemently believes that homosexuals and those who celebrate 
diversity are undermining traditional American values grounded in 
Judeo-Christian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'celebrate diversity' crowd is a tragedy to me -- it's like celebrating 
our differences," D'Acchioli said. "My idea is to get away from that garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 "Colorado Springs is a battleground for heated issues such as abortion and 
homosexuality," D'Acchioli added. "When one side or the other will not settle 
for total surrender -- and that's what you have here -- there can be no 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry over such strident views, and the sway conservative religious groups 
seemed to have over community affairs, a diverse group of residents banded 
together three years ago to form the Citizens Project. The group, which 
includes conservative Christians and liberals, publishes a monthly newsletter 
called Freedom Watch, which monitors the activities of conservative religious 
groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the incident last summer involving the police officer who handed 
out a religious pamphlet alarmed Citizens Project members and others who saw it 
as an unwarranted intrusion of church in police matters. 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, police officials said it was against department policy for 
the officer to have given a religious pamphlet to the man, who had been talking 
loudly on a downtown apartment telephone after 10 p.m. Police officials said 
"appropriate action" was taken, but they declined to say whether the officer, 
one of about 30 members of Police Officers for Christ here, was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to promote alternative viewpoints, Citizens Project also hosts 
"dialogue dinners" -- informal gatherings of residents who discuss a range of 
personal views on issues ranging from abortion to school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the problem (in Colorado Springs) is a small but incredibly vocal 
minority bolstered by the critical mass of conservative religious 
organizations," said Mike Shaver, co-director of Citizens Project and an avowed 
Christian. "The dialogue dinners aim to build consensus, to look for areas 
where a majority of people can agree." 
</P>
<P>
 A separate effort to find common ground between the opposing factions involves 
local clergy in a 2-year-old, broad-based "community concerns group" 
representing every shade of opinion -- from conservative evangelical to 
liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of that group include Rabbi Harold Hirsch of Temple Shalom and James 
C. Dobson, president of Focus on the Family, which has hosted unity meetings of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal," Hirsch said, "is to move toward mutual understanding rather than 
mutual recrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials want the same thing in troubled District 20, where the 
hottest topics of the moment are sex education, the origin of the human race 
and contentious Christian students in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of religious groups has been dramatic in the district, a booming 
sector of northern Colorado Springs enveloping Rampart High School and the 
Christian Missionary Alliance, Every Home for Christ and Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 There, parents were alarmed to learn earlier this month that four biology 
teachers at Rampart High School skipped two textbook chapters on evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents blamed the problem on pressure from fundamentalist Christians. 
High school officials denied that, saying the chapters were omitted because of 
their length and because they were redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 That dispute has been resolved, said Donna Nicholson, the district's new 
associate superintendent. "Evolution will be taught here," said Nicholson, who 
arrived four months ago from Longview, Tex., where she had to iron out similar 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson said the real problem is a lack of written policies about how to 
address curriculum content. She has asked a school district lawyer to review 
policies with an eye toward correcting inconsistencies in the curriculum and 
clarifying the role of religion in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Rori Whelan, 43, who claims that her two daughters have been "victims of 
harassment by Christian bullies at school," says she plans to move to another 
side of town if the situation does not improve soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the playground, my 9-year-old daughter told some kids that she did not 
believe in Adam and Eve," Whelan said. "They made fun of her, told her that she 
was stupid and didn't believe in God." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her other daughter attended a sex education class at a middle school 
here two years ago in which a religious video was shown without permission of 
school district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a public school, for goodness sake," Whelan said. "I don't believe it 
is a place for people to inflict their beliefs on others. And certainly my kids 
should not be made to feel like second-class citizens because they don't preach 
Jesus in the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ted Haggard, senior pastor of the 4,800-member New Life Church, 
blames the uproar in District 20 and across town on "liberals" who are suddenly 
having to deal with issues that make them uncomfortable, but must be reckoned 
with nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen Christians all over this nation, and man, these Christians (in 
Colorado Springs) are not hostile, angry people," said Haggard, who established 
his 10-year-old church after the "Holy Spirit spoke to me and said he had 
chosen this city for a special purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 "When a society switches to relativism, those who believe in absolutes stick 
out like a sore thumb," he said. "Colorado Springs is a gasp of hope that what 
was good in the Bible is still good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pastor George Otto of the Broadmoor Community Church, part of the United 
Church of Christ, worries that some religious groups are trying to "produce a 
construct of folk who are relatively alike." 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are not going to be in the saddle forever," Otto said. 
"Ultimately, they will either moderate their positions, or this is just a phase 
in the life of American religion."

KIDNAP SUSPECT HAS BURGLARY RECORD; CRIME: THE MAN HELD IN THE ABDUCTION OF A 
12-YEAR-OLD LODI GIRL HAS SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN PRISON IN ARIZONA, 
INVESTIGATORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man arrested in the kidnaping of a 12-year-old Lodi girl has spent much of 
the past decade in Arizona state prison on burglary convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators have been working to connect suspect Steven Reece 
Cochran, 25, to a series of unsolved abductions in Northern California over the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona prison officials say Cochran, who allegedly kidnaped 12-year-old Katie 
Romanek at knifepoint Saturday from her house in the Central Valley town of 
Lodi, has spent eight of the last nine years in prison on two burglary 
convictions and for parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for a few months here and there, he's been behind bars since October 
of 1986," said Ron Mayes, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday afternoon, 22 hours after the abduction, Cochran was spotted walking 
near the Sierra foothills 26 miles southeast of Lodi. A few minutes later, the 
brown-haired, brown-eyed Katie, wearing only socks and streaked with mud but 
otherwise in good condition, emerged from a nearby clump of oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that moment, the kidnaping resembled the October, 1993, abduction of 
Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old Petaluma girl whose body was found two months 
later. Her death helped propel the "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime 
measure enacted in March. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, a bare-chested and heavily tattooed intruder calling 
himself Steve somehow entered the Romanek house in an upscale subdivision about 
50 miles south of Sacramento, police said. Katie and a 12-year-old friend were 
under the supervision of Katie's 16-year-old sister, Elizabeth. Their parents 
had left for a two-day visit to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The stranger tied up the friend and sister, driving off with Katie in her 
sister's car, police said. The car was later found about 25 miles southeast of 
Lodi apparently after it broke down and started a grass fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday on charges of kidnaping, sexual 
assault, unlawful detention and burglary. Authorities would not say which of 
the three girls may have been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities said Cochran has no history of kidnaping or sexual crimes. 
He served four years of a five-year burglary sentence and was released without 
supervision and parole three months ago.

SPOUSAL ABUSE IS TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature, spurred by the O.J. Simpson case, are 
about to approve spending an unprecedented $30 million to assist battered women 
and intensify prosecution of spousal abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic commitment was quietly written into the otherwise austere state 
budget at the urging of female legislators, who capitalized on the notoriety of 
the Simpson case to attack an issue they say has been neglected for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did take O.J. Simpson being accused of brutally murdering his (ex-) wife 
and a friend . . . and the re-publicizing of his history of battering to make 
this happen," Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill (AB 167) was approved by the Senate on a bipartisan 32-2 vote late 
Monday and is expected to receive similar heavy support in the Assembly. "We'll 
be ready to sign it," a Wilson spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), who joined Friedman and Assemblywoman 
Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) in pressing for the funds, said the financial 
commitment "may be the one bright spot in this year's budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill represents the largest expenditure of its kind by the state, 
earmarking $23 million during the current and next fiscal years for creating 
shelters and expanding services for battered women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also would be used to find permanent housing for battered women and 
provide job training, placement, legal services and classes in family budgeting 
and child rearing. Now, the state spends only about $1.4 million a year for 
shelter-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpert said there are three times more shelters for animals in California than 
for abused women. She said most women seeking shelter are turned away for lack 
of resources and space. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also earmarks $7 million for the state Department of Justice in the 
next two years for disbursement to local prosecutors for intensified 
prosecution of wife beaters and other abusers. Included in the bill is a plan 
for assignment of a single deputy prosecutor to handle domestic violence cases 
from start to finish instead of sharing the task among several deputy 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution component of the program applies to all victims of domestic 
violence; the shelter, training and counseling funding is tailored specifically 
for women. For at least 10 years, the Legislature has enacted various domestic 
violence laws but has been criticized for failing to follow through with enough 
money to make a substantial dent in what Alpert called "an epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for victims of spousal abuse praised the measure as a watershed for 
California. "This is the beginning to put an end, I believe, to domestic 
violence in California," said Alana Bowman of the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was fashioned in private late last week by Wilson and legislative 
leaders during state budget negotiations. It was quietly sponsored by Friedman, 
Alpert and Solis, all activists on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do it in a nonconfrontational way," said a legislative source 
who asked not to be identified. The source said a high-profile presentation 
might have jeopardized the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Tuesday, Alpert, Solis and Friedman said they decided to act 
because the Simpson case had focused public and legislative attention on the 
issues of spousal abuse. Concurrently, Wilson and the legislative leaders were 
close to finishing details on the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing is everything and we felt this was just really a short window of 
opportunity in which to act," Alpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 They urged Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) to submit their 
$30-million plan to the budget negotiators. "He said, 'Good idea,' " Friedman 
recalled. While other programs such as welfare were cut, the domestic violence 
funds were added. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis said the legislation reflected the emerging viewpoint that domestic 
violence finally "is going to be placed up there with other heinous crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative against domestic violence may give Wilson and 
reelection-conscious lawmakers at least one positive accomplishment to cite in 
an otherwise bleak state budget, Alpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, the reality is the governor wants to be perceived as being strong 
on this (issue) and the Legislature wants to be perceived as being strong on 
this," she said. "We say good for them."

BEACH CITY STILL REELING FROM HOLIDAY MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and city officials wondered Tuesday what more could have been done to 
stem Fourth of July melees that included the burning of furniture in the 
streets and the hurling of firecrackers, bottles and rocks at officers and 
passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people were arrested in the city's downtown area during three 
hours late Monday night. In all, 139 arrests were made through the day for a 
variety of offenses, including public drunkenness, resisting arrest and failure 
to disperse, police said. Police also impounded about 250 bicycles from riders 
who lacked city licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the scene was reminiscent of the trouble on last year's Fourth of 
July holiday, which resulted in more than 40 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Krysten Olson watched the action unfold Monday night from her front yard at 
Olive and 11th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walked a couch down the block and lit it on fire," she said. "People 
were cheering it on. There were about 200 people going down the street, 
drinking and throwing fireworks.' 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble started about 10:30 p.m. when about 500 people gathered near Main 
and Olive streets. Police arrived and dispersed the crowd, which then broke 
into several smaller groups and spread throughout downtown, Officer Mike 
Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned into a game of cat-and-mouse," Corchoran said. "We would split one 
group up, and then there would be two or three other things starting up. We had 
to do that for more than three hours until we dispersed all of the problem 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a water truck was used to clear stubborn revelers from downtown 
streets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to dampen their spirits, and basically it worked real well," 
Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corchoran said this year's disturbances appeared to be much more calculated 
than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was like one big thing, and this year was more like a myriad of 
little things," Corchoran said. "I think what's behind it is that people are 
almost expecting something like this to occur. So, you have individuals who 
flock anywhere where there is potential for recognition and notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to avoid a repeat of last year, the city's entire 230-member police 
force was on duty through the weekend at a cost of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the cops did the best that they could," said resident Tim Wuerfel, 
26. "They are outnumbered every year. The biggest problem is that so many 
people come to this area. A lot of these people get together, and they think 
they can do whatever they want to do."

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILSON'S PRIORITIES DICTATED BUDGET; FINANCES: THE WEALTHY AND 
THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE PROTECTED AND THE POOR ARE PINCHED. BUT HARSH CUTS FAIL TO 
AVERT GROWING RELIANCE ON BORROWING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. 
</P>

<P>
 The state budget that Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to sign today bears more of 
his imprint than any other spending plan enacted since Wilson became governor 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican chief executive dictated the terms of this budget, and the 
Democrats who control the Legislature -- lacking the two-thirds majority needed 
to overrule him -- capitulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Any budget is a statement of the values of those who write it, and Wilson, 
dogged by a consistently repressed economy, wrote this one. It protects the 
pocketbooks of the wealthy and limits damage to programs valued by the middle 
class -- at the expense of services that the poorest Californians depend upon 
for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the tough-talking Wilson could not stomach the still deeper spending 
cuts that would have been required to balance the budget. Instead, to soften 
the blow, the governor won approval of the kind of deficit spending he once 
warned would lead the state down a path toward fiscal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Democrats and Republicans alike warn that this budget will 
not pull the state government out of its fiscal quagmire. They expect to return 
after the November elections and face yet another in a string of deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a conciliatory statement released by his office, said the budget 
that passed the state Senate on July 4 was the product of give and take from 
both sides of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This budget," he said, "contains items forged in compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic legislators say there was little in the budget to satisfy their 
constituents. In a few areas, they got Wilson to settle for smaller reductions 
in spending on programs than he had proposed. But the overall direction of the 
plan remained his. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was able to get his way by working smoothly with the Republicans in the 
Legislature. Even though they are the minority party in both the Assembly and 
the Senate, the Republicans have enough votes to block the Democrats from 
building the two-thirds majority required to enact a spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you operate with the tyranny of the minority, you can come close to 
getting everything you want," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has made crime, illegal immigration and economic recovery the main 
themes of his reelection campaign, and there is something in the budget that 
fits with all three. 
</P>
<P>
 It boosts prison funding by more than 9%, including enough to pay for the 
increasing number of inmates expected to result from the passage earlier this 
year of the "three strikes" sentencing measure. Wilson fought off Democratic 
attempts to trim the size of the increase for prisons, insisting that any 
significant cut would force the state to release dangerous felons early. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it was not his idea, Wilson can take credit for signing a bill that 
provides $30 million to battle domestic violence and provide shelters for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget addresses illegal immigration by stripping funds from a program 
that provided prenatal care to pregnant women who are here illegally. It also 
denies health and welfare benefits to certain legal immigrants for five years. 
And it provides money for Wilson's deployment of California National Guard 
troops at the border to back up federal immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the budget holds the line on taxes. Although Wilson earlier in his 
term advocated and signed the largest tax increase in the state's history, he 
has now taken the position that higher taxes would hinder California's economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson turned back the Democrats' effort to extend an income tax surcharge on 
the wealthy that is due to expire at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed -- and the Legislature approved -- enough money to allow 
kindergarten through 12th-grade schools to keep up with enrollment and offered 
small increases for the state universities and community colleges. In one of 
his few defeats, Wilson had to abandon a proposal to increase community college 
fees by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor, as they have for the past several years, came out on the short end. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget reduces welfare grants for the fourth year in a row, this time by 
2.3%. The $593 per month that a parent with two children will now receive is 
the minimum allowed by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Related legislation will nudge welfare recipients toward work after two years 
on the rolls and will deny additional benefits to women who conceive children 
after they go on public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants still are higher than Wilson says he would like. But without the 
cuts and freezes instituted since he became governor, the monthly grant would 
now be $813 -- 37% higher than it will be under the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also cuts aid to the aged, blind and disabled and reduces funding 
for county hospitals that care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its harsher elements, the budget is more clearly unbalanced than any 
spending plan Wilson has signed since 1991. Unlike previous budgets, which 
relied on hopes of an economic recovery to erase the state's deficit, this one 
does not even go that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it is part of a two-year plan that depends on a highly unlikely 
$2.8-billion bailout from the federal government the year after next. Without 
it, the state will be flat broke in 1996 unless the economy recovers with a 
vigor that almost no one expects to see. 
</P>
<P>
 So bleak are the state's revenue prospects that the Wall Street investors who 
have been propping up the government with loans for the past several years 
balked this time. The state had to pay Bank of America and a consortium of 
international lenders $30 million just to co-sign on a record $4 billion in 
borrowing needed to keep the state afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the banks demanded and received a standby measure that could 
trigger automatic, across-the-board reductions in all programs except education 
if the state's fiscal condition worsens over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Democratic opponent, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, has indicated 
that she will try to make the budget an issue in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson's legacy will be additional hardships for most of us," said John 
Whitehurst, Brown's press secretary. "But Wilson's friends, who are relaxing at 
their country clubs, won't feel any of the pain. The mind-set that created 
these priorities is simply out of touch with the way most of us live." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether this populist rhetoric -- reminiscent of Bill 
Clinton's 1992 campaign -- will work here in 1994. California voters have shown 
little interest in state fiscal policy, except perhaps during the 63-day 
stalemate that forced the state to pay its bills with IOUs throughout the 
summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Brown's own state budget proposal is an echo of Wilson's. Like 
him, she called for deep cuts in welfare grants, and she endorsed the 
governor's prison budget. Though she has criticized him for shorting education, 
she proposed not a penny more for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The major difference between the two was that Brown called for slightly more 
taxes and more deficit spending -- not the sort of twin pillars on which 
candidates normally get elected to the state's highest office.

FACING EXPULSION, HILL RESIGNS SEAT IN SENATE; LEGISLATURE: THE WHITTIER 
REPUBLICAN, CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION, LEAVES OFFICE FRIDAY. GOV. WILSON IS 
EXPECTED TO CALL A SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE HIM.

<P>
 Facing expulsion by his colleagues after his conviction on corruption charges, 
state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) on Tuesday resigned his office effective 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-sentence letter, the veteran lawmaker said: "I hereby submit my 
resignation as senator for the Twenty-Ninth Senate District to become effective 
July 8, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 16, Hill, 40, was convicted of extortion, money laundering and 
conspiracy stemming from his acceptance of a $2,500 check from an undercover 
FBI agent posing as a Southern businessman seeking a legislative favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill refused to resign, but the Senate was reluctant to move swiftly to oust a 
well-liked colleague. He continued to collect his $52,500-a-year salary plus a 
tax-free living allowance as his supporters urged that he be allowed to remain 
in office at least until his Sept. 12 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week the Senate Rules Committee voted 4-0 to oust Hill and scheduled 
a full Senate vote for later this week. The last time a senator was expelled 
was in 1905, when four members caught up in a political scandal were thrown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), a Rules Committee member, said pressure 
was building from constituents to oust Hill. He said voters have accused 
senators of "coddling one of your own. As far as they are concerned, Hill is a 
convicted felon. Why keep him on the payroll." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill last week seemed to tip his hand, distributing to his Senate colleagues a 
flyer listing his Sacramento area condominium for sale. "Must sell or will list 
with realtor soon," the flyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's resignation will clear the way for Gov. Pete Wilson to call a special 
election for the San Gabriel Valley to run concurrently with the Nov. 8 regular 
statewide election. A Wilson spokesman said a decision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining the special election could save taxpayers about $1 million, 
legislative election consultants estimate. If no candidate receives a majority, 
a runoff election would be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Assembly Republicans, Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar and Richard Mountjoy of 
Arcadia, are considering whether to run for Hill's safe GOP seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's letter arrived at the close of business Tuesday. Karin Caves, press 
secretary to Senate Democratic leader Bill Lockyer of Hayward said, "Sen. Hill 
did the right thing."

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; LAKE WOEBEGONE'S WELCOME SIGN; A STATE PARK AT THE SALTON SEA 
IS LARGELY UNUSED, A CASUALTY OF POLLUTION FEARS. BUT OFFICIALS SAY THE WATER 
IS SAFE AND URGE FISHERS, CAMPERS, SWIMMERS AND EVERYONE ELSE TO RETURN.

<P>
 Steve Horvitz walks along the beach while water laps gently at the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is warm. It is good swimming water, great skiing water and 
super-great fishing water. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is shallow enough that children can wade out 50 yards and barely be 
chest high. The salt content provides a natural buoyancy for neophyte swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat ramps are close so fishers can launch quickly and speed off to the deeper 
water where the orangemouth corvina, sargo, tilapia and Gulf croaker await. 
Novice anglers can experience the thrill of catching their limit before 
lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 On shore are shaded picnic tables, barbecue pits and clean, graffiti-free 
bathrooms with showers. Parking is close and roomy enough for recreational 
vehicles. Palm trees add to the ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the far background to the west loom the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa 
mountains, as pretty a pair of mountains as any in Southern California. In the 
summer, the mountains are brown and shimmering; in the winter, they are adorned 
by a mantle of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for journalists tagging along and three snowy egrets cooling their 
feet, Horvitz is alone at midday. Utterly alone. There is not a single swimmer, 
boater, fisher, camper, picnicker or sunbather to be seen on the land or the 
water. All 440 camping sites are empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the loneliest park in California. Horvitz, an affable and low-key 
veteran of 20 years with the state park system, is the superintendent and he is 
not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drives me crazy to see it so empty," Horvitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not always been this way. As late as the early 1980s, the Salton Sea 
State Recreation Area, which straddles Riverside and Imperial counties, was one 
of the busiest parks in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981-82, 394,000 people came to play on beaches called Mecca, Corvina, Salt 
Creek and Bombay. Then the big decline started, and it has been all downhill 
for Salton Sea State Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year that ended last week, the tally was more like 130,000, and 
that was 20,000 above the nadir of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The precipitous drop in use of the recreation area, a strip 15 miles long and 
several hundred yards wide on the Salton Sea's north shore, can be attributed 
to the ongoing environmental problems of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by catastrophe when the Colorado River broke free in 1905, the Salton 
Sea is the largest (35 miles long, 15 miles wide) body of water in California. 
Horvitz insists it is also one of the most misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to ignore the chronic problems of the Salton Sea: rising 
salinity, fluctuating water levels, mysterious bird die-offs, the lack of 
drainage, and the effects of the fetid New River flowing northward from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is possible to overstate the sea's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the two main unattractive attributes of the Salton Sea -- its 
tea-like color and the occasional aroma -- are natural phenomena. They are not 
caused by pollution and not considered harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea is brownish because of a healthy crop of algae and plankton. The sea 
smells because algae and plankton, when deprived of oxygen, can emit a nontoxic 
variety of hydrogen sulfide gas, in the same manner as ocean seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Horvitz concedes that the average person may think the sea is polluted 
based on its smell and look. But, scientifically, the sea is not polluted, and 
the park system classifies it as "class-one recreational water." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches of southern San Diego County and San Diego's famed Mission Bay 
Aquatic Park are occasionally closed to swimmers because of raw sewage breaks. 
Yet tourists keep coming in ever greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salton Sea, subject to the same health laws, stays open for swimmers 365 days 
a year but cannot shake its reputation. It is a point that rankles Salton Sea 
loyalists such as Norm Niver, who writes for the monthly Salton Seafarer 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 He often devotes his column to correcting errors about the Salton Sea that he 
spots in out-of-town newspapers. He wrote recently about a story he had seen in 
a San Diego paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read that article," Niver wrote, "and it was just as stupid as a lot of the 
other ones that I receive from all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Horvitz has a more tactful approach to errant journalists, but his message is 
basically the same: Don't confuse the Salton Sea's image with its environmental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to turn around the impression people have of the sea," Horvitz said. 
"I take it as a personal challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Horvitz has been at Salton Sea for three years. His territory also includes 
the Indio Hills Palm recreation area and the Picacho recreation area on the 
Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it is three-digit hot during the summer at Salton Sea, but other hot 
weather recreation spots in California are doing fine. And it was just as hot 
in the days when Salton Sea State Recreation Area had 1,500 camping spots and 
could have used more. 
</P>
<P>
 Miki Jensen has been at Salton Sea for the parks agency for 16 years in 
several jobs. She remembers the boom years, when lines of cars streamed down 
California 111 from Riverside, Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, the place was so loaded with people you could hardly stand it," 
she said wistfully. "It was great. To see it now, just sitting here, really 
upsets me." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest drop in usage came the year state health inspectors posted signs 
warning that pregnant women and young children should beware of eating too much 
fish from the Salton Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by a story on CBS' "60 Minutes" that branded the New River 
the most polluted river in America. Scientists say most of the river's nasty 
brew has been neutralized by the natural forces of flow and turbulence by the 
time it reaches the Salton Sea, but that is a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The news stories of late have dealt with the die-off of a small bird called 
the eared grebe. As part of the Pacific Flyway, the Salton Sea and its marshes 
host millions of birds from an estimated 350 species on their migratory paths. 
</P>
<P>
 From mid-February to mid-April an estimated 20,000 grebes died in the southern 
portion of the sea. Two years earlier, a similar die-off claimed 250,000 
grebes. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists did extensive 
necropsies but could not pinpoint a cause. One theory holds that it was not the 
Salton Sea that killed the grebes but something they picked up along their 
migratory path, possibly in the Sea of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Salton Sea is in need of good news, possibly it will come today in 
Brawley when the year-old Salton Sea Authority hears a set of recommendations 
from consultant Pete Dangermond, former director of the state park system. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangermond says he has found a way to reduce salinity by creating salt brine 
ponds at one corner of the sea to produce energy. Salinity, which can kill fish 
and birds, comes from agricultural runoff and natural leeching from the salt 
sink at the bottom of the sea. Salton Sea is 15% saltier than the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangermond also thinks it is possible to stabilize the level of the sea. In 
the past, rising levels have wiped out beachfront businesses, and consumed 
several hundred camping spots. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time, Dangermond said, to think of the Salton Sea as a prospect, not a 
suspect. "It's an unused resource that deserves a better rap," he said.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; IN THE SIMPSON DRAMA, NO WITNESS IS A MINOR PLAYER ON 
THE STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If O.J. Simpson were just another accused double murderer, Allan Park would 
have been just another routine witness for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, there's no such thing as a routine witness. Every bit of 
testimony is magnified by the presence of the insistent mass of media, by the 
relentless television cameras and the insatiable appetite of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Every witness becomes a featured player, the focus of close-ups that 
exaggerate nervous glances, dry lips, hesitations and minor memory failures. 
These perfectly normal occurrences, common in all our lives, have become the 
subject of instant analysis by journalists, lawyer-commentators and the 
millions watching on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ordinary preliminary hearing, the testimony of limousine driver Park 
would have been just one of several building blocks in the prosecution's effort 
to establish a timetable for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The average preliminary hearing, if it were covered at all, would merit just a 
short story. Park might have been worth a mention, along with the prosecution 
witness who followed him, Brian (Kato) Kaelin, who lived in Simpson's guest 
house and who also bolstered the prosecution's contention that Simpson was not 
home when the killings were apparently carried out in front of his ex-wife's 
nearby condo. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy D.A. Marcia Clark, who has handled many low-profile preliminaries, is 
experienced enough to understand the changed circumstances. That's why 
attorneys in a hearing such as this one don't put witnesses on the stand unless 
they're well coached. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Park looks like the kind of limo driver you could trust to drive an 
important client around town or to meet the company president at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Tuesday, he told his story simply and wasn't shaken under defense 
attorney Robert L. Shapiro's cross-examination. And, in addition to the details 
of his time with Simpson the night of the murders, we learned something about 
his character. 
</P>
<P>
 When Park talked to someone about the Simpson case, for example, it was with 
his mom and his boss -- not a free-spending supermarket tabloid. That meant 
stability. So did his going home for a snack when he had time to kill between 
driving jobs that fatal night. Punctuality seems important to him. He said he 
checks his watch frequently and compares it to clocks he encounters during the 
day. He said he arrived early to pick up Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched Park on television, I thought his appearance was perfect for our 
system of media justice. I wondered how it happened. The man is a limo driver, 
not an actor. How did prosecutor Clark make sure he was such an asset for her 
side? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the prosecutor had time, I doubted whether she'd share such 
information. So I called up a couple of criminal defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the process of witness preparation is common sense. Lawyers tell 
witnesses the questions they'll ask and prepare them for the kind of grilling 
they can expect from the opposition. Keep the testimony simple, the witnesses 
are told. If you can't remember, say so. It's not a big deal if you don't 
remember whether someone was wearing green or blue socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to be sure they recall what they saw and heard," said Los Angeles 
attorney Angela Oh. "You want them to be truthful, but sometimes you want them 
to be circumspect." In that case, she said, you tell them "just answer the 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lawyer told me that the live televising of Park's appearance presented 
the prosecution with additional problems. "You want to make sure he is not 
responding to the media," he said. "You want to make sure he goes through his 
chronology of events and not try to embellish anything. There is a tendency for 
someone like that, who's just a limo driver, to think this is his five minutes 
of fame. You want to get him out of that posture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes of fame. Some people love it. Others wilt under the glare. 
Whatever the reaction, the possibility of fame or embarrassment has changed the 
process of preparing witnesses, made it more important, extending the process 
beyond the courtroom, perhaps changing the dynamics of the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses have been coached probably as long as there have been trials. Anyone 
who's been in a lawsuit or had the misfortune to be a crime victim or witness 
knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 If this had been just another murder case, the prosecutor would have sat down 
with Allan Park and rehearsed his story. Park would have been shown diagrams of 
the crime scene and would have marked them confidently, as he did in court 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he had made a mistake, if his memory had slipped, if he had become 
confused over the location of the Simpson garage, nobody would have noticed 
except a few people in court. It would have made no difference in determining 
the outcome of the case. Judges don't usually decide the outcomes of 
preliminary hearings based on minor mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Simpson case, the principals are not just playing to the judge and 
a small courtroom audience. They all understand that the vast television 
audience likely includes a dozen or so potential jurors and alternates who may 
encounter Allan Park in a court one day, should a full trial take place. Both 
sides are already are shaping his image. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the importance of a routine witness is exaggerated and the criminal 
justice system is distorted.

SILENCE IS RULE OF THE ROAD FOR LIMO DRIVERS; CHAUFFEURS: VETERANS SAY THEY DO 
HEAR INTIMATE DETAILS OF CELEBRITY LIVES, AND TABLOID BUCKS CAN BE TEMPTING. 
BUT THEIR CLIENTS EXPECT CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Along with the privilege of serving the Celebrated Classes in Los Angeles 
comes the obligation: the code of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever goes on in the hairdresser's chair, the plastic surgeon's office, on 
the shrink's couch -- or in the back of a limo -- it is supposed to stay there. 
Under celebrity rules, it might as well be taking place in the confessional. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are sworn to discretion. Hairdressers may thrive or die on protecting 
famous clients' follicle count and root color. And limo drivers, who work in a 
world where they come to know the difference between a Gucci garment bag and a 
Louis Vuitton, even though they can't afford either one. 
</P>
<P>
 From the stars they ferry at 3 a.m. for network news shows, to the marquee 
names they collect from 3 a.m. parties, what happens behind the glass partition 
on those long, silent drives is supposed to stay silent -- even against the 
temptation of wads of tabloid bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a young limo driver named Allan Park -- a Kenneth Branagh 
look-alike, in casting director terms -- took the stand in the O.J. Simpson 
preliminary hearing. The things he testified to in court were the things he had 
been offered bales of cash to reveal weeks ago. He'd turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allan has been so terrific" in the clamorous bidding wars, said his boss, 
Dale St. John, owner of Town & Country Limousine in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John said that when the tabloids came knocking, Park asked: "What should 
we do?" "I said, 'Alan, if you want to go to the tabloids, that's a decision 
you can make on your own.' My personal feeling on this was, I just don't want 
to do it -- it just wasn't because of the business factor, it was a personal 
ethical thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some limo companies make it a condition of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 14 years we have never dropped a dime on anybody," boasts Rick Granard, 
vice president of operations for Fleetwood, one of the elite services in a city 
with three Yellow Pages of limo listings. "We've had 500-dollar bills, 
thousand-dollar bills waved in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "A chauffeur is a rabbi, a priest, a confidant, a banker, a psychiatrist, a 
consultant, everything in one," said Granard, who once fired a driver who was 
just too chatty. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before the Simpson case, Fleetwood's owner, Alan Shanedling, sent a 
memo to his employees as a reminder: "Please keep your mouth shut both in and 
out of the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 So who are these limo drivers quoted so liberally and anonymously in the 
tabloids? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of flakes, drivers in the business a short time, guys with ponytails or 
earrings who think it's cool to get in back with the client and smoke a joint 
-- they want to talk," Granard said. "They want to be actors, producers. 
They're not professional drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a few limo drivers waited in their big, clean cars idling in the 
limo rendezvous at the edge of a runway at Los Angeles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps 200 yards away, dozens of cabbies schmoozed and joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But the limo drivers, the elite, sat, solitary, each in his own car, doing 
paperwork, reading, with the air conditioning set at "glacial," waiting to meet 
the next CEO or sports star at the airline gate. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver, who offered only the name Alex, watched on the little TV in his 
stretch limo as Bulgaria beat Mexico in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest," he said, not taking his eyes off the color set, "100 grand is 
not gonna do you much good. First of all, you're gonna lose your job" for 
squealing to the tabs "and what can you buy for 100 grand?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Limo, it's a job you keep quiet. You do hear what they say. I just keep it 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest ethical dilemma is when to return a history book one client left 
behind; he began reading almost by accident and now he can't put the thing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran driver whose colleague chauffeured people to Nicole Brown 
Simpson's funeral says his firm requires drivers to sign a pledge that they 
will not divulge anything. Still, he said wistfully, "I can't believe it if 
that guy (Park) turned down (a reported) $50,000. For $50,000 I could take off 
for a year," and after that, "there's 50 limo companies in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time someone quotes an unnamed "limo driver," that's a blow to his 
business, Granard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One driver for a large company in L.A. opened his own service . . . and he 
went on Montel Williams or 'Geraldo' and started talking about clients! How 
Diana Ross was, how this one was, I couldn't believe it. It's nobody's 
business. They pay for that confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen years ago, one of St. John's drivers had someone in his car who 
asked the driver, "is so-and-so in town?" -- some famous name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver answered point-blank, yes." It was the celebrity's publicist, and 
she was furious; "She said, 'Why in the world would you tell me that? It's 
supposed to be a secret?' " 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson has been a client of Town & Country for more than four years, and 
St. John was offered big money to talk. Even his neighbors were offered cash 
for scraps of information. When St. John refused, one tabloid made up quotes 
from him anyway, he said, and a reputable national magazine said he had talked 
to a TV tabloid show. His lawyer, he said, is dealing with that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's human nature for drivers to talk among themselves -- what client is a 
nice guy, who isn't. Out at LAX, one driver remembered that another had 
chauffeured Simpson and a second former football player some time ago, "and 
they were talking about (Simpson's) wife, about getting back together." 
</P>
<P>
 But to sell such tidbits?

 Gene Marquart was applying a whisk broom to the velour rear seat of his white

 Marquart began Allegro Limousine two years ago.

 "I think most of us know our position: Keep your necktie tightened, and your 
hair combed." And not spill the beans, even for, say, $50,000?

 "I just wouldn't do that. I'm not a prostitute."

 A little smile danced briefly across his face. "But I'd like to have a chance

TUESDAY'S WITNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a summary of Tuesday's testimony in the O.J. Simpson preliminary 
hearing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allan Park, limousine driver. Testified that Simpson did not respond to a 
buzzer when the driver first arrived to take him to the airport.Just before 11 
p.m., Park said he saw a shadowy figure dart across the lawn and into Simpson's 
house. Moments later, the buzzer was finally answered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brian (Kato) Kaelin, writer and actor who lived in a guest house on 
Simpson's property. Said he was with Simpson until shortly before 10 p.m., but 
did not see him again until almost 11 p.m. About 10:40 p.m., Kaelin said, he 
heard thumping sounds outside his window, where a bloodstained glove later was 
recovered. Also said Simpson told him on the afternoon of the murders that he 
and Nicole Brown Simpson were never going to reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rachel Ferrara, friend of Kaelin. Said she was on the phone with Kaelin when 
he heard the thumping sounds. She too put the time at roughly 10:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one of two lead investigators in the case. 
Testified briefly that when he arrived at Simpson's home, he learned that 
Kaelin lived on the property but did not discover until later that he was a 
guest, as opposed to a renter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detective Mark Fuhrman, the first investigator assigned to Simpson case. 
Said he jumped the fence to enter Simpson's property only after spotting what 
he believed to be blood on a car parked outside, noting the unusual way in 
which the car was parked and other signs that led him to believe there might be 
more victims in Simpson's home.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; UNRESOLVED ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell has not yet revealed the 
contents of the bulky yellow envelope that Simpson's attorneys turned over last 
week. And court recessed Tuesday without a decision on the defense motion to 
suppress evidence seized during a search of Simpson's home after the 
killing.Discussion of the motion is expected to lead off today's hearing. MOVIE 
PLANS 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian television station plans to broadcast an O.J. Simpson movie 
marathon next week. Toronto-based CITY-TV plans to show six hours of films in 
which Simpson had supporting roles. CITY-TV said it will screen "The Naked 
Gun," "The Towering Inferno" and "Capricorn One." The programming choice has 
been criticized by a group that monitors violence in the media. VOICE

 "I said, 'We got . . . an emergency. We got a problem. We don't know if we 
have people inside that are in danger, dying, bleeding to death. We have to do 
something. I don't care whose house this is. We have to do something."

PLO OPPONENTS BIDE THEIR TIME, WAITING FOR CHAIRMAN TO FAIL; AUTONOMY: LEADERS 
OF HAMAS SEE NO POINT IN BEING NAYSAYERS DURING ARAFAT'S VISIT. THEY TRUST THAT 
ECONOMIC REALITIES WILL SOON ERODE HIS SUPPORT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the crudely lettered block walls here, spray-painted with a reflection of 
the turmoil in this city, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas has weighed in 
with uncharacteristic sweetness, calling for "the unity of the Palestinian 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 What else to do, when crowds were giving Yasser Arafat, the Palestine 
Liberation Organization chairman, an enthusiastic send-off Tuesday after his 
four-day visit, the first to his homeland in 27 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, bitterly opposed to the autonomy agreement Arafat signed with Israel, 
has put up no posters mocking the PLO leader. It mounted no demonstrations 
against his return. Hamas leaders -- off the streets and parked instead in 
their offices, charity organizations and mosques -- are biding their time and 
waiting for Arafat to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to stand in front of these emotional crowds who are 
welcoming Arafat, because some people like him. But at the same time, we will 
not let anybody say that we quit or stood aside. We are keeping silent, because 
we know this agreement will fail," said Mohsen abu Ayta, a Hamas leader in 
Gaza. "We must let the people enjoy these emotional times. Let us bide our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas is keenly aware of the dilemma Arafat faced in returning relatively 
empty-handed to the Palestinian autonomous zones. The PLO chairman had delayed 
his return for weeks. He had hoped to negotiate to have cash on hand from $42 
million in commitments to support the new Palestinian areas; he wanted to 
negotiate with the Israelis some dramatic breakthrough, such as the release of 
more Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day before his Gaza debut Friday, neighborhoods here were abuzz with 
rumors that Arafat would produce a stunning "surprise" that would make his 
return memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even speculated that he would perform a miracle, that he might somehow 
raise from the dead Abu Jihad, the deputy PLO leader and activist in the 
intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation; Jihad, also 
known as Khalil Wazir, was killed by Israeli commandos on April 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here hoped that Arafat might announce that Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed 
Yassin would be released from prison on the day of the PLO leader's return. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Arafat's welcoming speech in Gaza, and the ones that followed it in 
the next three days, apologized that the peace agreement was not better than it 
was. He fumed at the World Bank for holding up financial aid, he demanded in 
futile fashion that Sheik Yassin be released and he called on Palestinians to 
begin relying on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Though tens of thousands warmly welcomed him, part of the crowd began walking 
out of Gaza's Parliament Square on Friday in the middle of Arafat's speech. In 
interviews, most Palestinians were delirious about his return, but some were 
troubled that he brought nothing with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody now is wondering, why did he come? Why didn't he wait until he had 
something to tell us?" said a supporter of Arafat's Fatah organization. "All he 
told us about were the problems. It's like a group of sick patients waiting for 
the doctor, and finally the doctor comes and says, 'You are very sick.' We 
already know that! We don't need to be told! 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thought that when Arafat came back, he would bring us a surprise, 
some solution," the young man went on. "OK, there are 20 terrible problems. 
Tell us you can fix even five of them or six of them. But what does he bring? 
Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hani Abed, an Islamic Jihad supporter whose recent arrest by Palestinian 
police spawned one of the first crises of the new Palestinian administration, 
said the Jihad organization is, like Hamas, waiting out the current euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "The happy period is gone now, with Arafat's return," Abed said. "Now the 
people have to face the reality of what will the Palestinian Authority do for 
the people. It's not logical now to express our opposition to it. With the 
people wanting to see Arafat, we can do nothing now. But look at what happened 
when he came. The first couple of words, and many people left." 
</P>
<P>
 Economics alone, Arafat's opposition calculates, will have the fledgling 
Palestinian Authority in trouble soon. "The average policeman's salary is $500 
to $600 a month. The rent for an apartment here is $500. How is the policeman 
going to pay for his apartment? This is the issue," Abed said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps a measure of the urgency with which the PLO leadership sees the 
need to begin attacking problems that Arafat has decided to take up permanent 
residence in Gaza as early as Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stymied for weeks because all PLO decision-making comes straight from the top, 
PLO officials hope that Arafat will begin to remove roadblocks to setting up 
functioning government institutions and departments. And they claim to be 
unconcerned about the political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was betting that there would be clashes between Fatah and Hamas, and 
all of the bets were wrong," said Gaza Fatah spokesman Diab Nemer Allouh. "We 
are here in one unit, united for the benefit of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 While not accepting any participation in the new Palestinian Authority, Hamas 
has struck a tentative alliance of sorts with the police, allowing them to go 
after alleged Israeli collaborators instead of assassinating them themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But much will depend on the future of several suspects now believed to be in 
custody for the killing of a Hamas activist. Hamas leaders, who believe the man 
was killed by relatives of Israeli collaborators, say they are waiting to see 
if the suspects will be judged and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, meanwhile, is quietly waiting until the first Palestinian elections, 
tentatively set for October, when it can begin capitalizing on the shortcomings 
of the autonomy plan. By then, Ayta said, Palestinians will be only too aware 
of the reality of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of the agreement as a very nice meal," he said. "Nice and tasty, good 
smell. But inside, it's full of poison. When the people eat this meal, they are 
going to get a very big stomachache."

2ND DAY OF RAIN SOAKS GEORGIA; 6 DIE IN FLOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto unloaded rain on Georgia for the second 
straight day Tuesday, forcing hundreds from their homes. Six deaths were blamed 
on the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dumped up to a foot or more of rain on the north and central parts 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just south of Atlanta, some residents had to be evacuated by boat. A man 
trying to walk back to his Clayton County home fell into a large water-filled 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden there was no road," Harold Bailey said after a firefighter 
pulled him to safety. "I was grabbing for the asphalt with one hand and 
grabbing my umbrella with the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Bibb County authorities said three people died when the swollen Rocky Creek 
swept away their pickup and pinned it under a bridge abutment Tuesday night. 
Their identities were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Dixon, 16, of Rockdale County drowned Tuesday afternoon after she was 
swept away while walking her dog, authorities said. And Teresa Beyah, 31, was 
killed Tuesday when she lost control of her car at a flooded intersection in 
Spalding County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Shriver, 40, of Fayette County died Tuesday when he dived into Line Creek 
to tie a rope to a bridge to keep it from being pulled away, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudslides were reported in several areas, and the dam of the Lamar County 
reservoir broke, forcing the evacuation of residents downstream.

USAIR CREW DID NOT HEAR TOWER'S WIND-SHEAR ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The captain and first officer who survived the crash of a USAir flight told 
investigators on Tuesday that they tried to avoid storm pockets as they landed 
the plane and did not hear an on-board alarm warning of a dangerous wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Michael R. Greenlee and First Officer James Hayes were "cooperative and 
very helpful" in separate interviews with National Transportation Safety Board 
investigators, said John Hammerschmidt, an NTSB board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerschmidt related the pilots' descriptions of the last few moments of 
Saturday's Flight 1016 from Columbia, S.C. The crash killed 37 of the 57 people 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots said they noticed a concentration of storms to the south and east 
of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport as they descended toward landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They agreed they would turn right, which is west, to stay away from those 
cells," Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 While still two miles from the airport, the DC-9 passed through rain that 
quickly turned violent. The air traffic controller announced a wind-shear 
alert. The captain decided to abort the landing when the plane was just 200 
feet off the runway, a maneuver called a "go-around." 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew did a go-around . . . because of the heavy rain, a possible wet 
runway, the lack of visibility and the wind reports," Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots said Hayes gave the engines maximum power, turned right and turned 
the nose up. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane climbed to 350 feet, but the pilots "felt a severe sink rate," which 
would be expected if they encountered a wind shear, Hammerschmidt said. Wind 
shear is a sudden shift in wind speed and direction due to a rapid downward 
rush of cooled air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither pilot recalled hearing the on-board wind-shear alert activated." 
Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower warned the pilots of the possibility of a wind shear less than two 
minutes before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee and Hayes were released from a hospital Monday. Fourteen people 
remained hospitalized.

SPLIT HULL OF A GIANT ORE CARRIER STUDIED ON LAKE SUPERIOR'S FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Edmund Fitzgerald's mangled carcass juts like a mountain from the flat, 
barren Lake Superior floor, rising as abruptly as the ship plunged to its doom 
19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The stricken giant's two main sections lie 180 feet apart at a depth of 530 
feet, tons of taconite ore pellets from the cargo hold strewn between them.The 
windows of the pilot house are gone, blown away by the rush of water. The 
crow's nest is surprisingly intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes were visible Tuesday from the miniature submarine Clelia as 
scientists and marine historians concluded a three-day mission to probe the 
mystery of the Fitzgerald's sinking on Nov. 10, 1975. All 29 crew members died. 
No distress signal was sent. 
</P>
<P>
 The explorers, led by Canadian marine scientist Joe MacInnis, conducted the 
first extensive manned survey of the wreckage. Colleagues of Jacques Cousteau 
made brief dives in 1980, and robots have photographed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The explorers concluded that the Fitzgerald did not break up on the water's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the bow shows the 729-foot long ship probably hurtled downward with 
missile-like speed. Propelled by its 7,500-horsepower engines and its 
26,000-ton ore cargo, the vessel reached the bottom in seconds and was smashed 
to pieces, said Tom Farnquist, director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most common theories are that the ship took on water as 30-foot seas 
crashed over its side and finally nose-dived under a monster wave; or that it 
hit a poorly charted shoal, tearing a gash in the hull hours before the 
sinking.

TRENDS; A REVERSAL OF FORTUNE: PREDATORS GOING FROM TARGETS TO ICONS; SOME SEE 
THE REINTRODUCTION OF ANIMALS OF PREY AS PART OF AMERICANS' CHANGE IN VALUES. 
BUT OTHERS SAY THAT ENDING THE EXTERMINATION IS ONLY MOMENTARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1639, European settler John Clarke peered into the dark forests of North 
America and observed, "The life of the wolf is the death of the lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 For about 350 years afterward -- just as for countless millennia preceding -- 
this logic drove homesteaders to vanquish the wolf, the bear and other large 
predators. And in most places they did a pretty thorough job of it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is one of the improbable curiosities of this Virtual Age that Americans 
now seem bent on reconciling themselves with these ancient rivals. Across the 
country, Americans are trying to find room to let big predators roam, offering 
them unique legal protection and, increasingly, reintroducing predators into 
old lairs where they were exterminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is only a momentary pause, and soon Americans will resume their 
quest to tame every square foot of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, as some believe, a transformation of values is occurring in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a culture of symbols," says Renee Askins, executive director of the 
Wolf Fund in Moose, Wyo. "The wolf and the other predators have become symbols 
for a slow and difficult process: Man is confronting his ancient world view of 
dominion. It is a deep struggle, a way of facing the mistakes of our past. For 
most people, it is occurring at the subconscious or subliminal level. But it is 
occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is at play is an old way of thinking in which we strived to control 
everything, and a new, reciprocal relationship with the natural world." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many of the causes that make the newspaper headlines are about money, 
power, lawlessness in the cities, the whiz-bang of the future. The return of 
predators is the contrary: Human altruism, the relinquishing of power, the 
return of nature's laws to the outdoors and nostalgia for the timeless howl of 
the wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, in the most profound step yet, the Clinton Administration gave 
the go-ahead to reintroduce the gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park. The 
federal government is also studying reintroduction of the grizzly bear to North 
Cascades National Park in Washington state and into the Bitterroot-Selway 
Mountains of Idaho. Two years ago, the red wolf was reintroduced into the 
Appalachian highlands. Mexican wolves are being reared for reintroduction into 
the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since four zoo-reared gray wolves were released on Isle Royale in Lake 
Superior 40 years ago have there been such scenes in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Several states have acted to protect their existing predators. California 
voters outlawed sport hunting of mountain lions in 1990. In 1992, Colorado 
restricted bear hunts. Oregon voters face a ballot measure this November to 
restrict cougar and bear hunts. Public pressure stopped grizzly bear hunting in 
Montana in 1991 and Florida has now ended its bear hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Why predators? Why, of all times, now? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe because the frontiers are finally all but gone and America's fabled 
self-belief in its frontier spirit is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people who have pondered these questions are the husband and wife team of 
Pat Tucker and Bruce Weide of Missoula, Mont. She is a biologist and he is a 
filmmaker and story teller, and together they form a homespun organization 
called Wild Sentry. 
</P>
<P>
 They have custody of a full-grown, captive-bred wolf, Koani. A black-coated 
female, Koani is not a pet but an "ambassador wolf" that Tucker and Weide 
transport to schools and other audiences around the West. Their purpose is to 
demystify and destigmatize the wild wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wolves? In a word, wildness," Weide says. "You can save whales and baby 
seals, and you've saved animals. But if you save wolves, you've saved wildness. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of thinking they can control everything. They don't want to 
live in the world but they want it to be there -- we hear it time and again, it 
gives people satisfaction to know there's something out there free from human 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Tucker, "This must be imprinted deep in our brains because there are a 
lot of people who connect with the wild but have no experience with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others speak similarly of grizzly bears and mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Peacock, iconoclastic outdoorsman and champion of the grizzly, says there 
is self-interest involved. "What this is about, the real reason, is humility -- 
these creatures keep us humble." 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen or more organizations around the nation are actively engaged on behalf 
of big predators. Some, like the Great Bear Foundation in Missoula, offer cash 
payments to ranchers who lose livestock to grizzly bear attacks. Others, like 
Wolf Haven, in Tenino, Wash., provide shelter for captive animals and breeding 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, their impact has amazed even those who are in the business of saving 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The degree of change in public perception is more marked for predators than 
for any other species -- going from a policy of extermination toward one of 
protection," says Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, this newfound fancy for predators is opposed primarily by ranchers. 
But as populations of bears and wolves and lions expand, old conflicts over 
territory surely will test public fortitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lion attacks in Western states are making news, including the mauling 
death in April of a 40-year-old woman in the Sierra Nevada foothills of 
California. The lion subsequently was hunted and killed. Considerable social 
reflection occurred when public donations for the woman's two children lagged 
behind contributions for the lion's surviving cub. 
</P>
<P>
 And even some die-hard wilderness aficionados say there is reason to worry. 
Ira Spring of Seattle took his first backpacking trip in 1928 and has since 
written seminal hiking guides to the Pacific Northwest. And he has become an 
outspoken opponent of reintroducing the grizzly bear to the Cascade Mountains 
of northern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it's about access. We're already overcrowding our wilderness with 
people. Grizzly bears don't like people, they don't even like each other. So 
how are they going to obtain people-free areas needed for grizzly bears? The 
only way I can think of is by drastically cutting down the number of people who 
have access to the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Americans may have to decide if predators are worth real sacrifice. Or 
are they just another modern fad? Beast of Prey 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spent three centuries vanquishing large predators. Now many are 
trying to find room to let the animals roam. 
</P>
<P>
 WOLVES 
</P>
<P>
 Status: About 2,000 individuals in the lower 48 states, both red and gray 
variety. Found mostly in Minnesota. Alaskan game officials estimate 5,000 to 
7,000 gray wolves there. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Before organized wolf extermination campaigns of the 19th and 20th 
centuries, wolves lived in nearly every region of North America north of Mexico 
City. Experts say wolves could have easily numbered in the hundreds of 
thousands, perhaps millions. 
</P>
<P>
 GRIZZLY BEARS 
</P>
<P>
 Status: Approx. 1,000 in lower 48, concentrated in Montana and Yellowstone 
National Park. Called the brown bear in Alaska, there are an estimated 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: There were an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears in the lower 48 
states at the start of the 19th Century. In California, once the Bear Flag 
Republic, the last known California grizzly was killed in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 MOUNTAIN LION 
</P>
<P>
 Status: A solitary, elusive animal difficult to monitor. Not an endangered 
species, so there is no estimate of current U.S. population. Some experts say 
possibly 20,000 in western states. Perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 in California alone, 
according to state wildlife managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: From 1907 to 1963, state of California paid bounties on over 
12,000 mountain lions carcasses.

RWANDA REBELS PLAN GOVERNMENT, REPORTEDLY OK PACT WITH FRENCH

 Rwanda's rebel commander said Tuesday that his Rwandan Patriotic Front will 
form a government within days, to be followed by a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 French officers said France had won an endorsement from the rebels for a 
limited "humanitarian security zone" in southwestern Rwanda.The tentative 
agreement appeared to avert any immediate risk of a clash with the Tutsi-led 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had disputed a broader French deployment, saying it would have 
effectively protected the retreating forces of the Hutu-declared interim 
Rwandan government. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.N. headquarters in New York, the rebels said they will ask for Rwanda's 
U.N. seat as soon as the new government is named. Faustin Twagiramungu, a 
moderate Hutu who was appointed prime minister last year under an aborted peace 
agreement, will be the new government's prime minister, said Claude Dusaidi, an 
envoy to the United Nations for the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital, Kigali, which the rebels took Monday, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame 
said the government would include many people from opposition parties and would 
be guided by the principles of last year's aborted multiparty peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees crowded Gikongoro on Tuesday. French troops found three new camps in 
the area, raising the number of refugees there to 300,000.

 Less than two months after it came to power, South Africa's new democratic 
coalition government lost its most important link to the business community 
Tuesday with the surprise resignation of Finance Minister Derek Keys, who cited 
unspecified personal reasons for stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Tuesday night, President Nelson Mandela announced that 
Keys would be replaced by another prominent business figure, Chris Liebenberg, 
former head of the banking conglomerate Nedcor.

U.S., ALLIES OK BOSNIA PEACE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, Russia and three European powers issued an ultimatum 
Tuesday to the warring factions in Bosnia: Agree to a new peace package or face 
international reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 The five nations' foreign ministers approved a plan to give the new 
Bosnian-Croat federation roughly 51% of Bosnia's territory and the Serbs 
49%.The Serbs now hold about 70% and are seen as the most likely to reject the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a mistake of truly historic proportions for either party to feel 
they can serve their people well if they reject the proposal," Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said after the three-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev described the plan as "the only 
possible alternative" to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, who hosted the meeting for the envoys from the United States, Russia, 
Germany, France and Britain, said the Croat-Muslim federation and the Bosnian 
Serbs will have two weeks to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers aimed their ultimatum primarily at the Serbs, who would have to 
give up land they consider strategically important. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said U.N. sanctions against the Serbs will be gradually lifted if 
they withdraw to the areas designated under the proposal. Otherwise, 
enforcement of the sanctions will be tightened.

 CHILD CARE CENTERS: The Times incorrectly reported on June 29 Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick's position involving child care centers. Chick plans 
to present a motion this week urging creation of guidelines to help determine 
whether child care facilities should be allowed in single-family homes. The 
councilwoman, however, contends she has no intention of eliminating the public 
hearing process currently required when a child-care facility exceeds 12 
children.
