A CLOSED BOOK; THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY MAY TALK A GOOD MULTICULTURAL GAME, BUT 
IT STILL DOESN'T HIRE PEOPLE OF COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER MOSLEY, Walter Mosley's most recent novel, Black Betty, will be 
published in June. He is chairman of PEN's Open Book committee, which is 
seeking to create a multicultural mainstream press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most liberal thinking people racism is easy to identify; it is negative 
prejudice against groups and individuals, that prejudice being based on 
appearances -- appearances and lies. 
</P>
<P>
 Racists are just as easily identified from this point of view. They are often 
unkempt, anti-social, epithet-wielding oafs who -- due to poverty, 
conservatism, or psychosis -- hate without reason. They are shaved-skulled, 
swastika-bearing, red-necked . . . well, you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Racism and racists are other in the liberal's world. They are southern or 
rural or, maybe, corporate. They represent the old guard, our parents' deluded 
generation. They read Rush Limbaugh if they read at all. 
</P>
<P>
 An intelligent and liberal-minded American would tell you, sadly, that racism 
is alive and well in this country, that the police, the conservative 
politicians, and the economically hard hit working classes are rife with 
irrational hatreds. And it isn't only the African Americans that suffer under 
these prejudices. Latinos, Gays, Asians, women of all races, and Native 
Americans are also victims. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bad scene out there. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we find so many of our intelligent people attracted to education 
and the arts, where a powerful liberal base tolerates, even promotes, 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds and races are welcomed into the college community. Art's subject is 
all the world and not just the white man and his property. And literature . . . 
literature delves into every experience and background. Nothing is taboo in 
books. Writers from all backgrounds are welcomed to contribute their words, 
their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in the higher world of art and education we have made strides against 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what everybody would like to believe. That's what I would like 
to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But I know that it isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the subtle racism of colleges and schools. I know the painfully white 
makeup of the art world. But most of all I know how exclusively white the 
mainstream publishing world is. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that American publishing, the very bastion of liberalism, the 
benefactor of the First Amendment, has kept any hint of color from its halls. 
</P>
<P>
 This fact struck home for me a few months ago when I was honored with the task 
of being the keynote speaker at the Assn. of American Publishers' annual 
meeting in Puerto Rico. I gave my speech and stayed a few days in the luxury of 
the resort hotel. I came down to talk about the Information Highway and then to 
relax on the beach. But I also wanted to see what the CEOs of mainstream 
American publishing were thinking, so I attended a few seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these seminars was presented by a demographics expert who explained 
that the only American growth populations at the beginning of the 21st Century 
will be nonwhite peoples (mainly Asian and Latino). When he said that I looked 
back at the crowd of some 200 publishers. These publishers ranged from mighty 
Random House to small college presses. 
</P>
<P>
 All I saw were white faces. There was only one black publisher present. There 
were no Latino or Asian publishers that I saw. The future of American culture 
was on the screen behind me but the power of that culture was tightly in the 
grip of Caucasian hands. 
</P>
<P>
 That evoked thoughts of all the white publishers I'd seen and talked to over 
the past five years. All the white editors and publicists and rights 
specialists. Almost all positions of power are held by white people in American 
publishing, not one of them sporting a swastika. Many publishing houses have no 
editors other than white ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, it is true, have their tokens. These tokens are almost always African 
Americans who stand out at company parties because they're the only one there 
(at least the only one outside of the mail room and the secretarial pool). 
</P>
<P>
 When I talk to publishers and editors about this problem they smile 
apologetically and say: "But you know, Walter, entry level positions are lowly 
paid and any minority who is good enough for this job can find better money 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 I try to mention that there are black, Latino and Asian publishing houses (not 
in the mainstream) that have advanced editors who might be persuaded to try 
their hand in one of the major houses. I say that there is a long tradition for 
American publishing houses to take potential editors (and publishers) from 
business and universities. I say that there are nonwhite people in America who 
don't have money as a bottom line and would take a lower salary to be involved 
with the all-important publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They always listen to me. They always nod and open their eyes a little as if I 
were opening new vistas. Then they say: "We have to discuss these ideas more." 
</P>
<P>
 But we never do. We never do because of a passive kind of liberal racism. The 
kind of racism where you stick to your own kind without hating those who are 
different. Why hate them? You don't have to work with them. They don't have any 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 This brand of racism isn't coarse or violent. The perpetrators haven't the 
slightest animosity. Maybe there's a Puerto Rican or black married to one of 
their kids. They probably had dinner with Nelson Mandela or Jesse Jackson. 
(They may have even published one of their books.) These racists actually 
support the rainbow -- as long as the sun don't shine on the musty halls of 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, in the publishing world people most often come to a job because they 
know somebody or because they are known. You ask around when you're trying to 
fill a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you ask? You ask the people you're working with. They have friends who 
are clamoring for these positions that, I'm told, intelligent black people 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors of publishing are closed to multicultural America. I'm told that I 
have no reason to complain because the doors aren't locked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can knock." 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't know when to knock. And when they do get in they are often 
alienated because no one else got in, ever. Inside this world you would think 
that America is only one culture. A culture that is of white European descent. 
The rich history that boils in our language from Asian, Latino and African 
roots is deciphered or, most often, ignored by the publishing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying here that nonwhite editors should be hired to edit nonwhite 
books. I'm saying that the editors from every different background should be 
editing any book that lands before them and strikes their fancy. Because we 
have all created the language together; we should all be helping that language 
into books. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm saying mainstream publishing in America has to take its doors off the 
hinges and let a fresh wind blow through their halls. Because America is going 
grow whether we're ready for it or not.

RICHARD EDER: THE LAW OF THE LAND; WHITE MAN'S GRAVE, BY RICHARD DOOLING 
(FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $22; 386 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Dooling is a traveler in two drastically different territories: the 
law he practices today in Nebraska, and the folkways of the Mende people in the 
backlands of Sierra Leone, where he once stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his sardonic and decidedly untidy novel, "White Man's Grave," he pits the 
tribal magic of each against the other. There is no question who wins. Dooling 
has something of the beady, comical glitter of Evelyn Waugh -- though not his 
formal perfection -- but only in one eye. Waugh traveled in Sierra Leone and 
wrote nastily about both whites and blacks. Dooling's parody wickedly impales 
his Americans; his ingenious sympathies lie with the Mende villagers, giving 
his book an aspect beyond parody. 
</P>
<P>
 The story goes roughly like this: Randall Killigan, a maniacally hard-charging 
lawyer in Indianapolis, has a straying son, Michael, who went to Africa with 
the Peace Corps for two years, stayed for four and has disappeared. While 
Randall fulminates, mobilizes his senator and the State Department and offers 
large rewards, a second effort goes on. Boone, an artist friend of Michael's 
and a fugitive from an equivalent bull-elephant of a father, treks into the 
Sierra Leone bush. Eventually Michael turns up along with an explanation for 
his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the African part of the story, which is most of the book, concerns 
Boone's painful and illuminating encounters with a primitive village 
civilization. Painful for him, illuminating for us. The young man's artistic 
veneer quickly burns off, disclosing a hereditary, stiff-necked American prig. 
The priggishness, though, allows the author to show us what Boone refuses to 
see: how supremely and winningly, in the notion of primitive civilization, the 
noun demolishes the adjective. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooling gives us a bravura display of satire with Randall Killigan, in war 
paint and tribal regalia, as a legal chieftain whose ambition is to be "the 
synonym for bankruptcy in the Seventh Circuit." He demolishes the lawyers for 
bankrupt firms. He lays the reeking carcasses of his victims upon his 
conference-room table, apportioning bits to the rival creditors' lawyers. He is 
the most virile tiger in the jungle: the electronic notebook he carries into 
negotiating battle has twice as many bytes as anyone else's. It contains for 
instant reference the entire Federal Bankruptcy Code, annotated. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagery, of course, is purposeful as well as comic. As the search for his 
son goes on, with Boone encountering witches, shape-changers, juju medicine, 
the dumbstruck regard of young villagers and the cryptic though essentially 
benevolent maneuvering of the elders, Africa leaks into Indianapolis. Randall 
mysteriously receives a hideous, skin-wrapped package that drips blood; now and 
then it turns into a bat. For a while he wonders if he has a brain tumor; 
gradually he realizes that it is witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
 It will turn out to be self-inflicted: he, we will learn by the end, is 
possessed by a witch-spirit and has, in effect, become one. As one character 
points out, the American counterpart of voodoo is lawsuits: Both are used to 
kill, sicken or otherwise ruin ones neighbors. The Mende hire witches, we hire 
lawyers. Dooling brings off his satiric parallel, which might otherwise seem 
forced, with a wit and outrageousness that make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 His success has large holes in it, though. He can satirize his countrymen but 
he is plain awful when he attempts anything more inward with them. When Randall 
goes to Mass and Confession to try to stave off the witchery, his mental 
flailing is written in flamboyant cliche and interlarded with more cliche: 
lengthy quotations from the liturgy. Satire has sunk out of its depth to become 
the mawkish thing it satirizes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the African chapters, the author's sympathy and responsiveness produce 
writing whose humor is carried on a current of discovery and astonishment. Only 
the Americans are flat. Michael, when discovered, is simply an American 
over-achiever gone native. Boone's cultural obtuseness has a narrative 
usefulness -- it allows the delicate complexities of the villagers to emerge 
more clearly -- but it turns him into a null character. An anthropologist who 
has lived with the Mende for years and has, in effect, become one of them, is 
considerably less interesting than what he has to say. He is a good explainer 
but not much else. Oddly, the only American with any roundness or allure is a 
thoroughly reprehensible Peace Corps veteran, infinitely cynical about the 
villagers and mainly in it for the adventure and the beer. 
</P>
<P>
 He is alive, though, and authentic. And it is in evoking the life of Africa 
and in suggesting the wisdom and forbearance that underlay the "superstitions" 
of the Mende villagers that Dooling is at his best. There is, first of all, a 
vivid presentation not just of what his Africa looks, feels and smells like, 
but of the emotions of unease and beguilement they can produce. The vast 
landscape seen from the descending airplane looks like "an empire of solid 
broccoli tops stretching inland to the horizon." Boone rides a rickety truck 
into the interior; people, animals and cargo are so jammed together that the 
passengers practice a kind of metabolism-lowering trance state. 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers live in a fearful world of uncontrollable events: hunger, 
disease, the depredations of white settlers and diamond seekers, and the 
arbitrary incursions of warring political factions whose maneuvering in the 
capital is felt 200 miles down-country. Dooling portrays the rich culture that 
can evolve from powerlessness to command ones environment; as opposed to 
Western culture, which has evolved from just the opposite. From command, that 
is, or a sense of command or -- look at our cities -- an illusion of command. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion is there without being explicit. It is fleshed out in countless 
scenes in which Dooling gives life to a village that manages dignity and a 
subversive humor in the teeth of what seem to us like invincible odds. The 
witchcraft, the magical secret societies, the shamanism, the taboos are ways of 
coping with unmanageable dangers both outside and within. In his portraits -- a 
visiting witch-cleaner who runs a cotton thread around the village so nobody 
shall leave or enter until the place is cleaned; the poignantly striving third 
wife of a local political thug; and above all, the elder who adopts Boone as 
his son so that the villagers can see him as a real person, albeit an odd and 
misbehaving one -- Dooling evokes the humane checks and balances of a deep 
world; the logic, you might say, of its magic.

TELL YOUR FRIENDS; THE SERPENT'S GIFT, BY HELEN ELAINE LEE (ATHENEUM: $21; 374 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paula L. Woods, Paula L. Woods runs her own consulting firm and is the 
co-author of I, Too, Sing America: The African American Book of Days and 
co-editor of the forthcoming I Hear a Symphony: African Americans Celebrate 
Love. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a former member of corporate America who eventually turned to writing, I 
was extremely intrigued by this novel written by Washington attorney Helen 
Elaine Lee. How many people have I met, fueled by the success of John Grisham 
or Michael Crichton, who report slaving away at their portable computers trying 
to write the next "Pelican Brief" or "Disclosure"? Was Lee, I wondered, another 
one of these misguided souls who'd be better off writing legal briefs than 
literature? Should she be given that sage advice, "Honey, don't quit your day 
job"? 
</P>
<P>
 But after a marathon reading of "The Serpent's Gift" while I should have been 
enjoying the scenery on vacation, I wanted to advise Lee to start writing that 
resignation letter. For "The Serpent's Gift" marks the debut of an important 
new voice on the fictional landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there's nary a lawyer or murder weapon in sight, Lee has nevertheless 
created an emotional, suspenseful page-turner. Her terrain is the human heart; 
the first two pages of the book alone contain one of the most haunting deaths 
in recent memory. This passing deeply affects young Vesta Smalls, creating in 
her a fear of making a critical misstep, of yielding to "the power of the small 
deed to rip the sky apart, and return it to seamless blue." And as the novel 
fast-forwards to an aged Vesta, now encased in tattered scarves and surrounded 
by plastic covered furniture, you sense she's paid some terrible price for a 
misstep, an accident long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a saying that goes, "When one door closes, another opens. " For Lee's 
characters, the closing off represented by the accident and the violence 
leading up to it are a new beginning, an opening that propel the 8-year-old 
Vesta, her mother Eula and younger brother LaRue to the loving and colorful 
home of Ruby and Polaris Staples. There Eula finds a peaceful place in the 
basement in which to recede and muse on the nature of her love for Ontario 
Smalls, a love whose most visible remnant is a serpentine facial scar, which 
her rescuer and friend Ruby calls "angry healing flesh." 
</P>
<P>
 It is there that Vesta and LaRue find a sister in the Staples' daughter Ouida, 
an imaginative, confident child, and a ready-made mother in Ruby, a woman 
deeply rooted in her community who, like the African griots, is a teller of 
tales and serves her neighbors as a sort of therapist-confessor, allowing the 
stories of their lives to come to light. And while Ruby's stories, told in 
stoop-sitting sessions with the neighbors, are too uncontrolled for the rigid 
vigil Vesta must keep over her life and emotions, young LaRue is drawn to this 
other mother, absorbing stories while sitting in a rocker in Ruby's kitchen. 
These stories ignite his imagination, allowing him to create his own 
make-believe character, Miss Snake, "who got in and out of fixes each time she 
appeared, who started out with purple spots but changed each time she shed her 
skin." 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of the Miss Snake stories, as well as the later tales of 
Tennessee Coal & Iron Company Jones, are author Lee's masterstroke, completely 
rooted in the African American oral traditions of Bre'r Rabbit and Anansi the 
spider. The stories, themselves deserving of their own book, act here to 
illuminate the narrative and give it a lyrical magic that both captivate and 
enlighten the characters. In young LaRue's mouth, the stories also represent a 
connectedness to African American culture and identity that delight Ruby and 
Ouida, but dismay Vesta and Eula, who consider them "lies." For Eula and Vesta, 
the stories threaten to initiate an internal battle with secrets and dreams, 
long hidden but recurring as closed-off spaces that keep them from knowing 
peace. And until they understand the gift the Miss Snake stories have to offer, 
that peace remains elusive, just beyond their reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has written in the siblings LaRue, Vesta, Ouida and December (who appears 
near the end of Part I) a quartet of unforgettable characters whose 
personalities run counter to expectation, especially as we see African American 
men and women too often portrayed in print and broadcast media. LaRue is a 
sensitive, intuitive man with a spirit that can not be crushed; a man who, when 
recognizing his love for Olive Winters, fights against his impulse to pull 
away; a man who marks the changes in his world from after the Great War through 
the 1960s with wonder, a great love for his people and a moving grace. His 
sister, Vesta, is rigid and frightened, a woman whose retreat from the pain of 
early disappointments drains the vitality from her life. Ouida supposedly has 
everything to be desired among black folk of the time -- fair skin, vivacious 
wit, imagination -- yet she makes a radical decision to embrace an 
unconventional love. Then there is December, Ruby and Polaris' daughter, whose 
arrival at the winter equinox signals birth out of death, but who, under 
Vesta's excruciatingly restrictive love, becomes a colorless cipher of a 
Detroit housewife, more concerned with the correctness of her peanut butter 
selection than the quality of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's novel also displays an adept use of color, light and space as indicators 
of vitality, of memory, of love and loss. From the earliest image of a ripped 
blue sky, "The Serpent's Gift" is suffused with color and space, creating a 
visual tapestry of emotional depth that compelled me to turn the page while I 
simultaneously wanted to linger over every word. Images appear in unexpected 
ways: The skin of an orange that stimulates the elderly Vesta's memories; her 
youthful retreat from the tumult of color into a seemingly serene world 
represented by an all-white wardrobe and meticulously cross-stitched homilies; 
the cobalt blue lovemaking of LaRue and Olive; the blood-red moon that ushers 
in the birth of Dessie, Ruby's "late in life" child; or Ouida's retreat into 
dark spaces after a wrenching night of terror. While there are moments, like 
the ultimately unfulfilling revelation of Ruby's secret shame, in which I 
wished Lee's style were a little more restrained, or conversely displayed more 
emotion, these are small quibbles about a book that is so richly imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue Smalls finishes many stories in "The Serpent's Gift" with, "I've told my 
friends, now you tell yours." The phrase is most apropos in celebrating the 
arrival of Helen Elaine Lee and "The Serpent's Gift," a book whose colors will 
linger behind the eyes long after you read the final page.

ART REVIEW; NEW WORLD ARDOR; WILLEM DE KOONING'S SENSUAL WORKS CONFIRM HIS 
PLACE AS A GREAT EUROPEAN MODERNIST REFRACTED THROUGH AN AMERICAN PRISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The magnificent retrospective of Willem de Kooning's paintings at the National 
Gallery of Art throws the artist's breathtaking achievement into high relief. 
More than ever, he is confirmed as the last great exemplar of a European 
tradition of modern art, as altered and transmogrified by his loving encounter 
with his adopted home. 
</P>
<P>
 De Kooning, a Dutch emigre to the United States, transformed Parisian Cubism 
and European Expressionism, infusing them with a scale and a temperament 
distinctly American and particular to New York. Cubism and Expressionism were 
writ large, in dazzlingly complex images of women begun circa 1949 and in 
luxurious, landscape-inspired abstractions that followed half a dozen years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrospective, which brings together 76 paintings on canvas, paper and 
board, begins in 1938 with De Kooning's peculiar figure studies of men and 
women in indeterminate interiors. They seem to merge an affection for the 
"little brown paintings" of Dutch old masters with a thoroughly modern, 
specifically Cubist interest in constantly shifting points of view. Together, 
these impulses are inflected by the salutary influence of painter Arshile 
Gorky, his great friend, mentor and fellow immigrant (from Armenia). 
</P>
<P>
 The show concludes in 1986 with the big canvases of loose, light-filled, open 
interlaces of color darting through fields of tinted white. The best of them 
rank as an astonishing coda to an already astonishing career. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has mounted the retrospective on the occasion of De Kooning's 90th 
birthday; he was born in Rotterdam on April 24, 1904, came to the United States 
illegally in 1926 and stopped painting in the late 1980s, when the debilitating 
effects of Alzheimer's disease ended his artistic life. National Gallery 
curator Marla Prather, English critic and historian David Sylvester and 
Nicholas Serota, director of London's Tate Gallery, have assembled a nearly 
flawless array of paintings to tell their tale. 
</P>
<P>
 That rarely flagging level of quality is crucial, because the last opportunity 
to survey De Kooning's work -- a 1983 retrospective at New York's Whitney 
Museum of American Art -- could be described most charitably as erratic in the 
loans that were secured. With few notable exceptions, topped by the missing 
"Pink Angels" from circa 1945, all the pivotal paintings are in Washington. As 
a result, it's easy to follow the internal trajectory of De Kooning's art. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important insight De Kooning took from Cubism was his sensual 
articulation of the surface of a painting as a bodily metaphor. The Cubist 
structure on which the great, rambunctious "Woman" paintings rely is harnessed 
by De Kooning as a way to unfold the body in keeping with the two-dimensional 
space of painting. He had mastered the device in the vigorous, mural-like 
abstraction "Excavation," painted for the 1950 Venice Biennale and completed 
while he was struggling with the newer figure paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Formally, in the show's group of 14 paintings dating from 1949 to 1955, the 
women are squared off, flattened out, interlocked with the surrounding 
environment. Raucous, funny, flirtatious and aggressive, they embody the 
mesmerizing fierceness of flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In these wildly inventive pictures, De Kooning made the painterly surface of 
his canvas or paper coincident with, and inseparable from, the bodily surface 
of the image. A pictorial surface loaded with paint is announced as the 
painting's skin, and further likened to human flesh. The problem for De 
Kooning, as an artist, was how to make that dead flesh live, in all its 
splendid emotional, physical and psychological variety. 
</P>
<P>
 This Expressionist dimension of his work parallels a more restrained postwar 
tradition of abstract painting, exemplified by artists such as Ellsworth Kelly, 
Agnes Martin and Brice Marden. They, too, developed a bodily metaphor for art, 
in which a painting's structural skeleton and surface skin are poetically 
articulated. 
</P>
<P>
 What differs is their temperament. Kelly and his compatriots coolly offered 
canvases as perceptual equivalents to the body of the viewer standing before 
them. De Kooning did, too, but he turned it into a visceral encounter: You find 
yourself wanting to touch, to inhale, to engorge yourself with his paint. 
</P>
<P>
 De Kooning used a variety of tricks to pump up the sensuously inviting 
tactility of his surfaces, including his famous wet-on-wet technique of mixing 
salad oil in the pigment, in order to make it slithery, fluid and receptive to 
sustained periods of work. It didn't dry out fast. 
</P>
<P>
 As he worked he would repeatedly scrape down the surface, leaving layered 
smears and traces of underpaint to show through, like insistent memories of 
past encounters piling up one atop the other. His paintings can look 
slatternly, as if they've been around. 
</P>
<P>
 When engrossed by that gorgeously seductive dynamic, the viewer may easily 
forget the complicated art scene De Kooning worked in. He had been living in 
New York for about a decade when the influx of European modern artists fleeing 
Hitler arrived, and after World War II he naturally stayed. (He still wasn't a 
citizen and wouldn't become one until 1962, but he considered himself an 
American nonetheless.) The volatile avant-garde context that marked the 
immediate postwar years in Manhattan was small, cliquish and without much 
public following. But as a devastated Europe lay in ruins, the sense of needing 
to pick up art's fallen torch was strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstract Expressionism was thus tinctured with a missionary aura. De Kooning, 
the European expatriate who had worked his way across the Atlantic and then 
jumped ship when docked at Newport News, Va., was in part a bridge between the 
Old World and the New. In many ways his work embodied the span. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other Abstract Expressionists' brand of painting had been important in 
setting a stage of cultural seriousness within the otherwise largely provincial 
art life of the United States. Remember, though, that they were at the center 
of that local maelstrom for only slightly more than a decade, when the big 
artistic tsunami of the early 1960s broke. By 1964, the explosive arrival of 
Pop, Minimal and Conceptual art had changed just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most telling alterations was the loosening of the exclusive grip of 
the New York School on claims to artistic significance. At the time, nearly 
half of De Kooning's working life as an artist was still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Gallery show demonstrates how De Kooning's art seriously wobbled 
in the wake of the artistic watershed that he had helped to foster -- and that 
finally overtook him. By the end of the 1960s and in the early 1970s, his 
painting goes slack for the first time. You feel him stumbling, as if in search 
of his sea legs. He reiterates the earlier themes of women and gestural 
landscape, often melding the two in playfully insouciant ways, but his pictures 
feel distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as if De Kooning had in fact been regrouping his energies, the paintings 
take off for the stratosphere again: A lush room of seven abstractions all 
dating from 1977-78 is among the most beautiful in the show. Never has paint as 
a dumb, mysteriously sensuous material looked more viscerally inviting than 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Gallery has done a remarkably good job of laying out this 
exciting terrain, especially in the big, sweeping middle of the presentation. 
Just once at the beginning and once at the end is the exhibition tripped up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start a serious fault is the absence of "Pink Angels," a smallish 
painting inspired by Picasso but marked by a voluptuous, transparent linearity 
wholly De Kooning's own. Without it, you just can't make the leap from the 
show's first room, with its six relatively conventional pink and ochre studies 
of male and female figures, to the startling second room, filled with six 
exciting black paintings, through which whiplash lines of white create a 
magical interpenetration of crystalline and biomorphic shapes. With these, De 
Kooning was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite numerous entreaties, according to the National Gallery, Los Angeles 
collector Frederick Weisman simply would not lend "Pink Angels," which hangs in 
the Holmby Hills mansion he has made plans to open as a house museum. It's too 
bad, since the picture's significance to De Kooning's oeuvre is accurately 
described by David Sylvester in the retrospective's catalogue as "probably the 
single most decisive turning point in a career full of twists and turns." 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is the final room. In the 1980s -- and in his increasingly 
debilitated dotage -- De Kooning was still enthralled with the soul-shattering, 
life-altering possibilities for visual pleasure in painting. But the eight 
selected canvases are uneven at best. Especially on the heels of the knockout 
gallery of gorgeous pictures from 1977-78 that immediately precedes it, the 
erratic last room inappropriately sends you out the door with a few doubts 
about the claims that have been made for De Kooning's last works. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these small deficiencies, the retrospective remains a superlative 
achievement. What's extraordinary is the way two central and related features 
of De Kooning's art get pressed upon our current consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 One concerns the current preoccupation among scores of significant artists 
with the cultural politics of the human body. The other concerns the potential 
role of seductive visual knowledge amid the hectoring descriptive content of so 
much art today. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is important to see now because it sets up an extravagant 
argument in favor of a kind of visual knowledge often erroneously dismissed as 
irrelevant today, but nonetheless being championed by many of our most 
compelling younger artists. De Kooning at 90 stands as a gorgeously convincing 
precedent. 
</P>

COVER STORY: SETTING THE PACE; ABC'S BOBBY UNSER & CO. REV UP THEIR COMMENTARY 
FOR THE 78TH INDY 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHEIBE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing tape-delayed about Bobby Unser. After 13 years of retirement 
from IndyCar racing, the 57-year-old Hall of Fame driver still enjoys a live 
show. His body may be confined to the broadcast booth for Sunday's 78th 
Indianapolis 500 on ABC, but his heart is strapped in behind the wheel and the 
accelerator is pressed to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser and the network's sports department have mutual admiration for each 
other, especially on Memorial Day. Executive producer Jack O'Hara says Unser is 
"terrific" and "extremely knowledgeable about the machinery, the drivers and 
the teams." His "offbeat and irreverent" style adds to the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Televising the 500 live suits Unser. "Being a race car driver you had no 
excuses. It was your day to perform. Doing it (the broadcast) live was like 
racing to me. I could add a whole lot more to the show." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Unser's eighth year working for ABC. The three-time Indianapolis 500 
champion will be in a sky booth at Turn 2 of the Speedway. In Turn 4 will be 
former 500 champion Danny Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara says placing announcers in different locations allows television to 
follow the race around the 2 1/2-mile oval course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the idea from radio," O'Hara says. "A car may be running fine coming 
out of Turn 2, but by the time it gets to Turn 4 it may not be running so good. 
It allows us to do commentary all the way around the track." 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be a camera in six of the cars. Paul Page and Sam Posey will 
call the race, which the network is carrying live for the ninth straight year. 
Jack Arute, Gary Gerould and Dr. Jerry Punch will report from the pits. Emerson 
Fittipaldi of Brazil is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeds and technology at Indianapolis have rocketed since Unser last 
climbed out of a Roger Penske-owned car in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, who describes himself as a "charger," says in a phone interview from 
his home in Albuquerque. N.M., "I was known for being a qualifier. I charged 
flat-out." 
</P>
<P>
 An aggressiveness that put more than one car on a speedway wall accented 
Unser's IndyCar career, which began in 1963 when he qualified Andy Granatelli's 
V-8 Novi. Unser won 35 races, fourth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an expert, an authority. That doesn't mean I've always been right. 
Nobody can call a race like Paul (Page), but he's not really a racer. I am an 
expert and the audience is going to believe what I say. And if I say something 
that's wrong, they'll forgive me." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser began doing commentary on TV in 1975 at the first Long Beach Grand Prix 
while he was recovering from a race-related injury. "A broken leg had laid me 
up for a little while," he says, "and CBS gave me a holler." 
</P>
<P>
 At first he didn't want to do it, but CBS announcer Ken Squier, a good friend, 
called and persuaded him to give it a try. "I had no idea what TV was like. No 
idea. My leg was in a fresh cast but I didn't want everybody to think I was a 
sissy, so I went. I was popping pain pills during the race. CBS asked me back 
the next year and that got the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I went to NBC where they did a lot of tape-delayed racing and at the 
same time I was learning more about TV. Then ABC began doing a live show, and I 
got more respect for TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser said he believes ABC's Indy coverage has improved since it went live. 
"They've got a better idea of what do do. For example, the graphics are better 
and the pre-race show is a piece of art." 
</P>
<P>
 Between Indy stints and other ABC-televised races, Unser keeps so busy doing 
endorsements, commercials and training films for various companies that he's 
only home 40 to 60 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he miss racing? "Of course I do." 
</P>
<P>
 But he gets his fix, as he calls it, by driving with his son, Robby, in the 
Pikes Peak Hill Climb, an event that Unser won a record 13 times, including in 
1986, when he set a speed record in the rally division. Robby Unser has won 
Pikes Peak four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice engineering and driving in a race with my son that I won 13 times," 
he says. "That fixes my need. I'm still a race driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Which auto racing fans definitely know when they hear his commentary Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's coverage of the Indian a polis 500 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
begins Sunday at 8 a.m. UNSER UTTERANCES 
</P>
<P>
 The never-bashful Bobby Unser doesn't hold back his opinions, whether they're 
of the Indianapolis 500, IndyCar racing or his own racing family. Some 
off-the-cuff observations:  
</P>
<P>
 On the ever-increasing speeds, now closing in on an average of 230 m.p.h. at 
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway: 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars are going too fast, but the safety has stayed ahead of the speeds. 
The cars today are safer than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 On the technology: 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars and the racing are too costly. The cost can be reduced by half. With 
the electronics and computers in the cars, the fans don't appreciate all that 
and they shouldn't. They don't care about the computers and electronics. The 
fans want to see the race." 
</P>
<P>
 On the influx of foreign, and especially European, drivers in IndyCar racing: 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs heroes, like the ones in sprint cars and NASCAR. The fans want 
heroes and they're fewer and fewer in the U.S. A lot of the drivers' names they 
can't pronounce. Only a few have a chance to win. The rest are 'pay drivers,' 
the ones rich enough to pay their way into the race." 
</P>
<P>
 On his nephew Al Unser Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Al is similar to his dad. He's picked up his dad's habits and traits 
and he's very capable of winning. He stays competitive in the race and in the 
last third of the race he is pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
 On his role as an auto-racing analyst: 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy it an awful lot. I spend a lot of time preparing ahead of time. Part 
of it is evaluating the new cars that are already set in place. For example, in 
Australia, we looked at the Honda engine. The Ford-Cosworth. The overhead cam 
vs. the pushrod. What is Chevy going to do? The different teams ... Penske. 
Then there are the chassis. TOP CARS AND DRIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Some key drivers to watch on as the cars round the turns:  
</P>
<P>

MUSIC; FROM PROTEGE TO MENTOR; MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS COMES FULL CIRCLE TO 
DIRECT YOUNG MUSICIANS AT THE SAME OJAI FESTIVAL THAT LAUNCHED HIS CAREER IN 
THE '60S

<P>
 Pluck a typical middle-aged concert-goer from the Music Center and ask him if 
he remembers Michael Tilson Thomas, and you might expect something like this in 
response. "Sure. He's from around here. Wonderful Gershwin conductor. He often 
gave terrific, splashy performances of Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Copland, when 
he was principal guest conductor of the Philharmonic in the early '80s. But, 
you know, he was also kind of uneven. They say he was temperamental, a little 
immature. What happened to him, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now mention Tilson Thomas to someone in the audience at the Barbican Centre in 
London, where the London Symphony Orchestra performs, and she might tell you, 
"Well, the Arts Council said it all, didn't it, when it selected the LSO as the 
main London orchestra? Tilson Thomas is known here for his elegant, inventive 
program-making, and, of course, he's popular for American music. But it's 
probably as a Mahler conductor that he has made his mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, try a young dude on Miami Beach newly turned on to classical music 
thanks to an appearance of Gloria Estefan with the New World Symphony, a 
training orchestra of young professionals that Tilson Thomas founded in Miami 
six years ago and turned into an almost overnight success. "MTT's cool. He 
plays Latin music." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tilson Thomas returns to Southern California next weekend as music 
director of the Ojai Festival, where he will lead the New World Symphony in a 
series of concerts that pay tribute to the West Coast musical world in which he 
grew up. Neither these traditions nor Tilson Thomas is probably as familiar or 
obvious as one might at first imagine, unless, of course, you happen to live in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas was once one of the best-known musicians in Los Angeles. As a 
teen-ager studying at USC, he was already a regular pianist at the Monday 
Evening Concerts devoted to modern music at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. At age 19, he was appointed conductor of the Young Musicians Foundation 
Orchestra, the prominent training ensemble. By 25, he already had a national 
reputation as an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra with a 
flair for grabbing media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Bernstein championed him, and he took over from Bernstein the New York 
Philharmonic Young People's Concerts in the 1970s. He became music director of 
the Buffalo Symphony. He continued to regularly guest-conduct in Los Angeles 
and later served as a principal guest conductor of the Philharmonic from 1981 
to 1985. But Tilson Thomas reportedly had a falling out with the orchestra 
management, disappointed to lose out to Andre Previn in the selection of a 
music director to succeed Carlo Maria Giulini. (Ironically, Previn had been a 
music director of the LSO in the '70s.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though little seen in Los Angeles since, Tilson Thomas, who will turn 50 at 
the end of the year, will be easily recognized. He looks as boyish as ever, and 
he remains the bouncy presence on the podium he's always been. In conversation, 
too, he continues to exude the kind of unashamed exuberance for music that one 
finds in teen-agers, which surely helps make him popular with young musicians 
and young audiences in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some notable signs that he has changed; he is no longer quite so 
Californian. He pronounces certain words with a Boston accent, perhaps acquired 
in his Boston Symphony days, but London seems to have made it more curiously 
conspicuous. He conducts differently too. His music-making has evolved. He is 
more unabashedly romantic in his interpretations, stretching phrases, digging 
deeper than he used to. Europe has put a little more weight into his 
performances, especially of European music. Brahms and Schubert figure more in 
his repertory these days, and Mahler is an obsession. But he says that the kids 
at the New World Symphony, with whom he spends nearly a third of the year 
coaching and conducting, keep him lively. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas, in fact, seems somewhat at a crossroads. Next season will be 
his last with the London Symphony, and he will leave in a big way, leading a 
cycle of all nine Mahler symphonies. Then, later in 1995, he takes over the San 
Francisco Symphony, returning to his native West Coast but to the city and 
orchestra often considered the competitors with his hometown and its band. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ojai, Tilson Thomas says, he will return to many of his roots, recalling a 
marvelous musical age in which he grew up in Los Angeles, an age that provides 
an important, if underappreciated, foundation for our own musical time. In 
fact, one way to understand the forces currently driving Tilson Thomas is to 
look at his Ojai Festival programs and listen to what he has to say about them. 
They are, in part, an autobiography of a complex musical personality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking expansively over the phone from Miami, exhausted but also charged up 
after a five-hour rehearsal of Mahler's Sixth Symphony, Tilson Thomas says that 
the first time he appeared at Ojai was in 1965 in a program devoted to American 
musical pioneers. He credits such pioneers from the '30s and '40s with helping 
foster his own adventurous spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cage, with his early percussion music, and Lou Harrison, with his 
Asian-tinged music, along with their predecessors Henry Cowell and the 
Balinese-absorbed Colin McPhee, will be the subject of a concert Saturday 
afternoon that also pays tribute to 100-year-old Russian emigre composer, 
conductor and lexicographer Nicolas Slonimsky, who early on befriended and 
championed many of them, while writing some pioneering and peculiar music of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of this non-European approach is peculiarly West Coast in 
spirit, Tilson Thomas is quick to point out that the Southern California 
tradition is rich in various kinds of more conventional music as well. He says 
he pays particular attention to his mentor at USC, composer Ingolf Dahl, who 
was music director of the Ojai Festival in which Tilson Thomas first performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ingolf was one of these super-accomplished musician's musicians who had a 
very elegant and personal voice as a composer and was also a phenomenal 
conductor and music historian," Tilson Thomas recalls of Dahl, a man who was 
once at the center of Los Angeles musical life but whose legacy is now sadly 
neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas' devotion to Dahl has led him to conduct an entire evening of 
the composer's work in Miami (he has also recorded a disc of Dahl's music with 
the New World Symphony for release on Argo), as well as to program Dahl in 
London. He has included Dahl's "The Tower of Santa Barbara" on the 
late-afternoon final concert next Sunday, and not only because of the 
composer's place in Ojai and Southern California history. The work also 
represents a deeper theme that concerns Tilson Thomas -- the living today in 
the past, present and future all at the same time, as we do in the world of 
classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Classical music is haunted by the past as no other art form is. The majority 
of concert-goers, record buyers and radio listeners steep themselves only in 
music of the last century and earlier. The majority of musicians play only that 
music. For some listeners, the recent past of up to half a century ago (or even 
more) is also the future -- those pioneers mentioned above are still considered 
ultramodern. But the future requires from us a present that can deal with the 
past more creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl offers one solution. "Ingolf's piece," Tilson Thomas explains, "is full 
of references to medieval and Renaissance music. He constructs his own cantus 
firmus, which is a kind of distillation of various medieval and Renaissance 
sources." That, of course, also has an additional unexpected currency, given 
the present rage for medieval chants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas has joined Dahl's piece with a number of other works that offer 
approaches to the notion of looking back -- and no two do it in remotely the 
same way. Charles Wuorinen's "Machault Mon Chou" is a more up-to-date academic 
approach to the same issue of reinterpreting medieval music. Lukas Foss, a 
former Ojai Festival director and onetime member of the UCLA faculty, is a 
composer who has modernized much old music, and his psychedelic version of 
Bach, "Phorion," is music history as musical happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Luciano Berio's "Rendering," meanwhile, is a postmodern non-completion of the 
sketches from Schubert's uncompleted 10th Symphony. Berio's technique is to 
join the fragments Schubert wrote, orchestrated in Schubert's style, with 
modern filler of his own, the composer likening the finished product to 
restoring an ancient mosaic by filling the spaces between missing tiles with 
neutral cement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the past also means the past. For Tilson Thomas there is the simple 
personal nostalgia that is found in his own brass quintet "Street Song," which 
reveals some of his own roots. "Street Song," he says, "is really based on the 
kinds of harmonies that hover over a lot of the music that my father used to 
play on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a self-taught musician -- well, he had a little bit of piano 
instruction from George Gershwin when he was a kid, because Gershwin used to 
hang around my grandparents' house," Tilson Thomas says, his grandparents, 
Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky, having been founders of the Yiddish Theater in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "And my father played, for at least a couple of hours every day, his 
individual sort of music, which was mostly in F major and was kind of a mixture 
of Broadway, Tin Pan Alley and Yiddish theater, with a certain kind of mystical 
Debussyan harmony, and that world is evoked in this quintet." 
</P>
<P>
 Tilson Thomas is so tied in with the music of our period, in fact, that a 
surprising number of the works he has selected have personal significance. For 
instance, "Threnody II" by Aaron Copland, for whom a teen-age Tilson Thomas 
first played backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, was written in memory of Beatrice 
Cunningham, the sister of Lawrence Morton, the original guiding spirit of Ojai 
and one of the first important Angelenos to recognize Tilson Thomas' talents. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Arias and Barcarolles," Bernstein's last piece, Tilson Thomas played 
in its original two-piano version and calls it Bernstein's most confessional 
score. "I always told Lenny that I thought it was a wonderful example of 
insomnia in music," he recalls. "He never slept and late at night would work on 
theses pieces, asking all the time, 'What does it mean?' " It, too, has its 
references, Tilson Thomas says, pointing out that Mahler and Mussorgsky are 
used in it in humorous ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, once you start looking back it's hard to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was listening the other day to Stravinsky's Symphony in Three 
Movements," Tilson Thomas observes of the work that will close the festival, "I 
had forgotten just how many references there are to Monteverdi, and troubadour 
and trouvere music, and, my God, to Tchaikovsky and Rimsky in a few places. 
It's amazing how one can still hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you also have to remember that the person I met in Los Angeles who was by 
far the most adventurous music spirit on the West Coast was Igor Stravinsky. As 
an old man he had such astonishing curiosity and desire to understand the new 
and to uncover, in the old, things that he had never experienced, and this was 
to me the greatest inspiration of what a musician should be." 
</P>
<P>
 And just what a musician should or should not be seems to be very much on 
Tilson Thomas' mind these days. In London, where a musician's work is more 
grinding than in the States -- the orchestra prepares two major programs on the 
average week -- Tilson Thomas says he has learned much from the fact that the 
ensemble is self-governing: "It has increased my sense that the responsibility 
of the sort of music that is made rests with the musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 At the New World Symphony, that spirit is even stronger. Tilson Thomas says 
that another way he has changed since leaving Los Angeles is that he has become 
more of an idealist, perhaps needing to leave the West Coast to recapture some 
of its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work that I'm doing here (in Miami) is tied in with the idealistic work I 
did in the first years of my musical life, and it reminds me very much of the 
work Ingolf (Dahl) and so many others did with me and reminds me of my first 
years at Ojai," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, Tilson Thomas has a laboratory for trying out new ideas, for musical 
experimentation and collaboration unlike anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a conductor I am utterly uninterested in going out on the stage and giving 
beats and having people follow them," he says. "That is not my style of 
music-making. What I'm interested in doing is helping to create a kind of 
musical space, a kind of space in time and spirit in which music can take 
place. And I enter this space with my ideas, and all of my colleagues with me 
enter this space with all of their ideas, their past experience, their 
perspectives. And somehow in this space we find one another." 
</P>
<P>
 What in this space-time continuum is past, present, future? It all becomes so 
intertwined that it needs its own laws of relativity. But space, we know, is 
curved, and for Tilson Thomas the return to Ojai "is kind of a completion of a 
circle for me -- bringing this repertoire with these musicians of an entirely 
different generation who play all this music as if it were written for them."* 
</P>
<P>

THEATER; ON THE WINGS OF 'ANGELS'; STEPHEN SPINELLA HAS VAULTED FROM OBSCURITY 
TO WIDESPREAD ACCLAIM, ONE TONY AND NOW ANOTHER NOMINATION FOR HIS 
FRIGHTENINGLY REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF AIDS-RAVAGED PRIOR WALTER IN THE TWO-PART 
EPIC 'ANGELS IN AMERICA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, Patrick Pacheco is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most actors, it's the sound of applause and laughter rippling through the 
audience that is the most gratifying. But for Stephen Spinella, it's the sound 
of gasps. The 37-year-old actor certainly incites his share of them as Prior 
Walter, the addled and flamboyant scion and reluctant prophet who is at the 
heart of "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's two-part epic about gays, AIDS and 
Reaganism. 
</P>
<P>
 The first murmurs of astonishment usually come from the Broadway audiences 
near the beginning of Part 1, "Millennium Approaches," when a naked Spinella, 
his skinny body covered with lesions, cowers and screams in terror. Another 
shock wave hits the audience early in Part 2, "Perestroika," when after tearing 
around the stage at full tilt, the ailing Prior falls backward in a dead faint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear the gasps and then they're completely quiet," Spinella says. "They 
think it's some horrible mistake. Or that something truly horrible has 
happened. Which is where you want them." 
</P>
<P>
 Horrible things, of course, do happen in "Angels in America." But that horror 
is as often as not followed by something funny, provocative, malevolent or 
surreal. Prior is the lodestar for the play's amazing emotional journey, and 
the shy Spinella has emerged from relative obscurity to share in the honors 
that have been heaped on the hit drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angels in America" is divided into two 3 1/2-hour plays -- Part 1, 
"Millennium Approaches," opened on Broadway in May, 1993; "Perestroika" 
followed in November and has been playing in repertory with "Millennium" at the 
Walter Kerr Theatre. The Broadway shows followed productions of both parts in 
Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum in late 1992, and "Millennium Approaches" 
was also seen in London earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, when "Millennium" swept the Tonys -- taking, among its four 
awards, one for best play -- Spinella took home the trophy for best featured 
actor in a drama. Now, with "Perestroika" again leading the Tony nominees for 
drama with six nominations, Spinella is up for best performance by a leading 
actor in a play. The change in category recognizes his role in Part 2 as more 
pivotal to the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he will prevail again when the awards are announced June 12 remains to 
be seen. He's got stiff competition: Sam Waterston ("Abe Lincoln in Illinois"), 
Christopher Plummer ("No Man's Land") and Brian Bedford ("Timon of Athens"). 
But whatever the outcome, Spinella says that he's bound to enjoy this year's 
competition a lot more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a wreck last year," he says of the sudden onslaught of fame that 
greeted him as part of the eight-member cast of "Angels." "Everything happened 
so fast. This time, whether I win or not, I'm just much more confident about my 
situation. I'm going to savor every last minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If Spinella was not exactly comfortable with Broadway then, the New York 
audiences nonetheless cottoned to him in a big way. Few characters in recent 
theater history have generated as much empathy and affection as Prior, a waiter 
and former drag queen. Abandoned by his lover, he spends much of "Millennium 
Approaches" coping with the debilitating effects of AIDS while warding off the 
persistent visitations of a pushy angel. "Perestroika" sees him going sparring 
with the heavenly principalities and raging around the stage looking like, as 
one character notes, Morticia Addams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella is a close friend of playwright Kushner, who wrote the role with the 
actor in mind. He began playing Prior in 1989 in readings at San Francisco's 
Eureka Theatre, which commissioned the piece, and he was in the first workshop 
production of "Millennium" at the Taper in May, 1990. Spinella also played 
Prior in the seven-hour marathon of "Angels" there in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something kind of frail about him," he says of the character's 
appeal. "You think he's going to crumble. And he does. But then he puts himself 
back together as a much stronger person. There's something exhilarating about 
somebody who's at the bottom and fights back -- through humor as much as rage." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Spinella has been so successful in communicating the mesmerizing and 
horrific world of AIDS to audiences that he has become a poster child of sorts 
-- an image reinforced by a cameo as a dying man with AIDS in the HBO 
television movie "And the Band Played On." Offstage, he is often besieged by 
people inquiring after his health or sending heartfelt notes such as one 
scrawled on the back of a ticket stub that he keeps taped to his dressing room 
mirror: "Doug very much wanted to be here. He died of AIDS on Jan. 19, 1993. 
Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the audience's proprietary attitude toward Spinella stems from the 
fact that he has a very slender build, which onstage makes him appear 
emaciated. Audiences have often speculated as to the real state of his health. 
Nothing to be alarmed about. Much of the frailty is makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his dressing room, having just returned from a vacation in Florida, 
Spinella exudes health and well-being. As part of a campaign to put pounds on 
his bony frame, he's hired a personal trainer. A large bunch of bananas sits 
amid dried flowers, family photos, pictures of angels and other memorabilia 
cluttering his dressing room. The room has been painted a color he calls "dusty 
rose," and the fluty-voiced reference to his interior-decorating skills is a 
rare flash of Prior flamboyance. For the most part, his demeanor is serious, 
almost somber. Dressed conservatively in khakis and a striped shirt, he chooses 
his words carefully, punctuating them with long pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, a onetime gay activist, reluctantly reveals that he is HIV- 
negative -- ("I don't believe the community should be divided by those who are 
positive and those who are negative," he says) -- but he adds that audiences 
continue to confuse him with the character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really care," he says. "I'd play another PWA (person with AIDS) in a 
second if the role was a good one. I really don't have a problem leaving the 
role after I leave the theater. It doesn't persist. But some people can be 
extremely rude. They come up to me and think they can say stuff like 'You're so 
skinny,' 'You should eat more!' It's just unbelievably rude." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 400 Broadway performances, Spinella concedes that summoning up 
Prior's febrile exchanges with freshness and spontaneity has been a real 
challenge of late. The demands, particularly in "Perestroika," are so 
physically and emotionally exhausting that Spinella says he had no intention of 
renewing his contract when it expired in January. Yet the producers prevailed 
on him to stay on through September. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading him wasn't that hard, actually. Despite the acclaim for his 
performance in "Angels," other offers haven't exactly poured in. Aside from the 
role of a gay parent in Michael Tolkin's forthcoming movie, "The New Age," 
which he had to turn down because of scheduling, Spinella says he had no other 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 He auditioned for the role of a drag queen in the road movie "To Wong Foo, 
Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar" -- a part that eventually went to Patrick 
Swayze. Even so, Spinella says, he was eager to explore the possibilities of 
doing film and more TV at the time his contract came up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I realized I really wanted to understand the part better, especially 
in 'Perestroika,' which I hadn't had the chance to play that long," he says. 
"When you have a role as well written as this one, you constantly discover new 
wells of inspiration. It can even get to be a pretty desperate search after a 
while. You think, ' Ohmygod , I'm not deep enough, not honest enough, not funny 
enough.' It can be a humbling experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella says that he has had to plumb his own background and personal life 
for the compass points that intersect with Prior's. Unlike the well-born 
character he plays, Spinella forged his own survival skills in Arizona. His 
father, a Navy mechanic, moved the large brood after the end of a tour of duty 
in Italy, where Stephen, the middle son, was born. The close-knit family 
endured a shock when Stephen's father died unexpectedly of a heart attack. 
Though he was only 13 at the time, Spinella soon found himself the head of the 
household when his older brother and sister moved away to college. Meanwhile, 
he was coming to grips with his own sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really differentiate between what were the traumas of the situation 
of my family and the traumas about being terrified of my sexuality," he says. 
"They all get mixed up together." 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella found a refuge from both in the high school drama club. Alan D. 
Perry, who heads one of the many producing entities of "Angels in America," 
knew the aspiring actor at Glendale High School near Phoenix and remembered him 
as someone who was clearly going places, even then. 
</P>
<P>
 "My memory of him was as always being incredibly inventive and always the most 
interesting person to watch," Perry says. "We lived in a desert community and 
had that artistic insecurity that comes from living in a place where the 
seasons don't change. I remember once at a friend's house, where we all 
gathered on Friday evenings to watch 'Mary Hartman,' we announced to the group 
that we were no longer going to meet any more boring people. Only writers, 
artists and dancers. They looked at us like we were insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Spinella's many years working in fringe theater before "Angels," 
Broadway had long been a goal. The actor says that he even moved from Arizona 
to New York in 1978 to attend the graduate acting program at New York 
University, because, as he put it, "I'd be one step closer to actually being on 
Broadway." It worked. He met Kushner. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing Spinella in a university production, Kushner, then a first-year 
directing student, invited him to be in his play "The Age of Assassins," a 
four-hour political saga about American anarchists at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started writing roles for Stephen because the first time I saw him I knew 
he was a truly great actor," Kushner says. "He has immense emotional depth, 
great range and an extraordinarily facility for stylized language. He really 
knows how to do my stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella characterizes many of the roles Kushner has written for him as 
"fierce and angry men." Those have included a curmudgeonly amateur scientist 
and archeologist in "Hydriotaphia," an irascible early capitalist in "Heavenly 
Theatre," a leering cleric in "La Fin de la Baleine" and the gay intellectual 
in an early production of Kushner's previously best-known work, "A Bright Room 
Called Day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the nadir of Spinella's career was when Kushner received his first 
major New York production with "A Bright Room Called Day" at the Public Theatre 
in 1990, and Spinella wasn't invited to come along. The director, Michael Greif 
(who has since become artistic director at the La Jolla Playhouse), refused to 
cast him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely devastated. I was really very, very upset," Spinella 
recalls. "I had contributed a lot to that part, and Tony worked very hard to 
get me into that production. Michael simply thought another actor would be 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella's crisis of confidence almost led him to pull out of the inaugural 
workshop production of "Angels in America." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought this is the way it's going to be for the rest of my life," he 
says. "I'm going to be doing the plays in the small theaters for not much 
money, and when it comes to New York, it's going to go to somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Spinella persevered, buoyed by Kushner's guarantee that he would be a part 
of "Angels" no matter where it was produced. Through the various readings and 
workshops, the actor put his personal stamp on Prior -- so much so that now 
it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role, either on Broadway or in Robert 
Altman's upcoming films of "Angels in America." There will be a movie for each 
part, produced by Fine Line Features, with production now scheduled for next 
spring. Anxious not to jinx his chances to land the film role, Spinella 
declines to comment on the Altman production except to say, nervously, that his 
fingers are crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the actor continues to live in the modest East Village apartment 
he's had for 15 years. He recently separated from his lover of the past four 
years, a result, he says, of "two strong-headed people who have different ideas 
of where they want to live their lives." These days, Spinella's life appears to 
be equal parts monasticism and glamour: the monkish existence of playing eight 
performances at such a high pitch that long telephone conversations are out of 
the question, next to the experience of meeting such idols as Diana Ross, whom 
he told: "I've got a recording of every sound you've ever made." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the life and career he envisions for himself after "Angels," Spinella 
will only say: "The next play I want to do is one that lasts 90 minutes, is all 
jokes, one costume, one set and very, very easy. No gasps, no groans, just lots 
of laughter -- Please!"*

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening two-thirds of the 1990 TV movie The Incident (CBS Sunday at 9 
p.m.) are intricately plotted and charged with edgy intrigue, but the last 
third dissipates all suspense generated by director Joseph Sargent. During 
World War II an elderly doctor has been clubbed to death on the edge of a small 
Colorado town, and one of the German soldiers imprisoned there as a POW is 
charged with murder. Walter Matthau stars as the soldier's reluctant attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The absorbing 1991 TV movie White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd 
(NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), starring Loni Anderson in the title role, presents the 
popular comedienne of the 1930s as an archetypal ill-fated Hollywood blonde -- 
sexy, talented and beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Williams is hilarious in the excruciatingly funny 1990 Cadillac Man (ABC 
Monday at 9 p.m.), in which he plays a hapless car salesman already up to his 
ears in trouble when he has to make the deal of a lifetime: persuade a 
cuckolded, crazed Tim Robbins into dropping his gun and ending a reign of 
terror at a car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Krays (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.), Peter Medak's 1990 
film of Britain's violent and notorious twin gangsters and nightclub 
proprietors, is a bit literal in its Freudianisms and skimps on the brothers' 
enduring notoriety in Britain -- but it is engrossing all the same. The twins 
are played with hypnotic creepiness by Spandau Ballet brothers Martin and Gary 
Kemp. With Billie Whitelaw as their overly adoring mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Weapons of the Spirit (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a different kind 
of Holocaust documentary, a thorough and heartwarming probe by Pierre Sauvage 
of how his birthplace, a small Christian village in south-central France, 
became a refuge for 5,000 Jews, including the filmmakers' parents, during World 
War II. The answer lies in the the community's enduring Huguenot heritage with 
its memories of religious persecution and the leadership of its courageous, 
ecumenical-spirited pastor. The result is a rare and stirring illustration of 
the power of religion to unite rather than divide people. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizen Cohn (KABC Saturday at 11:30 p.m.) is a fascinating yet somehow 
lacking 1992 HBO production on the life of the late Roy Cohn. James Wood is 
stunning in his unsparing, kick-butt depiction of a dangerous man who, by many 
accounts, was a dishonest, ruthless poseur who saw power as a pickax to be used 
for decapitation. Beyond the film's McCarthy period, however, the film has 
intermittent lapses in energy and focus.

 Raising Arizona (USA Sunday at 1 p.m.), Joel and Ethan Coen's hilarious, 
off-the-wall 1987 comedy, finds Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter as a goofy, 
oddball couple who steal a set of quintuplets. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sporting Life (Bravo Tuesday at 5 p.m., Saturday at 9 p.m.) is Lindsay 
Anderson's powerful 1963 study of a coal miner (Albert Finney) who dreams of a 
better life as a professional rugby player. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger Than Life (Cinemax Thursday at 1 p.m.) is a harrowing 1956 Nicholas Ray 
film starring James Mason as a teacher moonlighting as a cab dispatcher and who 
turns to drugs to keep up his energy. With Barbara Rush as his determinedly 
perfect '50s-style wife.

 "Nightly dissipation did not slow down the workers who, by the spring of 1868, 
realized they were not mere laborers on a railroad but participants in the 
greatest race in history. The Central Pacific was winging across the level 
deserts of Nevada. The Union Pacific was battling through South Pass."

 -- Ray Allen Billington "Westward Expansion," 1960 
</P>
<P>
 "A family story lies at the heart of American western history."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Kathleen Neils Conzen "The Oxford History of the American West," 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Down the canyons of time here in the West, something like a Tolstoyan echo is 
ringing these days: Happy history is all alike, while every unhappy history is 
unhappy in its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five or so years, headline writers have not been able to resist 
telling us with terms such as showdown and shootout and other macho bull roar 
that, lo, the "old" frontier history and the "new" western history are in 
conflict. In a lot of ways, they are: consider the quotes above, one 
oldfangledly exuberant that things were at their "greatest" when the tracks of 
a transcontinental railroad were being laid across the West, the other 
politically corrective in its chiding stipulation that the West needs to be 
thought of as domestic at "heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those of us leery of scholarly arguments perk up at a match over whether 
the American West is properly a Mrs., Mr., Ms. or myth, don't we? But where to 
begin, in any sorting of suddenly omnipresent western historians (28 of them 
here in "The Oxford History" alone) and their oldness or newness? 
</P>
<P>
 How about with the fact that, battling or otherwise, the Union Pacific 
railroad never passed within a good many miles of South Pass, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Allen Billington was a dashing classroom lecturer (no, you can't look up 
my Northwestern University transcript and find out what grade he gave me; I 
simply sat in on his popular "Cowboys and Indians" course) who, when he stopped 
to think about it, knew perfectly well that it was the Oregon Trail wagon 
trains that crossed the Continental Divide at South Pass and that the later 
Union Pacific railroad route ran farther, um, south. But in his textbook 
persona Billington was a busy interpreter of Frederick Jackson Turner's famous 
1893 key-to-all-the-doors-of-the-kingdom assertion that "the frontier is the 
outer edge of the wave -- the meeting point between savagery and civilization . 
. . the line of most rapid and effective Americanization." Today's generation 
of textbook-dominating historians, quite a number of them born and raised in 
the West and/or forged by the heated issues of the 1960s -- do not see the 
West's past along that inexorable and triumphal frontier alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the middle of all this comes the just-issued "Oxford History of the 
American West," and, at 4 pounds, 3 ounces, it makes considerable ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for its target audience of "readers who wish to be well informed, 
but not overwhelmed," the Oxford's trio of editors looked at their expanse of 
pages and decided to organize, organize, organize: 
</P>
<P>
 Section I, Heritage, with essays such as "Native Peoples and Native Histories" 
and "The Spanish-Mexican Rim." 
</P>
<P>
 Section II, Expansion, with essays including "A Saga of Families," "Religion 
and Spirituality" and "Violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Section III, Transformation, which takes in wide-ranging essays such as "Wage 
Earners and Wealth Makers" and "Landscapes of Abundance and Scarcity." 
</P>
<P>
 Section IV, Interpretation, about the West on the page, palette, celluloid, 
bumper sticker and so on, more of which anon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This volume does not ignore the concepts of Frederick Jackson Turner or his 
intellectual legacy," co-editor Clyde A. Milner II maintains in this book's 
introduction, "but its assembled authors make their own case for the 
significance of the history of the American West." The zestiest of those cases 
seemed to me in articles such as Jay Gitlin's "Empires of Trade, Hinterlands of 
Settlement," in which he joyfully rummages through world history looking for 
attachments to America's frontiers ("This is also a story of -- in the words of 
the historian Fernand Braudel -- 'dietary frontiers.' ") and the 
hey-history-does-have-consequences essay, "Contemporary Peoples/Contested 
Places," by Sarah Deutsch, George J. Sanchez, and Gary Y. Okihiro. Perhaps not 
coincidentally, this latter survey of racial, ethnic and cultural flash points 
(its subheadings include "Delano," "San Francisco City Hall" and "Florence and 
Normandie") is the most California-centered piece in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us now dispraise the "Literary West" segment and get it over with. Thomas 
J. Lyons' chapter is one of the most traditional in the book, and the tradition 
I have in mind is the old one of historians staying determinedly out of date, 
by a decade or two, about anything that smacks of modern writing. (In three 
successive editions of their standard American history textbook, between 1937 
and 1950, Samuel E. Morison and Henry Steele Commager opined that the Southern 
author of "The Sound and the Fury" wrote "tales signifying nothing"; their 1950 
edition thus missed the news that William Faulkner had won the Nobel Prize for 
Literature the year before.) For anyone wanting specifics on prose in the 
American West since, say, Norman Maclean's "A River Runs Through It" was 
published in 1976, this 1994 Oxford treatment is shy of Rudolfo Anaya, Rick 
Bass, Mary Clearman Blew, Joan Didion, Harriet Doerr, Michael Dorris, Gretel 
Ehrlich, Louise Erdrich, Judith Freeman, Linda Hogan, Teresa Jordan, Barbara 
Kingsolver, Maxine Hong Kingston, Cormac McCarthy, Thomas McGuane. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the other, "newer" historical hand, if you had the impulse during "Dances 
With Wolves" to yelp out "Kevin, leave that wolf alone! Put that wolf back 
where you found it!" then has Richard White got an essay for you. When White 
goes over the ground with his encyclopedic artillery, a piece of historical 
territory never quite looks the same afterward. In his "Animals and Enterprise" 
essay, he ranges back to when "the West was a biological republic," carries the 
story to the European-wrought change to "animals of enterprise, which gleaned 
the energy of western ecosystems . . . to produce hides, meat, and wool that 
found markets all over the world" and up to just yesterday with his conclusion 
that although "Dances With Wolves" "seemed to reject the commodification of 
animals . . . the film itself was a commodity: the audience paid for the 
sentiments, and the animals were highly trained. Regarded this way, the film 
was also what it condemned: yet another stage in the evolution of animals of 
enterprise in the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as remarkable, in its way, as White's eon-wide grasp of topics is the 
Oregon factor. In 1965, Earl Pomeroy of the University of Oregon brought out 
"The Pacific Slope," which made the invaluable (and then-newish) point that the 
West is also a citified place. Pomeroy's successor at Oregon, Richard Maxwell 
Brown, now one of the deans of western history in his own right, shows the same 
calm, independent thinking in his Oxford consideration of the roots of American 
violence; Brown not only discerns a violence-employing "Western Civil War of 
Incorporation" from the 1850s to 1919, he maps it out and decodes it for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken all in all, then, "The Oxford History of the American West" seems to me 
best at its most provocative. If the approaches of the "new" western historians 
end up costing the West its trademark cliches, its Louis L'Armourism and John 
Waynery, so much the better. A side of America where the mission church of San 
Xavier del Bac sits like a conquistador's dropped jewel box outside modern 
Tucson; where Gary Snyder and Jack Kerouac peered with wild surmise from U.S. 
Forest Service lookout towers in Washington's North Cascades in forest-fire 
summers past; where the corduroy and velvet fields of the Sacramento Valley 
agricultural factory practically run into the runway of the Sacramento airport; 
an American palimpsest of so many maps, mental and actual, surely deserves 
ongoing histories, in the plural.

TELEVISION; A DAY IN THE LIFE OF QVC; AT THE HOME-SHOPPING GIANT, THE REAL 
ACTION HAS LITTLE TO DOWITH STOCK DEALS, TAKEOVERS OR THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVE 
TV. LET'S START BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE DROP TEST AND SOME TWEETY BIRD 
FIGURINES . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STRAUSS, Robert Strauss is the television critic for the Asbury Park 
Press in New Jersey. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Enders sits at his workstation in his white lab coat concentrating on his 
mission. As supervisor of hard goods in the Quality Assurance Laboratory, he is 
an important first line of defense against improprieties, impurities and other 
pitfalls for his employer, the QVC Network. 
</P>
<P>
 On Enders' desk is a pewter figurine of Tweety Bird. It is about half a foot 
high and is clad in prospector garb, his binoculars quite outsized. 
</P>
<P>
 Enders has pushed, prodded and cuddled his pewter prospecting Tweety and has 
found no discernible flaws. Best of all, Tweety has passed the most crucial of 
all QVC Quality Assurance Lab hurdles, the fabled Drop Test. Over and over 
again, Enders has placed this very Tweety and several of his mass-produced bird 
brethren in their black velvet pouch carrying cases and dropped them from his 
waist. Over and over, the Tweetys emerged uncracked, unpimpled, unscathed -- 
products worthy of sale on and shipment from QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the same for the Warner Bros. wooden bobble-head dolls on an 
adjacent table. Many of the heads bobbled off in their crucial Drop Tests, 
either their glue or their headsprings inadequate. Enders put his thumb down. 
They would not appear on QVC until their packing or their head glue were shored 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't send out items that will fall apart in normal shipping," said QVC 
spokeswoman Amy Jackson. "The Drop Test weeds that out, and we just send items 
back to the manufacturers so they can get it right. Quality -- that's the 
reputation QVC has developed. The Quality Assurance Lab may be our most 
important link to our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Folks have been watching a lot of QVC (the initials stand for "Quality, Value, 
Convenience") lately. Some of those folks have been business types, especially 
after former Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller bought into QVC and became its 
chairman in January, 1993. Gossip-mongers and stock analysts sent and received 
tremors about what Diller would do: He'd be the Father of Home Shopping, the 
Honcho of Interactive TV, the Grand Vizier of All New Media. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the whole hoo-hah around the bidding war between QVC and Viacom 
(the parent of the Nickelodeon and MTV networks) over Paramount. Diller lost, 
but issued a brief statement: "Next." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of those who watch QVC have no concern about Diller or Paramount or 
stock prices or the future of interactive TV. What they want is their 
Diamonique silver earrings or their Joyce Chen wok sets or their JVC 
camcorders. They've seen them on their TV and they want them. Now! 
</P>
<P>
 Enough of those folks have watched QVC that the network has gone from a 
shoestring start-up to a $1.2-billion company in just seven years. QVC has 
carved out a niche as the upscale TV shopping service, as opposed to its 
competitor, Home Shopping Network, which has generally thrived on selling 
cheaper merchandise with less creative programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, QVC has become the salesway to the stars. Diller pal Diane Von 
Furstenberg sells her fashion lines on QVC. So, too, do fashion nameplates 
Elizabeth Arden, Kenneth Jay Lane and Criscione. Regis Philbin has sold 
heart-rehabilitation exercise videos on QVC. Sporting MVPs Cal Ripken of the 
Baltimore Orioles and Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys have watched hundreds 
of their limited-edition memorabilia be snapped up on the network. Willie 
Nelson, Tova Borgnine, Cindy Williams, Morgan Fairchild, Leslie Nielsen, 
William Shatner and Paul Prudhomme all appeared on QVC in a three-week period 
this winter selling merrily away. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these celebs and all of these products don't go to a lavish studio in 
Hollywood or a historic theater in Manhattan but to a run-of-the-mill brown 
brick three-story office complex in the Goshen Corporate Center, an industrial 
park 30 miles west of Philadelphia -- a place so exurban there is still a 
working farm complete with a 19th-Century farmhouse, barn and silo on the 
property next to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 What brings the stars and the marketers to the Salesplace of Dreams is this: 
More and more people are spending more and more money buying things on 
television, and QVC, they believe, has found the way to do it best. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Principal faces many obstacles this February morning. Rural 
Pennsylvania has been socked in by one of the 15 ice- and snowstorms that have 
hit this winter, making her trip to the QVC studios a dicey affair. A few days 
before, she sliced her right hand with a knife while doing some home electrical 
repairs. And now her advisers have asked her to jazz up her latest appearance 
on QVC to sell her personalized skin-care product line by having her take live 
phone calls from buyer-viewers despite the injured hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But there the former "Dallas" star is, looking peppy and beautiful as ever, up 
on the "living room" set -- part of a huge Lazy Susan of four sets that rotate 
to match the emphasis of the particular QVC selling hour. She is here to sell 
her skin care line, the Principal Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The first product up for the hour is Intensive Serum With AHA, which costs $45 
retail, according to the large bar with the gray background that almost 
constantly runs up the left side of TV screens tuned to QVC. That price has a 
vivid slash through it. Underneath, the skin-softening serum, product A19005 in 
the QVC catalogue, is being offered for the "introductory price" of $34.14. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start using this on Monday, you will see the results Monday night and 
everyone will see a difference by Wednesday," Principal tells the audience at 
home confidently. "A lot of us have beautiful skin, but we have to learn to 
bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Rudolph Treacy, an immaculately dressed sprite of a woman, is the hour's 
QVC hostess. Treacy describes herself as a "motor mouth," but she gets a rest 
from her explaining and soft-selling duties with Principal around. Principal 
has been coming to sell on QVC four to six weekends a year since 1991, before 
Diller and his cache of stars started venturing into the strange world of TV 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started doing this, I was told by everyone that it could destroy 
my career, and my friends were genuinely and deeply concerned," Principal said 
in an interview after her appearance. "Now I think their attitudes and opinions 
have radically changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is Principal's bottom line that has convinced them. In less than 
the usual six minutes QVC allots for a product on the air, more than 5,000 
bottles of Intensive Serum With AHA were sold. Neither QVC nor Principal would 
divulge the actress's percentage of the take, but even at a conservative 5%, 
that's a cool $8,500 for six minutes' work. Principal's spokesman said that 
during that February Saturday hour, QVC sold $750,000 worth of Principal Secret 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Principal said she loves the spontaneity of it all even more. She 
ambled up to the bank of phone order-takers, just in front of the set where a 
studio audience might be in other studios, and answered the phone herself live 
on the air. There was Sandy from Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had seborrhea for several years and was able to throw away my medication 
soon after using (the AHA serum) with the blessing of my dermatologist," gushed 
Sandy. And, by the way, said Sandy, the dermatologist said he went to high 
school with Principal. "Did he tell you I got A's in biology?" the actress said 
with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I love about this is that it's live. There's an element of danger and 
the unexpected about live television that I absolutely love," Principal said. 
"I really thrive on it because this really is my product. I really know it 
inside out and I'm not scared; you can ask me anything. By the way, I wouldn't 
envy anybody who is up there faking it. . . . That's when selling on TV doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not all that long ago when it wasn't certain that selling on 
TV, at least the QVC way, would work at all. In April, 1986, Home Shopping 
Network became the first national all-shopping channel. That summer, no fewer 
than 17 entities, from department stores to auction services to now-defunct 
gonzo consumer-electronics marketer Crazy Eddie, announced they had plans for a 
shopping channel. One of those folks was Joseph Segel, the founder of the 
Franklin Mint, the suburban Philadelphia-based makers of mail-order 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe was thinking about some kind of direct-marketing business and he saw Home 
Shopping Network and said, 'Well, this looks like a good business. We'll do 
this too,' " said Douglas Briggs, who worked for Segel at the Franklin Mint and 
is now QVC's president, answering only to Diller (Segel is chairman emeritus). 
"It was so hot at the time, Joe was able to raise over $20 million to start 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC needed every bit of that money. Segel demanded state-of-the-art 
broadcasting equipment and hired several TV types to teach his Franklin Mint 
marketers how to do the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost went bankrupt six months into it," said Briggs, whose office is 
rather restrained for a man running a $1.2-billion business. You can actually 
walk across it in a few easy steps, with the only significant adornments being 
TVs tuned to QVC and rival Home Shopping Network. "Running out of cash creates 
a certain kind of culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, we used to go, all of us, to pack product in the warehouse 
after working all day. We took inventories. We answered phones. If we had a 
product that was getting lots of calls on the air, these yellow lights would 
come on, and all of us, secretaries and vice presidents, would go to the 
phones. It's amazing how far we've come so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, of the 17 would-be challengers to the Home Shopping Network, only QVC 
made it past the first year. Now it has 5,300 lines branching out from the 
toll-free ordering number that runs across the bottom of the TV screen 24 hours 
a day, answered by those operators in front of the Lazy Susan set (and others 
in Chesapeake, Va., and San Antonio) and automated 
leave-your-credit-card-number messages as well. 
</P>
<P>
 You can order what is on the air at the moment or ask the operators about any 
of the 1,000 or so items that have appeared on the air during the last month, 
the usual length QVC keeps its products in warehouses at the home office in 
West Chester, in Lancaster, Pa., and in Suffolk, Va. A no-questions-asked, 
money-back guarantee is standard. (QVC says the return rate is 19%.) 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, on Diller's orders, QVC instituted a goal of shipping a 
product to a customer within 24 hours of the phone order. With 70,000 orders a 
day, that's no minuscule task. Still, QVC claims that 99.98% of its orders have 
been sent out accurately. Of its 125 full-time packing employees in West 
Chester, 80% made no mistakes all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the folks at QVC are happy with all these lovely statistics, they 
are quite aware of the footsteps tromping heavily behind them. Lots of people 
with big names and apparently deep pockets, from Time Warner to the Spiegel 
Catalogue people to Nordstrom, the department store chain, have announced plans 
to have their own shopping channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, this is a very difficult thing to do," said Steve Tomlin, QVC's vice 
president and general manager of interactive technology, internally known as 
"vice president of what's next." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all busy people and you have to put something there," said Tomlin, 
pointing to a TV set in his small, windowless office, cramped with 
computer-program boxes, "to make me put down my magazine or stop interacting 
with my kids. There are only a few people in TV and Hollywood who can do it 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, you have to fulfill -- the basic blocking and tackling of retail. 
You are out there in cyberspace at the virtual mall shopping for your virtual 
shirt. Does that virtual shirt become a real shirt? Is it the right size? Is it 
the right color? If you have a problem with it, is there an easy way to get it 
resolved? Those two things, programming and fulfillment, are both separately 
hard to do. Not many companies have done them well just individually. Bringing 
them together in the televised shopping arena has been very difficult. Exactly 
two -- QVC and HSN -- have stood the test of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin draws charts on his blackboard to show that there is about $1 trillion 
in retail sales every year. A little lumpy line shows QVC's $1.2-billion share 
of that. A big glob Tomlin draws above that indicates the huge segment QVC can 
still shoot for. 
</P>
<P>
 But how to get it? On-line services have not been able to break significantly 
into the market, for they are inherently short on programming. Interactive 
television is still in its dreaming state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unsure what the winning technology model is there, not to mention 
whether the winning business model is there," Tomlin said. "And if you build 
it, will they come? And at what price? But it is the Holy Grail. It is what 
everyone is shooting for." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, QVC is looking to expand its base further and further. QVC itself 
will launch another cable channel this summer. During weekdays, OnQ will target 
the 18-to-35 age group, which has so far shunned TV shopping, with 
younger-oriented clothing and merchandise. On weekends, the channel will 
transform itself to Q2 and feature up-market leisure products -- trips, 
exercise equipment and the like -- to the other hard-to-reach group, 
upper-income shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, QVC is creating its own proprietary brands and continuing to 
forge partnerships, like those with Von Furstenberg, for exclusive products for 
QVC. QVC has entered partnerships with museums and movie studios to sell their 
souvenirs and such. And even as it tries to be more global, QVC is looking to 
be more parochial as well, looking into local TV shopping shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard to present the right product for the whole nation," said QVC 
President Briggs. "I believe that the person outside of Atlanta and the person 
in Texas and the person in Wyoming perceive us in different ways: accents, what 
is talked about. So we try to take that out of the show as much as we can. But 
by taking it out, you create vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if some hours of each day, you go local?" Briggs said excitedly. "They 
go on, let's say it's springtime, and a guy says, 'This is the weekend you 
should be planting your azaleas and Jake's Nursery from here in town will 
deliver to your home on Saturday morning a dozen azalea plants and all the 
things you need to plant them for $40. Just call now!' 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get people to use the TV to buy locally, they will start to use the 
rest of the service," Briggs talks even more excitedly as more and more new 
ideas for televised shopping flow. "What if you could get your groceries by it 
with no significant extra charge? What if. . . . Well, there is so much more 
for us to shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Rudolph Treacy was back living with her mother in suburban Philadelphia. 
She had wanted to be a ballet dancer and a sports announcer. Neither was 
particularly happening at the moment. In fact, nothing was particularly 
happening. She had been at one or another local TV news department for the last 
several years and was between jobs. She was wavering about answering a 
classified ad in the Philadelphia Inquirer from a new company looking for a TV 
host. She'd never sold anything. She was a journalist, for gosh sakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother said, 'Of course you can do it. Here, sell me this pencil,' " 
Treacy said. "So I took the pencil and I told her you can draw with it. And you 
can write with it. You can write love letters with it. I really sold that 
pencil in every way I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I walked into the building a few hours later and a gentleman said to me, 
'It's actually very simple. We just want to see how impromptu you can be in 
front of the camera. Please present this pencil,' " said Treacy, grinning as 
she no doubt did that day seven years ago. "My fate was sealed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the original QVC hosts had limited television experience. A few were 
from sales. Others just hit the right note with the interviewers. Kathy Levine, 
another original host still with the network, was a hotel clerk when she was 
hired. All have now become celebrities of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
 When QVC began, founder Segel decided that each hour had to have only one kind 
of product, which was quite different from the willy-nilly approaches of early 
home shopping. He also insisted that the hosts be able to chat knowledgeably 
not only about the product at hand but also about history, art and life in 
general. To that end, QVC hosts still attend myriad seminars and read reams 
about each product they handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Treacy and the other hosts are often on the stage alone speaking only to 
disembodied robot cameras in front of them. Behind the cameras are the banks of 
phone operators, Segel's idea for that being that at least the operators 
simulate some kind of audience for the hosts to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, off to one side are tables on which production assistants place 
the items to be sold for the day. Hosts gather around their particular table, 
reading index cards chock-full of every conceivable detail about each product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we have elevated the knowledge of our viewers, but they are very 
savvy shoppers and listeners," Treacy said. "That's why you don't go on the air 
unless you know something inside out and backward. They can tell when you don't 
do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, back in the three Quality Assurance Labs (Hard Goods, Jewelry and 
Clothing), the QVC nit-picking team is weeding through seemingly zillions of 
items. Dress samples are stomped on, pulled violently at every seam, 
dry-cleaned to death. Every shipment of jewelry is scanned both electronically 
and by QVC staff gemologists. In the old days, a lot of stuff was rejected. 
These days, with the competition to get on QVC, vendors are tending to get 
things right the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all this success, there is a bit of defensiveness at QVC about 
its TV shopping mission. There are still a few hokey things on the air: a 
Ping-Pong ball lucky number drawing each hour with the winner getting a $10 
shopping credit on QVC and a chance at one of five daily $1,000 "shopping 
sprees."

<P>
 "Let's face it, 900 phone numbers or whatever, the early pioneers are not the 
ones who popularize new (retailing schemes) or bring it to its highest level," 
said Tomlin, the vice president of interactive technology. "In fact, sometimes 
you have to overcome some credibility problems established by the early 
pioneers, which is what I hope we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Said QVC President Briggs: "Look, the hardest point of direct marketing, when 
you come down to it, is trust. All direct marketers face that. What makes our 
show successful is that we establish that trust level by not exaggerating the 
benefits of a product, or the easy return privileges, or the friendly host or 
the lack of a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can never be satisfied," Briggs said with the sigh of a man whose 
legs are always revving toward the future. "If you start to think you have it, 
you wake up a couple of weeks later and you realize things are going the other 
way."

 I just heard that ABC is canceling "Missing Persons" and "Byrds of 
Paradise."And any other show we liked. Just when I said to my husband, "Let's 
cancel HBO and just keep regular cable because TV is coming out with some shows 
like 'Missing Persons' and 'Christy' (CBS). The only shows that (the networks) 
keep on the air are those stupid sitcoms. Give us some variety.

 "Byrds of Paradise" was such a great family show and one all ages could enjoy. 
Please consider bringing a family-oriented program back.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; CHILD-ABUSE SPECIAL AIMS TO BREAK 
THE SILENCE AND WALL OF SELF-BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Things are definitely not better left unsaid: That's the message of Tuesday's 
CBS prime-time special Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Using both animation and live action, including interviews, the show focuses 
on physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect. Tales of abuse are told through 
the voices and stories of four young people, two boys and two girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Animation sequences, interwoven throughout the narration, depict the 
frightening way children view things, without being uncomfortably graphic. For 
example, as cowering children are seen in line drawings, adult abusers often 
are shown as large, looming figures. The animation is intercut with a live 
interview with each child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful tool for parents to show their children how to protect 
themselves," says host Jane Seymour ("Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"), who is also 
a spokeswoman for Childhelp USA. "The most important thing is that children 
break the silence by not being ashamed to talk, to know that they aren't to 
blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Children often feel most wronged after trying to talk about abuse, Seymour 
points out. Parents or primary care givers can be in denial, leaving children 
with no one to share their worst experiences. It's imperative that kids not 
only have someone to talk to, but also someone who will listen and believe, she 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also hopes to teach children who haven't suffered abuse to become 
good listeners and advise their lesser-informed peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The depictions -- and subsequent solutions -- are presented in a simple, 
direct manner so that even very young children can understand. Parents are 
offered ways to detect behavioral changes that might be signs of something 
wrong. Options for legal action are explored as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our kids to worry about strangers, but abuse doesn't really happen 
with strangers. More often, it happens with people kids know," Seymour 
emphasizes. "Parents need to be educated along with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse" airs 8-8:30 p.m. Tuesday on CBS. 
For ages 6 and up. Another Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager, as yet unnamed, is lying in a dark stairwell, shot. Paramedics 
rush him to a Bronx hospital. The scene resembles an episode of "Rescue 911," 
but there's something different: Reporters covering the story are the victim's 
peers. In the Mix teens Melanie Glickson and Kevin Jordan better not be afraid 
of the sight of blood, because on Sunday they follow the victim from the site 
of the shooting to the hospital and await results of emergency surgery. They 
talk to medical personnel, as well as the victim's friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Like an MTV-influenced "60 Minutes" for teens, "In the Mix" offers a 
combination of news and feature stories as well as profiles and segments geared 
directly for teen-age audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsmagazine recently began its second season, with a change in format, 
going from an hour to half an hour. The "mix" now means shows on single topics 
and shows with a variety of segments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we're able to explore a topic in an in-depth way," says executive 
producer Sue Castle, who adds that the shorter-format show is easier for PBS 
stations to put into their schedule. "We're also really excited about two 
upcoming specials. We're looking into what the topics should be right now." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the series looks at legal rights; alcoholism, toxicity and drunk 
driving; teen pregnancy; safety, and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the show covered such topics as violence; teen parents; eating 
disorders; jobs and interracial dating. It's also been a showcase for such 
celebrities as the Spin Doctors, INXS, Christian Slater, Chuck D., Salt 'N' 
Pepa, Kadeem Hardison and Natalie Merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 New reporters Andrea Barrow, Tamah Krinsky, Julio Rivera and Logan Campbell 
join Glickson and Jordan to form a rotating team. All from the New York area, 
they range in age from 15 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping up to date on what interests teens plays a vital role for the show. 
Castle points out that through arranged focus groups, teens get together and 
talk about what's important to them helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Mix" reflects their interests.

COMMENTARY; GO AHEAD! RUIN OUR CREDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WALSTAD, David Walstad is a free-lance entertainment writer based in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until a year or so ago, if you wondered who the artist or craftsperson was who 
composed the music, supervised production, applied the makeup or acted in a 
role, you had a chance of catching their name in the end credits -- even if 
they scrolled by fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with end credits electronically squeezed into a corner -- so "The Tonight 
Shows's" Jay Leno, "Good Morning America's" Charles Gibson or your local news 
anchor fill 75% of the screen to promote their programs -- forget it. By 
shoving aside the end-title sequence, the broadcast and cable networks and 
local stations make it virtually impossible for the home viewer to discover 
ordinary things -- such as who played Murphy Brown's secretary of the week, for 
instance, or to listen to the "Sisters" theme music, or learn in what 
right-to-work state the latest lurid docudrama was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 This cluttering practice is yet another way broadcasters carve additional time 
out of their programs for promotional purposes. It hasn't gone unnoticed by the 
Hollywood production community's powerful guilds and unions. Glen Gumpel, 
executive director of the Directors Guild of America, whose members include TV 
and feature film directors as well as production managers and assistant 
directors, charges: "What the networks are doing very clearly is getting free 
commercials. They're actually appropriating time that we bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an issue that's going to go away quietly. ... We're having ongoing 
discussions with NBC and ABC." 
</P>
<P>
 In instances of cable networks such as the Family Channel, certainly one of 
the most frequent practitioners of what we will now call "squeezing," Gumpel 
replies: "You have to rely on your relationship with program suppliers," i.e. 
studios and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 DGA member Steve Tramz, currently serving as first assistant director on Fox's 
"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." sounds off: "It's very offensive. People 
have worked long and hard to get some recognition." Tramz complains that 
"Brisco's" credits are routinely shoved aside so Fox can pitch "The X-Files," 
which follows the madcap Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most writing credits appear prominently at the beginning or end of a 
show, Writers Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Roden says, "The Writers Guid of America 
would object strenuously were we to be notified writing credits were squeezed 
into a portion of the screen. The provisions of our contract would prohibit 
that. The networks can't ignore our licensing agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the musicians union admits its clout isn't as strong as some 
of the other guilds. 
</P>
<P>
 Member Dennis J. Dreith, a composer-conductor whose credits include "Columbo," 
said he believes squeezing "represents greed on the part of the networks and 
broadcasters. The technical people are totally pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, because from a contractual point there's very little we can 
do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert defends the intrusion. "Yes, we really 
do need the additional promo time," he says. "And we're careful not to start 
the squeeze until after those credits -- representing unions with which the 
network has specific contracts have passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-director Clint Eastwood was unaware that the networks and local stations 
were shoving aside the end titles to some of his features -- "Pale Rider," 
"Firefox" and the "Dirty Harry" films to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 His solution carries with it a nostalgia for the way things used to be in 
features. "I think there are too many credits today," he says. "I like the old 
days where you'd have a few names on each (title) card and then the movie would 
begin."

MOVIES; IF EVERYBODY HAD AN OCEAN . . . ; YES, IT'S ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT PEOPLE 
WITH A LOVE FOR WEARING THONGS. 'ENDLESS SUMMER II' ARRIVES THREE DECADES AFTER 
ITS ACCLAIMED PREDECESSOR CELEBRATED A LIFESTYLE

 It's been 30 years since director-surfer Bruce Brown released his epic surf 
film "Endless Summer," which chronicled the travels of Robert August and Mike 
Hynson as they journeyed around the world looking for the perfect wave. That 
movie, made for $50,000 using one windup 16-millimeter camera, was one of the 
Top 10 box-office hits of 1964 and went on to earn more than $30 million 
worldwide. Released in the same year as "Ride the Wild Surf," "Beach Blanket 
Bingo" and "Surf Party," not to mention "Zorba the Greek," "Endless Summer" 
eclipsed its companion surf flicks and is still hailed as one of the purest 
expressions of the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, Brown has returned with "Endless Summer II," which 
opens Friday. Cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, "ES II" follows a 
pair of new surfers who represent the two main styles in surfing. Robert 
(Wingnut) Weaver is a classic long-boarder, who goes with the wave, carving 
graceful turns. Pat O'Connell represents the new surfing style, using a short 
board to "shred" the waves with sharp turns and radical maneuvers. With Weaver 
and O'Connell, Brown visits many of the places he explored in 1964, noting with 
both enthusiasm and wisdom the development in the changing surfscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend surfers Kalle Matso and Scott White explore some of the issues 
surrounding "Endless Summer II" and surf films in general, including: What is 
the appeal of surf movies versus other sports films? How does the 
"surfumentary" format compare with those surfing films that have fictional 
characters and actors who can't surf? And, of course, does "Endless Summer II" 
appeal just to surfers or is there something for inlanders as well? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White: What I'm wondering is if filmgoers in the '90s will pay $7 to see a 
documentary on two guys who just love to surf. The last big surfing movie was 
"Point Break" in 1991, and the only reason it was made was because it had this 
slick Hollywood story line and two popular leading men -- non-surfers Keanu 
Reeves and Patrick Swayze. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I think it's kind of cool to see a movie that doesn't have some hastily 
constructed plot line that is just there to give a framework for the main 
activity. The filmmakers could have easily created a tawdry love triangle plot 
where some native falls in love with Pat but has more respect for Wingnut. It 
would certainly broaden the appeal of the movie and make it more commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 White: On the other hand, adding some trumped up story line would have 
negative effects as well. One of the cool things about the movie is that there 
are these candid discussions about the art of surfing with superstars like 
Kelly Slater, Gerry Lopez and Tommy Curren. Otherwise, you have some hack 
writer's inaccurate conception of what surfing's all about, squeezed in between 
scenes of Patrick Swayze splashing around like a 3-year-old in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Well, we've already established that "Point Break" sucked from a 
surfing perspective. But other movies, like "North Shore" and "Big Wednesday," 
have been successful in combining story lines with good surfing action. The 
plots served as nice buffers for radical ocean scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I'm not saying I don't like films that mix fiction with surfing. I'm 
just stoked to see a documentary about surfing because it's a misunderstood 
sport, and one that has spawned a large and rapidly growing American 
subculture. Surfing's influences on America can be seen in everything from the 
way people dress to the way they speak. Still, I can't think of any sport that 
has generated such a strong -- and sometimes negative -- image. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That's true. As soon as people find out that you're a surfer, or even 
from Southern California, they immediately decide you've spent way too much 
time in the sun and start speaking very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Yeah. If you tell people you're from Augusta, they don't ask you if 
you're "one of those golfer dudes." If I mention to anyone outside of 
California that I surf occasionally, I automatically inherit this lame 
"slacker" attitude a la Jeff Spicoli from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
People are very surprised that my mantra isn't "Hey, Bud. Let's party!" 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But doesn't every sport have stereotypical attributes? 
</P>
<P>
 White: No. People don't say "Oh. He's such a baseball player" unless they're 
referring to someone who has great hand-eye coordination and is 20 pounds 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But it's not just image. Even in terms of mechanics, surfing is 
fundamentally different from most activities. Few sports besides surfing 
involve dynamic motion by both the athlete and the medium (i.e., the ocean). 
</P>
<P>
 White: Exactly. Surfing is completely dependent on the whims of nature and 
that has an effect on the surfers themselves, who are often unusually reverent 
of the environment, spontaneous, patient and posses a weird penchant for 
thongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: And these traits come through in both "Endless Summers" and most of the 
other big surfing films that have come out of Hollywood in the last 30 years. 
"Big Wednesday," "North Shore" and even "Point Break" throw out the concept of 
these deep, pensive "soul" surfers. Patrick Swayze's character is called 
Bodhisattva because he's so into the metaphysics of surfing -- that and armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Hollywood certainly didn't invent the soulful quality that exudes from 
surf movies. All you have to do is grab a longboard, get in the ocean and catch 
a few waves and you realize that surfing is undeniably more spiritual than 
truck-pulling. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Besides surfing, I'd have to say that baseball is the only pastime that 
evokes these profound feelings. Look at "The Natural" and "Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 White: But the reasons for that are more historical. There's nothing 
empirically spiritual about baseball. Just when you really start to discover 
things about yourself, someone charges the mound. I really think that surfing 
has some kind of intangible draw. The first "Endless Summer" was released in 
1964 and was one of the top 10 grossing films of the year. How do you explain 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: It was competing with "McHale's Navy." How bad could it do? Also, 
surfing was such a novel sport in 1964. Today, you can't even call inlanders 
"Barney" because they know they're being insulted. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I don't think novelty is the only reason people liked "Endless Summer." 
Both the original film and "Endless Summer II" can be enjoyed on many levels. I 
thought it was cool that the sequel follows roughly the same path pioneered by 
the original 30 years ago. It's interesting to see the enormous changes that 
took place in the interim, especially in Africa. In the first movie, the locals 
were mostly agrarians. In "Endless Summer II," they're selling time-share 
condos. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: It's just hard for me to believe that this movie will be well-received 
by the non-surfing community. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Why? Surfing movies do very well in parts of the world that are 
extremely alienated from surfing. The title of this movie alone is enough to 
hook Scandinavians, most of whom would be ecstatic for a two-week summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That's true. Perhaps, as a surfer from Southern California, I'm taking 
the aesthetics of the sport for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Everything that is associated with surfing -- sunshine, clear water, 
athletic people -- has universal appeal. I mean, look at the worldwide success 
of "Baywatch." It's one of the best-rated series in Germany, right behind 
"Wolfgang and der Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I've heard other people say that the "Endless Summer" series is like 
Warren Miller's ski films, with more babes and fewer chairlift antics. But I 
see some real differences between the two. Most importantly, almost everyone 
dabbles in skiing. Surfing, on the other hand, is much more of an 
all-or-nothing sport. Either you don't surf and never intend to, or you spend 
all your lunch breaks checking the tide chart in the Metro section. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Your point being. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That "Endless Summer II" might have the most polarized audience ever. 
Because of the very nature of surfing, people will either worship this movie, 
or think it's a mildly interesting travel film that spends too much time in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I disagree. I don't believe that people have to have an affinity for a 
sport to appreciate and be moved by it. There is something inherently thrilling 
in watching two guys in search of the perfect ride, a search that takes them to 
both familiar and exotic places all over the world. I also think it's a tribute 
to surfing's dynamic quality that a film like this is even made. I doubt that 
we will ever see a movie about two track and field athletes entitled "Endless 
Vaulting." That, to me, is the real reason that "Endless Summer" and "Endless 
Summer II" were made . . . to show that surfing isn't just standing on a board. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Aren't you just saying that surfing is much more than a sport? That 
it's way of life, an attitude? 
</P>
<P>
 White: That's exactly what I'm saying. Did a surfer say that? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: No -- Jeff Spicoli did in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."

 BALSAMROOT: A Memoir by Mary Clearman Blew. (Viking: $20.95; 212 pp.) Mary 
Clearman Blew, author of "All But the Waltz," and two short story collections, 
is on some people's best western writing short list.Born and raised in Montana, 
much of her writing ferrets out the Montana history and landscape in her own 
life experiences; characters from her youth and ancestry are analyzed for the 
choices they made with an eye to the choices she's making. In this book she 
ponders her relationship to quickly aging and newly dependent aunt, as well as 
an estranged and angry daughter. Efforts to honor the family code: "Never speak 
aloud of what you feel deeply," make these urgent tasks somewhat difficult and 
a little frustrating for the reader. When, as a reader, you feel the urge to do 
group therapy, it's time to focus on the fine writing; on the plant and animal 
life in the book; on the wonderful terse evocation of her maiden aunt's one 
love affair.

 A VALLEY IN ITALY: The Many Seasons of a Villa in Umbria by Lisa St. Aubin De 
Teran. (HarperCollins: $21; 224 pp.) One of the grand difficulties accompanying 
books about people who find the perfect fixer-upper villa in some gorgeous, 
flavorful but not too remote part of the world is that you must hate them with 
all your heart. The other, more interesting problem is: How they fit into the 
culture they invade and admire? What do they give back? Are their observations 
evidence that they travel with their own culture and experience keeping them 
afloat and apart like water wings? Or are they porous and dignified in their 
differentness? Having heaped so many caveats on these obnoxious pilgrims, let 
me now say that Lisa St. Aubin de Teran gets it right. Sure, she's a bit of a 
poseur, "instructed in the art of buying houses by Ted Hughes, our Poet 
Laureate, who explained to me that first I should find the house I wanted and 
then I should buy it, and only later worry about how to pay for it," and in our 
American culture delusions of grandeur, visions of loggias and balustrades and 
cantilevered thises and thats can be off-putting. You're supposed to know your 
place and what you can afford and keep your ego in check. Lisa St. Aubin de 
Teran takes her two children; 6-year-boy Allie, and 15-year-old future 
super-model "the child Iseult" with her to set up house in the Villa Orsola in 
the little village of San Orsela in the Umbrian hills.Her Scottish painter 
husband comes later. She has patience and imagination and a wonderful sense of 
humor. She has a kind of courage and equanimity and her observations of her own 
cast of characters is gracious and generous and respectful. After visiting this 
long with her, it was hard to leave -- a compliment to any hostess (or writer).

 READER'S DIGEST TRAVEL GUIDE USA (Reader's Digest: $32.95.) This is not a 
lovely book, not a book to leave lying around in the hopes of putting someone 
in the mood for doing something you want them to do (a common use for coffee 
table books and fine linen).Think of it as the traveler's equivalent of a great 
big seed catalogue. Think of it as an aide for the neurotic traveler, the kind 
who reads maps and calculates distances and plans day trips to outlying areas. 
Organized in chapters titled "Western States," "Central States" and "Eastern 
States," each section describes museums, national and state parks, historical 
sites and other less obvious attractions on the many detailed maps, like 
wineries and hot springs, nice looking city halls and zoos. Sure, it brings to 
mind station wagons full of screaming kids, but it's one way to travel. SUSAN

SUMMER SPLASH; LOST AMONG ALL THE CHOICES? LET THESE FOUR TOUR GUIDES SHOW YOU 
THE WAY; MARGARET CHO; 'SUNSET' TO VAN CLIBURN TO MEGA-TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, Robert Levine is a Times staff writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Cho doesn't plan on attending too many upscale events this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old comedian expects to take in the Moscow Philharmonic's July 11 
Hollywood Bowl concert with Van Cliburn and plans to see "Sunset Boulevard," 
but she says she'll also spend time catching rock concerts, watching 
reality-based television and attending monster truck events. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she runs in "young Hollywood circles," Cho has no plans to hit the 
Roxbury or the Viper Room. "I'm kind of low-end glamour," she says, smiling. "I 
can turn it out with the best of them (but) it's too obvious. It's too, like, 
what's expected of you if you live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cho's planning on a kitschy summer of "tiki luau parties," complete 
with surf music and limbo, in the back yard of the Hollywood Hills home she 
shares with four roommates. It'll also be a summer filled with infomercials, 
"Melrose Place" reruns and celebrity-watching at the Farmer's Market, an 
activity Cho continues to enjoy even now that she's recognizable as a 
successful stand-up comedian and the star of her own upcoming television 
series, "All American Girl," which will air on ABC starting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 She also may go to the exhibition of American art from the '80s at the UCLA 
Armand Hammer Museum of Art, partly out of nostalgia for the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she's also planning on some serious fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things that I do that are legitimately. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Unironic? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Cho says. "It's hard to think of what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 She plans on taking in quite a few unironic summer movies, including "Wyatt 
Earp," "The Mask" and "Natural Born Killers," though she's undecided on "Wolf," 
saying that the only true wolf for her is David Naughton, "who was 'An American 
Werewolf in London.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She's also looking forward to Disney's "The Lion King." "I know I'll love it," 
she says. "I always cry. (Disney animation) makes me very emotional."  
</P>
<P>
 Cho's also a rock fan, and she's planning on going to this summer's 
"Lollapalooza" concert, where she's looking forward to seeing Smashing Pumpkins 
and the Beastie Boys. She'll skip shows by older rockers like the Eagles and 
the Grateful Dead, but a Michael Bolton concert apparently has enough kitsch 
value for her to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert she's most excited about though, is the June 11 KROQ "Weenie 
Roast" at Irvine Meadows, which will feature such alternative rock bands as 
Boingo, the Pretenders, Pavement, Green Day and her "absolute favorite band in 
the whole world," the Afghan Whigs. Sandra Bernhard's late June one-woman show 
at the La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre is also a must-see for Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 She jokes about the July 16 Three Tenors concert at Dodger Stadium, with 
Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. "Well, I would go see the 
two tenors I know," she says, apparently more familiar with Pavarotti and 
Domingo than Carreras. 
</P>
<P>
 On the serious side, Cho will be hard at work on her new sitcom, which will 
focus on the cultural conflicts between the Korean American Cho and her 
character's traditional Korean family. She plans on taking a short trip to New 
Orleans and possibly going to San Francisco to visit her family, but she won't 
be going on the road as a stand-up comic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I travel so much for my job, vacation for me is staying home with the 
phone unplugged," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Cho will also be busy dealing with one of the downsides of summer in Los 
Angeles -- bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in a wooded area, so there's a lot of insects," Cho says. "I have used 
so much (Raid) that I turned my house into Three Mile Island. I have to find 
another solution. I think I could . . . talk them out of the house, make them 
realize that they're not in the house by choice, make them realize that it's OK 
to leave and reclaim the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a really good summer," Cho says. "You can really taste the 
air. It's oppressive and kind of gross." She smiles. "I won't have to smoke as 
many cigarettes."

SUMMER SPLASH; LOST AMONG ALL THE CHOICES? LET THESE FOUR TOUR GUIDES SHOW YOU 
THE WAY; ED RUSCHA; A VARIATION ON A THEME FOR SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't expect the usual summer entertainment choices from Edward Ruscha, the 
Venice-based artist who proved that carrot and blackberry juice were to paint 
with as well as to drink. The internationally known painter has some 
idiosyncratic arts choices worthy of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his interests are traditional, of course. Ruscha, 56, figures he sees 
most shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, for instance. Among summer exhibitions he's planning to 
attend are the J. Paul Getty Museum's centennial tribute to photographer Andre 
Kertesz as well as the coming MOCA exhibition of painter Bruce Nauman. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Ruscha is the quintessential Los Angeles artist whose canvases 
immortalized phrases like "Hollywood is a Verb" and "A Blvd. Called Sunset." 
He's the transplanted Oklahoman whose paint substitutes have included 
everything from ketchup, spinach and egg white to gunpowder, tobacco and 
Pepto-Bismol.  
</P>
<P>
 So he'll also be spending time at Culver City's Museum of Jurassic Technology, 
which, he adds immediately, "has no connection to Steven Spielberg." Ruscha is 
at a loss to describe the Venice Boulevard collection of artistic and 
scientific artifacts, but he calls it "the most quirky worthwhile museum I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruscha figures he spends more time in museums when he's in New York than he 
does here, however. Competing for his attention here, among other things, is 
car art. "I go out of my way to drive through East L.A. just to see Chicano car 
styling," says Ruscha. "I think it is Los Angeles' most indigenous art form." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruscha spends a lot of time in his car, and admits maps are among his favorite 
reading materials. "I read maps of any kind, anything that will hold the 
promise that I'll get out of this town for a short period." (He also mentions 
that he can get "great inspiration" from reading plumbing manuals.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are, in fact, a favored entertainment center for Ruscha. "I'm a driving 
person," he says. "I like driving around L.A. listening to radio." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite car radio entertainment comes not from a station but from a 
frequency: 88.5 FM. "It gives me two and sometimes three stations that overlap 
each other, simultaneously," he explains. "It's like a vegetable soup sound. I 
never know what the two or three stations are going to be. It's uplifting to me 
to hear these stations -- music, news, another kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Add in his year-round commute back and forth between his places in Los Angeles 
and in the desert. He'll tune in 88.5, of course, as well as an occasional news 
program or crusty commentator Paul Harvey. His favorite tapes include those by 
rhythm-and-blues legends Johnny Otis and Clyde McPhatter as well as by 
pioneering artist-musician Captain Beefheart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruscha is unlikely to attend a live concert, however. He'll take in boxing at 
the newly reopened Olympic Auditorium, a place he first visited 34 years ago, 
but he won't stand in line to buy concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he won't stand in line to buy movie tickets either. Ruscha made two 
"low, low budget" films himself 20 years ago and has appeared in other movies, 
but his unwillingness to wait in movie lines has sharply curtailed his 
movie-going.  
</P>
<P>
 The exception is movies by writer-director Quentin Tarantino, whose film "Pulp 
Fiction" is due out this summer. "I will stand in any line for any length of 
time to see one of his movies," Ruscha says. He was quite taken with 
Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," he says, "because it is so realistic. It makes 
you squirm, and I like movies that make me squirm. Although I know they're 
make-believe."  
</P>
<P>
 Given that he prefers seeing films in theaters rather than on video, he 
readily acknowledges missing most of the blockbusters of the past few years. 
But he also won't see any movie that smacks of sentimentality, saying "if the 
advertisement looks the least bit sentimental, I won't go."  
</P>
<P>
 Does this summer differ from other summers for Ruscha? "I haven't changed that 
much from year to year," the artist replies. "I'm a variation on a theme."

 VOICE LESSONS: On Becoming A Woman Writer by Nancy Mairs. (Beacon: $15; 166 
pp.) Where would we be without Nancy Mairs, vigilant chronicler of a woman's 
life, a writer's life? We'd be stuck trying to convert the 500 a year Virginia 
Woolf told us we'd need to write into billable hours, like immoral lawyers 
calculating backwards, that's where. It has been said already that she is 
fearless, can write about anything: depression, sex, adultery, religion and 
now, writing (in true life order of degree of risk). Which means that these 
essays look more to the stories writers write (in particular, Virginia Woolf, 
Montaigne, and Helene Cixous, among others), the text, than they do to 
immediate life experience, as in Mairs' other books. "What has interested me 
particularly," she writes, "is the crucial role that learning to decipher texts 
-- both my own experiences and the works of other writers -- has played in my 
writerly evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Often asked, "How did you find your voice?" Mairs responds: "In the beginning 
was the Word . Not me. And the question, properly phrased, should be asked of 
my voice: How did you find (devise, invent, contrive) your Nancy?" This may 
seem rhetorical, out of context, but it relieves an enormous burden to find 
one's voice, as distinct from others' and from the experience of others; a 
voice with some critical authority and a great deal of distance from real-life 
suffering -- a quest Mairs believes is uniquely male in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up believing that men could fill emptiness in women, for a long 
time Mairs wrote, she tells us, "out of yearning." Filling voids with men is 
replaced, as she grows older and more confident (with the help of other women, 
writers and friends), by filling voids with ideas, bringing the same ardor to 
this yearning as to the first: "I could feel them in my flesh, quickening my 
breath, itching my fingers...." As always, Mairs' revelations and 
transformations will translate more easily for some readers than others, but 
her resolve and her ability to turn a once haphazard path into a clear 
evolution (her own) is an inspiration. "This is the body," she writes, "who 
works here."

 THE COAST OF SUMMER: Sailing New England Waters From Shelter Island to Cape 
Cod by Anthony Bailey. (HarperCollins: $23; 368 pp.) Unlike the other fantasies 
on this page; journeys backward, forwards and sideways, varying in expense and 
imagination, this is one that remains fairly well cloistered from reality. 
Sailing yachts along the coast of New England for entire summers is not 
something you can recommend to people in an offhanded way. It seems even more 
difficult than moving your family to a village in Umbria. But it's a culture, 
with a language, and the nostalgia is somewhat contagious, even if the yearning 
is downright unproductive. But don't let me burst your bubble, let's let the 
author, in this comment about class on Fisher's Island (affectionately known as 
"Fishers") do it himself: "the local class structure is evident in physiognomy, 
I decide (perhaps quite unjustly)." The very need for the parenthetical should 
clue you in. "Messing about in boats" needn't be so exclusive.

 SIMPLE PRAYERS by Michael Golding. (Warner Books: $17.95; 304 pp.) This 
delightful, exotic fable, part "Tempest" and part "Decameron" is so lavish, so 
dirt-rich and so colorful its like a meal in the open air, laid out on brocade, 
under the pine and cypress looking out at the ocean.Part of what gives the 
writing its infallible charm is the fact that every fifth word is Italian, some 
names of places or food, some just sprinkled generously over the meal. This may 
annoy some people but that would be churlish. Terra del Pozzo di Luna, 
campanili, mezzogiorno, Riva di Pignoli are hardly words to shut a reader out. 
The characters, all living side by side with their daily miracles and potions 
and transfigurations, are, for the most part, lovable gnomes and gargoyles (the 
only really malicious character is the black death). Things start going wrong 
on the little island in the Venice lagoon, Riva di Pignoli, like objects tossed 
around before a storm, like the rumbling before an earthquake. This is a world 
in which climate and weather are affected by the passions and disappointments 
of individuals, all of which are threatened by the approaching juggernaut. 
Their prayers may be simple, but the cacophony of their daily lives is 
fascinating.

 THE D-DAY ATLAS: The Definitive Account of the Allied Invasion of Normandy by 
John Man (Facts on File: ?; 143 pp., illustrated, paperback original). June 6, 
1944, marked a turning point in World War II. The success of D-Day was the 
result of the growing strength of the Allies, an ingenious hoax that played on 
Hitler's certainty that Calais would be the site of any attempted landing, the 
ineffective German command structure, the interruption of communications by 
Resistance sabotage and plain luck. Man uses maps and contemporary photographs 
to supplement his description of the preparations, the invasion and its 
aftermath, which lead to the defeat of the Nazi Reich.

 SLIM'S TABLE: Race, Respectability, and Masculinity by Mitchell Duneier 
(University of Chicago Press: $9.95; 200 pp., illustrated). In this modest 
study of working-class men, Duneier argues, "Black men are badly misunderstood, 
probably no less because of the well-meaning liberal media's constant barrage 
of images showing how bad things have become to Republican advertisements 
indicating that liberals have placed killer like Willie Horton back on the 
streets."Slim and his friends are unassuming men who socialize in a cafeteria 
at the edge of the Chicago ghetto. Unlike the media images of African-American 
males as dope peddlers, gang bangers and felons, they believe in honesty, hard 
work and "modes of conduct that testify to respectability." Duneier presents a 
brief look at a neglected sector of society that offers much-needed role models 
for teen-aged boys of all races.

 THE HAT OF MY MOTHER by Max Steele (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill: $9.95; 270 
pp.) . Available for the first paperback, Steele's short fiction offers solidly 
constructed plots, vivid characterizations and well-crafted sentences. The 
title story recounts the curious misadventures the narrator's prim mother 
encountered when she set out to buy a replacement for her antiquated favorite 
hat. In the multilayered "Another Love Story," a married man scrutinizes his 
former lover's successful books, hoping and fearing they contain some hint of 
their affair. Steele received the O. Henry Prize for "Color the Daydream 
Yellow," a vivid evocation of man's memories of an early love affair in Paris.

 THE BECKONING FAIRGROUND: Notes of a British Exile in Lotus Land by Ian 
Whitcomb (California Classics Books: $12.95; 231 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Singer, songwriter, radio personality, journalist, record producer, 
one-hit rock star and pop culture gadfly, Ian Whitcomb sets the tone for this 
memoir when he declares in an early diary entry, "Wish I was like a rock 'n' 
roll record."The journal entries, articles, interviews and remembrances in this 
lively collection document encounters with icons that range from Mae West and 
Walter Matthau to Felix the Cat. Whitcomb may not have achieved the rock 
stardom he desired, but his account of his ongoing fascination with American 
popular music is far more entertaining than the biographies of many more 
celebrated rockers.

 UNDERSTANDING IMMIGRATION LAW by Nancy-Jo Merritt (112 pp.); YOUR RIGHTS AS A 
CONSUMER by Marc R. Lieberman (104 pp.) and YOUR RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE by 
Richard L. Strohm (120 pp.) (Career Press: $8.95 each, paperback originals). 
The "Layman's Guide to Law" series is designed to introduce the average citizen 
to the increasingly (and needlessly) embrangled U.S. legal system. The authors 
explain what may constitute grounds for legal action in key areas of American 
life. As the disclaimer notes, the books are not a substitute for a visit to a 
lawyer, but they provide a useful starting point for readers curious to know 
more about their rights and obligations.

 AMERICAN GROUND ZERO: The Secret Nuclear War by Carole Gallagher (Random 
House: $30; 361 pp.). Gallagher interviewed dozens of men and women to document 
the U.S. government's callous exposure of citizens in Nevada and Utah to 
radiation from above-ground nuclear tests during 1950s.Soldiers were sent into 
"hot" areas shortly after detonation to retrieve equipment. Civilians in nearby 
towns came to watch the blasts -- and the strange, pinkish clouds of dust and 
ash that killed sheep by the thousand. Since then, local residents have 
suffered from abnormally high incidences of cancer, autoimmune diseases, 
reproductive problems, hormonal imbalances, nerve damage and birth defects. 
They bitterly recall how their government used them as expendable guinea pigs, 
then lied about it. This deeply disturbing book only begins to explore one of 
the most shameful episodes of the Cold War: Many of the men recall seeing cages 
near ground zero that held chained animals and humans.

SUMMER SPLASH; FOUR TOUR GUIDES SHOW YOU THE WAY; CONRAD LOZANO; FAMILY LIFE 
COMES FIRST WHEN THERE'S A BREAK FROM TOURING

 Los Lobos drummer Louie Perez once described the music of the longtime 
Angeleno rock band as "the soundtrack of the barrio," and for more than 20 
years now the band's affecting, homegrown rock 'n' roll has been powered by a 
strong sense of community and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Family activities are what the band is looking forward to this summer, when 
they manage to get some time off from a rigorous touring schedule. "Whenever we 
have free time, we have to take the kids out to this and that," laughs bassist 
Conrad Lozano. "What will be popular around our band will be kiddie movies and 
rock 'n' roll concerts. My 16-year-old daughter's already asking me about going 
to 'Lollapalooza.' Luckily that's something I don't mind going to." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano has the oldest kids among the members of Los Lobos, which includes 
guitarists David Hidalgo and Cesar Rosas, and saxophonist Steve Berlin. 
Lozano's looking forward to seeing Jack Nicholson in "Wolf," but says he's sure 
that the players with younger kids will be discussing the merits of Disney's 
"The Lion King" on the tour bus by the end of the summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "The story of our life is that we miss a lot of the shows and events we'd like 
to be at because we're out working, but that's not as bad as missing kids' 
birthdays and wives' birthdays," says Lozano. "When you're on the road for 
weeks and then come home, there's all kinds of things to catch up on. Free time 
becomes family time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano and his kids are lucky enough to have a common interest in rock 'n' 
roll. "Whenever I do have a chance, I love to get out to see shows around town, 
and what I go to see are rock 'n' roll bands. Now my kids are into it too, so 
we go out together." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally Lozano is able to combine work and family time. "My son's a big 
Eagles fan, and wanted to go to the shows out here. But Los Lobos is opening 
for the Eagles in Phoenix and Las Vegas, so I'll bring him out to those and it 
will be a better time for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the rocking and rolling, Lozano wants to bring his kids to a wide 
range of cultural events this summer. He says he feels terrible that he never 
saw "Phantom of the Opera," and wants to get the family to some Los Angeles 
theater productions this summer. He'll also make a point of catching a couple 
of the auto swap meets and quarter-mile races at the Pomona Fairplex.  
</P>
<P>
 "That swap meet's a killer," he says. "The cars they bring in down there are 
just incredible. That always becomes a big family day for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano says that Los Lobos is still a very happy musical family, but the 
members don't have a lot of time to spend with one another when they're not 
performing. "We used to get together a lot for weekend barbecues and picnics, 
but we're spread out a bit now and on different schedules so it's a lot 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one series of L.A. events that will get the band together in their 
free time, however. "Los Lobos is a band of big baseball fans," says Lozano. "I 
have a friend who works at Dodger Stadium, and he said we should let him know 
when we want to come down for a game. I think we'll definitely take him up on 
that."*

SUMMER SPLASH; FOUR TOUR GUIDES SHOW YOU THE WAY; SLASH; A PINBALL-PLAYING

 Some might think that a world-class rock 'n' roller like guitarist Slash of 
Guns N' Roses would spend the summer in sunny, nonstop debauchery. But the 
28-year-old rocker says that these days, maintaining a busy work schedule is 
more satisfying than pursuing summer pleasures.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm not working hard, I tend to get depressed," he says. "I like to work 
at a fast pace, and I try to avoid too much free time. I was supposed to take a 
break so my wife and I could take a trip for our first-year anniversary, and 
that was nine months ago. We're still in the planning stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Slash has plenty of work lined up for himself this summer. He's got a solo 
project ready to go into pre-production, and by August will be working with 
Guns N' Roses on the band's next album. There are some musical events coming to 
Los Angeles that may tempt him out of the studio, but GNR fans might be 
surprised by Slash's concert choices.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it sounds odd coming from me, but I think Harry Connick Jr.'s great. 
I'd love to see him play. I'm a big Joe Walsh fan, so I'd love to see the 
Eagles. I think the Isley Brothers show would be very cool. And the Gipsy Kings 
are amazing. Leon Redbone's coming to town -- now there would a great show to 
get some guys together, leave the wives at home, order up some big steaks and 
listen to the man play."  
</P>
<P>
 It might also be hard to imagine Slash humming along to "Funny Girl," but the 
guitarist numbers himself among Barbra Streisand's admirers. He may not make 
her Anaheim Pond shows, though. "I'm a big fan of her work, and I'd love to see 
her perform, but her tickets are too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Slash says he would like to see Metallica and Alice in Chains at the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion and may get out to catch James Brown's Greek Theatre 
show. "That's a show to see. You haven't really been belittled until you've 
been belittled by James Brown. I met him once and he sort of growled at me." 
</P>
<P>
 But he definitely won't be at summer shows by Phil Collins, Counting Crows, 
Foreigner, or, predictably, the Oak Ridge Boys. He gives Meat Loaf credit for 
being "the comeback story of the decade," but don't look for him at the big 
guy's Irvine Meadows concert.  
</P>
<P>
 Slash is a dedicated fan of movie monsters, so he says he may make it to 
Fangoria magazine's Weekend of Horrors next month at the L.A. Airport Hilton. 
"That's something I have to go to. I've been collecting 'Fango' since I was 14. 
I've got a huge stack of them in the garage." He takes his monsters seriously: 
He asked Stan Winston's shop (the group behind "Jurassic Park") to build him a 
dinosaur for his foyer, and he has a T. rex in his bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mega-hype surrounding this summer's movie releases hasn't gotten Slash 
any more excited about getting out to the multiplex. "There are some movies I 
love, but I hate going to the theaters. I usually just fall asleep. I know John 
Goodman put his heart and soul into 'The Flintstones,' but I'll wait for the 
video."  
</P>
<P>
 What Slash is really looking for this summer is a pinball exposition. He's an 
avid collector of pinball machines, and recently helped to design a special 
Guns N' Roses machine on which the player can activate the music of the band. 
"It's the loudest machine ever built," he claims proudly.  
</P>
<P>
 Slash concedes that there's plenty going on around town this summer, but says 
that if he's not toiling in the studio, he'll probably just be relaxing at 
home. "I don't go on picnics. I don't go out for a day at the beach. If 
anything, I might go to a local bar and talk to the bartender for a while. 
Mostly though, I'll be at home with my wife, probably watching TV. I've 
regressed to the point where cartoons, Comedy Central and cooking shows can 
keep me very happy."*

 THE THREE-INCH GOLDEN LOTUS by Feng Jicai translated from the Chinese by 
Eugene M. Kayden (University of Hawaii Press: $12.95; 239 pp., paperback 
original). Foot-bound girls had their toes bent under their arches and the 
balls of their feet pressed against the fronts of their heels to produce a 
small, deformed grub of flesh that became the object of a national fetish in 
China.Feng Jicai's curious novel exposes the cruelty of the practice and the 
weird sexual-aesthetic response it evoked. As a child, Golden Lotus screams in 
pain when her feet are bound, breaking many of the bones. But her tiny feet 
enable her to marry the son of a wealthy merchant, and Golden Lotus uses her 
position as an object of desire to gain power over her decadent in-laws. Feng's 
sardonic prose contrasts her calculating intelligence with the shallowness of 
the men, who extol the details of her shoes like connoisseurs praising an 
antique vase.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: SOME GENUINE GEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN, This column is the first of a weekly Children's Bookshelf 
in which rotating monthly columnists will cover picture books, storybooks, 
activity books, nonfiction, young adult novels and the occasional classic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A home for neglected children, that's what this column is, a small monthly 
corner of a five-pound newspaper that will give succor to children's books that 
aren't written or illustrated by megabuck superstars with agents. Some 
enchanted evening, you may see . . . an activity book? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, why not? You can't get little Elvis to turn off "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers," you can't persuade little Elvira to stop staring into space. Face it 
-- your kids don't read enough and you're beginning to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 These books may help turn them on to reading. Heck, they may help turn you on 
to reading. They may sucker-punch the little tykes into -- gasp! -- even 
thinking. Thinking about how things work. Thinking about things to do. Thinking 
about things that just may be of some use now or down the road. Thinking about 
how much fun is hidden inside those old-fashioned, low-tech, 
pre-computer/TV/radio objects you hope they will decide to pick up for a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought I was having a flashback when I came across the "Rocks and Minerals" 
edition of the Random House series of Collector's Kits by Carol Benanti ($10). 
Here was the beloved cheapo white plastic tray from my youth -- last seen in 
1960 or so -- reborn in a tiny new version that seemed like a hologram beamed 
direct from my memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, I spent untold hours with my tray, carting it from bedroom to den 
to front lawn to garage to dirt-floor back yard, filing, feeling, arranging and 
rearranging my gem-like treasures, guarding them from the predations of my 
older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 And I couldn't resist doing the same with the Random House retro package. It 
will be hard for most kids -- adults as well -- to resist the simple, 
infectious tactile pleasure of rolling a piece of scoria around in your hand or 
rubbing a chunk of cool black obsidian against your cheek. The samples are 
small enough to jam into a jeans pocket or stash at the bottom of a backpack so 
a child can take them to school to wow friends and/or charm members of the 
opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the 4-by-9-inch tray -- a mere shadow of the original -- fits neatly 
into a backpack and can be used to snow gullible teachers. It is divided into 
compact squares and holds 20 "genuine" samples complete with pop-out stamps to 
identify them. There's also a decent reference guide with its own set of stamps 
that explains how rocks and minerals are formed and identified and includes 
such nuggets of information as what common rock is made from skeletons and why 
jeans are stonewashed with a certain type of lava. 
</P>
<P>
 Other works in the series cover fossils, seashells and stamps from around the 
world. All are priced at $10. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to get your own kit -- as will my son. In the innocence of my 
youth, I let the first kit get away. The gods have given me a second chance. 
This one gets hidden in my gym bag, under the soggy sweat socks. Any 
transgressor unlucky enough to look there will pay a stiff nasal tariff. My 
rock collection is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other book-kits that look worth a try: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Complete Wilderness Training Book," by Hugh McManners (Dorling 
Kindersley: $22.95). Subtitled "Field Skills for Adventure in the Outdoors," it 
has a bunch of outdoors stuff to try, things to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watercolor for the Artistically Undiscovered," by Thacher Hurd and John 
Cassidy (Klutz Press: $18.95). Kid-friendly instruction book and a set of 
paints and brush.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE PRIVATE EYE'S WINDSHIELD; WHAT THE NEWER WRITERS CANNOT 
QUITE COMMAND IS THE BRUISED ROMANTICISM OF THE OLDER PRIVATE EYES AND THEIR 
WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Charles Champlin writes the monthly Criminal Pursuits 
column in Book Review.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Years before I came to Los Angeles to live, I felt as if I knew the city well 
already. I had ridden up and down its mean streets as a passenger sitting 
alongside Philip Marlowe and Lew Archer, with Raymond Chandler and Ross 
Macdonald as our tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
 The street names were sometimes exotic (how did you pronounce La Cienega?), 
but they had become as familiar to me as Lake, Main and Liberty in my home 
town. When I came to drive in the city myself, I recognized the bungalows of 
West Hollywood with their tiny, struggling patches of lawn, and the derricks 
pumping in the hills and the incandescent carpet of lights seen from Mulholland 
by night, all as if I'd been there before -- and in a sense I had. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler and Macdonald were inspired by the city to a remarkable prose-poetry. 
There were songs of celebration, and sometimes a hard-eyed irony. One of my 
favorite passages in Chandler is a kind of litany for a drive Marlowe takes to 
Malibu and back, just to pull his thoughts together, in "The Little Sister" 
(1949): 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove east on Sunset but I didn't go home. At La Brea I turned north and 
swung over to Highland, out over Cahuenga Pass and down on to Ventura 
Boulevard, past Studio City and Sherman Oaks and Encino. . . . I drove on past 
the gaudy neons and the false fronts behind them, the sleazy hamburger joints 
that look like palaces under the colors, the circular drive-ins as gay as 
circuses with the chipper hard-eyed car-hops, the brilliant counters, and 
sweaty greasy kitchens that would have poisoned a toad." 
</P>
<P>
 The last drive-in is gone, replaced by drive-thrus, the car-hops replaced by 
disembodied arms that hand paper bags of food out of a service window. The 
Hollywood Freeway now takes you over Cahuenga Pass to the Valley, as it didn't 
when Chandler was writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what seems remarkable is not what changes, but how much stays the same. In 
1987, Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward published "Raymond Chandler's Los 
Angeles," a book of photographs that demonstrated, quite astonishingly, how 
many of the streets, neighborhoods, buildings large and small that he 
described, even the moods of shadowy foreboding, could still be captured almost 
a half-century after he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a smoggy day or night, you can still verify the truth of a couple of 
lines from the same piece in "The Little Sister": "I smelled Los Angeles before 
I got to it. It smelled stale and old like a living room that had been closed 
too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer also caught a timeless Los Angeles. In "The Way 
Some People Die" (1951), Archer visits a fictional Pacific Point south of Long 
Beach (the beach cities were often renamed to protect the guilty). It could be 
any of several places along the littoral: 
</P>
<P>
 "It rose from sea level in a gentle slope, divided neatly into social tiers, 
like something a sociologist had built to prove a theory. . . . On the other 
side of the tracks -- the tracks were there -- the business section wore its 
old Spanish facades like icing on a stale cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Chandler, Macdonald was a fast hand with a simile. "Parking spaces in 
downtown Hollywood were as scarce as the cardinal virtues," he wrote in the 
same novel, and he speaks of "the corner of Hollywood and Vine, where 
everything ends and a great many things begin." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of the Archer books, "The Moving Target" (1949), Archer calls on 
a client in one of the ritzy enclaves up the coast beyond Malibu. "The 
light-blue haze in the lower canyon was like a thin smoke from slowly burning 
money. Even the sea looked precious through it, a solid wedge held in the 
canyon's mouth. . . . I had never seen the Pacific look so small." 
</P>
<P>
 Macdonald brings Southern California into the 1970s. In "The Underground Man" 
(1971), murderous events going back 15 years are uncovered by a ruinous fire so 
well described that it could be any of the recent devastations: "Sparks and 
embers were blowing down the canyon, plunging into the trees behind the house 
like bright exotic birds taking the place of the birds that had flown." 
</P>
<P>
 Macdonald died in 1983 of the complications of Alzheimer's. But the 
fascination of Southern California and its mean streets (sometimes as mean 
where the rich live as where they don't) has carried forward to a new 
generation of voices evoking a later Los Angeles, where the tensions, angers 
and troubles make the world Chandler and Macdonald described seem as 
uncomplicated and nostalgically attractive as the doings in old movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the two classic stylists they follow, the best of the new writers see 
Southern California as a shaping presence, an additional character in the tale, 
from T. Jefferson Parker in "Summer of Fear" describing his character's house 
on stilts swaying in the hot Santa Ana wind in Laguna Canyon, to Michael Nava 
in "The Hidden Law" (1992) dramatizing the long distance (every way but 
geographically) between east side barrio and the glistening towers of the 
central city. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they traverse it, neither Chandler nor Macdonald could have seen South 
Central Los Angeles as sharply and meaningfully as Walter Mosley sees it. His 
detective, Easy Rawlins, inhabits a part of town Marlowe got in and out of 
fast, where a neighborhood bar is "a small shack with plaster walls that were 
held together by tar paper, chicken wire and nails. It stood lopsided and 
ungainly in the middle of a vacant lot." ("A Red Death," 1991). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newest and best of the city's chroniclers, Michael Connelly, writes 
in "The Black Ice" (1993) about an honest cop, Harry Bosch, working in a world 
where you can't be sure of anybody. His predecessors would have understood 
that, although some things are different. "Out over Studio City, Bosch could 
see a police helicopter circling, a shaft of white light cast downward on a 
crime scene somewhere. It almost seemed as if the beam was a leash that held 
the circling craft from flying high and away." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Marlowe and Archer, Bosch spends a lot of time in his car, and Connelly 
as his eyes sees everything, from the Medfly Eradication Project Center over 
near County-USC Hospital (an institution that Macdonald would have noted with 
interest) to a last-resort bar in a condemned building. 
</P>
<P>
 What the newer writers cannot quite command is the bruised romanticism of the 
older private eyes and their world, who could truly be seen as latter-day 
knights riding (or driving) down those mean streets. The world doesn't permit 
quite such an easy surrender of reality as it once did. 
</P>
<P>
 So there is a peculiar wistfulness, an aching memory of something never 
experienced and now gone, when Marlowe says: "The car was a dark blue 
seven-passenger sedan, a Packard of the latest model, custom-built. It was the 
kind of car you wear your rope pearls in. . . . We went west, dropped over to 
Sunset and slid fast and noiselessly along that. . . . Past all this and down a 
wide smooth curve to the bridle path of Beverly Hills and lights to the south, 
all colors of the spectrum and crystal clear in an evening without fog, past 
the shadowed mansions up on the hills to the north, past Beverly Hills 
altogether and up into the twisting foothill boulevard and the sudden cool dusk 
and the drift of wind from the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 Farewell, my lovely, indeed.

SUMMER SPLASH; AT KNOTT'S, ANCIENT STORIES TOLD IN SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest attraction at Knott's Berry Farm isn't a roller coaster or thrill 
ride -- it's a high-tech special-effects attraction where images seem to form 
out of thin air. This illusionistic show isn't based on a hit movie or a 
cartoon character -- it's built on the cultural traditions of native North 
Americans of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound different from typical amusement park fare? 
</P>
<P>
 It is. Mystery Lodge, which opens this weekend at Knott's Berry Farm, uses the 
latest in theatrical effects "magic" to tell a story, rather than simply 
impress viewers with technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is part of Thunder Falls, Knott's Berry Farm's $10-million new 
area, which also includes a man-made waterfall and a store that will sell 
authentic native North American crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mystery Lodge show, a Native American storyteller talks about his life, 
using symbols from the culture of the Kwak'wala-speaking people. He illustrates 
his story by making colored images take shape in the swirling smoke that comes 
from what looks like a small fire near center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ancient art meets state-of-the-art," said Pat Scanlon, executive vice 
president of BRC Imagination Arts, the Burbank-based attractions development 
company that designed and produced Mystery Lodge.  
</P>
<P>
 That combination of technology and storytelling was one of the things that 
impressed Knott's President and CEO Terry E. Van Gorder about Spirit Lodge, the 
early version of Mystery Lodge he saw at the 1986 World's Fair in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so stunned by it," Van Gorder said. "What struck me was how effectively 
the message was delivered. I remember thinking (that) if I could change the 
story, how great it would be for Knott's." 
</P>
<P>
 The option for the attraction was locked up then. Van Gorder started 
negotiating with BRC in 1991, and by the end of the year, the project was in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 BRC changed the story, giving it a family focus designers thought would appeal 
better to Knott's visitors. Knott's built a theater for the show, as well as 
the Thunder Falls area, the park's biggest expansion since the addition of 
Bigfoot Rapids in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors enter Mystery Lodge on a wooden walkway that runs next to the 
waterfall. After waiting in line, they're ushered into an indoor pre-show area, 
about 280 at a time. There they find themselves in a Northwestern forest 
atmosphere, listening to wild animal noises and looking at the painted front of 
a "big house," a native North American building. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-minute pre-show puts people in the mood for the main event, according 
to Bob Rogers, founder and chairman of BRC. "The story line is that a storm is 
coming closer and we're going to have to go inside," Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 As the storm approaches and "rain" starts falling, visitors enter the house, 
which is the theater where the main show takes place. After the audience is 
seated on benches, the storyteller, who seems to be a live actor, appears on 
the stage out of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "Oh, it's only you. Good, I need someone here with me tonight because 
something just happened." The storyteller confides that as he was walking home, 
he heard an owl whisper his name, a sign that his death may be near. 
</P>
<P>
 "(That's when) our Knott's Berry Farm audience grabs their kids by the hands 
and goes, 'Whoa, I thought we were in Camp Snoopy,' " Rogers says. "It's a 
heavy-duty show. This isn't the funny, pretend death of roller coasters -- this 
is the real death we're talking about."  
</P>
<P>
 Though the show itself isn't frightening, the storyteller seems to believe he 
may soon die, and he starts reminiscing about his life, conjuring up images to 
illustrate his story from the rising smoke. Images from his childhood appear in 
the smoke and move at his command -- then disappear when the story moves on. He 
talks about a canoe, and a yellow one moves through the smoke; he mentions 
fish, and they jump around in the column of gray haze. 
</P>
<P>
 Other characters take shape during the show, which is also 13 minutes long, 
including the storyteller's wife and their children. He talks fondly of them 
and regrets that he doesn't have more time to spend with them. But as the story 
continues, the threatening owl turns into a playful yellow raven, which flies 
out of the smoke and lands on the storyteller's hand, making him think that 
death isn't near after all.  
</P>
<P>
 The owl and the raven are taken from the myths of the Kwak'wala-speaking 
people, as is much of the story told in the Mystery Lodge show. The art on the 
front of the big house was painted by Native American artist Doug Cranmer, and 
Native American advisers choreographed the dance sequences and ensured that 
their culture was portrayed accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's pretty serious stuff for an amusement park attraction, and Rogers thinks 
the story is just as important as the technology used to tell it. "It's 
something that's a universal message that happens to come from a Native 
American culture," Rogers says. "As the guy starts thinking over his life, he 
begins to think about what was really important to him. He wishes he spent more 
time with his kids, (and) that's exactly what our audience is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge is as much a magic show as an amusement park attraction, and 
those not charmed by the story may still be entertained wondering how the 
illusions work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may form theories explaining the magic, but even they'll be thrown for a 
loop when the storyteller disappears in a flash of lightning at the end of the 
show. He looks too real to be a projection, and there doesn't seem to be a trap 
door for him to escape through. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does he go? That, it seems, is one of the real mysteries of Mystery 
Lodge. "It's magic," Rogers says. "It's like asking David Copperfield how the 
Saw of Death works." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. What he will say is that the show is based on "Holavision," BRC's 
patented effects system that "magically suspends a dimensional image in the 
air. 
</P>

 "The technology is a light-year ahead of what we did (in Vancouver). We

 BRC previously has produced mostly large-format, film-based attractions for 
world's fairs and Walt Disney's Epcot Center.

 Marketing an illusion-based attraction can be difficult, according to Tim 
O'Brien, an editor of the trade magazine Amusement Business. But in addition to 
its advertising, Knott's is counting on positive crowd reactions to spread the 
word.

THE HUMANS WITHIN THE EVENTS; TWILIGHT; LOS ANGELES, 1992 / ON THE ROAD: A 
SEARCH FOR AMERICAN CHARACTER, BY ANNA DEAVERE SMITH (ANCHOR BOOKS / DOUBLEDAY: 
$21.95, CLOTH; $12.95 PAPER; 265 PP.)

<P>
 Twilight, April 29, 1992. What Angelino doesn't remember the first dusk of the 
Rodney King verdicts, as fire blazed on the horizon, smoke smeared the sunset 
and sirens called in the night? Despite the subsequent summer of fires and the 
Northridge quake, the memory of that first night of civil unrest remains 
indelible. 
</P>
<P>
 In May 1992, the Mark Taper Forum commissioned Anna Deavere Smith to tackle 
Los Angeles and the verdicts in her "On the Road" series, a theatrical 
experiment Smith had already applied to 1991's Crown Heights crisis with 
award-winning success. What makes Smith's theater particularly suited to the 
shapeless event that was "the verdicts" is that Smith doesn't write plays, she 
collects them. She sifts hundreds of interviews into a selection of verbatim 
transcripts that becomes the "text" of her performance-piece. Smith then 
recreates on stage, word for word, pause for pause, accent for accent, each of 
the characters of her "social dramas," regardless of their race, age, sex or 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is a collection of those interviews, presented as a companion to the 
show that ran in Los Angeles from May to June of 1993, moved to the Public 
Theater in New York and is now on Broadway. Just as the script of "Twilight" 
evolved, losing and gaining characters as it was developed and moved, the 
compilation of interviews in the book differs somewhat from each of the three 
stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
 It contains 50 interviews with 46 characters. Some, such as Reginald Denny, 
Daryl Gates and Maxine Waters, are well known, but most are not media darlings. 
Smith has gone out of her way to find community voices not heard often in the 
media. In her interesting but too short introduction she notes that Amercia's 
racial discussion "is much larger and more complex than a story of black and 
white," and the media for focusing on black and ignoring Latino involvement in 
the riots. Yet white Anglo voices make up almost half the interviews while 
Latin voices are the least heard amid the various white Anglo, African-American 
and Asian-American voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's performance-pieces have been called "documentary theater." The book 
could be more accurately labeled "documentary verse." Even the layout of the 
text suggests poetry. Each interview is titled with a short quote from the 
transcript, followed by the character's name and a brief description. The text 
is presented in choppy, free-verse style. 
</P>
<P>
 For those characters accustomed to public speaking, such as Waters, Gates or 
the Rev. Tom Choi, this typographical conceit seems gimmicky, arbitrarily 
disjointing interviews more accessibly presented as prose. For others, however, 
the free-verse style illuminates the poetry of "casual" speech and thought. 
</P>
<P>
 This is perhaps most effective in Smith's final interview with the gang member 
for whom the piece is named: 
</P>
<P>
 So twilight  
</P>
<P>
 is  
</P>
<P>
 that time  
</P>
<P>
 between day and night.  
</P>
<P>
 Limbo,  
</P>
<P>
 I call it limbo.  
</P>
<P>
 . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So to me it's like I'm stuck in limbo,  
</P>
<P>
 like the sun is stuck between night and day  
</P>
<P>
 in the twilight hours.  
</P>
<P>
 You know,  
</P>
<P>
 I'm in an area not many people exist.  
</P>
<P>
 Nighttime to me  
</P>
<P>
 is like a lack of sun,  
</P>
<P>
 and I don't affiliate  
</P>
<P>
 darkness with anything negative.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith goes to great pains to capture the music as well as the content of 
language. The interview with Chung Lee, the president of the Korean-American 
Victim Assn., is presented phonetically in the original Korean and is 
accompanied by Lee's son's translation. Both are presented as spoken, with 
"uh's" and pauses preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholar Cornel West's transcript comes alive with Smith's annotations of his 
pronunciation quirks and physical attitudes: 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand  
</P>
<P>
 there's  
</P>
<P>
 like duh frontier myth in America,  
</P>
<P>
 right? (barely audible on the word "right")  
</P>
<P>
 That we (hard to hear that "we")  
</P>
<P>
 gain some moral and political (sic)  
</P>
<P>
 regeneration  
</P>
<P>
 ...  
</P>
<P>
 If in fact our major myth is that of the  
</P>
<P>
 fron teer, 
</P>
<P>
 the way in which you expand the fron teer .  
</P>
<P>
 (He is leaning forward, with his head down close  
</P>
<P>
 to the desk, his  
</P>
<P>
 glasses seeming to sit on top of his ears, and  
</P>
<P>
 screwing up his face, as  
</P>
<P>
 (he literally puts his body into the idea)  
</P>
<P>
 is by being a gunfighter.  
</P>
<P>
 The interviews where the seams of Smith's process, her attention to details of 
pronunciation and body movement, her "act of listening," are best documented 
are the most engaging. That is where the seeds of Smith's performance lie and 
without performance the interviews are more social anthropology or "documentary 
verse." This is an evocative collection of Los Angeles' disparate voices. Smith 
describes her theater as "looking for the humanness inside the problems. . . . 
The spoken word is evidence of the humanness." "Twilight" is a moving 
documentation of the humanness that is the character of L.A.

MIXING IT UP

 Translators rescued the honor of literary types last Sunday at the 1994 PEN 
Center USA West literary awards ceremony held at the Pacific Design Center. In 
elegantly staged dramatic readings from the award-winning texts (announced in 
these pages last week), the advantage fell to scripts, with the clear 
crowd-pleaser being a scene from the teleplay laureate, "The Positively True 
Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" (written by Jane 
Anderson for HBO). 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate Pierre Joris and Jerome Rothenberg's award-winning German 
translation of Kurt Schwitters' "Poems Performance Pieces Proses Plays Poetics" 
(Temple University Press) Rothenberg gave a reading verging on performance art 
that called for a lot of shouting of letters of the word London and 
rat-a-tatting of syntactically unrelated rhyming words, all piercingly 
punctuated by a sound that can perhaps only be transcribed as: RRRRRRRRRR. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors didn't come close. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is ungracious to make a distinction between literati and glitterati at 
an event that so clearly and uniquely seeks to draw them together. Although 
some literary award programs make a bow to the entertainment industry (the 
Edgar Awards for mystery writing include a screenplay category, the West Coast 
PEN awards have gone out of their way to honor the craft in all its forms. In 
her acceptance speech, Jane Anderson, the "Texas Cheerleader-Murdering" author, 
acknowledged the oddity -- and gratification -- of being honored on the same 
stage as poets and novelists. Or, as the drama award presenter put it: "This 
feels like a pep rally for writers." 
</P>
<P>
 This year saw the creation of a new award category, Criticism, in which the 
award winner, art historian T. J. Clark, also noted (by proxy) the rarity of 
writers recognizing the efforts of his brothers in critical arms. 
</P>
<P>
 As at any event where writers gather, there were gems of ironic comment on the 
scribbling life. Children's Literature award-winner Kathleen Krull had the 
houselights single out her somewhat reluctant eighth-grade English teacher 
(formerly Sister Marie Tollstrup). After years of meticulous research on 
"President Kennedy: Profile of Power," researcher Peter Keating, accepting for 
the absent Richard Reeves, could confidently report that the most frequently 
asked question about J.F.K. (from the dining rooms to the taxicabs of 
Washington) is: Did he really sleep with Marilyn Monroe? Drama winner Steven 
Dietz publicly thanked his "retired train-conductor" father for encouraging him 
in his chosen profession with the immortal words: "Seems like it'd be easier to 
write 'em down than think 'em up." Sonja Bolle and Susan Salter Reynolds

ENDPAPERS: SECRETS OF A TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 29, I happened upon a notice on an outdoor bulletin board announcing 
that poets Garrett Hongo and Maurya Simon would read that afternoon at Pitzer 
College. I admire the work of both. Though I had other work to do, I decided to 
seize the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, that afternoon Hongo and Simon were reading not their own 
work, but poetry by their late teacher, Bert Meyers. I had never read Meyers, 
but his work, as they recited it, was better than good: rhymes that fell as 
delicately on the ear as a petal on water; images of a perfection so hard and 
poignant that the breath caught, the muscles froze. Hongo and Simon read Meyers 
with an affectionate fierceness. Their grief that he was gone seemed close to 
the surface. His picture stood beside them on a simple tripod as a reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 As a prelude to their reading, Hongo read a memoir of his first steps toward 
Meyers and, equally important, Meyers' first steps toward him. Meyers' poetry 
seminar "met in the evening, and I arrived a little late for the first session. 
. . . The poet nodded to me to take the only seat available, which was next to 
him in the small seminar room. There were fewer than a dozen others in the 
class. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A man with long, blond hair and a puckered face that gathered down to a 
ginger beard introduced the topic of Walt Whitman and his homosexuality. A 
woman with long, braided brown hair, smelling of patchouli oil, cited some 
critics and some discussion she'd been involved in at a writers' conference in 
Vermont that past summer. I felt awe at how complicated their acquaintance with 
the subject was, how socialized. I'd barely begun to read poetry, let alone 
discuss it with adults in a public place." 
</P>
<P>
 But Meyers was notably less impressed than Hongo -- at the time a scholarship 
boy from South-Central Los Angeles -- with the socialization being shown off. 
Of homosexuality as the key to Whitman, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'That's (crap),' then proceeded to provide us with an extended critique of 
that particular, journalistic and decidedly unliterary approach to the 
discussion of Whitman. He said that Whitman was a poet who may have been gay, 
who may not have been gay, who might have been multi-sexual or asexual or 
non-sexual in whatever physical way, but what was important about him was that 
he had this feeling for humankind, for the wounded dying in the Union 
hospitals, for the workers and builders and Teamsters and for women that 
compelled him to write a strange, prosaic but chant-like non-metric verse, 
slightly imitative of what he thought Indian Vedic scripture was like, slightly 
imitative of what he thought Native American storytelling and ceremonial chant 
was like, and taking off on what he'd vaguely heard about as vers libre from 
the French; borrowing certain common American religious ideas; joining all of 
them to what he felt was the elite fashion of literary Transcendentalism; and, 
from that , he, a newspaperman and profound sentimentalist, had accomplished 
the building, with Emily Dickinson, of what had come to us as our American 
poetry. Homosexuality was not the issue, nor was heterosexuality ." 
</P>
<P>
 Whew! Bert Meyers was formidably learned, but the rumor that he was a college 
dropout was true. He had taught himself to write, won admission to graduate 
school on the strength of his poetry alone, dropped out before completing his 
doctorate and found work at Pitzer at first only as a kind of substitute 
teacher. Soon enough, the college recognized that he was a brilliant teacher as 
well as a gifted poet; but when told he had been awarded tenure, Meyers asked, 
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hongo obviously cherished the memory of that first torrential disquisition, 
but the learning stood in service to something that he cherished more: "Bert 
had an attitude , as is said in the ghetto, and it pleased me he felt confident 
in exposing us to it. And that attitude had the music of eloquence." 
</P>
<P>
 As that first class ended, Meyers asked his new student to walk him home, "as 
I'd said nothing during class and it puzzled him." 
</P>
<P>
 "We trudged back through a foggy night, across asphalt tennis courts, 
azalea-lined walks, and under olive trees through one college's campus and then 
another (Claremont is home to five). The poet produced a pipe and was having 
trouble keeping it lit. He'd stop from time to time, relighting the tobacco, 
and I'd stop with him to keep him company, to stay in the aura of his regard. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I know why you're so pissed off,' he said, sucking on the stem of his pipe. 
Sprinklers hissed on a lawn somewhere nearby. His wife and children and dog 
were up ahead of us. I was stunned, fixed to the sidewalk in my sturdy tennis 
shoes. He caught my eye. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Your parents were in those camps,' he said, and a puff of smoke swirled 
around the dark blade of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he'd been a kid in high school in Los Angeles. It was World War II, a 
few months after Pearl Harbor. He was a gymnast at Belmont High. There were 
lots of Japanese American kids in his school. He'd grown up with them . . . 
playing baseball, stealing hubcaps, trying to get dates, when, all of a sudden, 
one morning, all the Japanese American kids were gone! Just gone. He couldn't 
believe it. Our government had taken all of them, rounded them up like cattle 
and marched them off into trains and shipped them away to God-knows-where, to 
Kingdom Come, to concentration camps in the desert. His schoolmates were 
stunned, but everyone seemed to accept it after a while. His father raged about 
it at home. He felt it was a crummy deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bert knew about it. He could tell me. He could look into my eyes and see into 
the history I was not myself ready to address, to bring up, to live by, and he 
told me it was all right. He knew part of my story, the part no one else knew 
or seemed to want to know, and he would help me with it. He was telling me 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Meyers, a Sephardic Jew whose parents had come to Los Angeles from Spain 
via Brooklyn, knew why Garrett Hongo was pissed off at a time in Hongo's life 
when Hongo himself did not know. Yes, Hongo's parents had been in the camps. 
This was to be one of Hongo's subjects, among those that would win him the 
Lamont prize in 1987, but he didn't know it yet. How did Meyers know it? He 
couldn't, in fact, have had more than a hunch, but such hunches only come to 
teachers who are watching their students' every move, thinking about them with 
intelligence and love, and willing to push them to the brink to open their 
eyes. That kind of teacher tends also to be the kind who insists, with the 
aggressive edge that Meyers brought to his discussion of Whitman, that "it 
doesn't matter" whether you are gay or straight, or Asian or Caucasian, or name 
your polar pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it work this way? Because only those who believe that group identity 
is secondary acquire the habit of attending to the individual as primary. Not 
all Japanese American writers are called to write about ethnic identity. With 
the wrong Japanese American student, Meyers' "I know why you're pissed off" 
could have been a clumsy and perhaps a crippling mistake. Meyers took a chance, 
then, but he was the kind who watches closely enough to know when and with whom 
to take such a chance. In the individual identity of this Japanese American 
student, there was indeed some specifically Japanese American literary work to 
be done. If Meyers had not believed that his own Jewishness, his own group 
identity, was as finally irrelevant, however undeniable, as Whitman's 
homosexuality, he would have been blinded to his own individual identity, not 
to speak of Hongo's. Fortunately, it was not Meyers' way (it has become, 
unfortunately, too often the American way) to elevate the group above the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry proceeds by a heightening of the precision and clarity of ordinary 
perception. Meyers, to judge from what was said about him at the memorial 
service, brought some of this precision to his perception of people. Those who 
know he loved them know also that he knew them, or so it seemed as they spoke. 
Meyers' personality is remembered as hot and prickly rather than warm and 
fuzzy. Simon recalls him saying to her once, in a burst, "Be on guard!" But 
vigilance was evidently just another variety of attention in an exceptionally 
attentive man. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now common for teachers of writing, poetry included, to say with 
becoming modesty that they merely teach the craft, the part that can be taught. 
The craft counts, of course. Meyers, the college dropout, was a frame maker by 
trade, proud of the fineness of his work, and as careful about words as about 
wood. But nothing was clearer from Hongo's story than that Meyers also taught 
things that allegedly can't be taught. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Meyers' poems is "Apprentice": 
</P>
<P>
 Because  
</P>
<P>
 I love you  
</P>
<P>
 I've learned to be  
</P>
<P>
 this hammer that runs  
</P>
<P>
 all day like a horse  
</P>
<P>
 with its hoof in its head.  
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon  
</P>
<P>
 my hands  
</P>
<P>
 lie down together  
</P>
<P>
 for a minute.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyers taught his students to prepare for the obsessiveness that all artists 
must endure, "like a horse with its hoof in its head." He taught them how to 
recognize the exceptional, as Whitman was exceptional, and honor it. He showed 
them how, for love, to tell a stranger that you know his secret. This is what 
the very greatest literature does: It tells you a secret you didn't know you 
were keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers' body of work is small; but small as it is, it deserves to be reissued 
and brought to a new audience. Al Wachtel, a Pitzer colleague, calls Meyers "an 
imagist born out of time," referring to a post-Romantic movement in French and 
English poetry that sought, rather than exalt emotion, to displace it from 
where the reader might expect it to some unexpected place. Imagist poems are 
often easy on first reading, deceptively casual, like haikus; they become deep 
or difficult, paradoxically, only on repeated reading. Meyers, who knew that 
his unbreakable tobacco habit would eventually kill him, displaced his despair 
from the cigarette, where it was expected, to the teacher's stump of chalk, 
where it wasn't: 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke waters the flowers  
</P>
<P>
 that grow in the lungs.  
</P>
<P>
 The cigarette, like your life,  
</P>
<P>
 is a piece of chalk  
</P>
<P>
 that shrinks as it tries to explain.  
</P>
<P>
 The imagist part of Meyers' spirit may be the part that Maurya Simon has taken 
away. There was no more intense moment in the memorial service than her reading 
of Meyers' dry-eyed "The Poets," a poem apparently written near the end of his 
life: 
</P>
<P>
 There he sat among them  
</P>
<P>
 (his old friends) a walking ash  
</P>
<P>
 that knows how to smile.  
</P>
<P>
 And he still dreamed of a style  
</P>
<P>
 so clear it could wash a face,  
</P>
<P>
 or make a dry mouth sing.  
</P>
<P>
 But they laughed, having found  
</P>
<P>
 themselves more astonishing.  
</P>
<P>
 They would drive their minds  
</P>
<P>
 prismatic, strange, each wrapped  
</P>
<P>
 in his own ecstatic wires,  
</P>
<P>
 over a cliff for language,  
</P>
<P>
 while he remained to raise  
</P>
<P>
 a few birds from a blank page.  
</P>
<P>
 As she read him, one believed it possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Any stranger happening on this memorial reading would have guessed, as I did, 
that Meyers had just recently died. And been wrong: He died fully 15 years ago. 
American memories are said to be short, student memories shortest of all. Teach 
what can't be taught, though, and your students will remember you forever.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: A KILLER SCRIPT FROM SAN 
QUENTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four of the five winners of an industry-sponsored screenwriting contest for 
ethnic minority writers are expected to attend an awards ceremony Thursday at 
the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth will be sitting on San Quentin's death row. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Gay is serving a death sentence at the penitentiary north of San 
Francisco for having murdered Los Angeles police officer Paul Verna in the Lake 
View Terrace district during a routine traffic stop in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Gay and a companion, Raynard Cummings, were on parole and 
implicated in 13 violent robberies in the San Fernando Valley when they were 
pulled over by Verna. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the men were afraid that Verna would arrest them. Each 
defendant said the other did the shooting, but prosecutors said Cummings fired 
the first shot at Verna, then handed the gun to Gay, who pumped five more 
bullets into the officer's body. The convictions of the two men were upheld on 
April 29 by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gay submitted a script he wrote in prison to the Writers Workshop for 
contest consideration, Willard Rodgers, founder and director of the 
organization, said that he was surprised at the degree of humanity in the 
story. He said that Gay's selection as one of the five winners in no way meant 
that the workshop was condoning the violence of Gay's past. 
</P>
<P>
 His script, titled "A Children's Story," was picked from among 170 submissions 
from across the nation. The story deals with nine children -- all with mental 
or physical deformities -- who are lost in a forest when the bus they are 
riding is involved in an accident and their leader is mauled by a bear. The 
kids then have to find their way back to safety and in the process of helping 
each other are surprised at what they can achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time in the five years of the workshop's contest -- which is 
sponsored by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, Quincy Jones Productions, 
Carsey-Werner Co., Norman Jewison, MCA/Universal, Dan Petrie Jr., Sony Pictures 
Entertainment and Oliver Stone -- that someone in prison has won the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uplifting and it teaches the value of cooperation among people," Rodgers 
said. "There's not one bit of violence in the script." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said that there are actually inquiries about next year's contest from 
four other people on death row in other states. "I'm baffled by this," he said, 
musing why someone with Gay's background would write a screenplay "that has 
such a positive message." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Gay's wife, Janice, said it was unlikely that her 
husband would return a Times request for an interview. In words that may shock 
some in Hollywood, she said: "He doesn't want any publicity."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: NOT GRUMPY OR OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, to be young, talented and the toast of Hollywood. Mark Steven Johnson, 28, 
and Kevin Smith, 23, are both screenwriters who have seen their first projects 
become mini-gold mines in town. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Johnson is already writing a sequel to his first script, "Grumpy Old 
Men," for Warner Bros.; the first film cost about $18 million and brought in 
nearly $70 million at the box office. He's also writing a live-action "Frosty 
the Snowman" for Warners, as well as a comedy for 20th Century Fox about the 
first major league female ballplayer called "Balls." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Smith, his "Clerks" -- which won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the 
Critics Week prize at Cannes and was well-received at Sundance -- has already 
nailed down several future projects, even though Miramax is not scheduled to 
release "Clerks" until Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Clerks," a black-and-white slice of life about convenience store 
clerks in New Jersey, is already becoming something of a mini-Jersey trilogy. 
Smith is writing a Jersey busboys saga called "Busing" for Disney, and a Jersey 
boys-go-to-the-mall film for producers Sean Daniel and Jim Jacks at Universal 
called "Mall Rats," which Smith will direct. He also is writing "Dogma," about 
growing up Catholic -- in New Jersey -- for Miramax. 
</P>
<P>
 How each lucked into success has the sweet smell of innocence and naivete. 
Both pulled their stories from experiences in their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith, "I was working as a store clerk at the Quick Stop Convenience store 
in Leonardo (N.J.) and had spent about four months at the Vancouver Film 
School. I saw 'Slackers' and decided I was going to take the rest of my tuition 
and put it into a film." 
</P>
<P>
 He convinced the store manager, his boss for three years, to let him use the 
store as the setting. And $27,575 later, Smith had a movie about 12 hours in a 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now these studios want me to do some more of what I call these 'brainy 
no-brainers.' One of the producers told me they're more like a smart 'Porky's,' 
" says Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mall Rats" will probably have a budget of about $3 million. While Smith says 
the others will have equally low budgets, no amounts have been determined yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith won't disclose how much he's received for each of his projects, but 
Johnson isn't as coy. Johnson says that after the success of "Grumpy Old Men," 
he's now averaging between $175,000 to $350,000 for his scripts, plus another 
$175,000 to $200,000 if the films are made. For "Grumpy II," the initial amount 
jumped to $450,000 because it's a sequel. He will get another $300,000 if it is 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, from a middle-class family in Wabasha, Minn., finds the numbers 
dizzying.  
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't get used to it . . . my family can't get used to it," he says. 
"When I wrote 'Grumpy' I was working as an assistant at Orion Pictures and 
going to night school at Cal State Long Beach. The studio was in bankruptcy and 
there wasn't a lot to do. So I made use of the computers and in five weeks 
wrote 'Grumpy,' which is really a story about my grandfather (the Jack Lemmon 
character) ice fishing and falling in love in Wabasha." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson didn't really know anybody in the business to pitch his script to. In 
fact, his big connection at the time was his wife's hospital co-worker, whose 
cousin used to be an agent. "How's that for a connection? I took a chance and 
called the guy and he got it to people, who brought it to Warner Bros.," he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the same guy who came to L.A. and called up one of the biggest agents 
here and said, 'Hi, I'm Mark Johnson.' I really didn't know any better at the 
time. The only reason the agent took my call is because he thought I was the 
producer (Mark Johnson, director Barry Levinson's former partner). I didn't 
know about the producer, but once the agent realized it wasn't him, he told me 
to take a hike," says Johnson. "See how quickly it can change?" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he's no big fan of sequels. "I didn't want to do a 'Grumpy' 
sequel at first because I don't think they work unless they're a continuation 
of where the story left off," he says. Expect that of "Grumpy II." 
</P>
<P>
 His other Warners projects include a spec script called "Big Bully" for 
producer Lee Rich, about the lifelong relationship between a childhood bully 
and his favorite victim. But he's particularly excited about "Frosty," which is 
going to be directed by Sam Raimi ("Darkman"), executive produced by his 
partner Rob Tapert and produced by Irving Azoff.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Frosty' would be another comedy but it would also be my first musical to 
write. It's gonna be a blast with a guy like Sam directing a family movie that 
has a lot of special effects," says Johnson. The story centers on a little girl 
whose father has died. She keeps some of his personal effects and one day 
builds a snowman, dressing him with her dad's pipe, glasses and hat. Frosty 
comes to life and becomes her protector. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balls," the comedy about a female ballplayer named Louise Gehrig, is in the 
hands of producer David Kirschner ("The Pagemaster").  
</P>
<P>
 Both young writers chalk their quick success up to luck, hard work and forever 
keeping their egos in check. But the producers who are pursuing their projects 
say talent has a little bit to do with it.

TAD AND DIXIE: ROUND 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All fans of Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight) and Dixie Cooney (Cady McClain) 
were happy to see the "All My Children" characters tie the marital knot -- for 
the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime viewers remember that the last time the romantic duo tried to walk 
down the aisle their wedding never took place, because Tad got into a fight 
with the dastardly Billy Clyde Tuggle (Matthew Cowles) and fell off a bridge 
and was presumed dead. For the next couple of years, Tad was in California 
suffering from amnesia, while Dixie went through two marriages, to Craig Lawson 
(Scott Thompson Baker) and Brian Bodine (Brian Green). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, "Another World" threw a party at the elegant Hudson River 
Club in New York City. The atmosphere was joyous, and the food was scrumptious 
and plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the show's current cast members were in attendance, but a lovely 
part of the evening was how many former cast members showed up. "Another World" 
started with the Matthews family, and not only was Irene Daily in attendance 
(she still plays Aunt Liz Matthews on a recurring basis), but so was Sam Groom 
and David Bailey, who both played Russ Matthews; Beverly Penberthy, who played 
Pat Matthews; and her one time on-screen husband, Michael M. Ryan, who played 
John Randolph. Also present was gone-but-not-forgotten George Reinholt, who 
played the first Steve Frame, and Judith Barcroft, the original Lenore Curtin. 
</P>
<P>
 Penberthy had been out of town and came home the day of the party to find her 
invitation in the mail. After spending the day shopping and grooming herself, 
she emerged looking very elegant. Reinholt was so happy to be in New York City 
that he is seriously considering moving back from his current residence in 
Pennsylvania. He would happily consider a return engagement on "Another World." 
</P>
<P>
 Two notable recent returnees were Ricky Paull Goldin (formerly Dean Frame), 
who was accompanied by Yasmine Bleeth (formerly Lee Ann Buchanan on "One Life 
to Live") and Alicia Coppola (the original Lorna Devon). Goldin was gearing up 
for his Broadway opening in "Grease." Bleeth put to rest all rumors that she 
would be returning to "One Life to Live," since she has signed a two-year 
contract with the syndicated series "Baywatch." Coppola was "chilling out," 
just as she had planned to do after leaving the show, and looked well-rested 
and lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 No party would be complete without a cake, and the highlight of the evening 
came with the entire cast gathering around to cut it (and cut up for the 
cameras), while singing a rousing rendition of the show's theme song.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE INNER LIFE; HERE'S A 
SCREENWRITER WHO STRIVES TO GIVE WOMEN A REAL VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERA DIKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Swicord could be a heroine in one of her own screenplays: a woman 
overcoming the odds to triumph -- if still rather anonymously. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * She has three films slated for production over the next few months: "Little 
Women," to star Winona Ryder as Jo, at Columbia; "The Perez Family," starring 
Marisa Tomei and Anjelica Huston, at Goldwyn; and "Matilda," an adaptation of 
the Roald Dahl novel that she co-scripted with her husband, screenwriter Nick 
Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
 * A fourth Swicord script, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," adapted from 
an F. Scott Fitzgerald story, once planned as a directorial project for Steven 
Spielberg, has come back to life in a proposed co-production deal between 
Universal and Paramount, produced by Kathleen Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * She recently completed her directing debut with "The Red Coat," a short 
autobiographical film, "a valentine to my grandmother," financed by Disney, 
which premiered at the Aspen Film Festival in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad Hollywood run for anyone, especially for a woman whose protagonists 
are usually of the strong female persuasion. "I want to create real 
characters," she said, "even if they happen to be women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Female characters rarely get to speak in their own voices," insists Swicord 
in her soft Southern voice, evidence of her Florida upbringing. "Women have 
been misunderstood and absolutely silenced -- they have been figments of men's 
imaginations."  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike, say, screenwriter Hilary Henkin's strong women -- who out-cuss, 
out-maim and out-shoot her male characters -- Swicord's protagonists choose 
self-expression, even sexual desire, as the motivation for their actions. But 
in a decided departure from Hollywood's norm, these women are not punished for 
their choices. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, her version of "Little Women" is a slightly different take on the 
beloved tale of the four March sisters. In Swicord's version (which will be 
produced by Denise DeNovi and directed by Gillian Armstrong), in contrast to 
the 1933 George Cukor version that starred Katharine Hepburn, the focus is no 
longer on the marriage prospects of the young women, or on how Jo, because she 
wants to "write," loses the handsome Laurie as a husband. Instead, as in 
Alcott's book, the film is set within the Women's Progressive Movement of the 
late 19th Century, and tells the story of a young woman who wants to be an 
artist and writer, and who marries exactly the man who matches her passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a very different kind of character, like Dottie in "The Perez Family," to 
be played by Marisa Tomei, she gets her way. Adapted from a novel by Christine 
Bell, "The Perez Family," which began filming this spring, is set in Miami, 
within the Cuban immigrant community, and centers on Dottie, a fiery, 
passionate and openly sexual young woman. She may appear at first glance to be 
Hollywood's quintessential slut -- but with a difference. "Here is the kind of 
woman who has been caricatured over and over again on film. She is the 
ambitious slut-woman. She looks like a prostitute, she dresses like a 
prostitute, but she refuses to be treated like anything other than a woman with 
normal sexual desires."  
</P>
<P>
 The script follows how Dottie works to get what she wants, even if what she 
wants is to buy lipstick and head for the nearest disco. And despite breaking 
the Hollywood conventions for a bad gal, Dottie wins the man she loves. 
</P>
<P>
 The central character in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," on the other 
hand, is a man who is born old, and who ages backward. But even here Swicord 
has molded the story to reflect some of her wider concerns, specifically, the 
need for personal fulfillment. "Benjamin Button" tells the story of a 
misunderstood child born into a family who tries to deny who he is, yet 
ultimately, the story is about the struggle and growth of an artist. Benjamin 
is a musician, and his quest to find himself, to stay true to what he must be, 
charts the evolution of American music across the 20th Century. "Like Jo March, 
Benjamin is different from the other members of his family," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Swicord was attracted to Roald Dahl's "Matilda" (to be produced by Martin 
Bregman and directed by and starring Danny DeVito) because she recognized her 
daughters, Zoe and Maya, in the character of Matilda. The young protagonist is 
a precocious child of vision and determination. In the book, Matilda finds 
herself in an impossible family, and at an impossible school. But Matilda knows 
how to fight, and is also blessed with tremendous brain power for math and 
telekinesis.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is what I'm after," says Swicord. "It is time to say, of course, women 
are enjoyable to look at, but we also have voices, desires, and an inner life."

ON THE RECORD: STRINGING TOGETHER A TRIO OF MIDYEAR WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Emerson String Quartet, the nominal tough guys of today's chamber music 
scene, as the Juilliard Quartet was in an earlier era, demolish that stereotype 
in a new coupling of Dvorak's Quintet in A, Opus 81, and Quartet in E-flat, 
Opus 87. The pianist in both is Menahem Pressler (Deutsche Grammophon 439 868). 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of those releases that leave the writer struggling for and 
ultimately discarding superlatives. Clearly, it evidences not so much a 
"different" Emerson from the one responsible for the icily brilliant, 
award-winning set of Bartok quartets and other hard-hearted thrillers, but 
another, previously unexposed facet of the Emerson's wide-ranging, complex 
interpretive persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Partial credit, of course, belongs to the liberating presence of Pressler, the 
nonpareil chamber music pianist, who seemingly inspires his colleagues to play 
not only with their customary technical command but also with an intense, 
full-blown Romantic style that takes the breath away. 
</P>
<P>
 And everything sounds so natural: the little Luftpausen and portamentos and 
such touches as repeated string phases never precisely mirroring each other 
(e.g., the numerous times when, say, the violin's tune is taken up by the 
cello, it isn't literally duplicated; rather, its articulation is subtly, 
enhancingly varied). 
</P>
<P>
 Masterful details, within the context of interpretations as lyrical as they 
are dramatic, and Pressler not so much the star as the center of a perfect 
chamber music cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bartok Quartet of Budapest has never been accused of being tough, or 
perfect. If "soulless perfection" is a description that has -- simplistically 
-- been ascribed to the Emerson's way with Bartok the composer, then his 
namesake quartet can be credited with soulful imperfection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hungarians' set of the Bartok Six, mentioned in passing in this column 
some months ago, at which time it was unavailable in the United States, has 
finally arrived (Canyon Classics 3698, three CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, you don't have to be Hungarian to "know" Bartok. But there can be 
little doubt that the composer's countrymen have tended to see his music as 
much in the light of a sort of somber, late-blooming Romanticism as a 
reflection of modern-era tensions. The duality is keenly projected by these 
four artists, who have lived with the music for so long and so intimately that 
each is able to make his presence felt within the context of an ensemble view. 
</P>
<P>
 These are grand, sometimes darkly humorous, always warm-toned interpretations. 
The listener who demands that every note is hit dead-center, with not a ragged 
ensemble edge showing, should apply elsewhere. If, however, you can tolerate 
some flawed humanity along with the heart and soul of these inexhaustibly rich 
creations, by all means try the Bartok Quartet's Bartok. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Piano Quartet makes one of its infrequent recorded outings 
with a smashing pairing of Gabriel Faure's quartets for their combination of 
instruments, the familiar work in C minor and the unaccountably lesser-known 
one in G minor. 
</P>
<P>
 This exquisitely voluptuous stuff was made to order for the highly expressive 
style of the LAPQ: pianist James Bonn (the only one of the four still locally 
based), violinist Joseph Genualdi, violist Randolph Kelly and cellist Peter 
Rejto. 
</P>
<P>
 The close-up recording is well suited to the music as well, clarifying 
textures while maintaining sufficient air around the players to preserve the 
composer's often dreamlike harmonic states (IMP/Pickwick Masters 66). 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Sony's all-star team of Emanuel Ax, Isaac Stern, Jaime Laredo 
and Yo-Yo Ma, who brutalized both scores with their every-man-for-himself 
slugfest, the LAPQ has, in common with the two string quartets previously 
cited, the ability to function as a tightly knit unit without denying its 
members a large measure of personal freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the important, often overlooked things great chamber music is 
about.

NEW RELEASES; EXHILARATING DEBUT FOR SANCHEZ

 "The Departure" 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 * * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Say hello to a new and vibrant jazz voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rare is it that a player not yet 30 plays with authority, presence and verve, 
not to mention creativity.But one aesthetic strength is followed by another on 
this exhilarating debut by the gifted, youthful tenor (and occasionally soprano 
saxophonist) from Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin and mainstream realms are both explored -- sometimes within the same 
piece. Take "Cara De Payaso," a Brazilian classic that reveals Sanchez's Sonny 
Rollins influence, and that flies from a Latin feel to a blistering 
straight-ahead up-tempo. "Woody 'n' You" finds the leader playing the tune by 
Dizzy Gillespie -- both Sanchez and his pianist, the notable Danilo Perez, 
performed with the trumpeter -- at a seductive moderately slow clip, then a 
blazing one, the tenorist's long, loping lines never lacking interest. "I'll Be 
Around" is a reverent look at the timeless Alec Wilder ballad, with Sanchez's 
tone fat and comfy, and Perez's "You Got It Diz" is a snappy Thelonious 
Monk-ish, Latin groove on "I Got Rhythm" changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast -- including trumpeter Tom Harrell, drummer Leon Parker 
and bassist Peter Washington -- is right there with Sanchez, delivering 
crackling stuff.

</P>
<P>
 In an intriguing change of stylistic pace, the Cuban virtuoso digs in his 
roots for an album that is strongly orchestral, though his solos are numerous 
and brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from his early days is here -- rumba, conga, cha-cha, bolero, 
Afro-Cuban and Spanish and carnival sounds -- mainly composed by Sandoval, with 
percussion galore and such guest soloists as Dave Valentin, Vikki Carr and 
even, briefly, Bill Cosby. Note particularly the echoes of pre-Castro Cuba in 
"Suavito" and Sandoval's just-for-kicks scat vocal on his tribute to Dizzy 
Gillespie in Gillespie's perennial "Groovin' High."

 * * * * Frank Wess, "Tryin' to Make My Blues Turn Green," Concord 
Jazz."Surprise! Surprise!" is the name of one of the five Wess originals; it 
could well have been the title of the entire album, with its inventive use of 
the eight musicians, the sax and flute solos by Wess, and an unpredictable set 
of tunes that vary from gentle to jaunty and even to wistful (Kenny Burrell's 
"Listen to the Dawn," Bucky Pizzarelli's "Stray Horn"). The non-Wess charts, by 
Scott Robinson, round out a consistently diverting set.

 * * * * Hank Jones, "Upon Reflection," Verve. This sublime recording reunites 
the wondrous Jones musical family: the great pianist Hank performing on record 
for the first time in decades with his younger brother, drummer Elvin, playing 
the tunes of their late sibling, Thad.Such favorites as "A Child Is Born" and 
"Mean What You Say" and never-before-heard goodies such as the title track are 
given seamless, elegant interpretations. Hank's subtly opulent sound, issuing 
dancer-like lines of even, glossy notes, is backed by George Mraz's plump beat 
and Elvin's whooshy brush work -- he never picks up a stick. A classic.

 * * 1/2 Steve Coleman, Robin Eubanks, Greg Osby, Cassandra Wilson, "Flashback 
on M-base," JMT. This collection, spanning nine years, is certainly not the 
best of M-base, the hip-hop-meets-jazz movement that's been hailed as the 
music's badly needed new direction.A varied sampling of the Brooklyn-born 
genre, it includes M-base's worst as well, like the repetitive beat anthem "To 
Perpetuate the Funk" and the irritating "I'm Going Home," both written by Kevin 
Bruce Harris. But the movement's strength and promise -- strong, angular 
rhythmic pulses that power the urban sax sounds of Osby and Coleman -- are also 
included. As the M-base principals, the saxophonists play to a draw, though 
Coleman wins as the better composer. Skip this collection and buy their albums 
(Coleman's "Motherland Pulse" and Osby's "Season of Renewal") instead.

DRESSED UP, READY TO LOUNGE

 Well-poured martinis sparkle under soft lights. Lazy smoke and happy chatter 
drift through the room. Onstage, sharp cats in swanky matching tuxes are 
cooking up some way-out sounds, daring the collected revelers to follow the 
music's nutty lead. Young swingers fill the dance floor, hungry for more of 
that cool, crazy beat. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not visions of some long-forgotten shindig at Hef's place. The 
old-school drinks, vintage threads and retro sounds are beginning to show up in 
today's rock clubs, as a few dedicated bands rediscover the high style and 
happy hour vibe of late-'50s and early-'60s cocktail music. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bands as Love Jones, Combustible Edison and the Swamp Zombies have turned 
their amps down and dressed themselves up as they explore America's golden era 
of suburban cool. At their shows, they attempt to create a small, cozy world in 
which cocktail-sipping takes precedence over moshing and velvet has supplanted 
flannel as the fabric of choice. Never mind the grunge -- welcome to lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody wants to enjoy that playboy, high-life image, even if it's 
just for a few moments at a show," says Jonathan Palmer, vocalist of the 
Kentucky-bred, L.A.-based Love Jones, which plays Thursday at the Derby in the 
Los Feliz district (in lounge tradition, there's no cover charge). "It's a nice 
feeling to have a European cigarette in one hand and a well-poured cocktail in 
the other. People's everyday lives are more everyday than ever, so temporary 
fantasy living is at a premium right now." 
</P>
<P>
 On its recent debut album for Zoo Records, "Here's to the Losers," Love Jones 
lays tight harmonies over gentle R&B grooves cut through with some soul, pop 
and smoky jazz. For performances, the band dons custom-made, 100%-polyester 
suits and kicks up the energy of the music with a healthy dose of smarmy banter 
and playful audience interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of today's young lounge aficionados discovered the sounds they are 
reinterpreting while rummaging through their parents' record collections. These 
nascent rockers-cum-loungers found themselves secretly cherishing the stylish 
"exotica" of Martin Denny, the bachelor-pad kick of Herb Alpert & the Tijuana 
Brass and the dramatic swing of Henry Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was a punk rocker who just wanted to get hit by a truck, I'd come 
home and calm down by listening to my parents' records," says Love Jones 
vocalist and conga player Ben Daughtrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lounge sound is a smooth distillation of diverse influences, from the 
jumping jive of Louis Jordan to the Fellini film scores of Nino Rota and the 
cabaret songs of Kurt Weill. There are some less distinguished lounge heroes as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be dishonest not to admit that Bill Murray's lounge singer was an 
influence," Daughtrey says with a laugh. "But we do take our music seriously. I 
just think too many people at clubs don't even have the word fun in their 
vocabulary anymore. You're supposed to be cool by being dull and depressed. We 
live in an era of non-romance and non-beauty, and I'm nostalgic for the 
aesthetic and romantic quality that the lounge era offered."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island's Combustible Edison has brought some glamorous sparkle to the 
ultra-grungy Sub Pop label with the release of its debut, "I, Swinger." 
Guitarist Michael (The Millionaire) Cudahy, a self-described ex-punk, says that 
the desire to be swank and suave rather than fast and loud is no joke. The 
group's repertoire ranges from "Cry Me a River," the old Julie London hit, to 
Weill's "Surabaya Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to see cocktail music done as a gag or as shtick," he says. 
"It's fun music, but it's not stupid. Our band doesn't go for kitsch value." 
</P>
<P>
 Cudahy hopes that Combustible Edison, which plays June 12 at Jacks Sugar 
Shack, can help to create a Cocktail Nation, a network of well-heeled swingers 
who will continue to create and appreciate cocktail music in appropriately 
loungey settings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock clubs are the worst places to socialize. They're not very good places to 
hear music -- and forget about getting a decent drink," he says. "I still like 
rock music, but it's been done, done, done. It communicates the id well -- I'm 
hungry, I'm horny, I'm angry. But lounge music has more color. It covers a 
wider spectrum. Frankly, I think putting on my tux is the most punk rock thing 
I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These former punks aren't the first rockers to find solace in a world of dry 
martinis and brassy beats. David Johansen, lead singer for the seminal '70s 
glam-punks the New York Dolls, developed the loungey alter ego of Buster 
Poindexter nearly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Poindexter persona simply allowed the singer to kick back and 
cut loose in smaller New York clubs, but it also scored him a hit in 1987 with 
an over-the-top take of "Hot Hot Hot." Johansen can currently be seen in 
character on the lounge-happy variety show "Buster's Happy Hour," airing Friday 
nights on VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeve Jacobs of Orange County's Swamp Zombies says the lounge scene offers 
him and his band a chance to investigate their suburban heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suburbs can't get any cooler than lounge," he says. "The generation of 
kids whose parents were into this stuff have taken a while to express our 
roots, but it's happening. My dad listened to any record that had a picture of 
a pretty girl in an exotic location -- in front of a beaded curtain, next to a 
volcano. I grew up loving that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 On the cover of their last record, "Spunk," the Swamp Zombies are resplendent 
in smoking jackets and dark shades. Jacobs holds a martini in one hand and a 
cigarette-in-holder in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes pride in the band's music but says the secret to being a successful 
lounger is in the cocktails: "You have to stay away from new drinks -- Sex on 
the Beach and so on. Go to a thrift store and find an old mixing glass with 
recipes listed on the side. Pick one of those to be your drink. It's just as 
important for a drink to look good as taste good. Maybe more important." 
</P>
<P>
 The music of Chicago's Urge Overkill owes more to Cheap Trick than to '50s 
hi-fi heroes like Martin Denny, but the Urge members were early and 
enthusiastic celebrators of lounge fashion and happy hour panache. Even when 
they were a struggling outfit touring in their own van and playing very small, 
very unglamorous venues, they carried customized tuxedo jackets, turtlenecks, 
vests and medallions in their wardrobe. These days, the band occasionally 
dresses down to keep the music from being overshadowed by the clothes. For a 
recent appearance on "Late Show With David Letterman," the band played in black 
jeans and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love that Cocktail Nation look and style," says guitarist Nash Kato. "But 
we are playing rock music and we want it to speak for itself. We don't always 
want to be 'the band with the jackets.' Of course, that doesn't mean we've lost 
our taste for bracing martinis and exciting tiki bars. I'd much rather spend my 
leisure time in a lounge than in a rock club." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The looks and sounds of lounge are spreading into other forms of entertainment 
as well. At Igby's comedy club, L.A.-based comedian Rick Corso has put together 
"Vegarama," a Vegas-style lounge revue that's part parody and part homage. And 
San Francisco crooner Bud E. Luv brings neo-Vegas flamboyance to nightclubs and 
theaters. At a recent LunaPark performance, he delighted the crowd with 
post-polyester versions of such classics as "Blowin' in the Wind," "Back in 
Black" and "What's New, Pussycat?" 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. lounge fans often have the choice of taking their music straight or with 
a twist. At the Dresden, bona fide song stylists Marty & Elayne entertain a hip 
rock crowd with all manner of pop and jazz standards. Roller-skating cabaret 
singer Joey Cheezhee has opted for a high-kitsch approach in his zany lounge 
extravaganzas at Kelbo's. 
</P>
<P>
 Combustible Edison's Cudahy says the lounge scene's appeal is in its 
celebration of personal style.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Be fabulous' is our central credo," he says. "That implies a visual thing, 
a certain amount of imagination and a degree of self-respect. To be fabulous 
means to make yourself into a beautiful freak. That's what lounge music is 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Love Jones' Palmer agrees. "We're not trying to reverentially re-create 
something that happened 30 years ago," he says. "We're just trying to entertain 
with a mix of style and substance. A lot of bands today have pushed away from 
giving entertainment value, because it's associated with selling out or phony 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's bandmate Daughtrey says he's happy to be tapping into a musical era 
that was hipper, happier and better-looking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a time when hedonism was acceptable. I have a vintage portable bar 
designed as an attache case for the businessman on the go. That's an amazing 
concept these days. What happened to that world of pleasure? There's way too 
much guilt going around these days. Love Jones is just trying to bring back a 
sense of fun, and we want to look good doing it."*

POP MUSIC CHARTS: AS 'THE CROW' FLIES

 It looks as if teen fans are rushing out of theaters showing the Brandon Lee 
action movie "The Crow" and heading straight to record stores. The soundtrack, 
featuring new tracks by Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine and other 
alternative-rock artists, soared to the top of both The Times' Southern 
California pop album chart and the national chart. For an indication of where 
Boingo's following is concentrated, check out the disparity between the 
standing of its "Boingo" album on The Times' chart (No. 3) and its ranking 
nationally (No. 71).

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2; NICK CAVE & THE BAD SEEDS, "LET LOVE IN"; MUTE/ELEKTRA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 Will this explorer of the soul's darkest recesses be the upcoming 
"Lollapalooza" tour's sacrificial cult band, like the Jesus and Mary Chain two 
years ago -- a nocturnal creature brought blinking to the stage in bright 
sunlight while the alternative-rock hit acts wait for the flattering cover of 
night? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it coincides with this opportunity to be heard by a huge audience 
-- one that has embraced his filtered-down influence without even knowing it -- 
Cave's new album isn't exactly a gesture toward the mainstream.But "Let Love 
In" is less phantasmagoric than its immediate predecessors, abandoning the last 
album's queasy cabaret and surreal sea chanteys for classic rock strains -- a 
"Blonde on Blonde" richness, haunting Doors grooves, Stones raucousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical broadening notwithstanding, "Let Love In" is unmistakably Cave. Devils 
still crawl around the bedroom, cities are dark and murderous places, and love 
remains a source of loss and torment and little else. Cave has never set forth 
these themes with more musical elegance, and he illuminates them with something 
new -- the glimmerings of a vulnerable spirit. RICHARD CROMELIN

 EAGLES MERCHANDISE: If you are going to the Eagles shows, you'd better buy the 
T-shirts and caps at the concert, because that may be your only chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going the traditional route of selling the merchandise at the venues," 
says tour organizer Irving Azoff."Some things will be available at retail 
stores, but we're not setting up any special things for it." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Eagles' line of souvenirs is nowhere near as extensive as Streisand's. 
Azoff says that the Eagles turned down numerous proposals for souvenirs, though 
some special items (including "Hell Freezes Over" tour drumsticks) are being 
sold, with their proceeds earmarked for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Barbra is doing is fine for her and her audience," he says. "I don't 
think the Eagles audience would respond to it." Steve Hochman

 NIRVANA NUGGET: The first posthumous release of a Nirvana recording is 
coming.A demo for a song titled "Pay to Play" will be featured on "DGC 
Rarities, Vol. 1," a compilation of rare and unreleased tracks from artists on 
the Geffen-owned DGC label. The album is due July 5, with a special $9.98 list 
price for CD and $7.98 for cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana fanatics know that the group never recorded an "official" version of 
"Pay to Play," but changed it into "Stay Away," which is on the "Nevermind" 
album. Unfortunately for Nirvana fans, that's the group's only track on this 
collection. Dennis Hunt

RECORD RACK: BOYS' ONE-NOTE BRAY IS STILL FUN; *** 1/2; BEASTIE BOYS, "ILL 
COMMUNICATION"; CAPITOL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Other rappers used to fault the Beasties for their abrasive, somewhat 
monochromatic rapping style, and on "Ill Communication," the boys have largely 
returned to the one-note bray they made famous on their 1986 album, "Licensed 
to Ill." 
</P>
<P>
 With this album, as on 1989's "Paul's Boutique," they are masters of the fun 
part of hip-hop that many artists have forgotten -- the art of swiping bits of 
music from hundreds of obscure old records and stitching them together into 
something resembling art.They even manage to manufacture a beat around a second 
or two of low groans from singing Tibetan monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Beasties prove they are maybe the 417th best hard-core punk 
band in the world, and again, they fill out the album with dusted, low-tech 
instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Beasties are a lot more ambitious than they'd like you to think they 
are. The complete, self-referential trash-culture world they create on "Ill 
Communication" may be on a level with the visions of prime Public Enemy and 
Nine Inch Nails. JONATHAN GOLD

POP EYE: GEE, THE SLIM WHITMAN BOUTIQUE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RING 
</P>

 Imagine the dilemma of Barbra Streisand fans during her brief U.S. tour: Do 
they spend $100 for that sterling silver limited-edition chain or $400 for the 
tour jacket? 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the frustration of being 20 people back in the line at the 
merchandise table as the lights go down, signaling the start of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, that would have been the end of it. You get your souvenirs at 
the show -- or you don't get them at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore: Operators are standing by. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, mail order has come to the pop souvenir world. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, concert merchandise sales has been viewed as impulse 
buying, save for some goods available through fan club mailings. But the trend 
is to expand the sales of T-shirts and other items through mail order and 
retail store sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Signatures, the company handling the Streisand merchandising, has moved 
aggressively into mail order -- figuring that thousands of fans never get to 
the concert and thousands more may be looking for gift items. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mail order) is evolving music and event merchandising to a higher level than 
just selling things at the arena," says Dave Furano, senior vice president of 
Sony Signatures. The company is also selling souvenir items for Janet Jackson, 
Billy Joel, Carlos Santana and others by mail and through stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Signatures will also be selling Streisand items through special Barbra 
Boutiques being set up in major department stores and plans eventually to sell 
its entire line through a chain of stores modeled after the Disney and Warner 
Bros. stores currently found in some shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how well the mail-order sales can do," says Rod Stewart's 
manager, Arnold Stiefel, "but I'm eager to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Full-color brochures for the Streisand product line are being handed out at 
the concerts, featuring a handy 800 number to order most of the items sold at 
the shows, and a few that aren't. There are T-shirts and coffee mugs emblazoned 
with Barbra's face, a deluxe ballpoint pen bearing the legend "Barbra: the 
Concert" and even framed gold records commemorating Streisand's most popular 
works -- "People," "The Way We Were" and "The Broadway Album." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the mail and phone orders, the sales at Streisand's concerts 
alone are shattering records. Where an average of $5 per person spent on 
T-shirts, posters and other items at a concert is generally considered great 
and about $14 per head has been the past top figure, Streisand fans are 
spending an average of more than $20 a person in merchandise at the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The added take from phone and mail orders raises the stakes to previously 
unthinkable levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbra has reinvented the idea of this kind of marketing a star," says 
Stiefel, though he cautions that Streisand's situation may be unique. "If this 
gives the signal to merchandisers that they can open Rod Boutiques or Bruce 
Boutiques or Elton Boutiques or Whitney Boutiques, it's just not the same."

 *** All-4-One, "All-4-One," Blitzz/Atlantic. Tired of all the wanna-be vocal 
groups desecrating doo-wop? Then check out All-4-One's debut album.In 
modern-day doo-wop, this is as good as it gets. The young group's reverence for 
vintage doo-wop is evident on such romantic songs as the glorious remake of "So 
Much in Love," a highlight of this excellent album -- mostly ballads -- 
boasting spine-tingling harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 NIRVANA NEWS: It was only a matter of time before wild rumors started to fly 
about what's next for the surviving members of Nirvana. Here's the first one: 
Drummer Dave Grohl, the gossip says, will be joining Pearl Jam, replacing a 
supposedly disgruntled Dave Abbruzzese. 
</P>
<P>
 The response in both the Nirvana and Pearl Jam camps: Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pearl Jam is still one happy family," says a source close to the band. "No 
changes are planned." (Manager Kelly Curtis was unavailable for comment.)  
</P>
<P>
 There was also no official comment from Nirvana's management, but a source 
close to the band says that neither Grohl nor bassist Krist Noveselic has made 
any plans about his musical career in the wake of Kurt Cobain's suicide last 
month. It's not expected, though, that the two will form a new group together. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is planned for Grohl, who was set to wed his longtime girlfriend 
this weekend. He'll perform as part of the "Backbeat" band on the "MTV Movie 
Awards" show Saturday. Grohl was in the band -- along with R.E.M.'s Mike Mills, 
Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner and Afghan Whigs' Greg 
Dulli -- that recorded the songs for the film about the early Beatles. This 
event, the only planned performance by the band, will be Grohl's first public 
appearance since Cobain's death. Steve Hochman

<TEXT>
<P>
 Directed by Louis Malle and written by John Guare, the 1980 film is an 
exquisite romantic fable and satire of American pop culture, past and present. 
Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon are among those dreamers whose lives converge 
in the throes of Atlantic City's renewal, thanks to legalized gambling. A key 
film of the '80s, it is a fairy tale beautifully acted and as funny as it is 
touching (Lifetime Wednesday 10 a.m.).

<TEXT>
<P>
 This 1992 release is a black diamond of a film, hard-edged and compelling. 
Volatile, verbal and streetwise, it neither complains or explains -- it simply 
puts a world on display and dares you to be indifferent to it.Set among the 
petty hoodlums and junior-grade hard guys of Brooklyn's Green Point section, 
the debut feature of writer-director Nick Gomez is independent American 
filmmaking at its best. The center of "Gravity" is Jimmy (Peter Greene, 
pictured with Edie Falco, who plays his wife Denise). Jimmy is a small-time 
street outlaw who, though horrified at the thought of actual work, is stable by 
local standards. His pal Jon (Adam Trese) is the original hothead, and into 
their edgy friendship comes the sinister Frankie (Paul Schulze), just back from 
Florida in a stolen car with a trunk full of illegal firearms (Showtime Tuesday 
at 12:35 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Graced with a clever script, a cast that will make you smile until you ache, 
and a snappy sense of pace, this summer '92 hit is the funniest by-the-numbers 
comedy in who knows how long.The engine that drives "Sister Act" from start to 
finish is Whoopi Goldberg, irascible mistress of the double take. She's the 
lead singer in the most marginal of Reno lounges, the frustrated lover of a 
Reno gangster (an amusing Harvey Keitel) and feeling fed up when she 
accidentally witnesses a major crime. Where to hide Whoopi until she can 
testify? A small cloistered community of Carmelite sisters in San Francisco, of 
course (Showtime Wednesday at noon and 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; ANGELA WATSON'S ACTING IS A BIG PUT-ON -- AND THAT FITS 
THE PART JUST FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Karen Foster is a conceited, bubble-headed, fashion-occupied teen. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Watson, who plays Karen on ABC's hit sitcom "Step by Step," hopes that 
no one thinks she's that airheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 She will reluctantly say she likes fashion a lot. Then, grudgingly, Watson, 
18, adds that her parents tease her about looking in the mirror as often as 
Karen does. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, playing someone stuck-up is fun, Watson says from her San 
Fernando Valley home. "I think she really has feelings inside of her she 
sometimes lets show," she says in defense. "She's probably not that 
self-centered. It's a show she puts on so she doesn't have to show her true 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson -- and Karen -- have put on that particular show for three seasons. 
"Step by Step," currently in summer repeats, enters its fourth season this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress' five-year career bio almost reads like a how-to manual for young 
actresses: beauty pageant winner to model to commercial actress to hit TV 
series co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11, the Danville, Ill., native moved to Florida, where her farmer father 
had retired, with her mother, her brother Carroll, now 23, and sister Amy, now 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 She won her first beauty pageant to become Miss Sunburst at a mall 
competition. Within two years, Miss Sunburst had 60 more crowns and 200 
trophies vying for shelf space. The secret to her success? "I really wanted to 
do them, they were so much fun and I loved all the different outfits. We did a 
pageant every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The pageants led to modeling. Two years after Watson was named Face Finders' 
Model of the Year 1987, her family moved to California so she could begin an 
acting career. After a series of national commercials, she won a recurring role 
in 1991 on ABC's short-lived "Davis Rules," which starred Jonathan Winters. 
</P>
<P>
 While she can't envision any other full-time career for herself, she's got her 
sights on a secondary or alternative career as a country-Western singer. She 
turned to singing when her tap dancing wasn't winning her the "best talent" 
trophy at beauty pageants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The singers would always beat me," she says. But when she won that coveted 
prize in first attempt, she decided that country music suited her quite well, 
and that "what was missing in country music were kid singers. There isn't 
anybody kids can relate to." Watson hopes to be that missing link. Last 
weekend, Watson was scheduled to perform tunes from her upcoming country album 
at the California Strawberry Festival in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the recent John Burroughs High School graduate's busy schedule 
hasn't allowed for much of a social life, she keeps her eyes on the big screen. 
Giddily, she says she'd really like to work with Keanu Reeves.

 Since her show airs on Fridays, a popular night out, she says most of her 
classmates at high school didn't even know she was an actress. But at local 
malls or appearances, children often beg for an autograph. "My mother always 
carries around these postcard pictures of me," she says. "There's a list of my 
favorite things on it, so they can get a lot of information about me." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing not on the card is Watson's "really intense" interest in acting 
classes, where "I read lots of things to get to know what our profession's 
like, like plays and stuff." Her bible has become Stephen R. Covey's "The Seven 
Habits of Highly Effective People," definitely not a book that "Step by Step's" 
Karen would be interested in. "It's the greatest book for everyone," Watson 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really all about sacrificing now for the happiness you'll want later." 
And that, she adds, is exactly what she's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step by Step" airs Fridays at 9 p.m. on ABC.

ON VIEW; LAUGHTER FROM THE LATINO GROUND FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE VILLASENOR, Anne Villasenor is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the colorfully decorated backdrop at Downtown's Mayan Theatre, comedian 
Luke Torres jokes about the significant lack of Latinos on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about it, there are no Latinos on TV. What are we supposed to do 
about that?" he questions his attentive audience. "I think we should handle 
this just like we handled them not letting us into the country -- just 
(expletive) sneak on TV." At that instant, the audience bursts into loud 
laughter and cheers while Torres, crouching over like a squirrel onstage, 
tiptoes as if no one can hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 There is definite excitement in the air as a high-energy crowd fills the seats 
clustered so close to the stage of this Los Angeles landmark 
theater-turned-nightclub. From a nationwide search that drew more than 200 
comedians, 15 have been selected to appear on "Loco Slam," the first national 
Latino comedy showcase, premiereing Friday on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 In-between segments of hard-edged and light humor, the popular raunchy 
up-and-coming comic Carlos Mencia keeps the crowd laughing. "I look like the 
ghetto Barney," the upbeat and easygoing Mencia chortles, calling attention to 
his very violet garb. He jabs good-naturedly not only at himself and the 
various Latino ethnic mixes in the audience but also at several audience 
members who bravely ventured close to the stage to sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, comedian-turned-producer Paul Rodriguez hooked up with 
Cuban-born Nety Galan, host of the "E! Gossip Show" on E! Entertainment and a 
partner in Tropix, HBO's Latino entertainment division. Their mission: give 
Latinos a small-screen venue. They hope that "Loco Slam" will do for Latinos 
what HBO's "Def Comedy Jam" has done for African Americans -- give them a 
showcase and help them build an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's initial run takes it through the next four Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt growing up like there was nobody on TV that was like us," Galan 
says. "We're the lost generation and, as a result, a lot of performers haven't 
gotten a chance to really work out their stuff, to really hone their craft. And 
it's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Mencia, who acts as creative consultant for the series, will host each 
half-hour show, which will feature such talents as Chris (Crazy Legs) Fonseca, 
18-year-old Jeff Garcia (the Bad Boy from La Puente), Kenya Bennett and Mario & 
Daniel, culled from showcases in Chicago, Houston, Miami, Las Vegas, New York 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of times in the past, Latinos would do things and people would 
say, 'Oh, they're really not good enough,' " Galan says. "Well, how could they 
be good enough? They never really had a place to work out their stuff? So, it's 
very important and I think HBO as a company really has committed," to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jellybean Benitez produced hip, pungent musical grooves with the help of 
deejays Humpty Vision and Malena. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian-dancer Ludo Vika, who appears on the first show, is excited to be 
part of the package. "I really loved it because it was very well put together," 
she says afterward. "I was a little nervous because I was a little late, but 
once I got in there, after that first applause break, I felt this was something 
I wanted to do very week." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing "Loco Slam" makes clear is that Latinos are a diverse bunch, but 
share many universal experiences with one another and the population at large. 
"The important thing is the voices," Galan says. "When you start hearing voices 
from a lot of these people, it's universal. Those experiences cross over, and 
you are creating talent that's usable in sitcoms and an awareness of the 
market. Hopefully, a lot of other shows will come from that, not just comedy 
shows." 
</P>
<P>
 And, adds Rodriguez, "We're on the ground floor, but we have a long way to go. 
We have to be able to reach a situation where we're not a novelty, but we're a 
staple, a staple consumption."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: GETTING DOWN IN DESCANSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest member of the extended South Bay restaurant family that includes 
Chez Melange in Redondo Beach and Fino, Misto and Depot, all of Torrance, 
debuted last week. Proud parents Michael Franks and Robert Bell named their new 
Hermosa Beach restaurant Descanso after the Spanish word for rest or relaxation 
-- in other words, downtime. The bright glossy decor takes the tropics as its 
theme with an ornate tiled bar, cascades of faux bougainvillea, and a 
wraparound tropical mural in shades of azure, mango and lemon. Shuttered trompe 
l'oeil windows and other whimsical touches give it the look of a light opera 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Located just off PCH in a walking area of this laid-back beach town, Descanso 
is big, brash and packed. The menu seems just as crowded, all-encompassing in 
its enthusiasm for dishes from the far reaches of the world. Plantain, coconut, 
jicama, green papaya, mango, yuca and black beans show up again and again. Not 
sure you've quite grasped the meaning of patacones served with the mango and 
vodka-cured salmon? The waitress whips out a nifty glossary. Here it is: green 
plantain crackers. The unconventional menu organizes dishes by categories like 
"pupus and sticky fingers," "seafood cocktails," "cakes" (that's savory, not 
sweet), "sticks" (read sates and kabobs), "bowls" (one-dish meals in a bowl) 
and more. "Breads" includes a blackened swordfish sandwich on focaccia from the 
partners' new Pier Avenue Bakery next door.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time you get to the specialties, i.e, main courses, they look a lot 
less interesting than the rest of the menu. Where to start? How about shrimp 
deep-fried in a shaggy plantain batter or the grilled Thai sausages served 
alongside a delicious slippery green papaya slaw? Portions are not exactly 
dainty, so the best plan is to order in flights, dipping back into the menu as 
hunger dictates. No hurry, it's Descanso. 
</P>
<P>
 * Descanso, 705 Pier Ave., Hermosa Beach. (310) 379-7997. Open daily for lunch 
and dinner. Valet parking. All major credit cards accepted. Full bar. 
Mix-and-match dishes $4.95-$9.95; specialties (entrees) $11.95-$15.50. S. IRENE

FOCUS; LEARNING HOW TO LIVE AND DIE TOGETHER; OPPOSITES BECOME 'ROOMMATES' IN 
NBC DRAMA ABOUT AIDS AS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When executive producer Michael Filerman was casting his movie "Roommates," 
airing Monday on NBC, he wanted two special actors to play the leads. And he 
got them. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama -- inspired by a true story -- deals with a heterosexual ex-convict 
who had contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion and a gay, wealthy, 
Harvard-educated professional, also dealing with the disease, who become 
unlikely roommates at a hospice for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Filerman and the network knew the subject matter was a hard sell. "NBC 
felt because the subject matter, unfortunately still to advertisers, has a 
sense of some controversy to it, they felt having feature actors in it who 
normally don't do television would give it a sense of more import that would 
not frighten advertisers away. 
</P>
<P>
 So feature actors Randy Quaid ("The Paper," "The Last Picture Show" and "The 
Last Detail") was cast to play the burly homophobe Jim Flynn, and Eric Stoltz 
("Mask," "The Waterdance" and "Some Kind of Wonderful") the dying gay man, Bill 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Filerman says he always envisioned Stoltz in the role of Thomas. "I've always 
been an Eric Stoltz fan," says Filerman. "I watched his career and admired his 
choices. I just thought he would be really good for this. He read the material 
and said, 'Yes, I like this.' So that made him even more endearing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz wanted to do "Roommates" for a couple of reasons. "I liked the script 
and I knew Randy was doing it," he says. "I respect him tremendously." Ten 
years ago, the two appeared in the teen comedy "The Wild Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roommates" marks the first time in a decade that the 30ish Stoltz has made a 
network TV movie. He recently appeared in the TNT cable movies "Foreign 
Affairs" and "Heart of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a TV movie in 1983 called 'A Killer in the Family' with Robert 
Mitchum," says the personable actor, over a vegetarian lunch at Pasadena's 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel. "He played my father. He's a hoot, isn't he? I love working 
with those old Hollywood legends." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes they leave him speechless, like the time he forgot his lines 
while working with Vincent Price on "Heart of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I totally went up, and we had to cut," he says. "I looked at him and said, 
'Forgive me. I was just looking at you and thinking, 'Oh my God, that's Vincent 
Price.' He said, 'It's all right dear boy. The same thing happened to me when I 
worked with Ronald Colman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before production began on "Roommates," Stoltz and Quaid visited hospices in 
Los Angeles and Vancouver, where the film was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really quite amazing places," says Stoltz, nibbling at his pasta. 
"In Vancouver, there was quite a lovely old Victorian home where they had 
created a schedule where one person would cook and one person would do this and 
that. Then as they got sicker, they would go to a different hospice that had 
more hospital facilities. I think Canada is far more advanced than we are about 
dealing with their health problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz discovered that the majority of hospice residents were quite open about 
talking about their illnesses. Several patients worked as extras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were a little bit excited that we were doing something to show 
people that they were still human beings and had lives. A few of them were 
quite insistent that we do not talk down to them or reduce them to 
stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting these people, Stoltz says, made him want to do his best work possible. 
"I felt I'd a responsibility to these people and to represent them as 
accurately as possible. I can't say it was a happy responsibility. I remember 
having quite disturbing dreams. But anytime you do a role where you confront a 
disturbing issue, especially your own mortality, it leaves you feeling 
disturbed, sad and strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz acknowledges that it's difficult to play a reserved, quiet character 
like Thomas. "Deep down you wish you had taken the showier part because it's so 
much more fun chewing the scenery and letting it all hang out, as it were. But 
I think Randy was more suited for that role than I would have been because he 
looks like a big, blustery dockworker and I look much more like a lawyer and a 
pianist." 
</P>
<P>
 The slight, redheaded actor has been working nonstop during the past year. 
Currently in production on MGM's 'Fluke," Stoltz can be seen now on the big 
screen in "Naked in New York." He also recently produced "'Sleep With Me," with 
Meg Tilly. Last year, he produced "Bodies, Rest and Motion," in which he 
co-starred with girlfriend Bridget Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like producing and, surprisingly enough, I'm kind of good at it and would 
like to produce more," he says. Stoltz also will be seen later this year in 
"Killing Zoe," Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" and "God's Army," with 
Christopher Walken. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz sighs. "It's way too many movies to have coming out," he quips. "I try 
to do as much work in as little time as possible. It's the American way. I 
don't have time to live a life. I'm too busy working. I'm defined by my work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roommates" airs Monday at 9 p.m on NBC.

RETRO; YESTERDAY'S 'TONIGHTS'; JOHNNY CARSON HELPS VIDEO PRODUCER PICK FAVORITE 
MOMENTS FROM HIS NBC REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Heeere comes Johnny -- again! 
</P>
<P>
 It's been two years since Johnny Carson signed off as host of NBC's "The 
Tonight Show" after an amazing 30-year run as the undisputed king of late 
night. It was only a matter of time before he'd catch back up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Vista Home Video releases a four-volume collection of his best moments 
this week with Johnny Carson: His Favorite Moments From "The Tonight Show." The 
videos consist of "60sand 70s: Heeere's Johnny"; "70s and 80s: The Master of 
Laughs"; "80s and 90s: The King of Late Night," and "The Final Show: America's 
Farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights from the videos include the debuts or early appearances of George 
Carlin, Jay Leno, David Letterman and Garry Shandling and performances by 
veteran comics Bob Hope, George Gobel and Flip Wilson. Candid moments feature 
Carson singing with Pearl Bailey, Ed Ames with his famous tomahawk chop and 
Tiny Tim's wedding. Of course, there are ample clips of Jim Fowler and Joan 
Embrey with their unpredictable animals and numerous examples of Carson's 
famous sketches and classic characters (Carnac, Aunt Blabby). 
</P>
<P>
 According to the videos' executive producer, Jeff Sotzing, who worked on "The 
Tonight Show" for 17 years, there was never any plan to put Carson's "Tonight 
Show" on video. "But there was such a tremendous demand that, after a year or 
so, we decided we should actually put it together. I think we wanted to have 
the best representation as to what 'The Tonight Show' was. When you have a 
30-year span and 20,000 hours of videotape to look at, it's hard to decide 
which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sotzing was well-versed on favorite "Tonight" clips, having put together 
Carson's popular "Tonight Show" anniversary specials. "I've a great 
relationship with Carson and Peter Lasally, who was the executive producer of 
the show. We had a pretty good road map as to where we wanted to go. We put it 
together on paper and then started to rough it out on video to see if it would 
work and hold up." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, Sotzing says, was very much involved in the selection process. "What 
we would do was, we would talk about ideas for packages and segments we thought 
would work if they were tied together in a particular way. Then I would put the 
cassettes together and we would look at them. I would listen to his comments 
and we would make changes until we felt it really played." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Sotzing acknowledges, most of the shows between '62 and '72 
were destroyed. To save money, the network would just reuse the videotape. "We 
have an audio recording of the first show, the Oct. 1, 1962, show. They saved 
shows they would use for Emmy nominations. But most of the segments from the 
'60s are in bits and pieces. There's probably only a dozen or so full shows. 
But we have about 15 hours of segments from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sotzing's favorite moments are when "you never really know what's going to 
happen. The kids are always great. The Joey Lawrence segment where Johnny says, 
'Have you ever seen the show before?' and he says, 'Well, when I was up 
vomiting (I saw it).' That's priceless. Joan Embrey and Jim Fowler are 
terrific. They were really great additions to the show. You forget how many 
sketches (Carson) did over the years. They did it as a live show. They never 
stopped tape, so if something went wrong he just pushed on through." 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny Carson: His Favorite Moments from 'The Tonight Show' " is available on 
Buena Vista Home Video. The four-volume set is $60; the first three volumes are 
also available for $15 each.

LAST ACTION ZEROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "These Guys Blow Us Away," by David Kronke (Summer Sneaks, May 15): 
</P>
<P>
 Your article on action movies is guilty of a crime you and Hollywood have 
perpetuated in the past. The premise is that people are tired of action films. 
The proof you cite is the box-office failure of several movies: "Last Action 
Hero," "On Deadly Ground," "The Getaway," "The Chase" and "No Escape." 
</P>
<P>
 This is typical denial. These films didn't bomb because people are tired of 
action films. (Although it's quite possible that we may be.) These films bombed 
because they were terrible. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hollywood would stop obsessing on finding just the right formula and start 
obsessing on making good films, regardless of their genre, we'd all be a lot 
happier, and they'd be making money hand over fist.

 How on Earth can anyone write a five-page article on action movies and not 
once mention producer Joel Silver? My God, he practically single-handedly 
invented the mega-budget action film as we know it today. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends and I would like to know what restaurant critic concocted the 
insane list of the 10 best directors of action films. I mean, you put Quentin 
Tarantino on the list with one directing credit? And you call John Woo, the 
greatest and most influential action-film director in the Orient (with 23 films 
to his credit), an "up-and-comer"? Jeez. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no excuse for this. It isn't funny -- it's plain sloppy writing and 
research unworthy of any major newspaper. 
</P>

 Producer Silver, through his office, declined repeated requests to be 
interviewed for the story.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kronke's list of action movie directors was fascinating, but may I suggest 
that Tony Scott is more action-oriented that his brother Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony's credits include "Top Gun" (1986), "Beverly Hills Cop II" (1987), 
"Revenge" (1990), "Days of Thunder" (1990) and the recent "True Romance." One 
of his trademarks is his use of riveting car chases, as was particularly 
evident in "The Last Boy Scout" (1991).

THE GARNER FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading your Summer Sneaks article on James Garner ("Was, Is and Always a 
Maverick," by Carla Hall, May 15) reminded me of an oft-repeated family story. 
</P>
<P>
 My father, who was an avid amateur golfer, played in a pro-am game sometime in 
the late '60s.After the first 18 holes, he introduced my mother, who was quite 
star-struck, to Garner, who was playing in the tournament. My mother, trying to 
be cute and clever, said, "Hmmm, James Garner. I don't think I'm familiar with 
the name." Well, according to my mother, Garner, in typical Rockfordesque 
fashion, looked at her and said, "That's OK, lady, I don't know you either." 
</P>
<P>
 For years after that, James Garner was taboo in my household. I had to watch 
"The Rockford Files," which I loved, on the sly. Once my mother even caught me 
humming the show's great Mike Post/Pete Carpenter theme song. It wasn't until I 
became an adult that I had the courage to admit to my mother that I really like 
James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 No knock to Mel Gibson intended, but to me there really is and always will be 
only one Bret Maverick (and one Jim Rockford, for that matter). And, believe it 
or not, my mother agrees.

 His middle name, Eugene, may not be too cool, but Jim Carrey definitely is

 Walker's insightful article neglected to mention Carrey's dramatic work in the 
television movie "Doing Time on Maple Drive." He has a well of talent into

BOING FOR THE BUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a die-hard fan of Boingo (formerly known as Oingo Boingo) and loved Chris 
Willman's article on group leader Danny Elfman ("Back to Boingo," May 15). 
However, I do have one complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Willman calls the group's new album, "Boingo," the group's "second studio 
album since their most popular effort, 'Dead Man's Party,' came out in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
 As any Oingo Boingo fan knows, "Dead Man's Party" was released in 1985, not 
1986, and it was followed by "Boi-ngo" in 1987 and "Dark at the End of the 
Tunnel" in 1990. That would make the new album the group's third studio album 
since "Dead Man's Party." (Willman may have gotten "Boi-ngo" confused with 
"Boingo Alive," a 1988 compilation album recorded live on a soundstage.)

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / ROBERT EISNER: IN FED'S INFLATION AMBUSH, RECOVERY 
MAY GET SHOT IN THE FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor of economics at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He is the author of The Misunderstood 
Economy: What Counts and How to Count It. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the economy, stupid! That's what matters to most Americans, but not to 
our current Federal Reserve Board. For them it's the rate of inflation -- or, I 
should say, their fears, bordering on paranoia, as to what inflation might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's actions of the last two months, culminating in that 
half-percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates May 17, are risky 
and wrong. But it is important to understand the premise from which the Fed 
governors operate -- a premise shared by too many others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, simply, that we cannot allow the economy to do too well. Sales must not 
be too brisk, production too high, growth too rapid or the unemployment rate 
too low. Otherwise we will have high inflation -- indeed, accelerating 
inflation, inflation going up and up and up. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was all of 0.1% in 
April. Productivity has been rising faster than wages, so labor costs have been 
falling. International and domestic competition are fierce. Yet, because 
unemployment is all the way down to 6.4% -- too low by the Fed's standards -- 
and growth has been slightly ahead of a meager target rate of 2.5%, the Fed 
sees the economy as "overheating" and in need of cooling off if inflation is to 
be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 How is the Fed supposed to do this? By raising interest rates, it figures it 
will reduce borrowing for new houses, consumer durables such as automobiles and 
business investment. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the theory. We can only hope -- along with President Clinton, 
apparently -- that the economy is so strong that it won't work. If it does, we 
will be enjoying fewer new homes and cars and there will be less investment in 
plants and equipment for our future. And the job losses in the industries most 
directly affected will spill over to the rest of the economy. The unemployed 
consumer can't buy much. And the more of them there are, the more all business 
suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's precisely the Fed's idea. We have to make business scramble for 
sales and keep prices down because of excess capacity. Firms must not bid up 
wages and other labor costs by trying to hire workers in short supply. That, 
the Fed says, will stop inflation. But this "cure" for a disease of which we 
currently have no symptoms may strike many as severe. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been another twist on the argument, popular in some Wall Street 
circles. According to this variant, the Fed -- by raising short-term interest 
rates and showing it means business about fighting inflation -- would reduce 
market expectations of inflation. This, in turn, would depress long-term 
interest rates, which are related to such expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, interest rates had been falling, with the Fed's encouragement of 
lower short-term rates, until February. And this had certainly contributed, as 
intended, to economic recovery. It was precisely when the Fed reversed course, 
announcing that it was raising short-term rates to combat inflation, that 
long-term rates went up again. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of many of those Wall Street analysts should be red with 
embarrassment, for this is just what should have been expected. Whatever anyone 
thinks about future inflation, long-term interest rates depend on expectations 
of future short-term rates. By signaling in February that the Fed's priorities 
had changed -- that the governors were no longer keeping rates low to encourage 
economic growth, but were raising interest rates and were prepared to continue 
raising them to slow the economy -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan created a whole 
new ballgame. Investors now would have to reckon with higher rates into the 
indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, bond prices promptly plunged and long-term interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
 This can only spell danger for the economy. In advancing his drastic 
deficit-reduction package, President Clinton looked to low interest rates to 
compensate for the depressing effects of tight fiscal policy. As long as the 
Fed was cooperating, this seemed to work. Housing, automobile sales and 
business investment boomed. The more prosperous economy actually narrowed the 
deficit more than had been expected. Current forecasts have the 1994 deficit so 
small that the debt-to-GDP ratio will no longer be growing -- fiscal balance, 
in a relevant economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, real reductions in the underlying structural deficit -- as 
opposed to reductions due to a growing economy and low interest rates -- are 
just coming on stream. They will slow the economy themselves. At this point, 
the Fed adds its monetary restraint and higher interest rates to slow it 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be what the current Federal Reserve Board wants. Do the rest of us?

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: DIVORCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I have been told I am not eligible to collect Social Security as a divorced 
spouse until I have been divorced for two years. Is this true? -- C.Z.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. A divorced person who was married at least 10 years to the same spouse 
is entitled to claim Social Security benefits on the ex-spouse's account after 
the divorce has been final for two years. If the ex-spouse is alive, the 
claimant must be at least age 62, and at that age will be entitled to 37.5% of 
the wage earner's benefits. If the ex-spouse waits until age 65 to claim 
benefits, the payment is 50% of the wage earner's benefits. The wage earner 
need not be claiming benefits for the ex-spouse to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 If the wage earner is dead, the ex-spouse is considered a widow or widower. He 
or she may claim benefits at age 60 and is entitled to 71.5% of what the wage 
earner would have received. The percentage increases to100% if the ex-spouse is 
age 65 when benefits begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-spouse benefits are based on the total contributions made by the wage 
earner during his or her working career, not just those made during the 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have been married more than once may claim benefits against the 
ex-spouse with the largest Social Security account, provided the marriage 
lasted 10 years or more. However, as long as a person remains remarried, he or 
she may not claim benefits on the account of an ex-spouse. Tracking Stock in 
Foreign Companies 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently purchased stock in three foreign companies. How can I track the 
shares' movements? -- A.T.A.  
</P>
<P>
 A: If the stocks you purchased were in the form of American depository 
receipts, commonly known as ADRs, you can track their performance in the daily 
stock exchange listings in this and most other newspapers. At least 1,000 
foreign companies, usually the largest and best known in the world, have taken 
the necessary steps to allow their stock to be traded in this way. 
</P>
<P>
 If you invested directly in a foreign company, you can check the foreign stock 
tables carried in such financial publications as the Wall Street Journal, 
Investors Daily and Barron's. Divorce Doesn't Alter House Value 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My husband and I bought a house in 1954 for $25,000. We divorced last year. 
Should the house be valued as of the date of death of the marriage, just as 
community property is revalued when a spouse dies? -- G.F.  
</P>
<P>
 A: While the pain of a divorce is similar to that caused by the death of a 
spouse, the Internal Revenue Service treats the two events quite differently. 
It is true that upon the death of a spouse, the IRS allows the survivor to 
value both halves of their community property as of the spouse's date of death, 
not its original cost basis.  
</P>
<P>
 However, this is not the case in divorce. Regardless of how assets are held, 
when the marriage is dissolved, the original cost basis remains unchanged. In 
your case, the house you received in the settlement still has its original 
$25,000 cost basis, plus the value of any additional permanent improvements you 
have made to it over the years. Taxation on Inherited IRAs 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife inherited her mother's three undistributed individual retirement 
accounts last year. The accounts were included in her mother's estate and were 
subject to estate taxes. When my wife cashed out the accounts, she had to pay 
income tax on the entire distribution. Isn't this double taxation? -- R.A.R. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Despite any appearances to the contrary, our experts say the matter was 
handled correctly. If your tax return was properly completed, you were not 
taxed twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's what should have happened. When your wife withdrew the funds from her 
mother's IRAs, she was also permitted to deduct a portion of the estate taxes 
paid on those accounts. This deduction is permitted under Section 691 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. Check your tax returns to see whether you took this 
deduction. If not, you may still be able to file an amended return and claim a 
refund. The statute of limitations for amending a return is generally three 
years after the original return was due or filed, or two years from the date 
the tax was paid, whichever is later. Failure to file a claim within this 
period prevents you from receiving a refund, regardless of the validity of your 
claim. Pension Taxed, No Matter Who Gets It 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I will roll over my company pension savings plan when I retire soon. My 
account has my own contributions as well as employer contributions in the form 
of company stock and a sizable amount of accumulated interest that has not yet 
been taxed. If I were to change ownership of the company stock to community 
property, would the stock be entitled to a full step-up in value upon the death 
of either my wife or me? -- R.K.B.  
</P>
<P>
 A: No matter how you hold title to your pension account, to the extent that 
either you, your wife or your heirs withdraw funds that were deposited on a 
pretax basis, those disbursements will be taxable. If the withdrawals are made 
after your death, the disbursements are considered "income in respect to a 
decedent," and no matter who collects it, it is taxable. Remember, the deposits 
into this pension savings account -- and the interest they have generated over 
the years -- have not been taxed, and Uncle Sam isn't about to let anyone 
withdraw this money without paying him his due.

MANY NEW MEXICO RESIDENTS WELCOME INTEL AND NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on Intel in New Mexico ("Land of Disenchantment," May 4) would 
give you the impression that the citizenry at large is up in arms against 
economic growth, but in truth, it's a small but vocal group. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 800 people from Albuquerque and Rio Rancho attended a sold-out luncheon 
in January to thank Intel for their presence and growth in New Mexico, while 17 
people protested outside.The number of supporters in the community far outweigh 
the detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 As for aquifer water use, residential use in Albuquerque makes up 60% of 
consumption, while 3% is industrial. Intel's use in Rio Rancho, counted 
separately, is another 3%. Apartments, office and commercial use takes 28%, and 
9% goes to government and parks. Even after Intel's $1.8-billion expansion, 
industrial use of water is projected to remain under 9% of total daily 
consumption, much less than in many Southwest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 As residents of California have discovered, everyone must do their part to use 
water wisely. The peak of water use in Albuquerque occurs in summer as lawn 
watering doubles or triples winter usage amounts. Industrial use remains 
constant throughout the year. Intel is working aggressively to conserve and 
recycle the water they use. Residents could learn a few lessons from Intel's 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often in New Mexico's recent history, our young people have had to go 
elsewhere to find the kinds of jobs that Intel and other high-tech employers 
are bringing to the state. We continue to welcome these companies and will do 
all we can to attract such manufacturers to New Mexico.

DON'T INDICT HOUSING CREDIT OVER ONE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As disappointing as it was to read of the indictment of a low-income-housing 
syndicator for allegedly misusing the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit 
program ("Beverly Hills Man Indicted on Housing Fraud, May 18), it is critical 
for the public to understand how important and useful these credits are when 
administered properly and ethically. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, in fact, one of the few government subsidies that work exactly as 
they are supposed to, providing the means to develop badly needed affordable 
housing as well as creating significant income tax offsets for people and 
companies who invest in that housing.It is, in every respect, a win-win program 
whose success Congress recognized when it made the credit permanent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Just within the past two years, our company has applied more than $100 million 
in housing tax credits toward the development of thousands of affordable 
apartment units for senior citizens as well as families. This is not "welfare" 
housing, but decent homes for people like teachers, firefighters and office 
workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Four such recently completed apartment communities, located in Claremont, 
Anaheim, and Columbus and Middletown, Ohio, were completely leased within a 
matter of weeks, reflecting the tremendous demand for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, those 
communities would simply not have been built. It would be a grievous loss for 
the nation if this beneficial program was jeopardized by one isolated incident 
of alleged abuse.

EDS-SPRINT MARRIAGE BEGETS 'COMPUNICATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dour assessment ("EDS-Sprint Merger Appears to Be a Telecommunications 
Paper Tiger," May 19) on the prospective merger of EDS and Sprint misses the 
mark. This is not about a "telecommunications paper tiger" but the law of the 
jungle in action.Market forces (i.e. clients) drive strategy -- witness NCR's 
transformation of ATT Global Information Services. The EDS-Sprint marriage will 
be viewed as no less significant in the annals of the "compunications" industry 
as Western Union's decision was to not get involved in the telephone business 
over a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Inter-operability issues are the current roadblocks to ultimate multimedia 
networking. EDS has the infrastructure to address these areas, while Sprint has 
already distinguished itself in the deployment of fiber-optic technology. 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase Vice President Al Gore's favorite analogy, EDS represents the 
cars at the on-ramp of Sprint's superhighway.

BAJA OFFICIALS OUT TO SPOIL NAFTA AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prof. Jose De la Torre ("Mexico Is Unlikely to Retreat From a Decade of Rapid 
Progress," May 22) notes that "pre-1980s Mexico was (emphasis mine) 
characterized by trade barriers that shielded domestic business from foreign 
competition." However, a present-day news item plainly shows that local 
protectionist sentiments are still at work in Mexico attempting to circumvent 
free-trade provisions in apparent violation of the terms of NAFTA -- known in 
Mexico by its Spanish initials, TLC. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja California Norte officials have acted to ban sales of U.S.-produced milk 
in Tijuana's 18 Calimax stores. In refreshing frankness from officials 
anywhere, the Mexican state officials acknowledged that they were acting to 
protect their own dairy industry. Baja officials claim some 120,000 
individuals, either directly or indirectly, depend on their milk industry for 
jobs. Clearly, shielding domestic producers from foreign competition is a 
deeply ingrained, understandable reaction not easily shed. 
</P>
<P>
 On either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, unions, trade groups, professional 
associations, etc. have for decades used regulations, permits and licenses not 
so much for quality control, but for quantity control to artificially limit 
competition and protect their own bottom-line financial interests. Here, the 
quality of the milk was never at issue. Not surprisingly, then, the mechanism 
for the removal of the product was the lack of a state permit for the sale of 
the milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest insight into the Mexican Angst over the sale of U.S. milk 
in Tijuana and their threatened loss of milk industry jobs is to be found in 
many Mexican workers' definition of TLC: "todos a la calle" (everybody (out) to 
the street).  
</P>
<P>
 It would be reasonable to expect that this incident will not be the last -- 
merely the first -- free-trade skirmish where there are sure to be losers as 
well as winners. Will the "losers" merely just go away?

REMODELING MOTIVES: MORE THAN JUST MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy Kristof's article "Remodeling Blues" (Dec. 12), although narrowly 
accurate in its premise that many remodeling projects don't immediately 
increase the resale value of a home, failed by its narrow focus to account for 
the reasons homeowners spent more than $100 billion last year on home 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 This huge sum spent on the American home underlines the fact that there are 
many more definitions of profit and value when it comes to home ownership than 
mere resale considerations.In fact, treating the home solely as an investment 
vehicle is an idea that came and went with the '80s. Today there are broader 
definitions of value. 
</P>
<P>
 As past president of the National Assn. of Home Builders Remodelors Council of 
Southern California and the contractor pictured in the article, I have watched 
trends shifting in the statistics as well as in the needs and desires of those 
whom I have the pleasure of calling my customers.

 Value to homeowners today has more to do with lifestyle, sense of self, 
increased enjoyment of the home, pride of ownership and necessity than with the 
principles of accounting. A new kitchen may have been someone's lifelong dream, 
and with the kids gone they finally have the financial ability to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many ways to define value when improving a home as there are 
reasons for doing it. The bottom line is a combination of costs, needs and 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when these are put together in proper perspective is it possible to 
determine whether remodeling is right for you.

FED DOESN'T CONTROL LONG-TERM RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to leading Democrats ("Furor Grows Over Fed Policy," May 5), the 
Federal Reserve Board is to blame for higher mortgage and long-term interest 
rates. I am amazed at the lack of understanding of basic economics in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed simply doesn't control long-term rates. Investors -- tens of millions 
all over the world -- control long-term U.S. interest rates. And as a small 
member of this group, let me tell these "leading Democrats" exactly why we're 
out of the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 We have an Administration that has embarked on several curious strategies. One 
is to drive down the value of the dollar to crisis levels. Investors are just 
tickled when they wake up to crises in the currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 A second is the unmistakable message sent out recently by this Administration 
that inflation may not be so bad after all. Dovish Federal Reserve appointments 
don't impress investors, especially ones who still think that inflation and 
high unemployment can't coexist. 
</P>
<P>
 And the third is this Administration's foreign policy. In the span of 16 
months, this nation has become a picture of inaction and uncertainty, a Carter 
Administration without the morals. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe me, investors don't back a loser -- or its Treasury bonds.

CORRECTING STEREOTYPE OF INSURANCE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject of rebates ("Insurance Commission Rebates at Issue," May 12) does 
little more than fan the flames of the stereotyped life insurance agent. You 
know the "type" -- badgering their customers, forcing them to buy something 
they do not want and on top of that being overpaid.Nowhere does your article 
discuss the ongoing realities of servicing the client and the realities of 
overhead expenses that exist for the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 When people do their due diligence, they will find that the quality companies 
rarely pay more than 55% in first-year commission. The average overhead as 
reported by the MDRT and other organizations reflect that 35% to 38% of gross 
income is required to support overheads. This means the agent is functioning 
just like any other small-business person with staff, rent, equipment and, yes, 
insurance of their own to pay. I do not believe there is a disproportionate 
share of wealthy insurance agents about. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not confuse the issues of poor service, substandard carriers and ethics 
with the fiscal realities of running a quality business. There is no question 
that the insurance industry contains an abundance of poorly trained agents and 
inferior companies. However, rebates will do nothing to correct these important 
issues. Rather it is a punitive reflex to some real problems.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: SURE, L.A.'S SAFE -- JUST ASK THE LATEST VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you trust: your eyes and ears . . . or the statistics? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you trust the by-now-familiar popping of guns in the night, the squeal of 
tires signaling the dreaded drive-by, the chunky whir of police helicopter 
blades obliterating the drone of the television . . . or the statistics? 
</P>
<P>
 When I read Wednesday that Los Angeles doesn't rank among the 15 most 
dangerous American cities, I reacted the way most people around here did: with 
incredulity. Atlanta and Miami on the list I can understand. But we're safer 
than Kansas City, Mo.? Safer than Birmingham, Ala.? 
</P>
<P>
 Aw c'mon. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the evening before, we had driven past a crime scene -- yet another crime 
scene -- about half a mile from our house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a liquor store on Lincoln Boulevard this time. A garland of yellow 
police tape heralded the mayhem. Uniformed officers stood on the sidewalk and 
in the street the way cops do -- solidly, their feet planted far apart. One lit 
traffic flares. Neighbors stood quietly in a clump on the corner, watching. A 
car with its windows shot out was parked in an alley next to the store, facing 
Lincoln, steps away from the sidewalk. Powder blue sheets covered the car's 
missing windows. 
</P>
<P>
 I've watched enough TV to know a homicide scene when I see one. A man in a 
brown suit stood next to the shot-up car scribbling onto a note pad. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked into the house, turned on the computer and called up the wire service 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough: "A man was shot to death today as he sat in his car in the 
parking lot of a liquor store in the Venice area, authorities said. The victim 
was shot in the head. Paramedics found him in a Cadillac parked behind the 
liquor store and pronounced him dead at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a particularly public death. It occurred at 6 p.m. next to a busy 
thoroughfare. The assailants, reported by witnesses to have numbered three, 
maybe wearing masks, maybe driving a green station wagon or a beige sedan, must 
have known they might get stuck in traffic as they made their getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The brazenness was as appalling as the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what it's come to in the gang war raging like a Malibu fire on our 
side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, we stopped taking our toddler to the local park. She loves the 
swings and the sand. But our assumptions about what goes on in parks were 
molded a long time ago, in what feels like a galaxy far, far away. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is home to Project Heavy West, a gang counseling program not for 
former gang members, mind you, but for active ones. It's a good program -- 
well-regarded, with a 15-year track record -- but I don't want my child playing 
in the vicinity of gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's counselors told a friend, whose preschooler son also 
loves the park, that two gang-related shootings have occurred there in the last 
couple of years.  
</P>
<P>
 Statistically speaking, that isn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, one of Project Heavy's counselors, a 32-year-old black man named 
Jimmy Powell, was shot in the arm by two Latino teen-agers he had counseled. 
Powell was near his home in Oakwood, a neighborhood that has taken the brunt of 
a black-on-brown gang war that has claimed at least 13 lives since September. 
Some of the victims had nothing to do with gangs, the police say, but were 
singled out because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to support any effort to rid this city of gangs. And I don't want to be 
alarmist.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Project Heavy West senior case manager told me, "As neighborhoods go, 
this corner is pretty quiet," I had to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But who wants to take a chance? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the killing at the liquor store, I tried to contact the 
anti-gang police officers who work in the area. The officers on the case were 
out. But when I told the cop who answered the phone that I wanted to talk about 
Los Angeles failing to make the cut of the 15 most dangerous cities, I can only 
describe his response as a sputter. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I assured him, you can read it in The Times. We are No. 17 on the list. 
Our story was based on a piece in the June issue of Money magazine. Money 
analyzed 1993 FBI crime statistics on homicide, rape, burglary and aggravated 
assault. Its rankings were based on the number of violent crimes per 100,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole idea of a Midwestern city being more dangerous than Los Angeles is 
enough to jangle your brain. If it's any "consolation," in sheer numbers, Los 
Angeles -- with nearly 1,100 killings last year -- ranks No. 2 in the country 
for homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 So I feel vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 And sick.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; MR. FIX-IT; WHEN THINGS DON'T RUN RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA, THE 
WHITE HOUSE CALLS ON JOHN EMERSON. HIS JOB? ENSURING THAT THE POLITICIANS -- 
AND THE VOTERS -- ARE HAPPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Emerson has helped win political fights for Gary Hart, Jerry Brown and 
his current boss, President Clinton. But the victory he wanted so badly for 
himself, and gave away, tells his story best. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen candidates were running for a state Assembly seat from the Silver 
Lake-Echo Park district in 1991, in a punishing contest that gave new meaning 
to descriptions of Southern California as the Beirut of American politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, then Los Angeles' chief deputy city attorney, claimed an early lead. 
But after the opposition, in a cannonade of denunciations, painted him a 
bureaucrat, a pol and a carpetbagger (he had moved half a mile into the 
district), the lead was seized by Barbara Friedman, the candidate backed by 
labor and the influential organization of Reps. Howard Berman and Henry Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and advisers urged Emerson, who hadn't criticized his rivals, to mount 
a quick counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question what this would mean," says Rick Allen, who has been 
Emerson's best friend for 19 years and is the No. 2 official in the new 
national service program for young people. "If he did one mailing, he would 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 But Emerson would do no such thing. He thought it would undercut efforts to 
win points for waging a clean campaign and risk alienating Democratic friends, 
including those in organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut told me not to," Emerson says. 
</P>
<P>
 He came within 31 votes of victory, entitling him to a recount. But he 
wouldn't go for that either, reasoning that it might foster bitterness among 
his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's political friends nod knowingly at this story, because it seems to 
capture his essence. "Emo," as they call him, wants to always preserve his 
carefully cultivated relationships for another day. To minimize friction. To 
make sure everybody is heard from, everybody is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 All this oiling of the waters makes the 40-year-old lawyer an unusual figure 
in boisterous California politics, but it has served him well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other roles as a deputy assistant to the President, Emerson is a 
sort of untitled ambassador to California, in charge of ensuring that federal 
services are delivered, that the state's politicians are kept happy and that 
the White House has laid the groundwork to win 54 electoral votes in 1996. As 
such, he coordinated the Administration response to the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, a $10.3-billion project that mobilized several dozen federal 
agencies and most of the Cabinet secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, where Democrats feud among themselves almost as bitterly as 
with the Republicans, serving as Washington's emissary is no easy assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires someone who can walk through a jostling, scuffling, elbow-throwing 
crowd and emerge with his tie crisply knotted and a smile still on his face. 
Someone like Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with California is dealing with enormous egos and enormous stakes," 
says Tony Coelho, a former House Democratic leader and an outside adviser to 
the White House. "That tells you all you need to know about the confidence the 
President has in this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's diplomatic skills also have been in demand this past year in his 
role as deputy White House personnel chief, a job that, because of ethnic and 
gender diversity issues, guarantees controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson came to these positions with a surprisingly long political resume. He 
was Clinton's California campaign manager in 1992; deputy national campaign 
manager for Gary Hart's 1986-1987 presidential bid; Hart's California chairman 
in 1984, and general counsel for Jerry Brown's 1982 U.S. Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the key to deconstructing Emerson's personality lies in the fact 
that his father is a retired Presbyterian minister, his mother a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a minister's son, you've always got to stay on your best behavior: 
You never know when you may run into a member of the congregation," says David 
Dreyer, a White House aide who worked with Emerson on the Hart campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Lichtman, a Los Angeles political consultant who worked for a different 
candidate in the 1991 Assembly race, acknowledges that he's still baffled by 
Emerson's campaign move -- and by his unfailingly sunny disposition. "The guy 
is just, well -- terminally nice," he says with a hint of exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's upbringing does make his temperament and interests seem more 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 His maternal grandfather, John Sutherland Bonnell, and his father, James G. 
Emerson, were prominent Presbyterian ministers. The Rev. Bonnell was well-known 
as one of the first to challenge Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 When Emerson was growing up, primarily in the New York City suburbs of 
Bloomfield, N.J., and Larchmont, N.Y., he heard regular talk of his family's 
social and political concerns. He got involved in politics during his college 
years, taking part in anti-war rallies and walking New York precincts to help 
Democratic Sen. George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson flirted briefly with the idea of becoming a minister but decided 
against it: "I wanted to seek my own path." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and the University of Chicago 
Law School, Emerson moved to Southern California in 1978 to take a job with the 
politically influential Los Angeles firm Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor. Its 
founder, Charles T. Manatt, once chaired the Democratic National Committee. 
Emerson became a partner, built friendships with such firm members as U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, and assembled a huge network of other 
political contacts and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of those ties was evident in January after the earthquake, when 
Emerson was in the first group of officials to arrive from Washington. With his 
black cowboy boots and a cellular telephone often pressed to his ear, he 
swiftly became a familiar sight in the disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
 As one official explained, the goal in such a crisis is to prevent any hint of 
disorganization among government officials, lest panic ensue. "If it looks like 
there's panic, you can kiss it goodby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A critical test came early, in a brouhaha over the distribution of food 
stamps. The screening had been lax, drawing crowds of unqualified applicants to 
social service offices and contributing to fights and shoving matches that had 
police worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was taking responsibility for fixing it, and the bad publicity was 
threatening to drown out everything good we were doing," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, playing the role of a sort of master air traffic controller, started 
looking for a solution. He called County Supervisor Gloria Molina, Sheriff 
Sherman Block, the mayor's office and various federal authorities. After an 
ear-bruising half-day of cellular bonding, the team decided to switch to a 
network of fewer but larger processing centers, where more effective controls 
and police surveillance could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local officials were not happy to see centers moved out of their 
neighborhoods, but the crisis passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the guy who could do it, because no other federal official would feel 
like I was from another agency trying to give them orders," Emerson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Managing the earthquake aftermath required careful acknowledgment of political 
realities in other areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson engineered a very public federal response to South-Central Los Angeles 
in hopes of showing government support of victims of other tragedies. Federal 
contractors were prodded to not only hire minority firms but to offer jobs to 
those displaced by the quake and by the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 He also spent a day in the Simi Valley district of Rep. Elton Gallegy, a 
Republican, to forestall brewing criticism that the federal team was lax in 
assessing damage in outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
 His calming influence was also felt in Clinton's 1992 campaign in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the primary season, the Clinton team was coming under fire 
from headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., for being a low-energy outfit that was 
wasn't fully succeeding in mobilizing its own troops, much less the voters. 
Emerson, who brought the effort new access to top California Democrats, joined 
the organization in May and took over after the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to Emerson's approach is the idea of hearing everybody's views, even 
if such consultation sometimes comes at the cost of some administrative 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reorganized the campaign, Emerson inaugurated a daily meeting. He 
invited so many people to attend that a body sat on every surface, his desk 
included. Others stood outside, poking their heads through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, the type of freewheeling brainstorming session that would 
prevail in the White House. "This was very much on the Clinton model," one 
participant says. "You could maybe say that we didn't get as much business 
transacted as we needed to, but it was very, very inclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 That everybody-in approach also helped defuse complaints from powerful Friends 
of Bill, including television producers Harry Thomason and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason, who thought they ought to have a bigger role in the 
operation. Under Emerson, the FOBs were treated to special briefings and given 
a greater say in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton eventually surged to a 15-point lead in California, but powerful 
elected officials and contributors continued to bicker over vote drives, 
fund-raisers and such seemingly petty details as who would sit in the 
candidate's limo when he came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 When opposing forces tried to keep each other out of an event altogether, 
Emerson had to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say, 'You have to pull the other faction into this, or I am pulling 
the event. Period,' " recalls one campaign team member. 
</P>
<P>
 Having run the final days of Hart's 1987 campaign, Emerson was well-equipped 
to cope with discord. 
</P>
<P>
 After news stories about the former Colorado senator's extramarital affair 
rocked the campaign off course and led to the resignation of its manager, 
Emerson became part of a troika managing the moribund cause from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Rick Allen says Emerson played the role of the cinematic Davy 
Crockett at the Alamo, shoring up the brave few before they met their doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Other veterans of that campaign recall Emerson's comment to backer Warren 
Beatty on the day that a defiant Hart, in a press conference, backed out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor had been urging Hart to hang in there. Emerson knew it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren, it's raining concrete," he told Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
 With a reputation as one who tries so hard to maintain good relations, some 
thought Emerson ill-suited for his first White House post as deputy director of 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the task of filling the federal ranks, Emerson will say only: "It is 
impossible to describe the rush, the flood, the phone calls and faxes, and pure 
human Angst at the beginning of an Administration, when its party has been out 
of power for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 He obviously relished the chance to hire Californians, more than 200 of them. 
"There are three times as many Californians in this Administration as 
Arkansans," Emerson says. 
</P>
<P>
 He does acknowledge a few trying moments surrounding ambassadorial 
appointments, for which he was directly responsible. The Foreign Service Assn., 
which represents career diplomats, challenged four Administration nominations 
in a push for the hiring of more of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the disputed nominees was an Emerson friend, M. Larry Lawrence, the San 
Diego hotelier and financier who was central to Clinton's California campaign. 
Lawrence handily cleared the Senate as ambassador to Switzerland but was 
criticized for referring in a hearing to the staunchly neutral country as a 
U.S. ally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes to read in the paper that they're unqualified," Emerson says. 
"But he's a very appropriate candidate for Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
 With his earthquake relief work winding down, Emerson has gotten a new 
assignment, as the White House point man in the campaign to pass the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade through Congress. He is also responsible for 
projects involving Western water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the demands on his time, Emerson remains a social creature. He and his 
wife "are still usually the ones bringing people together," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
 And he seems to relish the opportunities for hobnobbing -- vacationing at the 
Jackson Hole, Wyo., ranch of Treasury Undersecretary Roger Altman, flying to 
California with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, watching basketball games 
and jogging with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Although serious about public policy, he is not, as Michael Dukakis was, the 
kind of public servant who keeps Swedish urban planning guides on his bed 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he can name the winners of the Best Picture Oscars for the past 10 
years; the interest in films stems in part from his wife, Kimberly Marteau, a 
lawyer and former vice president of Savoy Pictures who now heads public 
information for the U.S. Information Agency. (During her years at UCLA, Marteau 
had an acting role as a "sweat hog" on TV's "Welcome Back, Kotter.") 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met in California during the 1988 presidential campaign, when she 
was doing advance work for Dukakis. They moved last year from the Los Feliz 
area of Los Angeles to Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood, a section a few 
blocks north of the White House where the trendy and the rundown mingle. They 
are expecting a child, their first, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson has a few industry ties of his own, including friendships with 
screenwriter Gary Ross ("Dave"), Disney executives John Cook and the late Frank 
Wells, and actor Mike Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Such connections paid off in his Assembly campaign. In 12 weeks, he raised a 
formidable $350,000 from 800 contributors, allowing him to avoid accepting 
money from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly campaign showed, too, a bit about the approach Emerson will take 
in a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 One May evening in a debate at Los Angeles Community College, fellow candidate 
Adam Schiff gave him a thorough going-over. A federal prosecutor, Schiff 
derided Emerson's credentials as chief deputy city attorney and even ridiculed 
the tiny souvenir flashlights Emerson had passed out to voters as a symbol of 
his anti-crime-centered campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime-fighting, Schiff raged, was about bigger things than flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd sucked in a breath, and all heads swiveled toward Emerson, 
apparently expecting a thunderous counterpunch. But they didn't know this guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Adam hasn't gotten his flashlight yet," he said mildly. 
</P>
<P>
 A burst of laughter and applause followed. John Emerson needed to say no more.

SOCIAL CLIMES; DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS; A LONE GLITTER BALL JUST ISN'T ENOUGH 
AT NIGHTCLUBS. PATRONS WANT COMFORT. SO DESIGNERS CHOOSE ELEMENTS THAT CREATE 
COZINESS WITHOUT SACRIFICING STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Black walls, strobe lights and a cooler full of beer just don't cut it on the 
nightclub circuit anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to decor, jaded clubbies demand more from their nightspots, and 
apparently they're getting it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Gate, guests lounge on velvet ottomans in what appears to be a spacious 
English manor house. At Glam Slam, the dance floor is awash in constantly 
changing colored lights, and at Hell's Gate, gilded skulls line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the intricacies -- such as hand-painted faux finishes, inlaid wood 
bars, hidden alcoves, plush fabrics and ornate lamps -- might even go unnoticed 
at first. But all the elements work together to create the all-important 
atmosphere, be it danger, romance or decadence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I design a club that will give people the full run of night life," says Steve 
Edelson, a club builder and designer whose L.A. clubography includes Hell's 
Gate, Martini, Glam Slam, Union and Dragonfly. He's also designed clubs in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find a lot of faults with clubs that are just one room, and if the music's 
really loud and you want to have a conversation, you're nowhere. We try to 
combine a quiet space and an active space in each of our clubs, so there's 
always something to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "People pay a lot of attention to detail these days," he adds. "I attribute 
that to boredom. After you've gone to many nightclubs, you get bored very 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is elegant," says Albert Gersten, president of the Gate on La 
Cienega, a 1 1/2-year-old club done in what he describes as "English country 
manor" style. 
</P>
<P>
 That style was co-executed by Camilla Bennett in overstuffed brocade and 
velvet sofas and ottomans, dark wood, rows of bookshelves, sconces and 
hand-painted finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like you're in someone's living room rather than a club," she says. 
"Each space has its own feel, like the libraries (small, bookshelf-lined 
alcoves). The (dropped) ceiling probably contributes to it feeling like a more 
intimate space, rather than this huge space where you feel out of touch with 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Gate partner Mario Oliver, formerly of the nightclub Vertigo and the 
restaurant Tryst (both now defunct), agrees that's the feeling club-goers want 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vertigo was the '80s," he says. "People liked big rooms with big dance 
floors. People wanted to hear the music and go crazy. Now I think we've gone 
back more to ambience, where people want to feel cozy." 
</P>
<P>
 One unusual feature of the Gate is that the roped-off VIP gallery, as Gersten 
calls it, is in full view of the rest of the club. Usually VIP rooms are hidden 
away to keep the riffraff away from celebs and important customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gersten explains his concept simply: "I think people in the gallery want to be 
seen, and people not in the gallery want to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no VIP room in Edelson's Hell's Gate, which he describes as having 
the atmosphere of "a gangster's dungeon in the middle of London." 
</P>
<P>
 The funky, unmarked, smallish club on Yucca in Hollywood has a long bar made 
out of an airplane wing at the entrance. Walls are covered alternately with 
gold skulls, padded velvet panels and hand-painted designs. The bar ends at the 
dance floor, which features changing colored lights and a smoke machine. That 
segues into the patio, decorated with colored lights, more skulls, shrunken 
heads, fake guns and covered over with army camouflage netting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really done in survivalist fashion," Edelson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Design) ideas are something that just come. I sit down with my partners and 
we talk it out. The club evolves as we build it." 
</P>
<P>
 As it evolves, one other element is thrown into the mix: an atmosphere of 
sensuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see it in the pillar statues (of entwined naked figures) at Glam 
Slam," Edelson says, "(in) the black-and-white padded walls at Martini and (in) 
the patio at Hell's Gate. They're all very romantic kinds of crazy places with 
a sense of danger or an element of surprise. You can't have a great nightclub 
if you don't have a sense of the unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Designer and architect Jordan Mozer has built a reputation on the unexpected. 
His clubs and restaurants in the United States and abroad are whimsically 
fanciful, down to the very last detail. His Iridium restaurant in New York 
features chairs with legs that look like dancer's limbs en pointe and covered 
with leg warmers. The Cypress Club restaurant in San Francisco has curvy, fat, 
streamlined furniture, elaborately tiled floors and colorful murals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based Mozer will soon bring his talents to Los Angeles, designing 
a club on Sunset Boulevard that was once the site of Carlos 'n' Charlie's. Elie 
Samaha, a principal partner in the nightclub Roxbury, plans to turn the 
16,000-square-foot building into an entertainment megaplex complete with coffee 
bar-breakfast room, dance floor, restaurant and more, due to be finished at the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to walk into a club and be in Wonderland," Mozer says, "to go 
through the looking glass. Everything should reinforce that. It should be 
special, not like the rest of your day." 
</P>
<P>
 Mozer also believes in making a club "comfortable, like you don't feel you 
have to hold your stomach in or comb your hair every few minutes. . . . People 
now in the '90s are sexually conservative, and they're looking for less 
predatory atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
 The design process, he says, "starts when we break it down. We'll have an idea 
or collection of ideas and ways we think about the narrative nature of the 
place. We'll tell stories with the tile and the lamps and the chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 "At Iridium, we have lamps with tutus and columns that look like Cubist opera 
singers, because it's across from Lincoln Center. We have cabinets in ballet 
positions and tile that looks like music. It fits in with our theory about what 
music would look like if you could see it." 
</P>
<P>
 He explains that his concept of design is "more like a CD-ROM, where you can 
go anywhere, they're not necessarily linear ideas. . . . As we develop our 
narrative, we think about the relationships between the spaces, how people move 
through them, and we'll start to sculpt the spaces out of air. If we want to 
create a dance space, we'll try to make it big and tall, monumental, special, 
something that does kind of take your breath away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has a lot to do with (the design) and the sense of style," he adds. 
"We want to elicit emotional responses from the architecture, so it's important 
for us to understand the collective consciousness of the city -- what do people 
think about when they think about a restaurant? What is a club people grew up 
with in L.A., or a restaurant? What is the archetype? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really love nightclubs," Mozer says. "I'm kind of a voyeur and I'm a visual 
person, so I like to stand off to the side and watch things. When I think about 
creating public spaces, I think about actors who like to be the center of 
attention, and people like myself who like to go off in a cozy corner and watch 
the performers."

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY; FRENCH OFFICIALLY SAY 'MERCI' TO WWII VETERANS

 M erci l'Amerique ("Thank You, America") is in full swing under the auspices 
of His Excellency Jacques Andreani, Ambassador of France, and Consul General of 
France Jean Maurice Ripert. Marcia Israel will chair and Constance Towers 
Gavin, Anne Jeffreys Sterling and Joanna Carson co-chair Friday in the 
International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 In remembrance: More than 1,000 are expected for the black-tie gala to benefit 
American World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanteuse: Not only will the night be star-spangled, but French singer Line 
Renaud will sing a medley of songs from the era -- she was in France during the 
war. Expect marching bands, flags and "do you remember?"conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedding bells: Stephanie Niklas, daughter of the Kurt Niklases of Beverly 
Hills, married Lord Robin Russell, son of the Marquess and Marchioness of 
Tavistock of Woburn Abbey. The reception, naturally, was at the Niklas family's 
Bistro Garden in Beverly Hills. They'll live in England. On the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * Blue Ribbon of the Music Center members had their own Oscar this week -- 
Oscar de la Renta, the handsome New York designer who showed his fall-winter 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other designer in the world evokes the unanimous praise for making women 
look beautiful," gushed president Sandra Ausman at the podium. She seemed on 
target. Fashion mavens such as Doreen McElvany proclaimed the show "art -- this 
isn't fashion -- it's artistry," as a subtle paisley trimmed with faux cheetah 
hit the runway. Joan Hotchkis glowed: "The best show I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 That Blue Ribbon got Oscar and his pretty brunet wife, Annette, was lucky. The 
pair had to miss Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' funeral in New York. Over lunch, 
Oscar whispered his views of the late First Lady: "It's amazing. As sick as she 
was, she called Annette, who recently had an operation, twice to see how she 
was." It fit Sen. Ted Kennedy's church comment: "She worried more about us than 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Saks Fifth Avenue's new general manager, Tom Voltin, introduced the fashions 
and Helen O'Hagan, who retired last month as Saks vice president of public 
relations and is now a consultant, was at a center table with Annette's two 
daughters, Eliza Reed and Beatrice Morrison, and friend Casey Call before 
flying to Barbados to see Claudette Colbert. Fashion plates included Jane 
Ackerman, new Blue Ribbon President Phyllis Hennegin, Marcia Hobbs and Barbara 
Davis, who was hosting 62 at a dinner for the de la Rentas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several hundred, including Roger and Nila Barkley and Robert and Gwen 
Cheesewright, gathered in the Rose Pavilion to celebrate the new $1.5-million 
International Rosarium at Descanso Gardens. When completed in a year, it will 
contain 7,000 rose bushes representing 2,200 antique and modern varieties . . . 
At the Banning House, American landscape historian James J. Yoch addressed a 
crowd in the Howard Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lorna Reed of San Marino, with her enormous commitments of time to USC 
Norris Cancer Center and as a USC trustee, was given the Spirit of Voluntarism 
Award Tuesday by the Junior League of Los Angeles at its annual meeting at 
Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bert and Corina Greynald opened their beautiful North Ranch home for 
luncheon to celebrate the Center for the Performing Arts now under construction 
at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza . . . In San Juan Capistrano, Joan Irvine 
Smith will host the Oaks Classic next Sunday to benefit the National Water 
Research Institute. It's an afternoon of watching the jumpers compete over the 
white rails in the $50,000 Grand Prix Jumping Classic and the House of Hermes 
$10,000 Acorn Junior-Amateur Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private schools have taken a light approach to fund raising. At the 50th 
anniversary of Campbell Hall, the Bagpiper's Ball took on the mood of 
"Moonlight & Memories" with Rosemary Clooney crooning. At Mayfield Junior 
School's annual "All That Jazz" spicy Cajun benefit, co-chairs Rita Whitney and 
Cindy Hogan told guests to wear black-and-white attire. Thus, former Security 
Pacific President Bob Smith, wife Loretta, Fran and Rob Lynch and Tillie and 
Tom Collins arrived in striped prison uniforms to jam and jive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sharon Rising and Genevieve Fakoory were netting $90,000 for the 
Chandler School in Pasadena from a Roundup, where 375 parents raised funds for 
computer labs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keeping up: Chef Ken Frank poured on the Mississippi Delta cuisine, Dan 
Aykroyd and his Blues Brothers Band delivered the beat, and a crowd -- 
including Debbe and Spike Booth, Margaret and Tom Larkin, and Robin and Peter 
Barker -- reveled at House of Blues to raise funds for Childrens Hospital . . . 
Lucie Salhany, Lilly Tartikoff and Ronald O. Perelman, on behalf of the 
Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, brought a crowd together for a 
Beverly Hills International Ballroom luncheon briefing on "Women and Doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 * In this social city, Maria Murdock, Suzanne Marz and Erika Brunson assembled 
friends for a sit-down tea at the Regency Club, honoring Arianna Huffington and 
her new book, "The Fourth Instinct" . . . Flocks of supporters celebrated the 
completion of the $4-million facility for the Pasadena Humane Society and 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * We can vouch for Carmine's sauteed eggplant. We've cooked it. It's 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe came with the invitation from the Downtown Women's Center for its 
"stay-at-home event" along with four other recipes from Carmine Marinelli. 
(He's house prop master for the Music Center Operating Co.) 
</P>
<P>
 Regularly he has been chef for the Center's benefit dinners, canceled this 
year for a stay-at-home strategy designed to make $50,000.

THE BUZZ: A SIGN OF THE '90S -- ABBY BEATS US TO THE BUZZ

 First Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and now . . . Abby? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, in Dear Abby a few weeks back, Abigail Van Buren opined that 
legalization of drugs was "an idea to consider." This one opinion has generated 
more mail into her Beverly Hills office than any column in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got much more reaction than I ever imagined," says Van Buren, who, we 
were surprised to learn, always has been pro-legalization and reads her own 
mail. "It's still pouring in weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the reaction split, but opinions pro and con were found on both 
sides of the generational divide. An 11-year-old kid, for instance, wrote in to 
say that he thought Abby's libertarian views were stupid. On the other hand, 
Abby says, "people have written me from nursing homes and said "Right on, it's 
time people realized that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, we wonder what Abby's sister Ann Landers has to say about this. 
</P>

 Odes to eats: We're noticing that L.A.'s up-and-coming bands are laying off 
the love songs these days and, instead, are singing about what's really at the 
root of Angeleno Angst -- not being able to find a decent diner. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: On "Invisible," from Possum Dixon's debut CD, the group sings, "My 
head aches / Echo Park turns to Silver Lake / Well, Millie's Diner is closed 
today / Oh, oh." 
</P>
<P>
 Things don't get any better on the other side of town. That Dog's debut CD has 
a song called "Westside Angst," in which the quirky quartet bellyaches that 
"There's no more Ships in Westwood now / Can't have my toast and eat it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Poignant, indeed. Now, if only someone can spare a few sad lyrics on behalf of 
the Miracle Milers who miss the Carnation Diner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 And here's something else to sink your teeth into: A North Hollywood company 
has been marketing a product called Love Gum, which has been turning up in 
liquor stores and 7-Elevens all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the box, it's "a full-potency gum to increase romantic power." 
Scanning the ingredients list, it seems that this Chiclet-like chewing gum gets 
its charge from natural ginseng powder, although we're frankly a little dubious 
about the presence of softeners.

WESTSIDE WATCH: WHALE-DOLPHIN ACT MAKES MALIBU A MULTICULTURAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Malibu sent a message to the Flippers of the world, declaring 
its shores a "human-dolphin shared environment." Last week city leaders took 
the next step, officially naming whales and dolphins a "living cultural 
resource." 
</P>
<P>
 "People will think we're nuts out here unless they understand why we're doing 
this," says Mayor Pro Tem Joann House. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: The resolution, passed Monday, was a message to the International 
Whaling Commission, which was meeting in Puerto Vallarta last week. Frances 
Jeffrey, spokesman for the Monterey-based Great Whales Foundation, said 
Malibu's action is intended to help promote the view of whales as a "living" 
culture rather than as food. He planned to fax the resolution to Mexico in 
hopes of changing the way cetaceans are viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action came after a hearing two weeks ago in which the "living 
cultural resource" measure drew support from environmentalists, a harpist -- 
from Wales, no less -- and a surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swim with the dolphins and sometimes I think I am part dolphin," said John 
Fain, a legendary surfer who lives in Malibu. "Where will we go if Malibu is 
ruined -- Santa Barbara? The water's too cold there." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ON THE ROAD: The Wilshire Boulevard off-ramp from the southbound San Diego 
Freeway will be closed Monday from 11:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and so will 
Wilshire Boulevard between Sepulveda Boulevard and Federal Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't panic. It's for a good cause: a Memorial Day ceremony in which the 
stretch of Wilshire fronting Veterans Cemetery will be dedicated "Veterans 
Parkway."

 ELEPHANTINE ENDORSEMENTS: When in doubt, get help from the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman(D-Marina del Rey) has been tagged a "liberal" by Rancho Palos 
Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron 
Florance -- the Republicans competing for the right to challenge her in the 
36th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 So at a recent rally, Harman unveiled a list of "Republicans for Harman" to 
show that her campaign has bipartisan support in the largely coastal district, 
which runs from heavily Democratic Venice to the solidly Republican Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 40 or so names on the list were former Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert, 
former Rolling Hills Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh, GM Hughes Electronics 
Chairman C. Michael Armstrong and TRW Space and Electronics Group General 
Manager Tim Hannemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Geissert, for one, supported Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores 
in her unsuccessful race against Harman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's produced," Geissert said, noting Harman's efforts to prevent the 
closure of Los Angeles Air Force Base and secure a federal defense conversion 
grant for Hi-Shear Technology Corp., a Torrance company. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's opponents are not worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks says Harman "speaks like a Republican" then sides with Democrats in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have something like this," said Florance campaign consultant John 
Carlson. "It's a common political thing."

THE JUNE 7 ELECTIONS; LEGISLATIVE HOPEFULS' PRIMARY WISH IS TO GET NOTICED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk into the church. Go past a wedding rehearsal, around the corner, across a 
dark patio and up the stairs. Enter a room that has many chairs but few 
occupants, except on the stage, where seven candidates sit shoulder to shoulder 
making speeches, mostly to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Primary Campaign '94, an election season that will end on June 7 
without, in all likelihood, ever capturing the public's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four primary races for California Assembly seats from the Westside, all 
but one are up for grabs, largely because term limits have pushed veteran 
legislators to seek employment elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) of the 41st District, Assemblyman 
Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) of the 42nd District and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore 
(D-Los Angeles) of the 47th District are all running for other offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the change of the guard in Sacramento, candidates and campaign 
workers say the sparsely attended 42nd Assembly District candidates' forum 
earlier this month is typical of their experiences of trying to reach voters 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to study up," admitted actor Steve Franken, a voter in the 
42nd Assembly District, which includes Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Westwood 
and the Fairfax area. Franken is walking precincts for a candidate in another 
district, but he has no idea who will get his vote to be his own legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of voter attention places even more emphasis than usual on the 
campaign mail that will be filling voters' mailboxes this week. Expect a lot of 
it, because candidates have raised or lent their campaigns significant sums of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 With a glut of viable candidates, none of them widely known, political 
prognosticators are loath to handicap these races. Too many savvy candidates 
with similar messages are trying to reach "their" voters, the pundits say, and 
the voters may or may not be moved to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 42nd, Los Angeles Community College Trustee Wally Knox is making a 
hard-edged law-and-order pitch that is unusual for this liberal district. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his mailers featured a uniformed, masked police officer pointing a 
large weapon and compares Los Angeles to a war zone. Another quoted a crime 
victim: "I was trimming my roses when a man walked up and said, 'Give me your 
wallet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are trying to reach their core voters too. West Hollywood 
Councilwoman Abbe Land sent a piece to women voters. Los Angeles school board 
member Mark Slavkin targeted parents with school-age children. He also went 
after older Jewish voters, noting his endorsements by Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
and County Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John Duran is mounting an absentee-ballot effort among voters 
identified as gay and lesbian, going so far as to pick up the completed ballots 
to make sure they get in. Homeowner activist Laura Lake is paying special 
attention to the San Fernando Valley portion of the district, and West 
Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz has sent out a potholder and a picture of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin aide Jefferson Crain said he expects just 1,000 votes to separate the 
top several candidates in this strong field. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41st Assembly District, to the west, is a schizophrenic swing district 
running from Santa Monica through the West San Fernando Valley to the Ventura 
County line, lumping Santa Monica renters with more conservative homeowner 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 The six Democrats in the race are working hard, and money does not seem a 
problem for most of them. Two Republicans, banker Peter Eason and law student 
Michael Meehan, are seeking to oppose the winning Democrat in November. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democratic candidate, attorney Edward Tabash, won a place on the 
Berman-D'Agostino slate mailer and is also on another major slate mailer put 
out by consultant Clint Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabash has set himself apart on immigration issues, suggesting in an interview 
that undocumented residents who seek emergency medical treatment should be 
deported after receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his opponents, attorney Roger Diamond, says Tabash's 
"immigrant-bashing" is an example of how the candidates in this race are 
"pandering to the baser instinct in human beings . . . to their fears and 
prejudices." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila James Kuehl, a Santa Monica women's rights attorney, is concentrating 
on her base of women and Santa Monica voters. Statements touting her as 
essential to protect rent control and featuring her extensive background on 
women's issues have already hit the mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates appear to be concentrating on the Valley portion of the 
district, where half the votes lie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 47th District, which was drawn to favor election of an African 
American, nine Democrats and two Republicans want to represent the area, which 
encompasses the Crenshaw District, Cheviot Hills and Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the contenders are Kevin Murray, son of veteran Assemblyman Willard W. 
Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), and Ed Johnson, a longtime aide to Rep. Julian Dixon 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Both have significant support from elected officials, but community activist 
Valerie Lynne Shaw, a grass-roots candidate, is also a contender, along with 
attorney Geoff Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd Assembly District, which runs from Venice to the South Bay, 
freshman lawmaker Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) is running unopposed in the 
Democratic primary. David Bohline and Julian Sirull are the Republican 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the Westside are also included in a state Senate contest that 
features a legislator -- State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) -- who has 
been an elected state official since Franklin D. Roosevelt was President. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills faces three challengers in the 28th District, which stretches from 
Venice to Long Beach. They are Torrance City Councilman George Nakano, Venice 
attorney Mike Sidley and Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda.

THE JUNE 7 ELECTIONS; 2 SQUARE OFF FOR COUNTY JUDGESHIP; 7 VIE FOR SPOT ON 
CULVER CITY BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Santa Monica Superior Court judge is facing a countywide election 
challenge from a Westside attorney whose license was suspended earlier this 
year for professional misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In another judicial race, seven candidates are seeking the office of retiring 
Culver City Municipal Judge Harold I. Cherness. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide contest pits Superior Court Judge Irving Shimer, rated 
"well-qualified" by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., against attorney Stuart 
H. Hirsh, who was found to be "unqualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a State Bar Court judge wrote that Hirsh suffered from a 
"borderline personality" disorder and had "poor impulse control." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh, 62, was suspended for, among other things, keeping more legal fees than 
he was entitled to, according to a written opinion by the State Bar judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh dismissed the misconduct charges as "so ridiculous they're funny." He 
has filed a federal lawsuit against the Bar and the California Supreme Court 
challenging their jurisdiction over attorney discipline. A federal trial judge 
dismissed the case, but it is on appeal, Hirsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension has yet to be affirmed by the California Supreme Court. Until 
then, Hirsh is considered a lawyer in good standing, allowing him to challenge 
Shimer in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hirsh said he has not tangled with Shimer in court, he said he chose to 
run against him because he "had never heard anything good about the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer responded, "I expect lawyers to be prepared and to behave 
professionally. When I encounter professional dishonesty or chicanery, I become 
very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer, 62, was appointed to the bench by Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. He 
estimated that the reelection fight could cost $100,000. Superior Court judges 
earn a base salary of $104,262 a year and can be challenged every six years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, candidates for the Municipal Court include Alan J. Goodman, 
48, a business attorney who was a deputy attorney general with the California 
Department of Justice, and City Council member Steven Gourley, 45, an attorney 
who has served as a judge pro tem in Culver City and West Los Angeles since 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate, attorney and former City Council member Paul A. Jacobs, 52, 
has also volunteered as a temporary judge in Culver City and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, Gourley and Jacobs all received "well-qualified" ratings from the 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Christine L. Harwell, 45, a volunteer judge for the Los Angeles 
Municipal Court in small claims and traffic court, received a "qualified" 
rating. Victor A. Marin, 46, a Culver City attorney, was rated "not qualified" 
by the association, which said "he lacks the professional ability required for 
this judicial office." 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public doesn't care about these ratings," Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two candidates, Martin J. Murphy, 48, and J. Richard Pearce, 55, 
were found to be "qualified" by the county bar. Murphy has been an attorney 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission since 1990, and Pearce is a deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 A municipal court judge earns $95,214 a year and serves a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City judicial district includes Marina del Rey, Ladera Heights, 
Windsor Hills, Fox Hills and Culver City.

THE JUNE 7 ELECTIONS; VICTORIES EXPECTED FOR 4 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three members of the Westside congressional delegation face what appears to be 
token opposition and a fourth is unopposed as the June 7 primary election 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be a difficult time for any" of the three, said Republican 
political consultant Allan Hoffenblum, referring to the Democratic incumbents 
with primary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the challengers acknowledge as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever wondered what it feels like to be a salmon swimming upstream?" 
begins a press release from Jon Rappoport, the lone opponent to powerful Rep. 
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) in the 29th Congressional District, which covers 
much of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, a champion of health reform who has taken on the tobacco companies, is 
widely considered to be a shoe-in to win an 11th term in November in the 
solidly Democratic district. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) is similarly a heavy favorite 
against his primary opponent in the sprawling 24th district, which stretches 
from Malibu to Sherman Oaks and across parts of the San Fernando Valley to 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 32nd District, veteran Congressman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) is 
heavily favored to defeat two challengers in the district that stretches from 
Baldwin Hills and Culver City to near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 First-term Congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Los Angeles), who represents the 
coastal 36th district that runs from Venice to the South Bay, has no primary 
opponent. She is expected to be the target of a lively Republican challenge in 
November, however.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BRENTWOOD; RADISSON HOTEL SECURES PERMIT TO CONTINUE TO HOST 
FUNCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Radisson Bel-Air Hotel has won permission to continue hosting social 
functions and business conventions, despite a local neighborhood association's 
complaints about noise and traffic tie-ups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles' Board of Zoning Appeals voted unanimously Tuesday to 
grant a conditional use permit to hotel owner Efrem Harkham provided that the 
hotel meet certain city conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents in the area support the hotel's convention and social function 
business, saying it helps the local economy and has not caused noise and 
traffic problems. But one residents' group, the Brentwood Neighbors Assn., 
disagrees, and plans to appeal the zoning board's decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The association became sharply critical of Harkham after the businessman 
purchased the 161-room hotel in 1983 and enlarged it in 1986 to accommodate 
business meetings, conventions and banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkham transformed the facility, zoned as an apartment hotel, into a 
full-service hotel without obtaining the correct city permits, city officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, sought to revoke the 
hotel's existing permits in the spring of 1992 but halted the effort when the 
City Council ordered Harkham to obtain the proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the homeowners association say the zoning board's vote Tuesday 
rewards the hotel for an illegal expansion of the facility and for a de facto 
transformation of the zoning rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really talking about creeping rezoning here," said Roger Rosendahl. 
"Our neighborhood was promised by the city 40 years ago that this operation 
would stay zoned as an apartment-hotel. This hotel has violated the law for 
years, and the city is now saying that if you break the law we'll help you out 
by making it legal after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was made on condition that the hotel comply with city 
transportation, fire and building and safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Rogger, a deputy to Braude, said the councilman supports the compromise 
because the hotel is a longtime Westside business and has agreed to meet the 
city's conditions, which -- among other things -- will mean making parking and 
fire safety improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to put them out of business but to contain them and make them 
run their operation in a manageable way," Rogger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harkham: "We're very happy, our staff is relieved and our neighbors have 
been phenomenal." ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; EX-BUFFALO SOLDIERS TEACH FORGOTTEN CHAPTER OF 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Buffalo Soldiers are a part of history that Charles Johnson has never read 
about in any textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Johnson and 100 other students at Dorsey High School got a 
firsthand account of what it was like to belong to a black cavalry unit that 
served in a segregated U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the stuff they're telling us we don't really know," said Johnson, a 
junior. "At first I thought the Buffalo Soldiers were from the Civil War, 
maybe, but I didn't know much about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at attention during a two-hour assembly, former Buffalo Soldiers John 
Tull, Franklin Henderson and Frederick Jones shared their memories of serving 
in North Africa and Korea and of patrolling the Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are finally recognizing the omission of many different 
cultures' history," said Henderson, president of the Buffalo Soldiers national 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1866, the Buffalo Soldiers helped patrol the West on horseback. 
They later served in several other conflicts, including World War II. More 
recently, the men of the all-black cavalry unit were honored by the Armed 
Forces, and the Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating their service. 
</P>
<P>
 Tull, who joined the Buffalo Soldiers after graduating from college, said he 
was drawn to the military because of the lack of jobs for African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at all the guys who had gone to school with me, and they were 
carrying mailbags or working as janitors," Tull, 75, told the students. "I said 
I would do better than that, and I joined the Army because my grandmother, who 
was a slave, said, 'You've got to get into the cavalry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Army disbanded the Buffalo Soldiers -- the Plains Indians had given them 
that name in honor of their fierce spirit -- in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sabrina Jackson, 17, the oral histories proved to be a lesson she won't 
soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (teen-agers) hear so much about slavery and the downfall of blacks rather 
than the positive side of what we've achieved," Jackson said. "This is long 
overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Waving their hands in the air, students strained to ask questions that, for 
the ex-soldiers, evoked painful memories of loss, isolation and conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 James Berger, a history teacher at Dorsey, arranged for the veterans to visit 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is get students to talk to people -- whether it be to 
their parents or their grandparents -- about their history," Berger said. "It's 
important for students to have access to living historical figures." SANDRA

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; PLAN TO ALLOW PUSHCART VENDORS BACKED BY 
PLANNING COMMISSION

<P>
 Hoping to boost pedestrian traffic in Beverly Hills' shopping district, the 
city's Planning Commission has endorsed a plan to allow street vending carts on 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
 The pushcarts, which will probably be restricted to selling flowers or 
nonalcoholic drinks, could set up at privately owned shopping malls or other 
sites that have enough space for the large carts, the commission said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission joined with Rodeo Drive merchants in opposing vendors in public 
areas such as sidewalks and streets. But it expressed support for a flower 
stand on a parking lot on Beverly Drive and plans to consider opening several 
other locations to vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city allows vending only from permanent structures, which 
amounts to a ban on pushcarts on both private and public property. Before the 
recommendations can take effect, the plan must be approved by the Beverly Hills 
City Council. The council is expected to take up the matter later this summer.

COVER STORY; HOUSE WARMING; REAL ESTATE: AFTER YEARS OF ICE-COLD SALES, THE 
WESTSIDE HOUSING MARKET IS STARTING TO HEAT UP. FUELING THE SURGE ARE 
FIRST-TIME BUYERS PURCHASING LESS-EXPENSIVE HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Aaroe doesn't go for that ordinary daredevil stuff. He doesn't bungee 
jump from cliffs, race the Formula One circuit or trek through the Himalayas 
looking for Bigfoot. The man doesn't even smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally risk-averse," he confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, last January, Aaroe did something many would find even more daunting. In 
the midst of Southern California's worst real estate recession in decades -- 
with housing prices in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars below their 
level of five years ago -- Aaroe abruptly left the Jon Douglas Co., where he 
had worked for 18 years, to open his own residential realty firm in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The move did not meet with overwhelming acclaim. Some of Aaroe's friends and 
acquaintances, to put it bluntly, thought he soon would be selling shirts 
instead of homes. "They said it was a terrible thing to be doing," Aaroe 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not any longer. After several years of downward mobility, the city's housing 
market finally seems to be on the road back from nowhere. And Aaroe, who 
correctly surmised that Southern California's slumping market was about to 
shape up, is suddenly a man with vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his opening, Aaroe has more than doubled his work force -- from 19 to 44 
employees -- and his firm has an inventory of 90 Westside homes worth about 
$145 million. On one busy day two weeks ago, Aaroe's realtors sold $4 million 
worth of property. His second office will open next week in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see a market that was changing," said Aaroe of his decision to strike 
out on his own -- made just two weeks before he opened for business. "You could 
feel there was slightly less inventory and a few more buyers with consumer 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 No, prosperity may not be just around the corner for Westside residential real 
estate. But from Hancock Park to West Los Angeles to Malibu, real estate agents 
report a dramatic increase in home sales and say their hands are full with 
properties that, for the first time in months, are receiving multiple offers. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be enough to entirely lift Los Angeles out of its economic 
quagmire, but, for now, the quickened pace is providing hope for the 
once-moribund housing market. Compared to one year ago, the percentage of 
listed homes that sell throughout Los Angeles has nearly doubled -- from 19% to 
34% -- with the bulk of the increase attributable to single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Jon Douglas said his overall sales of homes were up 40% in March over 
the previous year, and broker Fred Sands said his firm's home sales in March 
were greater than in any month during the last four years. April, he added, 
proved nearly as busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "March and April were gangbusters," Sands said. "There's four years of pent-up 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city whose mantra is real estate, the prospect of a rebound is being 
received with guarded enthusiasm. Real estate agents acknowledge that the sales 
increase has not been accompanied by a rise in home prices and is mostly a 
result of first-time buyers purchasing less-expensive homes. But they 
nonetheless forecast modest appreciation for most homes in 1994. Moreover, 
compared to the industry's long dearth of home purchasing, any activity on the 
part of buyers, they say, bodes well. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate experts give several reasons why buyers are suddenly scurrying 
into homes. Perhaps the biggest factors have been the slight rise recently in 
interest rates, coupled with a sense that the housing market has finally 
bottomed out. Both factors, they say, sent messages to potential home buyers 
that the only place for rates and prices to go was upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agent Bill Douglass, for example, recently bought a two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom residence in the "$400,000 range" in south Santa Monica after a 
scant two weeks of looking. Why? Partially for tax reasons, he said, and 
partially because of a perception that finally "the market was going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another, less tangible reason, brokers say, is the feeling among many 
Angelenos that the area's economy is improving, even though the economics of 
the housing market have not drastically changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really attitude," said Tim Corliss, an Re/Max realtor and past president 
of the Los Angeles Assn. of Realtors. "(A few months ago), prices and interest 
rates were still low but the buyers were still scared. Now there's a 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 And buyers wading into the market take with them more than confidence -- they 
also are armed with a great deal of buying power. In spite of the newfound 
activity, the median prices of homes in many areas have declined. Overall on 
the Westside, the median sales price of a single-family home in 1994 is about 
$35,000 less than it was a year ago; for condominiums, the median price fell 
$13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the price drop is to be expected, given the decade of dizzying market 
appreciation -- 20% yearly in some areas -- that preceded the recent recession. 
In fact, this was the only downturn in the past 30 years to result in lower 
housing prices, which usually stabilize during lean times. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Corliss, Westside housing prices are still down 30% to 50% from 
their peak of several years ago. He points to one Santa Monica home 10 blocks 
from the beach that he recently sold for $440,000. Seven years ago, just before 
the market topped out, Corliss sold a nearly identical home two blocks away for 
$865,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "More sellers are being realistic, and that's enabling buyers to buy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Douglass agrees: "The sellers understand (that) they're not going to get 
what they got in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 Because homes are now being priced more realistically, brokers are facing an 
enviable problem -- a lack of available homes for sale. That shortage is now 
being felt in expensive areas too. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, says John Aaroe realtor Helene Sherman, 13 homes have been 
sold in Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills -- more than were sold there all of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Sherman says, a Beverly Hills home that was listed for $895,000 
attracted 27 offers before it sold for nearly $1.1 million. "If it's priced 
right, it's going to get activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Sands broker Hilda Cohen agrees: "As soon as a good property comes on the 
market, people swoop down on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all good properties, however, are seeing their stock rise again. A notable 
exception in the Westside's incipient market recovery are condominiums, the 
sales of which have remained stagnant even though they have suffered the same 
downward sticker shock as single-family residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one reason may have to do with the recent surge in house sales. 
Because single-family residences now are competitively priced with condos, 
buyers -- especially first-time home buyers -- are opting for houses instead. 
Even those who would normally consider purchasing a condominium are finding 
that the maintenance fees required by condos could be better used to buy a 
larger, higher-priced single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a glut of condominiums on the market. Among the high-rise 
luxury buildings of the Wilshire Corridor, for example, where maintenance fees 
can easily run more than $1,000 monthly, sales have been virtually nonexistent, 
even for lesser-priced units. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, only two sales of Wilshire Corridor condos priced between 
$180,000 and $250,000 have closed and only 16 have been sold overall. One 
typical example: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit in a full-service building, 
complete with 24-hour valets, sauna, Jacuzzi and exercise room. Once appraised 
at more than $325,000, it has now been listed for six months for $100,000 less. 
No bids have been made on the property and fewer than a dozen people have come 
to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are walking away from a lot of these units," said Sherman, who cites 
another case of a luxury condo that was bought for $800,000 a few years ago but 
now will probably sell for less than $500,000, if not lower. "It's going to 
take years for us to absorb (the glut)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Matt Roberts about the state of the condominium market. The Brentwood 
publicist is attempting, so far in vain, to sell a two-bedroom, two-bath, 
1,500-square-foot condo in "great condition." Purchased seven years ago for 
$215,000, Roberts had the property listed for six months last year at $179,500 
with no takers. Now, in what has become a nationwide trend, he plans to give 
the condo to the winner of an essay contest. Entrants will be charged $200 to 
write, in 500 words or less, "Why would you want to live on the Westside of Los 
Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts hopes to attract at least 1,000 entrants and to have their entry fees 
pay off the mortgage. The state attorney general's office has ruled in the past 
that such schemes are against the law because they constitute illegal 
lotteries, but Roberts says his contest will be judged by USC and UCLA English 
professors and that, consequently, it will be a competition based on skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, although Roberts is confident that he will be able to pull off the 
contest, he acknowledges that he never envisioned that the Westside condominium 
market would sink to a point where he would have to dream up such a desperate 
selling scheme. "It's just a mess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eternally optimistic brokers insist that if Roberts can wait it out, the 
market will turn for condos as well. Once buying becomes the norm again, they 
say, it will simply be a matter of time before all the choice single-family 
homes are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that was precisely the thinking last January of Joel Secarz, 34, when 
he purchased his piece of the American dream -- a 1940ish, three-bedroom, 
two-bath home north of Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. Part of Secarz's 
decision to buy was fueled by his having accumulated a sufficient down payment 
for the $400,000-plus home. The other part was due to the sudden change in home 
prices and interest rates. For the best deal, Secarz said, he figured he'd have 
to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (are) more houses being sold and there are more buyers out there," said 
Secarz, a first-time homeowner. "People have finally decided that now is the 
time." On the Rebound 
</P>
<P>
 After four years in the deep freeze, sales of residential property on the 
Westside are heating up. Prices have yet to follow the up-tick in sales, but 
real estate agents and would-be sellers say any action is welcome. These 
figures are for single-family residences in the Westside area.

BIKE PATH: ROLLING CONTROVERSY: WHEELS VS. WALKERS IN VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "On the War Path" (May 19, Westside): We pedestrians who continually dodge 
speeding bicyclists on the "Pedestrians Only" path -- from Temescal Canyon to 
the Bel Air Bay Club -- would be more inclined to sympathize with the bikers' 
safety problems if they themselves were considerate enough to keep off our 
"Peds Only" segment. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than enough signs, on poles and on the pavement, to inform even 
the illiterate that no bicycles are allowed. The path is narrow, and used by 
walkers from toddlers to very elderly people. Yet the bikers whiz by, brushing 
against us, completely oblivious and utterly selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 If it hasn't happened already, someday someone will be seriously injured or 
killed while walking this stretch. Supervisor Dana and Councilman Braude, when 
will this law be enforced? 
</P>

<P>
 One reason I rarely ride on the bike path is the danger of collision with 
slower traffic (pedestrians, skaters, etc.) Few people follow the most basic 
rules of the road: Respect those around you, keep to the right, be aware of 
your surroundings, pass only when safe, etc. Perhaps you should publish a few 
simple guidelines such as these to make people aware of bike-path etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another easy solution to the pedestrian/in-line skater problem on the 
bike path: Ticket them! Cyclists are given moving violations when they violate 
street motor vehicle laws, so why not create and enforce bike path rules? What 
an easy way to generate revenue for the city and county! I hereby volunteer for 
duty!

 Last Sunday morning, heading south on the bike path as my blading partner and 
I rolled north, was a club of wheelchair athletes. We were all enjoying the 
early-morning mist, the relatively uncrowded lanes, the shores of the Pacific 
Ocean right beside us. Your Westside cover article of May 19 left me feeling 
that I don't belong there. That the wheelchairs don't either. According to the 
law. That I/we are somehow responsible for the increase in accidents -- 
"although officials do not keep precise numbers on accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone noticed how faded the "Bikes Only" markings are on the path? Times 
have changed. Perhaps it is time to change the wording too -- to WHEELS ONLY. 
For the father who jogs pushing his child in a stroller, for those in recumbent 
bicycles, for roller bladers and roller skaters. For all of us who come to the 
beach to see the ocean and smell the air, to roll in relative safety. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would dispute the increase in volume of use on the path. At certain 
hours congestion can lead to risky maneuvers to avoid a collision. Some rollers 
are more responsible than others. I sound like a driver describing an L.A. 
freeway in the morning! A driver waiting for the third car to drive through a 
red light! Do the police issue citations for that? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not channel energy (and) funds into this great resource for residents and 
visitors alike. The remark about requiring tourists to take blading lessons was 
amusing. How many of us started cycling that way? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not build wider paths, parallel paths, paths for everyone, walkers and 
rollers -- in the spirit of Marvin Braude -- instead of lapsing into tiresome 
claims of ownership? There's a lot of sand out there; one more strip of 
pavement will only improve this paradise. 
</P>

 BRENDA R. HANNING, Venice  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thank you for calling attention to the dangerous situation that exists on the 
Venice portion of the county bike path. While congestion of multiple types of 
users is a problem all along the path, it is pronounced in Venice due to the 
large number of competing users. In addition, hairpin turns that were 
originally engineered into the path to slow down bike traffic are instead the 
cause of numerous accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In September of last year the Venice Boardwalk Assn., along with other civic 
organizations in Venice, proposed the construction of a new jog/walk/skate lane 
parallel to the existing bike path to separate bike riders from joggers, 
skaters and pedestrians and to create more capacity. We then proposed in 
January that $690,000 of the $30 million in county Proposition A bond funds 
earmarked for beach improvements be used for the new path and to straighten the 
existing path. 
</P>
<P>
 We are hopeful that the county will support this solution to the problem that 
reporter Adrian Maher so clearly outlined in his recent article.

CIVIC CENTER: RAND CORP. DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When discussing the issues with the opponents of Santa Monica's new Civic 
Center plan, it becomes immediately apparent that traffic is not the real 
issue. Even more curious is that the actual urban design is rarely discussed. 
What comes out of the traffic complaint is some number of trips per day that, 
like many statistics, sounds high when taken alone, but is not alarming when 
compared to the whole city. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the new Olympic Boulevard extension should actually reduce impacts 
along 4th, especially at Colorado and Pico. Remember, too, mass-transit 
linkages and the plan's bikeway, which weren't counted, will give greater 
options to those who can now live within walking or riding distance of downtown 
offices, shops and entertainment. And didn't Tom Hayden even suggest relocating 
Santa Monica College here? Since when did we fear trips generated from going to 
parks and housing? Would we stop all parks and housing or cultural projects 
just because they generated car trips? 
</P>
<P>
 No, the real issue behind the opposition (and we don't all have to be former 
anti-war protesters to figure this out) is the RAND Corp. Labeled by opponents 
as a "mega-development," RAND actually has had its potential development volume 
reduced from 3 to 1.5 times the site area (typical or normal throughout the 
city), and voters should be aware that the buildings are not part of this plan 
and their designs are still subject to the expected public scrutiny that is 
appropriate to such a location. 
</P>
<P>
 The community participation workshops have seen RAND's options moved around 
the area in various designs knowing full well they would likely have to go 
along with them. Why? Because they need the city and this Civic Center Working 
Group to make a place for them. They cannot do it alone (such is the opposition 
and importance of the location), and they are willing to go with what comes 
from professional planning plus community input. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be what they would do by themselves, but they know that it is in no 
one's interest for them to fail. That is, except those people who want to 
punish them for sometimes being on the wrong side. I have seen this and I can 
understand the feelings, but I would not be so selfish to put that in front of 
generations of others who don't even remember or just want some green space and 
new housing options, not to mention a needed police facility. 
</P>
<P>
 I teach design and I can say that few good works, if any, spring from such 
negativity or pessimism. The new Civic Center Specific Plan sprang from years 
of lengthy, inclusive dialogue, and the old rhetoric that stands against it is 
just that, old. 
</P>
<P>
 The real progressive thing to do here is to trust the public process and not 
ask for retribution. Vengeance is not a city planning or urban design strategy. 
We are looking for the greater good. Please vote yes on Props. D & E to 
continue the evolution of the city.

 I support Santa Monica City Councilman Robert Holbrook and the Santa Monica 
Historical Society for leading the opposition to Santa Monica's coastal art

FOR SENIORS; RHONDA FLEMING NOW STAR OF REAL-LIFE DRAMA AIDING CANCER PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time there were two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 One was beautiful, like her fashion-model mother. One wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 One had the life of an international movie star, with leading men like Gregory 
Peck, Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. The other was a 
housewife in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 They had one thing in common: the spirit to go on with life, no matter what 
the obstacles. One died in the struggle. The other dedicates the rest of her 
life to the memory of her sister, so that others do not have to go through 
their nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhonda Fleming knew that her sister, Beverly, had a rare form of ovarian 
cancer. She was living with it for over a decade and seemed to be doing well. 
Then there was the phone call and Fleming remembers the voice on the other end. 
It didn't sound confident anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her husband had died six months before," she said. "Her children were 
scattered all over the country. Our mother had just died. There was just the 
two of us. I was always the brat she had to take with her when we were kids. 
And here she was, the older sister, asking me what she should do about having 
surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next is classic Rhonda Fleming. Never mind that she knew nothing 
about cancer, cancer surgery or the facilities and professionals who could 
help. She sat down at the telephone and 12 hours later -- at the urging of her 
husband, Ted Mann -- she finally got up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a thousand pounds on my shoulders," she said. "Who to call? So I 
called everyone. I just dived in." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other things going through her mind, too. It was always Beverly who 
called her and gave her strength. It was Beverly she knelt with and prayed with 
when she lost everything in a bad marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 49, had nothing," she said. "I was part of the studio system, which was 
like a protective family. That was over, too, and now I was unprotected. I was 
wiped out. My sister said to me: 'Where's your backbone?' It turned out that it 
was the best thing that could have happened to me because I finally woke up. . 
. . My sister would have killed for me and now I had to keep her alive," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing in Rhonda Fleming's life to prepare her for taking care of 
her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of her life was a fairy tale. She was discovered by a talent 
scout on her way to Beverly Hills High School. She had a certain presence -- 
maybe it was her height -- that exuded confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, she was about as naive as many other teen-agers in pre-World War II 
America. She had received no acting lessons. And in spite of being scared to 
death, she went on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cast as a nymphomaniac in 'Spellbound,' with Ingrid Bergman," she said. 
"I didn't even know what a nymphomaniac was. My mother and I had to look it up 
in the dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
 When Technicolor was invented, Fleming, with her red hair and sparkling blue 
eyes, was an immediate sensation. She was known as the "Technicolor queen" of 
Paramount Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 motion pictures, a mid-life debut on Broadway in Clare Booth Luce's 
"The Women," and assorted television parts, she is now starring in her own 
production: the newly opened Rhonda Fleming Mann Resource Center for Women With 
Cancer, at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not out to push me anymore," she said. "These centers are in existence 
because, even though we had the best medical care, we had no psychological 
support. No one to turn to for the spiritual (support). No environment that was 
pleasant to be in while she suffered so. There wasn't even a curtain in the 
examining room to hide personal things like your wig, or a prosthesis." 
</P>
<P>
 The plaque at the reception area reads, "Beverly Louis Engle 1918-1990," with 
a quote from her sister: "Make it a place of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what Fleming did. She chose the colors -- mauve and pale green -- 
the paintings, the furniture. Professionals in every area of psychological and 
social care, including death and the dying, are either on staff or on call. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the center, there is also the "Insights Into Cancer" lecture series, 
where leading professionals make presentations to help women and their families 
live with and learn about cancer as well as get timely information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rhonda had a vision and we implement her vision," said Anne Coscarelli, 
director of the center. "She worked out her grief by helping others. She's here 
every week giving and getting hugs. Our center's work is inspired by her words: 
'My prescription for all women with cancer is caring, compassion, communication 
and commitment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The center is located at 200 UCLA Medical Plaza, Suite 502. There is no charge 
for women receiving cancer care from faculty and staff at UCLA. For more 
information, call: (310) 794 6644.

THE ROMANCE OF COVERED BRIDGES; YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO EAST TO FIND THESE ANTIQUE 
TREASURES. OREGON HAS 53 OF THE SHELTERED SPANS, MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN 
THE WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For a while, it seemed everyone was talking about bridges . . . in particular 
the covered bridges Robert Waller described in "The Bridges of Madison County," 
his best-selling novel set in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The book has lured thousands of tourists from all over the world to Madison 
County. But you don't have to go to the Midwest to see covered bridges. Oregon 
has more. More, in fact, than any other state west of the Mississippi. It ranks 
sixth in the nation, behind Pennsylvania, Ohio, Vermont, Indiana and New 
Hampshire, Eastern destinations most people more readily associate with these 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 From my home in Ashland -- home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival that each 
year draws Southern Californians in droves -- there is a lovely day trip to be 
made out into the countryside, through the covered bridges and back into 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who live here, in the southwestern corner of Oregon, sometimes 
feel we're far from the action. Portland is a six-hour drive away, Los Angeles 
12 or so. Most people who leave Interstate 5 -- the north-south freeway that 
bisects our Rogue Valley -- come to Ashland only to attend the Shakespeare 
Festival, which this year began Feb. 18 and runs through Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 But visitors soon discover that our sunny valley is bordered by tiers of 
gently rolling mountains to the east, and that they can drive winding roads 
through those hills to a cluster of pretty lakes, then turn north at the cobalt 
depths of Crater Lake, which caps beautiful Crater Lake National Park. To the 
southwest, the roads wind through Redwood National Park, a virgin redwood 
forest, and lead to the rocky, wind-swept Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most romantics, I spend a good deal of time mentally ambling down lanes 
and byways of the past. I am particularly drawn to covered bridges, whose 
wooden floors once rattled under the weight of horse-drawn wagons and buggies. 
They are colorful pieces of Americana that also constitute a romantic chapter 
in Oregon's past. 
</P>
<P>
 Under their protective roofs, early pioneers held dances and church socials. 
Little children dropped small stones through the cracks into rushing streams 
below. Politicians used their shelter as sites for voter rallies. Lovers ducked 
into welcome shadows for fleeting trysts, earning the structures the nickname 
"kissing bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 But social, political and amorous pursuits aside, Oregon's covered bridges are 
a testament to the spirit of men and women who first forded -- and then tamed 
-- its wild waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is blessed with 27,000 miles of rivers and streams and plentiful 
rain. In Oregon, an uncovered bridge, constantly exposed to wet and sometimes 
freezing weather, would last only five to seven years before starting to rot, 
according to historians who have studied the bridges. Settlers soon learned 
that adding a roof to a bridge increased its life span immensely, perhaps up to 
35 years. Construction of these practical and economical structures 
particularly thrived during the 19th and early 20th centuries, before 
weatherproofed lumber became readily available in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 53 (others count 54, depending on how the term "covered bridge" is 
defined) of these charming relics of a gentler time survive in Oregon today. 
Most of them are clustered in five western counties and are easily accessible 
on, or near, good roads. 
</P>
<P>
 While modern thoroughfares still pass through some of the bridges, many cannot 
handle the weight of heavy trucks and automobiles. Those have been made into 
pedestrian bridges, open only to foot and bicycle traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Oregon's covered bridges were built of the sturdy Douglas fir that 
grows so abundantly here. Some were community projects, financed by benefit 
dances and socials. Others were strictly commercial affairs, belonging to 
entrepreneurs who exacted a toll from travelers. Some bridge builders were 
professional carpenters, other just local residents who needed a way to 
transport logs or farm produce across rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time during the late 1800s, as many as 450 covered bridges spanned the 
creeks and gullies in Oregon. But time, floods and the ever-increasing size and 
weight of automobiles and trucks rendered most of them obsolete. Many of those 
still standing have been preserved by counties, civic clubs or individuals. 
Their sites range from near Portland, in the north, to as far south as Ruch; 
from Yachats, on the coast, to Bend, in the state's center. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest is the Office Bridge, at 180 feet; it spans the north fork of the 
Willamette River at Westfir, near Eugene. The oldest is probably 80-year-old 
Drift Creek Bridge, south of Lincoln City near the coast (although historians 
argue that others may have been built earlier and that records of their 
construction are lost to time). In between, are a rainbow of bridges, 
interesting as much for their histories, as for their styles and settings. 
</P>
<P>
 With a map from the Covered Bridge Society of Oregon in hand, a friend and I 
laid out a daylong driving tour that would take us to the five southernmost 
bridges in an easy circle from Ashland. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of our trip last October dawned bright and sunny. We knew we 
wanted to picnic somewhere along the way, so our first stop was Cantwell's 
Market in Ashland. Once the young woman at the deli counter had filled our 
picnic basket, we were on our way. 
</P>
<P>
 Our journey took us north from Ashland on Interstate 5 to Medford, where we 
turned north on Oregon 62. This road, usually called Crater Lake Highway, 
scrolls through low rolling terrain and several rural communities and small 
towns, and within 40 minutes, leads to Eagle Point, the first stop on our 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 What we found there was a beautiful little bridge, spanning Little Butte Creek 
and linking one side of tree-shaded Royal Avenue with the other in the center 
of a quiet, rural town. 
</P>
<P>
 Still sometimes called Antelope Creek Bridge, this structure is unique for its 
bucolic setting in the middle of Eagle Point. It was constructed in 1922 by 
Wesley and Lyal Hartman to span Antelope Creek, a few miles from the village, 
and to connect it with the rural countryside filled with farms. In the late 
1800s, Eagle Point was a shipping port for the Pacific and Eastern Railroad, 
and it was from there that flour milled at the Butte Creek Mill was shipped to 
nearby towns. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1970s, the bridge had deteriorated so badly that traffic was 
forbidden and its future looked bleak indeed. But the local citizens pitched in 
to repair the 58-foot-long bridge, which in 1987 was moved to its present site 
over Little Butte Creek and dedicated to pedestrian traffic. On the bright 
morning of our arrival, the only person crossing the bridge was a youngster on 
his bike, happily savoring the freedom of childhood in a small town. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny Lost Creek Bridge was second on our tour -- a good choice for us since it 
was only about 15 miles from Eagle Point through a lush, fertile valley. To get 
there we continued east on Royal Avenue, which became Brownsboro Highway and 
soon joined Oregon 140. We followed it east and made a right turn (south) at 
the exit onto South Fork Little Butte Creek Road, toward the town of Lake 
Creek. We drove through Lake Creek four miles to Lost Creek Road and turned 
right. We found the bridge at the road's dead-end. 
</P>
<P>
 At just 39 feet, Lost Creek Bridge is the shortest in the state and another 
pedestrian-only span. The sign on it says it was built in 1881, even though 
county records list its construction date as 1919. What we do know for sure is 
that it served the little logging and farming community, which was also a 
stagecoach stop, by linking it to sawmills across Lost Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the local economy depended on trees -- the nearby forests providing 
early loggers with what at the time seemed an inexhaustible supply of timber -- 
and all of it had to be hauled by wagon to the sawmills. This was made easier 
by construction of the bridge over Lost Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 After several lifetimes of service, a highway was constructed that bypassed 
the bridge and a 1964 flood nearly washed it away. The bridge fell into more 
disrepair and was nearly hidden behind an overgrowth of trees and brush. But 
the people of Lake Creek (not to be mistaken for the bridge by the same name in 
a different part of the state) organized in 1985 after a nearby covered bridge 
was torn down, virtually without warning; they raised money and started a "save 
our bridge" campaign. Working together in the tradition of old-time barn 
raisings, they rebuilt and reinforced the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 As we approached the weathered little bridge, we were delighted to find that 
it stands just steps from Walch Memorial Wayside Park. Bright red roses rambled 
over the park's rustic fence, and a wooden arch welcomed guests to a quiet 
retreat of green lawns and flowering gardens. The little oasis is watered by an 
underground irrigation system, making it a stark contrast to the surrounding 
dry fields. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time the sun was high overhead. My traveling companion, Bob Baures, 
and I were hot and hungry, so we ducked into one of the park's open-sided 
shelters. Bob spread the red-checked cloth on the table while I dug into the 
basket: Buffalo wings, carrot and raisin salad, Cheddar cheese, whole wheat 
rolls, apples and a bottle of Chardonnay. We lingered long over that lovely 
lunch in the quiet garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, refreshed and ready for more bridges, we climbed back into my Toyota 
and headed out for Wimer Bridge in the town of the same name. To get there we 
backtracked to Eagle Point and turned right (north) on Oregon 62, driving about 
four miles north to its intersection with County 234. We turned left and headed 
west for 13 miles through beautiful Sam's Valley, the little hamlet of Gold 
Hill and into the town of Rogue River. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine Street, the main street there, becomes East Evans Creek Road just outside 
the city limits, and we followed it north. The turnoff to Wimer is about eight 
miles from Rogue River, but the sign was practically hidden by roadside brush. 
</P>
<P>
 We had both become distracted watching the passing fields, where cattle and 
horses grazed contentedly, and nearly missed the little sign indicating our 
turn. But eventually we found the road, and the imposing Wimer Bridge and its 
waterway, Evans Creek, came into view. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local history, this area was the site of fierce Indian wars in 
the mid-1800s. A scant 30 years later it was a thriving farming community 
boasting its own post office. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Wimer Bridge was built in 1892; it lasted 35 years and was 
rebuilt in 1927. By the 1960s, the old bridge was again shaking and shimmying 
enough to give cautious folks real pause about crossing. It had to be closed, 
finally, in the 1970s, but local efforts in 1985 restored it to its former 
beauty. It's one of only a few remaining Oregon bridges that actually is a 
working bridge, serving a community. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, you can drive vehicles under eight tons over the sturdy Wimer bridge 
and right into town. 
</P>
<P>
 We had to retrace our steps back to Rogue River and get on busy I-5 to reach 
Grave Creek Bridge, the fourth on our list. After driving on those pleasant, 
rolling, quiet back roads, the interstate was less than pleasant, but there was 
no other quick way to Sunny Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen miles north of Grants Pass, we turned right onto old Oregon 99, a 
short, half-circle remnant of the road that was bypassed when I-5 came roaring 
through. The road still serves people lucky enough to live in pretty Sunny 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing Grave Creek less than a mile from the exit, we soon found the 
105-foot bridge. It was in excellent condition, freshly painted and 
well-maintained for all of its 73 years. Perhaps because of its pristine 
appearance, Grave Creek bridge is among the most frequently photographed of all 
covered bridges in the state. Unlike many covered bridges, which have little 
inside illumination other than the daylight that streams through cracks between 
the boards, A few have small, quite ordinary holes for windows. In contrast, 
Grave Creek Bridge boasts 12 large, well-designed Gothic-style windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge's name has an interesting background too. About 150 years ago, 
during a Native American uprising, a young girl named Martha Leland Crowley 
died and was buried along the local creek. It was unnamed at the time, so 
residents christened it Grave Creek in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, the Oregon state legislature decided the name was, perhaps, a bit 
too morbid, and renamed it Leland Creek. No way, said the locals, who continue 
to call the pretty waterway Grave Creek, and to this day, it's listed as such 
on some maps. 
</P>
<P>
 We saved little McKee Bridge for last so we could stop off in historic 
Jacksonville for dinner on the way home. Jacksonville is a National Historic 
Landmark filled with pretty Victorian homes. To reach the bridge, we returned 
to Interstate 5 and drove to Gold Hill, where we took Old Stage Road into 
Jacksonville and through the Applegate Valley to the town of Ruch. In Ruch, we 
turned left on Upper Applegate Road and continued seven miles further to the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Farthest south of all of Oregon's covered bridges, the McKee stands 45 feet 
above the Applegate River, eight miles north of the California border. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospectors worked this area for many years, and the bridge, built in 1917, 
served as a rest stop for miners traveling between the town of Jacksonville to 
the north and copper mines to the south. As the area attracted residents, 
logging trucks, laden with Douglas fir, used the bridge to haul timber to local 
sawmills. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge proved equal to the task for approximately 40 years before a modern 
concrete-and-steel span replaced it. Then, like many others before it, the old 
McKee Bridge seemed doomed. For generations, though, it had been a focal point 
for the community, and the people there couldn't stand by to see their most 
prized possession disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 A grass-roots plan to re-roof and strengthen the old structure took over the 
town. As the local newspaper described it: "Hundreds of man hours of labor and 
several thousands of dollars worth of materials have been donated in the 
project of saving the McKee covered bridge." Once rebuilt, it reopened for 
pedestrian traffic in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 A lovely little state park stands beside the bridge today. We heard children 
laughing as we walked under its trees and followed the sound to find a whole 
bevy of youngsters playing in a nearby swimming hole. One brave fellow had 
climbed the river's opposite bank and was swinging across on a rope, just as 
Huck Finn might have done on some other river at some other time. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon sun was slanting low through the trees by then, and it was time 
to go home. We were a little tired, but couldn't help feeling closer to the men 
and women who'd pioneered this beautiful state and built these charming old 
bridges.

TRAVEL INSIDER: KEEPING A HEALTHY ATTITUDE ABOUT TROPICAL DESTINATIONS; 
DISEASES: THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK OF GETTING SICK IN EQUATORIAL CLIMES, BUT 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES CAN HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even experienced travelers venturing into tropical realms often do so with 
some apprehension about their health -- and understandably so. After all, lots 
of bacteria, parasites and other little unseen nasties are just waiting to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But travel to the tropics isn't something to be feared "as long as good health 
habits are carefully practiced," says Martin S. Wolfe, a Washington specialist 
in tropical medicine. Wolfe is editor of the most recent edition of "Health 
Hints for the Tropics," a helpful, 51-page guide to staying well abroad, 
published periodically since 1948 by the American Society of Tropical Medicine 
and Hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although many exotic diseases and other health hazards in tropical locales 
are not found in the United States or Europe," says Wolfe, who has lived and 
worked in the tropics and is a tropical medicine consultant to the State 
Department, "most of these illnesses are preventable by maintaining sanitation 
and using common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 On the good news front, the guide reports that a new hepatitis A vaccine, 
which is now licensed in Europe, should be available in the United States 
sometime this year. It provides longer protection than the current recommended 
vaccine -- immune globulin (IG) -- against the hepatitis A virus, which means 
it does not have to be administered as frequently. The virus, considered a 
"significant risk" in developing countries, can be acquired by consuming 
contaminated food, water or shellfish taken from contaminated water -- all of 
which are sometimes hard to avoid in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the bad news: Malaria-causing mosquitoes are becoming increasingly 
resistant to antimalarial drugs in some parts of the world, the guide says, 
"and no present-day antimalarial drug regimen guarantees protection against 
malaria." To avoid malaria, travelers are advised to pay much greater attention 
now to avoiding mosquito bites. This means using an insect repellent containing 
DEET (35% concentration) on exposed skin, wearing clothes that cover most of 
the body and spraying an insecticide on clothing, using a mosquito net at night 
and spraying a flying-insect insecticide in your room. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other recommendations in "Health Hints": 
</P>
<P>
 * Cholera: For most travelers, cholera immunizations are no longer 
recommended. The only vaccine currently available is not considered very 
effective, says the guide, and the injection can cause a fever and headache. 
Instead, if you are going to an area of active cholera outbreaks, such as South 
America, your best protection is to be cautious in what you eat and drink. 
Improved oral vaccines may be available soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diarrhea: An estimated 20%-30% of travelers to the developing world suffer a 
bout of diarrhea. The most common sources are contaminated food, water and 
beverages. Many people get tripped up on what the guide calls "oversights": 
brushing your teeth with contaminated water, ordering a drink with contaminated 
ice, sipping a diluted fruit juice, or eating cold foods that are much more 
likely than hot substances to be contaminated by the hands of infected food 
handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 To spare your stomach, make it a practice to consume only hot cooked food, 
fruits that can be peeled, carbonated beverages (they inhibit the growth of 
bacteria), and coffee, tea, beer and wine. Boiling water for five minutes kills 
all dangerous organisms, including hepatitis viruses. You can carry iodine 
water purification tablets or small, portable water filters with an iodine 
component. 
</P>
<P>
 But be aware, says the guide, that many available water filters "cannot be 
considered reliable for removing all infectious agents." Also, make a point of 
washing your hands frequently -- especially before eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepto-Bismol tablets, taken as a preventative, have been found safe and 
effective in warding off diarrhea for many people. Generally, tropical medical 
authorities don't recommend taking antibiotics as a preventative, unless you 
have other medical problems that could be worsened by diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Typhoid Fever: Since 1989, an oral typhoid vaccine has been available in the 
United States for travelers age 6 and older. A version of it is in development 
for younger children. Previously, prevention of typhoid, a bacterial infection 
caused by contaminated water and food, required a series of injections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sleeping Sickness: In tropical Africa, sleeping sickness is "a potential 
hazard," warns the guide, particularly in the game parks of East Africa. But 
infection has been rare in American travelers. The disease is spread by the 
large tsetse fly, and the best protection is to wear long-sleeved shirts and 
pants to avoid bites. 
</P>

 Two houses -- the American retreat of one of England's most famous authors, 
and the vast estate belonging to one of America's richest families -- have 
opened to the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brattleboro, Vt., Rudyard Kipling's home from 1892 to 1896 has been 
restored by the Landmark Trust and is available for rent by the week, with 
shorter stays possible November through March.The house, designed in the 
then-popular "shingle style," an outgrowth of the Arts and Crafts movement, is 
where Kipling wrote four of his books. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly rates range $1,200-$1,500; short stays (a minimum three nights) cost 
$235 a night. Bookings must be made through the office of the Landmark Trust in 
England (tel. 011-44-628-825925; fax 011-44-628-825417). 
</P>
<P>
 In Pocantico Hills, N.Y., the Rockefeller family estate, known as Kykuit (a 
Dutch word for lookout), opened this month under auspices of the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation. Public tours have already sold out, but a waiting 
list has been formed for 1995. The neo-Georgian mansion and its Italian villa 
gardens stand at the crown of a hill overlooking the Hudson River, commanding a 
stunning 300-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour tour, the only way to see the house, costs $18 for adults, $16 for 
seniors and students. Names are being taken now for 1995; call (914) 631-9491.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SANTA BARBARA; VICTORIAN CHARMER, XLNT LOCATION; TO A RESORT 
TOWN THEY LONGED TO GO, EXCEPT FOR LACK OF A CERTAIN CASH FLOW. FRIENDS' ADVICE 
SAVED THE DAY: THE KEY IS WHERE YOU STAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN GREENE, Greene is a free-lance writer based in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steve and I moved from the East Coast last year and plunked down just 
about everything we owned on our own piece of California real estate, we 
figured we'd never be able to afford to take a vacation again, especially in a 
pricey resort town like Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 We were bemoaning our fate one day to some friends, who offered a partial 
solution -- book a room at the Upham Hotel. It's right in the center of Santa 
Barbara, they said, and with rooms ranging from $105 to $325 (for a one-bedroom 
suite with private yard), it's generally less expensive than such icons as the 
Biltmore or San Ysidro Ranch. And we would love the hotel's bed and breakfast 
ambience, they promised. 
</P>
<P>
 At first I was skeptical. Steve and I aren't really B&B kind of people. We 
like to have a television set and telephone in our room, and we're not too keen 
on sharing our breakfast table with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a lovely Friday afternoon, we loaded up the Jeep, left our two young 
children behind and headed north, arriving in Santa Barbara just in time to 
watch the sun dip below the horizon. We managed to find our way to the Upham, 
which is just two blocks from the main shopping and entertainment strip on 
State Street and the 25-cent shuttle that takes you to the ocean, about a mile 
and a half away. We pulled around the front of the building at the corner of De 
La Vina and Sola streets and knew immediately that we had made the right 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the Upham looks like something out of a Wild West movie set. 
The hotel was built in 1871 and, with its wraparound veranda and white 
Adirondack furniture, it would not have been incongruous to see men in bowler 
hats and women in layered skirts and parasols parading through the front door. 
Once we pulled the car into the hotel's driveway, we found ourselves in another 
world not visible from the street -- of cottages, manicured gardens and 
gazebos. 
</P>
<P>
 It took us awhile to find our way to the main building -- not because the 
property is so large but because the walkways and buildings are a veritable 
maze. As we circled the grounds, we imagined what our room would be like: 
Perhaps it would be in one of the cozy cottages, some of which had private 
patios and gas-burning fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 We finally found the lobby, which resembled an English parlor, and the 
reception desk, which sported an old-fashioned -- now completely decorative -- 
telephone system, the type that required an operator plugging in wires to make 
the connections. It was easy to believe that the Upham is, as it claims, the 
oldest continuously operating hotel in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The older rooms are far from glitzy, but they're clean and comfortable. The 
newer rooms in the Carriage House (behind the main buildings), our friends had 
told us, are more updated and decorated in a sort of Ralph Lauren-horsy style. 
As it turned out, our $120-a-night room was in the main house and seemed a bit 
claustrophobic. Fortunately there were still some choices left. Although a 
small cottage room with a private porch near the parking lot could have been 
had for $100, we opted to spend $135 a night for a larger room in the Lincoln 
House, a two-story, olive-gray building adjacent to the main building. (Since 
our visit, the hotel has raised all its room rates by $5.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our second-choice room was decidedly better: somewhat dark and with a bathroom 
on the small side, but with a huge armoire with a television set, a desk, two 
chairs and a table, a dresser and a queen-size bed. After unpacking, I sent 
Steve back down to the lobby to relax while I showered and dressed. Thrilled 
with his banishment, Steve staked out a place in an easy chair beside the 
fireplace, from which he could survey the comings and goings of the clientele 
and bask in the hotel's Old World charm. In fact, by the time I reclaimed him, 
he had attained a kind of "lord of the manor" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve did try some of the complimentary wine and cheese served in the lobby 
before dinner. Since the wine was your basic standard, he opted for a glass of 
house red from the bar of Louie's Restaurant, right off the lobby but privately 
operated. It was one of the few mistakes of the weekend. He declared that wine, 
at $6 a glass, not much better than the free stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we had heard that the food at Louie's was quite good, we wanted 
another venue for dinner, so we drove up the hill to the vintage 
California-style El Encanto Hotel. The grounds were so lovely that we asked 
about room rates, and were told that cottage suites could be had for $220 to 
$480 a night, cottage rooms for $140 to $220. Perhaps next time, we mused as we 
entered the dining room with its stunning view of the city below. Steve's 
salmon looked more like art than food, and my fettuccine with shrimp was so 
good that I had to protect it from his wandering fork. The restaurant was 
moderately pricey, but for two people in need of ambience it was well worth the 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 We slept late Saturday morning, thanks to shutter-covered windows that kept 
the garden sun out. The Upham was still serving its complimentary continental 
breakfast, so we grabbed some coffee and orange juice from a sideboard in the 
lobby and some pastries from an outside table on the porch, and then retired to 
the courtyard. It was hard to leave the serenity of the garden, but we finally 
decided it was time to get out and explore. Heading north, we drove 25 miles to 
the Santa Ynez Valley "wine triangle" -- seven vineyards open for wine tasting 
-- that begins where California 246 crosses 154. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose the closest one, and after tasting four wines for $2.50 at Gainey 
Vineyards, decided to have lunch five miles away at the Side Street Cafe in Los 
Olivos. We left Los Olivos at about 3:30, aiming to meet the only deadline we 
had set for ourselves: to be on the beach at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 We stopped along Cliff Drive, right near the Brown Pelican restaurant, stuffed 
a bottle of champagne and two glasses in my son's Mickey Mouse backpack and 
tromped along the beach until we found a comfortable piece of driftwood to sit 
on. (Next time we bring beach chairs or a blanket.) For two hours, we watched a 
parade of people and their dogs slowly change to a parade of black silhouettes 
against the spectacular orange and blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the hotel, Steve started calling around to make a dinner reservation, 
but most of the restaurants along the waterfront were booked. On impulse, he 
called the Bay Cafe, a fish market and restaurant tucked away on a back street 
right near the water. It was a wonderful discovery. The service and food were 
excellent, the atmosphere ideal. We asked for and got a table tucked in the 
corner and feasted on the best clam chowder I've had in a while and some great 
fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, I was willing to settle for another quick hotel breakfast, 
but Steve convinced me we needed one last leisurely meal. We reluctantly 
checked out of the hotel and drove to the nearby Cajun Kitchen on De La Vina 
Street. As we read the Sunday newspaper and basked in the warm sunshine on the 
patio, Steve and I for the first time began to actually feel like Californians. 
Budget for Two Gas to Santa Barbara: $23.95 Upham Hotel, two nights: $296.80

HIKING: GREECE: VERDANT CORFU WELCOMES WALKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone accustomed to the harsh landscapes of rock, sea and sky on Greek 
islands such as Mikonos and Santorini will be surprised by Corfu's lush beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Corfu, the greenest of Greece's more than 1,400 islands, has a colorful 
countryside, charming coastal villages and a bustling main city. Located in the 
Ionian Sea off Greece's northwestern coast, adjacent to Albania, Corfu is 
perfect for walking. Mule paths, foot trails and dirt roads that crisscross the 
island provide access for hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain clouds, trapped by nearby mainland mountains, regularly shower the 
island, which is covered with flowering shrubs and trees year-round. 
Buttercups, daffodils, marigolds, daisies, hollyhocks, cyclamens, poppies, 
larkspur and chamomile dot the countryside. In the villages, acacia, geraniums, 
oleander and grapes, as well as groves of orange, lemon and olive trees, grow 
around whitewashed houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The best hike on Corfu is the ascent of Mt. Pantokrator, the island's highest 
peak. Golden eagles soar above the 2,972-foot summit, which is crowned by a 
beautiful monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 Get an early start for the eight-mile round-trip climb, accessible from two 
starting points. The first begins in the capital, Corfu town (known locally as 
Kerkyra, which is also the Greek name for the island). Hikers travel by car or 
bus 18 miles north to a trail that begins in the village of Strinilas; an 
alternative trail, which I recommend, starts in Viglatsouri, just inland from 
the beach resort of Nisaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Both routes are fairly steep, but wonderful sweeping views over the island, 
the mountains of mainland Greece, Albania and the deep blue Ionian Sea make the 
climb well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 For a less strenuous walk, a jaunt around Corfu town is one of the best city 
walks in Greece. In the early morning, souvenir shops open their doors, hanging 
out wool sweaters, postcard racks and amber worry beads. At outdoor cafes in 
the main town square, townspeople sit at tables drinking strong Greek coffee 
and sharing conversation. Cats nap on sun-splashed balconies while women hang 
out laundry on clotheslines strung from one tall, elegant, centuries-old 
building to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, this same town walk becomes a sensory assault. A cacophony 
of mopeds and motor scooters, church bells and taxi horns, belching buses and 
shouting peddlers dominates Corfu town. Perhaps Ambrose Bierce was thinking of 
Corfu town when he wrote that noise is "the chief product and authenticating 
sign of civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 Corfu town is reminiscent of many European cities -- especially Venice. The 
Venetians, who occupied Corfu for more than 400 years starting in 1386, built 
tall walls and houses that resembled those in their homeland. During that time, 
Corfu town was a walled fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 The island's main landmark, the red dome of St. Spyridon's church built in 
1596, holds the mummified remains of its namesake, a former archbishop of 
Cyprus. St. Spyridon lies in a silver casket, his feet encased in richly 
embroidered slippers. Daily, he receives the devotions of the faithful, who 
kiss his sarcophagus and hope to be cured of all manner of illnesses. Four 
times a year, he is paraded through the streets of Corfu town in triumphant 
procession. 
</P>
<P>
 On the west coast, Palaiokstritsa is one of the many beautiful villages facing 
a shoreline of small sand coves carved from sheer cliffs. Perched on a steep 
hill above the village is a Byzantine monastery. The monks often can be seen 
herding their sheep up and down the wooded hills, a ritual performed today 
exactly as it was five centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-perfect village has been overdeveloped (as have many of the island's 
seaside towns), yet it retains its charm despite hordes of British tourists 
swarming the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 From Palaiokstritsa, a footpath climbs past houses and through olive groves to 
the village of Lakones, then up to a small restaurant called Bella Vista. The 
spectacular view makes this a good spot to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk continues along the road out of Lakones, where it turns into a 
footpath that winds through vineyards and climbs a hill to ruins of a Byzantine 
castle, built in the 13th Century. The five-mile walk takes about two to three 
hours. Mt. Pantokrator Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Corfu, in the Ionian Sea off the west coast of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 to 8 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Verdant slopes, secluded pocket beaches.

TAKING THE KIDS: IT'S CHILD'S PLAY AT TWO MUSEUMS

 "Follow us," the kids commanded and led the way as we slid, crawled and 
climbed barefoot through 13 small chambers of a pitch-black dome. We felt our 
way along the narrow passageways, touching who-knows-what: a spoon here, a 
rubber mat there, blocks, a chain or a bicycle seat. Could that squishy thing 
be a silicone breast implant? It was impossible to tell for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we slid out into the light and into a vat of dry beans. Ten-year-old 
Matt and 8-year-old Reggie couldn't wait to start through the Tactile Dome 
again. I needed to catch my breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to San Francisco's Exploratorium, considered by many to be the 
nation's premier science museum and the model for hundreds of interactive and 
innovative museum exhibits around the world. Museum officials routinely make 
pilgrimages here for help in planning new museums: More than 500 teachers 
attend classes each year to learn new approaches to teaching science. All year 
long, visual and performing artists in residence create new works for the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere in the cavernous two-acre space -- there are no walls -- science is 
happening as kids and their parents turn cranks, push buttons, pull knobs and 
work computers. Adults bend over one bank of blinking computers, learning how 
risky behavior increases the chances of getting AIDS. Kids race from area to 
area, designing a giant bubble here, humming into an echo chamber there, finger 
painting on a computer in one spot, touching a real miniature tornado in 
another. It's impossible not to get excited about science here. 
</P>
<P>
 And this summer, the Exploratorium is hosting a festival of sound and music 
with more than 200 performances and 45 interactive exhibits in the new 
permanent Sound Studio. Learn how to build instruments or produce musical 
tracks; try the Whistle Machine or crank a giant music box. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has ever flunked a science museum," Exploratorium founder Frank 
Oppenheimer wrote. Twenty-five years ago, the late Oppenheimer, a physics 
professor (and brother of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb), 
created a place where adults and children alike could experience scientific 
phenomena for themselves. Here they could make their own discoveries about 
light or color, motion, electricity, heat and the weather . . . among other 
things. Thanks to Oppenheimer's vision, we not only have the Exploratorium but 
a rapidly growing number of interactive exhibits at museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't look like a museum," a very pleased Matt announced, taking in 
the noisy, bustling scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the Exploratorium look like a museum from the outside. Located at the 
foot of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is housed in the domed neoclassical Palace 
of Fine Arts, built for San Francisco's 1915 Panama-Pacific International 
Exposition. (General museum admission is $8.50 for adults, $4.50 for children 
6-17 and $2 for 3- to 5-year-olds. Call 415-561-0360.) 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, there are no walls -- just concrete floors and open space filled with 
more than 650 experiment areas. We stepped into Shadow Box, a three-sided room 
with phosphorescent wallpaper that freezes and holds shadows temporarily when a 
strobe light flashes them on the wall. In the Distorted Room, a 
10-foot-by-10-foot area with no right angles causes optical illusions, making 
the people inside appear to shrink and grow. We also stood inside a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus throughout the Exploratorium is on perception as much as on pure 
science: How do we see or hear, smell, feel or basically experience the world 
around us? 
</P>
<P>
 The Tactile Dome is a case in point. (Reservations are a must and the Dome 
commands an extra charge, which includes museum entrance. Until July 1, it 
costs $8; after that the price will be $10. Children under 7 are not admitted 
to the dome and reservations for weekends should be made four to eight weeks in 
advance. For reservations, call 415-561-0362.) In our allotted hour, we made 
our way through the Dome again and again, feeling different things each time: a 
rubber hose, sheepskin, rope, jingle bells and, yes, those were breast 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best part of our week in San Francisco," Matt said. Hours later, 
we were still shaking beans out of our clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploratorium staff explained that the free-wheeling environment may look 
chaotic but is actually carefully planned to provide an optimal hands-on 
learning experience. But be forewarned: The exhibits are geared for 
grade-school kids and some will probably require explanation from an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, most children won't need any help at the Bay Area Discovery Museum 
near Sausalito, just across the Golden Gate Bridge. While preschoolers may 
enjoy the swirl of activity at the Exploratorium, they really get a workout at 
the Discovery Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in seven historic turn-of-the-century buildings at Ft. Baker, the Bay 
Area museum doubled in size in 1993 and is packed with indoor as well as 
outdoor activities. It's guaranteed to amuse the diaper set as well as their 
older brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Small children "fish" from the indoor Discovery Boat or crawl through a faux 
"sea tunnel" in the San Francisco Bay Hall. They build skyscrapers from plastic 
bricks, play instruments in the Tot Spot music room or climb around an old 
Model T automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the grade school crowd likes to get lost in the Maze of Illusions, 
make videos in the Media Center, take nature hikes and design bridges. We made 
elaborate puppets that we got to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out the summer exhibit of kid-made cars contributed by Bay Area 
children. And be sure to ask about special workshops. (Admission is $5 for 
adults and children. Call 415-487-4398.) 
</P>
<P>
 The pace at the Discovery Museum may be less frenetic than at the 
Exploratorium but the intent is the same: Let the kids experience and explore 
for themselves. They'll learn as they go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad school isn't this much fun," Matt said, with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Reggie is planning a letter campaign to try to convince local 
museums to build a tactile dome near home.

 Travelers who want to use Britain as a gateway to Europe won't find train 
travel through the new Channel Tunnel affordable until the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first service, which started May 19, is "Le Shuttle" for passengers and 
their vehicles. Limited "Eurostar" foot-passenger rail service is expected to 
start in June and build in the fall with two or three trains crossing each week 
from London's new Waterloo Station. Although fares have not been announced, the 
early crossings will be a novelty and are not expected to be priced 
competitively with the ferry service.. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitive rates should start in 1995 with scheduled hourly service to both 
Paris and Brussels. The Brussels journey will take 3 1/2 hours; the Paris run 
will be three hours and finish at Gare du Nord station, where a youth 
accommodation reservation service is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger service is operated by Eurostar, a consortium of British, Belgian 
and French rail services. 
</P>
<P>
 BritRail expects that Channel Tunnel service will incorporate BritFrance rail 
passes in 1995. They can be purchased from travel agents in North America. 
Discounts are available to travelers under 26.

DESTINATION: CARIBBEAN; A LITTLE PLAY, A LITTLE WORK; PHONE CALLS AND FAXES 
FOLLOWED 4 WOMEN TO ST. JOHN, BUT THEY STILL MANAGED TO RELAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With absolutely no case studies to back me up, I'd like to offer a brazen 
suggestion for the weary working women who wanted it all, went out and got it 
all and now have to live with it: Start packing. I have just returned from the 
future, and there's a vacation in it for you. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to make sure that a fax and answering machine are part of your 
accommodations. And you probably won't be comfortable on the beach without a 
cellular phone in your bag. But if what I just experienced on a Caribbean jaunt 
with three of my high-tech girlfriends is any indication, this could be the 
wave of travel to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Here were four women, three of us mothers, who left behind a complicated 
accumulation of husbands present and past, children in diapers, children in 
adolescence and children in line for diplomas. Not to mention deals and 
deadlines and debts. Yet from a villa on a hill overlooking the water on the 
island of St. John, we wielded the kids, the men, the jobs and the snorkeling 
equipment without missing a beat, laughing for a week like a gaggle of 
12-year-olds watching "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
 Let it be known from the top that we are all control freaks, something some of 
us are trying like crazy to work out in therapy. But no doubt it was this 
collective characteristic that helped pull off our getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I lined up my friends Esther and Joanne in New York. Then Joanne 
clinched our friend Katie, who lives in Chicago. Esther booked the cheap 
airline tickets and a villa with a fax, answering machine and porta phone. (We 
agreed to leave the cellular phones at home, later considered to be a lapse in 
judgment.) I got trip insurance policies. Esther agreed to bring the zoom-lens 
camera, Joanne the SPF lotion Nos. 15, 20, 25, 30, 40. Katie packed the bottom 
half of her bikini. 
</P>
<P>
 A warning: The planning stage does not run smoothly. Fathers of children and 
business associates may balk, credit card limits may be exceeded and uninvited 
friends may feel hurt. We ran into complications like that. But once at the 
airport, we aimed to leave the stress behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for four hyper women, it's hard not to relax on St. John. This 
mountainous island of 20 square miles, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, is 
about two-thirds national parkland, with delicate stretches of white-sand 
beaches, vistas of the nearby island of Tortola, starry skies and spicy food. 
The temperature in February hangs in the high 80s; the sea feels as comforting 
as a bath. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived in Cruz Bay, the main little town with most of the hotel and 
restaurant action, on a ferry from St. Thomas, where our plane had landed. We 
were met at the dock by David Crowell, a dapper developer who is planting 
houses on the barren east end of the island. He had rented us his first 
completed villa, a pink two-bedroom, two-story house with wraparound porches 
and a matching detached guest cottage with a couple more bedrooms and baths. 
</P>
<P>
 What we hadn't realized in advance was that it was a 45-minute ride from house 
to town over steep and twisty mountain roads cluttered with goats. Or that we'd 
be driving on the left side of the road in an open-air Jeep (part of the villa 
rental) with the steering wheel on the left. (Even though this is a U.S. Virgin 
Island, it was settled by the British.) 
</P>
<P>
 Each night, after having dinner at some of the island's best restaurants, we 
would enter the villa and all stand around the answering machine. Then we'd 
negotiate who would get the porta phone first, depending on the bedtime of the 
kids at home or the urgency of the late-breaking problem at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 We also had a routine in the mornings. President of a furniture company based 
in Italy, Katie would get the phone around 8 and call overseas from a hammock 
on the upstairs porch. Joanne, a broker who rents commercial space in 
Manhattan, was working on a complicated deal and liked to call her client in 
his car around 8:30. And Esther, a real estate broker in the Hamptons, would 
meet with local agents around 9 to discuss land sales on St. John. By 10, the 
faxes would start flying. Around 11, things would calm down for an hour or so 
while we had coffee on the porch and sat hypnotized as the day unfolded in 
Hansen Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Heather, who (surprise to us) came with the house as a kind of 
concierge/guide, would arrive with croissants and fresh fruit. While we four 
talkaholics blabbed about money, men and leg waxing, Heather made the beds, 
washed the dishes and did the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she'd load us into the Jeep and head for a beach. One day, she took us to 
Lameshur Bay, down a steep dirt road on the south shore where we snorkeled out 
to the reef and lazed under the sea grape trees. (Beach time was sacrosanct; no 
business talk allowed, although we cheated a lot.) That day, we had lunch 
outside at Miss Lucy's in Coral Bay, a West Indian restaurant with curries and 
conchs on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, we visited Salt Pond Bay, a short hike down a rocky trail on the 
south shore, but we were put off from returning there because a park ranger 
approached us on the beach and warned us that island teen-agers often jump out 
of the bush and rob tourists' belongings when they go swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather introduced us to the beach of our choice on the north shore, the 
little-known and unmarked Gibney Beach, between the famous Caneel Bay resort 
and Cinnamon Bay beach. While both Cinnamon Bay and its neighbor, Trunk Bay, 
are the most scenic and have semi-famous snorkeling, they are usually packed 
with day-trippers off cruise ships and should be avoided by anyone looking for 
a patch of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 After we sunned body parts never bared to light before, the late afternoon 
energy kicked in. It became our mission to find a phone booth. And when we did 
-- once at a firehouse in Coral Bay, once at a T-shirt shop, another two times 
in a hotel lobby -- we lined up for the voice mail segment of our vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 One, two, three, four, we all called in to our answer phones and took care of 
business. Then we were free to watch the sun set. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the epitome of this working-mom's vacation came on the Sunday that we 
chartered a boat out of Coral Bay, the Breath, to sail around the nearby 
British Virgin Islands. Before we left the house at 8 a.m., the phone rang for 
Esther. The news was that her little son had been up vomiting during the night. 
Her guilt was palpable. Feeling far away and helpless, we nevertheless decided 
to go forth with our plans, knowing the child was in good hands with his 
father. What else could we do? 
</P>
<P>
 Once on board, seven-foot seas left everyone feeling queasy and looking green 
(sympathy nausea?), and we eagerly jumped ship and waded ashore when we reached 
Peter Island, a bitty patch of land inhabited only by guests of a very 
expensive (and very overrated) resort. We sat down for lunch at its beach 
restaurant, but Esther was clearly agitated. With bare feet, she walked across 
acres of burning hot sand and pleaded with a sullen phone operator at the 
hoity-toity hotel to put out a call to the States. She came back smiling; her 
3-year-old was running around the house as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before our projected nine-day vacation was over, Joanne and Katie 
bailed out. They had relaxed about as much as they could. They were tan. They 
had finished their shopping. And they were crazed about being away from their 
offices for so long. So our sisterhood was reduced by half, and Esther and I 
spent the last 48 hours with the unwind button pushed in -- filing no faxes, 
calling no kids, answering no voice mail -- you know, having an old-fashioned 
kind of vacation. 
</P>

 Robins is Newsday's Travel editor. GUIDEBOOK: A Villa in the Virgins 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: There is no airport on St. John. Visitors must fly to St. 
Thomas, then take a taxi to one of two ferries: in Red Hook (about a half hour 
from the airport and $3 one way to St. John) or in Charlotte Amalie (about 10 
minutes from the airport and $7 one way to St. John). Warning: The ferry ride 
can be choppy. 
</P>
<P>
 Renting a villa: Several agencies book fully equipped villas and condos on St. 
John, most with water views and many with pools. Prices run $1,000-$6,000 a 
week, depending on size and season. 
</P>
<P>
 Our villa rental was handled by Bryan Burns at Privateer Bay Estate, 136 
Bayview Ave., Salem, Mass. 01970; telephone (800) 229-USVI (229-8784). Besides 
villas on the east end of the island that come with Jeeps, Burns handles dozens 
of other properties around St. John and provides concierge services at all of 
them.

DESTINATION: ASIA; VIETNAM, CHINA CRUISING BOOMS

 In Vietnamese ports, strings of exploding red and cerise paper-covered 
firecrackers greet cruise ship arrivals, creating a din and leaving bright 
scraps like fallen bougainvillea petals on the pavement. The firecrackers are 
made from scrap paper that is dyed, then hand-wrapped around gunpowder salvaged 
from bombs and shells left over from the Vietnam War. The ceremony, which 
appears to be appreciated by Vietnamese on-lookers, is a traditional greeting 
to chase away bad spirits that could hamper the passengers' journey. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be a big run on firecrackers this fall and winter -- if the 
booming Vietnamese cruise market is any indication. Thirteen ships marketed in 
North America are setting sail for Vietnam between now and next April -- a 
major increase since travel restrictions on Americans visiting Vietnam were 
relaxed at the end of 1991, and remaining economic sanctions lifted in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for anyone eager to see the country before old-fashioned cam pho (roadside 
noodle shops) are supplanted by McDonald's, now is the time to go. The fact is, 
traveling by cruise ship through the Far East can be far more comfortable and 
convenient than overland. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cruises calling in Vietnam set out from Hong Kong or Singapore, and range 
from Club Med's seven-day series to 14 days on Cunard's Crown Monarch. Cruises 
may call at one or more of four major ports -- Haiphong, the port city for 
Hanoi; Da Nang, the port for the ancient capital of Hue; sultry Nha Trang, with 
its gently moldering French buildings, and, near the Mekong Delta, Ho Chi Minh 
City (the former Saigon), where shiny new Hondas vie with pedal bikes and 
citizens wear sunglasses instead of Hanoi's conical straw coolie hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Among upcoming Vietnam sailings: Pearl Cruises' peripatetic Pearl, which sails 
year-round in the Far East, visits several Vietnamese ports this summer and 
fall, and Special Expeditions' Caledonian Star will sail from Ho Chi Minh City 
to four other Vietnamese ports, then on to China on its June 13 cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunard Line is really high on Vietnam, with its flagship Queen Elizabeth 2 and 
Sagafjord both calling there on around-the-world cruises this winter; its Sea 
Goddess II visiting in February and March, and the Cunard Crown Monarch 
offering two "Asian Highlights" cruises in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Viking Sun returns for a second visit to overnight in Ho Chi Minh 
City and make a maiden call at Da Nang during its 1995 world cruise, and 
Princess Cruises' Golden Princess calls at Ho Chi Minh City during its 105-day 
Grand Circle Pacific cruise leaving Vancouver September 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Seas' Song of Flower is set for Vietnam cruises in November and again 
next March, while Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey calls in Da Nang on January 
2 and March 15 sailings. Seabourn Cruise Line's Seabourn Spirit sails to Da 
Nang and Ho Chi Minh City in February, March and April, and the new Marco Polo 
from Orient Lines calls during its June 18 and September 22 sailings. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling by cruise ship can also be the best way to visit Myanmar. The former 
Burma is back on the cruise schedule for the coming season after several years 
of political strife that reduced tourist visits severely. Three ships scheduled 
for Myanmar calls are Seven Seas' Song of Flower, Pearl Cruises' Pearl and the 
Royal Viking Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years in the doldrums, China too has bounced back into the cruise 
mainstream with a flurry of super-luxury sailings coming up, including the 
entry of Seabourn Cruise Line into China next March. Those once-spartan 
overland expeditions with primitive, hole-in-the-floor toilets and grimy 
restaurants have given way to more cosseted outings as the country's tourism 
infrastructure adds marble-lobbied hotels in the cities and more sanitary 
wayside stops in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seabourn Spirit is offering an optional overland visit to see the terra 
cotta warriors of Xi'an in conjunction with two March sailings from Hong Kong. 
Cunard's lavish Sea Goddess II also sets out from Hong Kong March 9 for a 
cruise along the Yangtse with calls at several ports, including Fuzhou, a tea 
port city that was once the center for Christianity in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Song of Flower from San Francisco-based Seven Seas is offering a March 10 
"China Discovery" sailing that calls at the Special Economic Zone of Shantou on 
the mainland as well as Taiwan's capital of Taipei, and the Oceanic Grace 
strays from its usual Japanese ports of call to visit China in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Orient Lines' Marco Polo is beginning its first season in China with 16-day 
land/cruise packages from Beijing's port of Dalian to Hong Kong June 18 and 
Sept. 22. Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey will also embark on a series of new 
China itineraries in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Several new lines will be offering Yangtse cruises, including four new 
154-passenger cruisers named Victoria I-IV from New York-based Victoria 
Cruises, three new German-built river cruisers from Regal China Cruises and 
Abercrombie & Kent, and the new China Glory from AHI International. All are 
brand-new Western-built ships that promise a higher level of luxury than 
previous Yangtse vessels. The Victoria sailings begin June 6, while the AHI 
itineraries are set for September and October. The A & K cruises are already in 
place.

MORE ON BODENSEE

<P>
 The article, "Reflections on the Bodensee" (May 15), was outstanding! My wife 
and I traveled on the car ferry from Konstanz to Lindau, Germany, in 1973 and 
we stayed only two blocks from the church that was in the picture of Lindau. 
"Jewel of the Rhine" is very appropriate.

THE U.N. MUST ABANDON ITS NEW MILITARY ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
denounced the international community for not sending troops to end the 
fighting in Rwanda, where an estimated 200,000 people have died. He was right 
to condemn world leaders for their inaction, but wrong to believe that a U.N. 
peacekeeping force is -- or was -- the answer. Quite the contrary. The efforts 
of Boutros-Ghali and others to expand the military role of the United Nations 
are partly to blame for the failure of the international community to develop 
effective ways to prevent such violent conflicts as is in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The root cause of the problem is the belief that the end of the Cold War opens 
the door for the United Nations to take on ever more responsibility for 
international peace and security. This ambition is an article of faith among a 
small but outspoken group of internationalists who regard the U.N. Charter as a 
sacred text that was regularly defiled by superpower antics during the Cold 
War. It was also fostered by world leaders, especially by former President 
George Bush, who see the world body as a convenient way to conceal unilateral 
desires beneath a cloak of international legitimacy (as happened in the case of 
the Gulf War) and to shift responsibility for troublesome conflicts in 
non-strategic places to others (as happened in the case of Angola). Finally, 
the new role was embraced by many relief and human-rights organizations that 
saw it as a means to transform the body into a vehicle for humanitarian 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the results of U.N. military adventures have been disastrous. 
The Bush Administration's cynical manipulation of the Security Council during 
the Gulf conflict has greatly increased distrust of the United Nations in many 
Third World countries. The misguided humanitarian intervention in Somalia has 
created a general reluctance to get involved in other conflicts. The U.N.'s 
role in military decisions regarding Bosnia has complicated and endangered the 
organization's humanitarian operations there and weakened the credibility of 
NATO threats to deter Serbian aggression. Now, disagreements over U.N. 
military-deployment plans and a lack of troop commitments have become an excuse 
for inaction in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts contend these problems can be solved by a series of reforms, 
among them, adding new permanent members to the Security Council; strengthening 
the U.N. Secretariat's ability to plan and supervise military operations; 
creating a standing U.N. military force, and establishing criteria for 
humanitarian intervention under Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter, which 
authorizes military action in response to threats to international peace and 
security. This is wishful thinking. Few of these reforms are likely to be 
approved by the U.N. membership. Even if they were, it is doubtful that they 
would produce the outcome their proponents covet. 
</P>
<P>
 The effective use of force requires a degree of consensus and resolve that the 
Security Council can only muster in extreme circumstances. The Gulf War and 
intervention in Somalia were the exceptions that proved the rule. In both 
instances, without American leadership, the United Nations would not have acted 
-- or been able to act -- in the ways it did. None of the reforms now being 
recommended would change this reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if a significant U.N. military capability could be created, it would 
be a mistake to move down this path. If an attempt were made to use such a 
force to stop the fighting in Rwanda, or Angola, or any of the other civil wars 
now raging, it would risk involving the United Nations in protracted guerrilla 
wars. To believe otherwise would require a naive faith that the parties to 
these conflicts would be prepared to give up their objectives and bow to U.N. 
demands without a fight. At the same time, it would be equally naive to believe 
that a U.N. force would have any more success in ending civil wars than the 
United States had in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, military intervention would make it impossible for U.N. 
officials to maintain the impartiality that is usually essential to the success 
of diplomatic mediation efforts and humanitarian-relief operations. These are 
the areas where the United Nations has achieved most of its greatest successes. 
As we have seen in Bosnia, however, once the Security Council approves military 
actions, U.N. mediators and relief workers lose the shield of neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done? The Clinton Administration has taken a series of steps in 
the right direction. A presidential directive earlier this month establishes 
criteria that will greatly restrict the kinds of peacekeeping operations 
Washington will support. One result is that the Administration has been 
reluctant to back deployment of soldiers in Rwanda. But it has not gone far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long run, the only kind of policy that is likely to succeed is one 
that combines a blanket prohibition against U.N. military intervention in 
combat situations with serious efforts to bolster the non-military operations 
of the United Nations to head off violent conflict and alleviate human 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be necessary for the United States and other countries to intervene for 
humanitarian reasons in conflicts such as Rwanda. And, over time, it may be 
possible for regional organizations to develop the military capabilities and 
decision-making structures needed for intervention. But these interventions are 
likely to be far more timely and successful if the United Nations is not 
involved. For example, the only opportunity to stop the violence in Rwanda 
through armed action was probably in the first hours after Rwandan government 
forces began to slaughter their opponents in Kigali. If the United States, 
France and Belgium had been willing to send troops in then, they probably could 
have prevented the killing from reaching such horrific proportions. Waiting for 
Security Council authorization would scuttle any such undertaking. As it is, 
the idea that such interventions are a U.N. responsibility provides a 
convenient rationale for Washington and other powers to stay on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than decry the international community's failure to support his calls 
for military action in Rwanda, Boutros-Ghali should direct his attention to 
developing ways to prevent future Rwandas. One would be to push for the 
creation of an international criminal court that would be responsible for 
investigating crimes against humanity and gross human-rights violations. If 
such a court were created and its decisions accepted and enforced by the 
world's governments, it would provide a significant deterrent against the kinds 
of atrocities occurring in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Boutros-Ghali should take the lead in calling on the United 
Nations and all other international organizations to bar any government that 
comes to power through violence or commits gross human-rights abuses from 
receiving international assistance. Finally, he should devote greater effort to 
getting the international community to focus on the deteriorating situation in 
countries like Kenya and Zaire, which are already sliding down the same 
slippery slope that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths in Rwanda and 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures will not produce quick results, nor will they end the fighting 
in Rwanda. But they would help to create the kind of political environment that 
will discourage future slaughters and make military intervention unnecessary. 
By contrast, another quixotic U.N. military operation would only set the stage 
for more disasters.*

WHY ROSTENKOWSKI'S FALL IS PRODUCING NO CHEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political Washington is spending this Memorial Day weekend with one eye on the 
barbecue and the other on the fate of Chicago's Rep. Dan Rostenkowski. The U.S. 
attorney for the District of Columbia has given the Ways and Means Committee 
chairman until Tuesday to accept a career-ending plea bargain or face an 
indictment for alleged thefts from the federal government. No one likes 
watching Rostenkowski's humiliation. Everyone expresses sympathy. Yet, we have 
lost the ability to explain to ourselves why his necessary fate produces such a 
grim atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night, at a snazzy black-tie dinner, a former representative 
explained how the wily Rostenkowski could have gotten himself into such trouble 
over comparatively prosaic charges -- of stealing from the stamp fund, 
appropriating automobiles, filching furniture, padding the payroll. Time was, 
said the ex-congressman, when the stamp fund was considered part of a 
legislator's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Reform came along. Some old-timers had contempt for the reformers and 
their political style. "(Expletive deleted) 'em," the veterans would say, and 
kept right on doing what they'd always done. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about those charges of Rostenkowski's paying people who did no work? 
That, said the maven, was Chicago -- one of the last places where loyalty was 
the cardinal political virtue. If you had power, you gave your people jobs. If 
for some unfortunate reason they could not perform the requisite duties, you 
gave them jobs, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, sigh Washington onlookers, Rostenkowski got caught in a "time warp." 
That verdict is true, as far as it goes. It recognizes that the standards he 
allegedly violated were not timeless and that the rule-breaking was not 
necessarily a sign of an antisocial character. But this "time warp" business 
gives no sense of the type of change politics has undergone in the 35 years 
since the chairman arrived in Congress, or of the difficulty in deciding 
whether it was a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 To politicians of Rostenkowski's style, politics is a personal exercise: You 
cannot govern just by appealing to principle or economic or ethnic interest. 
You need people who support you even when they don't care about the principle 
involved and there is nothing in it for them. 
</P>
<P>
 To build this kind of loyalty, you must involve yourself in your allies' 
lives. You become their buddy, get them jobs, show concern for their families. 
You appear in public with them, so that their friendship with you is clear to 
others. Your personal life becomes an adjunct to your political role. Your 
public and private selves become indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do the job well, you will find that when the crunch comes -- when an 
unpalatable compromise has to be made or a bitter legislative pill swallowed -- 
you can do what is necessary without committing political suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of American politics for the past 30 years has been one of revulsion 
against this political style. After all, political bosses exercised arbitrary 
power. They gave out jobs not on merit but as a gift to someone's incorrigibly 
out-of-work nephew. They cheerfully and routinely sold out principle. They were 
not much on maximum political participation. They did not object to the idea of 
making a little money off the practice of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 This country has done a fairly consistent job of suppressing the old-style 
politics. We have reformed campaign-finance laws to limit the size of 
contributions and increase the amount of public reporting. We have changed 
political-party nominations to end the rule of the smoke-filled room. We have 
made government's internal operations more public and required officials to 
provide more information about their finances. We have established new 
organizations, from the independent counsel's office to the Public Integrity 
Section of the Justice Department, to prosecute political-corruption cases more 
vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the federal government is, in the traditional sense, cleaner that 
it used to be. For all today's news about corruption, the clear evidence is 
that there is far less of it than there was 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are obvious costs to such efforts: Our new system has unquestionably 
made it harder for the country to attain political consensus and govern itself 
expeditiously. But has our politics at least become more moral in some 
fundamental sense? Almost surely not. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the memorable features of the Keating Five hearings of 1990 was that 
Charles H Keating Jr. did not try to corrupt senators mainly through 
traditional devices like campaign donations or clearly illegal payments. 
Instead, he dealt in more innovative incentives -- support for a 
voter-registration drive, for instance, or help with community economic 
development -- that did not go directly into a senator's coffers but that a 
shrewd politician would know full well how to turn to political benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 So there are new quids for new quos, but the principle remains unchanged: 
Gaming the system is as ineradicable a human drive as the desire for food or 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally inescapable is the law of unintended consequences. Do we think we 
purified our politics by limiting the size of campaign contributions? What we 
really got is congressmen who spend more time to raise the same amount of 
money, and who thus give more, rather than less, attention to fund raising than 
legislating. Do we think we got better government by tightening 
conflict-of-interest laws? We don't know. What we do know is that the new rules 
give us fewer officials with ties to regulated industries and more who get 
their satisfaction from exerting official power over regulatees. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone like Rostenkowski is caught violating the rules, he or she must 
be punished. Anything else is unthinkable in a democracy committed to the rule 
of law. Still, he was not among those whose orgy of self-righteousness 
transformed American politics after Watergate; his downfall does not afford the 
pleasure we get in seeing a man hoist by his own petard. Instead, this affair 
reminds us how very much of our political energy is now devoted to the catching 
and the punishing, and how uncertain the general benefits are. Perhaps that is 
why this victory for justice feels so hollow.*

THE OUTSIDER CONNECTION; WITH THE CORPORATE PRESENCE IN LOS ANGELES FADING, 
RIORDAN MUST REACH OUT TO A NEW TYPE OF BUSINESSPERSON FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL KOTKIN, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and author of Tribes: How Race, Religion 
and Identity Determine Success in the New Global Economy (Random House). He is 
also business-trends analyst for Fox News. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although a pro-business mayor, Richard Riordan's biggest problem, ironically 
enough, is drumming up support for his policies among his natural allies in the 
corporate-busi ness community. But with the char acter of the urban economy, 
particularly in Los Angeles, undergoing dramatic change, the mayor may have to 
look more and more to "outsider" entrepreneurs to fill the corporate vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, a moderate conservative like Riordan could reliably expect the 
support of a well-organized core of influential corporate leaders. Today, such 
a mayor is more likely to be greeted by their threats to desert the region that 
nurtured their companies unless this or that tax break is granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Given new communications technologies, relentless shareholder pressure and 
mobile labor markets, many large corporations no longer believe they require an 
urban presence. Many are retreating to smaller cities and rural locales, where 
they enjoy special tax breaks, slavish local governments, weak union movements 
and feeble environmental controls. 
</P>
<P>
 This corporate flight is reflected in the investment patterns of large 
companies. Today, the regions with the largest per-capita concentrations of 
big-company workers encircle such smaller cities as Nashville, Columbus and 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 For those left behind, the results have often been nothing short of 
disastrous. Since 1960, as big companies have moved to ever more remote 
locales, the urban core's share of U.S. poverty has grown from 27% to 43%. The 
decline is particularly marked in Detroit, Atlanta and St. Louis, where massive 
out-migrations of both middle-class residents and leading businesses has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The same forces have loosened the economic moorings of greater Los Angeles. 
Many of the top corporate powers most active in transforming the region into a 
global economic center -- Security Pacific, Pacific Mutual, Carter Hawley Hale, 
for example -- have either moved or been absorbed by outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
 One result is that the community commitment of the remaining corporate elite, 
with the notable exception of ARCO and the utility companies, which cannot 
move, is increasingly half-hearted and poorly focused. This has deprived 
Riordan of a critical source of support when taking on anti-business opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, the corporate elite in this town was made up of 20 guys -- and now 
a lot of them are gone," laments one Riordan aide. "Now people tend to look 
inward and hope someone else will look into the regional problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate neglect has been exacerbated by the peculiar nature of Southern 
California's economic makeup. Key industrial groups in most other regions, 
notes Tom Monahan of the Committee for Economic Development, a New York-based 
business think tank, tend to identify with regional concerns. As examples, he 
points to community activism among Silicon Valley's electronics community, the 
medical-research industry around Minneapolis and New York's financial-service 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Southern California, Monahan notes, two of the key industries -- 
aerospace and entertainment -- have tended to downplay their links to regional 
interests in favor of national or international connections. "In L.A. . . . 
it's a bit of a silo mentality. You have an entertainment silo, an aerospace 
silo, that doesn't connect to the rest of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 These emerging realities may compel Riordan to rethink his strategy for 
bolstering business support for his agenda. Instead of relying on large units 
-- the strategy that backfired on his friend Peter V. Ueberroth at RLA -- he 
will need to develop support among smaller, more grass-roots-oriented 
entrepreneurs who increasingly dominate the region's employer base. According 
to a recent study by Cognetics Inc., Los Angeles and San Diego have a higher 
percentage of jobs in companies with under 100 employees than any of the 
largest U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, these companies could constitute the backbone not only of the 
city's economic but of Riordan's political base. They and their employees, for 
example, might pressure City Council members, traditionally more responsive to 
the concerns of anti-business community groups, to back tax and regulatory 
reforms more conducive to job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 This possibility has not been lost on the mayor or his top aides. Already, 
Riordan has taken big steps in this direction by appointing business 
executives, such as Frank M. Sanchez, Dennis A. Tito, Donna F. Tuttle and 
Steven L. Soboroff, to oversee commissions called to streamline the city's 
bureaucracy. This could help staunch the flow of smaller, growing companies out 
of state, as well as the far larger exodus to outlying, more business-friendly 
cities such as Burbank, Glendale and Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, Riordan is reaching out to smaller-company owners who tend 
to be apolitical or too preoccupied with business to serve on commissions. "We 
have to figure out how to motivate neighborhood entrepreneurs," says one 
Riordan political adviser. "(Riordan's) very effective and cheerful in your 
face and small business people respond to 'in your face.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's first attempt at this new coalition-building involved the garment 
and textile industries, now the region's biggest manufacturing employers. He 
has repeatedly met with industry leaders and begun to take steps to deal with 
their primary concerns, particularly stepping up security in the crime-ridden 
area around the California Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 But to be truly effective, Riordan will have to expand his efforts to include 
such industries as medical equipment, high-fashion furniture and business 
services. Since these industries comprise scores of smaller, unconnected 
companies, the mayor may have to spend time with individuals who have never 
been the "usual suspects" for the attentions of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Riordan must continue wooing the entertainment-related 
sector of the economy, now arguably the city's most critical source of new 
wealth-creation. But the mayor must be attentive not only to the large studios, 
but also to the broader spectrum of more than 7,000 entertainment-related 
specialty firms. These companies account for more than two-thirds of all 
industry employment and constitute the critical element that distinguishes Los 
Angeles from all production centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Riordan, reaching out to these smaller companies represents a tremendous 
sociological as well as economic challenge. In contrast to the relatively 
tight-knit and homogeneous world of corporate Los Angeles, the new economic 
players in town frequently hail from a bewildering array of classic "outsider" 
groups -- women, gays, immigrants, ethnic minorities, creative artists -- who, 
as individuals, traditionally have little impact on city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, an emphasis on bringing "outsider" entrepreneurs into the 
political community would be similar to that of the cities of classical 
antiquity and the Renaissance. Then, as today, the vast majority of the 
population lived outside the urban centers. Most economic activity took place 
beyond the cities as well. Alexandria, Venice, Baghdad and Amsterdam thrived by 
providing a cosmopolitan atmosphere attractive to talented urban minorities, 
such as Jews, Arabs, Huguenots. As the historian Fernand Braudel notes, " . . . 
the miracle of toleration was to be found wherever the community of commerce 
convened." 
</P>
<P>
 By successfully reading the political implications of the city's new economic 
paradigm of smaller, more diverse companies, Riordan could yet make Los Angeles 
a modern Alexandria.*

THE NATION; BOMBED AND STRAFED BY A RELIC OF THE COLD WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf is the author of Crooked Timber, an environmental history 
of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, to be published next year by the University 
Press of Colorado. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where I grew up in Colorado, "Jet Noise: The Sound of Freedom" was the top 
bumper sticker -- without the question mark. My father was a federal employee, 
and we lived between an Air Force base and the Denver airport. Even today, a 
large proportion of Coloradoans work for the Defense Department and its 
contractors. Colorado historians tell us we've always had this love-hate 
relationship with Uncle Sam. Lately, it's all hate. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in southern Colorado, the Wilderness of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains 
forms our fortress walls. The mountains are the most ecologically diverse of 
any in the great Rocky Mountain chain. Motorized vehicles are forbidden in the 
wilderness, but its airspace is vulnerable to any intruder. We have always 
lived with some jet noise, but lately the sound of freedom has turned 
deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air National Guard, along with its Air Force allies, began to besiege the 
region's six counties with its Colorado Airspace Initiative, which would 
increase annual "sorties" -- screaming, ear-rending, tree-top-level dogfights 
-- by thousands, with no upper limit. The area would become a permanent 
Military Operations Area. 
</P>
<P>
 We made the mistake of demanding an Environmental Impact Statement, hoping 
that we could state a scientific case against the Guard's initiative. In 
return, we got an endless series of public meetings, "scoping sessions," lies, 
inaccuracies, contradictions and evasions -- all paid for with our tax dollars. 
Whatever its grasp of military tactics, the Guard understands war by attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Federal Aviation Administration, which rules on all military 
airspace, rejects the initiative, the Guard will bomb and boom us to kingdom 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't hear, see or smell the enemy until too late, until he has blasted 
you from a clear sky, dipped his wings in a mocking salute and screamed on to 
torture your neighbors with his sonic booms and his radar-confusing flares and 
aluminum-silicate chaff. Treetop-level sub-to-supersonic flights have 
reverberated through the valleys around the Sangres for at least 20 years. 
During the Cold War, we put up with the bombs and booms. We took it for granted 
that behind them lurked some deep, dark reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Cold War ended. Then the effects on livestock became all too clear. 
Then the effects on wildlife and pack animals in the back country started to 
show. And then came the earsplitting, heart-racing effects on a growing army of 
retirees and a real-estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The war with the Guard has turned uncivil. The main event pits ranchers, 
realtors and recreationists against a decrepit wing of the U.S. Air Force. It 
wasn't that long ago when the ranchers and recreationists were squaring off 
over wilderness designation. Indeed, they didn't strike a deal until last year. 
But the Guard has kept them united. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guard is about as rusty a weapon as there is the nation's arsenal. In the 
last 40 years, America has called up the Colorado Air Guard exactly once. 
Furthermore, the economies around the Sangres are changing, from traditional 
ranching and timbering to a mix of organic-beef or bison ranching, including a 
thriving business in ranching-for-wildlife. The recreation industry includes a 
booming second-home sector for retirees. More than 40 spiritual communities 
have made the Crestone area on the Sangres' west side a world center for 
contemplative religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guard claims that the new Denver International Airport restricts its 
airspace. In the face of rising local and statewide opposition, serious 
budgetary concerns and major environmental effects, it is determined to expand 
its training in the area. "We're in it for the long haul," said Maj. Thomas 
Schultz, public-affairs officer for the National Guard at Buckley Air Base. He 
says domestic training operations are increasingly important for the national 
defense, now that overseas missions have been sharply reduced. "If we don't 
fly, we lose our combat readiness," Schultz asserts. "This is a matter of pride 
for Colorado: Its 120th squadron was the first unit to be federally recognized 
in 1946. The Air National Guard was born here." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the valleys around the Sangres are not impressed. That's 
partly because so many of them are retired military or veterans themselves. 
Take Ray Koch, a naval-aviation veteran and former aerospace engineer for 
Martin Marietta. He spent years designing more sophisticated versions of the 
hardware and software systems that drive schemes like the Guard's. He doesn't 
have much respect for them or their systems, which he regards as Stone Age 
technology. "The Air Guard is a dinosaur," he says, adding that low-level 
flight training has about as much relevance to contemporary warfare as Kit 
Carson's pistols. Cheap, readily available surface-to-air missiles have 
rendered the Guard obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch has a solution to the dispute. He has designed a demonstration of the 
Guard's latest proposal to minimize impacts on our valleys and our wilderness. 
F-16s would overfly specific noise-sensitive points at typical airspeeds and 
power settings. Video and audio equipment would record the effects. Flight-data 
systems would correlate with ground data to validate speed, power setting, 
altitude and aircraft altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Guard's planes perform as it claims, we will leave our back yard open 
to them. If they perform as we claim, they will leave our back yard forever. 
The Guard has yet to respond. And so we continue to cringe when we consider the 
fire danger from crashing planes and flying flares. Could it be that silence 
has become the sound of freedom?*

THE NATION; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; CAN A BAD BOOK REVIEW RUIN A WRITING CAREER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN E. MOLDEA, Dan E. Moldea is also author of Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, 
MCA and the Mob (Viking Press). This article is adapted from a speech the 
author will deliver today at the American Book Assn. convention. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Aug. 18, 1989, William Morrow & Co. published my fourth book, 
"Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional Football." It 
contained well-documented charges of the Mafia's penetration into the 
multibillion-dollar world of professional football, including new information 
on illegal gambling and fixed games. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a public-relations problem, the National Football League had 
attacked me seven months before the book's release. Yet, no libel suits were 
either threatened or filed against "Interference." No source quoted in the book 
denied the accuracy of his or her quote. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I wrote in my book's prologue, the NFL, upon publication, "will remain 
aloof from the charges, deny them from afar, and then send its front line of 
defense, the loyal sportswriters, to attack the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 3, 1989, the week before the NFL season began, Gerald Eskenazi, a New 
York Times sportswriter who has covered the NFL for three decades, reviewed my 
book for the newspaper's Book Review. In his article, Eskenazi grossly 
misrepresented the facts in my book, concluding that it contained "sloppy 
journalism," a charge that, if true, could end a nonfiction author's career. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewer, however, based his opinion on a series of provably false 
assertions -- i.e., he made statements of fact that were simply not true. 
Eskenazi claimed I stated facts that I never did, or that I omitted other facts 
that were clearly in my book. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, as New York magazine observed: "(Eskenazi charges that): 
'(Moldea) revives the discredited notion that Carroll Rosenbloom . . . met foul 
play when he drowned in Florida 10 years ago.' In fact, Moldea interviewed 
witnesses who were at the scene, obtained the autopsy photos and concluded on 
Page 360 of 'Interference': 'Rosenbloom died in a tragic accident and was not 
murdered.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, Christopher Hanson stated: "Moldea 
has reason to be upset . . . (A)fter comparing what the book says with what the 
review says it says, one might conclude that Eskenazi was some distance from 
Pulitzer territory." 
</P>
<P>
 After reading Eskenazi's review, I wrote to him and asked for a retraction, 
citing his errors. He did not reply. 
</P>
<P>
 I retained an attorney who called the Times' chief in-house counsel and asked 
for a correction. The Times refused. It is worth noting that two years earlier, 
in April, 1987, the Times had been forced to print a correction regarding a 
previous review of my work. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to defend myself, I wrote to the editor of the Book Review, who 
never responded. I then tried to get my side of the story out through another 
publication, but no one gave me the opportunity. To this day, not one reporter 
has done a story that simply compares what the book says vs. what the Times 
said it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a lawsuit became my only means of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1990, after countless publishers, agents and colleagues, among 
others, continued to throw this false review in my face, I retained attorney 
Roger C. Simmons, who took my case on a contingency-fee basis. After notifying 
the Times that we were about to sue and still receiving no response, a suit was 
filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington. We charged that publication 
of the review had destroyed my career. 
</P>
<P>
 Our case piggybacked the June, 1990, U.S. Supreme Court decision, Milkovich 
vs. Lorain Journal, which stated, in part, that published opinions may be 
libelous if they are based on provably false facts. The Times immediately 
engaged our suit, filing a motion for summary judgment, proclaiming that this 
litigation jeopardized the "robust exchange of views in the marketplace of 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Times' refusal to publish my letter to the editor, which would 
have completely averted the suit, denied me the opportunity to participate in 
this "exchange of views." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the suit was filed, editorials and Op-Ed columns have relentlessly 
portrayed me as a thin-skinned author with "a wounded ego" who simply received 
a bad review and, thus, retained a top-legal gun to challenge the right of all 
reviewers and opinion writers to state their opinions freely and fully. This is 
not true. As a longtime writers' rights activist, I resent being forced to deny 
such a charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1992, U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn -- in a narrow view of 
Milkovich -- granted the Times' motion and dismissed our case. Then, on Feb. 
18, 1994, after six months of study and debate, the federal appellate court 
overturned Penn's ruling. The result was an avalanche of editorials and Op-Ed 
columns fiercely condemning and misrepresenting the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Completely ignored in all these articles was the key passage of the appellate 
opinion: "We certainly do not mean to suggest that all bad reviews are 
actionable. We do hold, however, that assertions that would otherwise be 
actionable in defamation are not transmogrified into non-actionable statements 
when they appear in the context of a book review." 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the appellate court stated that opinion writers should be held to 
the same standard of accuracy and honesty as news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on May 3, the appellate court inexplicably reversed itself. Without the 
benefit of any new evidence, legal precedent or oral argument -- but following 
the firestorm of editorial and Op-Ed criticism of their first decision -- the 
same judges wrote: "Indeed, some bad reviews may be written with an aim to 
damage a writer's reputation. There is nothing that we can do about this, at 
least without unacceptably interfering with free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the appellate court, in its virtually unprecedented act, created an 
exemption from libel for opinion writers when they engage in "mischievous 
intent," as the court now calls it. News reporters and nonfiction authors have 
no such exemption and continue to be held to a "malice" standard. Under this 
double standard of journalism, readers will never be sure whether a published 
opinion is based on real facts -- because opinion writers have no 
responsibility to be accountable for what they write. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the court of appeals -- in a decision that will surely be 
reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court -- has done nothing less than declare an 
open season for unchecked criticism on authors and their published works. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 7 editorial, the New York Times self-righteously concluded that the 
appellate court's second opinion safeguarded "spirited argument," adding: "The 
whole society, freer to speak and argue about matters of public concern, is the 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the Times' failure to publish my letter to the editor in response to a 
false and misleading review of "Interference" -- as well as my reply to its May 
7 editorial -- have denied me the opportunity to participate in "spirited 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not journalism; this is corporate tyranny.*

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; HOWARD UNIVERSITY IS NO BASTION OF ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OTESA MIDDLETON and LARRY W. BROWN, Otesa Middleton was editor in chief of 
Howard University Hilltop newspaper this year. Larry W. Brown was managing 
editor of the paper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A legacy that took 126 years to build is crumbling before the nation's eyes. 
The reputation of Howard University as a historic and prestigious African 
American institution has been damaged by charges of run away anti-Semitism on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the controversy is not hate-ridden teaching in the classroom, 
but a guest campus speaker, Khallid Abdul Muhammad. What the Nation of Islam 
leader said last February has sparked a nationwide debate on freedom of speech 
and black-Jewish relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, along with Malik Zulu Shabazz, a law student at Howard, spoke about 
black empowerment and the atrocities inflicted upon people of African descent. 
They said Jews were prominent players in the slave trade and were responsible 
for African Americans' low socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Howard has been continually attacked for permitting such a fiery, 
outspoken and, in some cases, hated speaker to appear on university property. 
The damage to the university's reputation has been immense. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Muhammad's speech, Howard has been portrayed in the media as a 
Jew-hating campus. As a result, some prospective students have shied away from 
attending classes at Howard, various aid programs have been threatened with 
curtailment and some graduates have even encountered a steady stream of 
rejections when applying for jobs. All this because everyone thinks Howard 
holds Jewish-hate rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 News programs, such as CBS's "Eye to Eye with Connie Chung," have given the 
issue national exposure. But their coverage has not fairly represented Howard 
students, faculty, staff and administrators. For example, when "Eye to Eye" 
aired in late March, Howard was again swept up in controversy because the 
show's producers chose to air the opinions of only two students, both of whom 
sided with Muhammad and both of whom have strong, biting beliefs about 
Jewish-black relations. The damaging and lasting impression was that the two 
spoke for everyone at Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 This could not more untrue. Howard has Jewish benefactors, students, faculty 
and supporters. It has always prided itself on being not only the "mecca" of 
higher black education, but also an institution that embraces diversity, 
whether of cultures, religions or beliefs.  
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad was just one of many who annually come to Howard to speak. Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders and Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown have both been 
invited to speak, as well as Muhammad, a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, not all invited speakers are university sanctioned. The 
Shabazz-led Unity Nation, not Howard, asked Muhammad to speak. Still, college 
students should be allowed to make up their own minds about whether they want 
to hear someone like Shabazz speak. 
</P>
<P>
 For the foundation of an institution of higher learning is freedom of 
expression. This ensures that students are exposed to a wide range of 
ideologies and theories. Howard prides itself on fulfilling this mission, which 
makes a Howard education more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-Jewish relations is an important topic, but they will not improve so 
long as the context of discussion is finger-pointing at universities for 
permitting controversial people to speak to students on campus. The media would 
do better to devote its resources to exposing the real causes of racial and 
social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, it is time to put this affair to rest. Blacks and Jews are 
fighting over who has been oppressed more and whose holocaust was worst. 
Everyone on both sides needs to realize that neither group can continue 
accusing the other if any progress is going to be made toward ending injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks and Jews have a lot in common. Once their shared experiences are 
expressed by members of both groups, we can begin to stop pointing the racist 
finger of blame.*

LOS ANGELES TIME INTERVIEW; EDOUARD BALLADUR; DEFENDING FRENCH CULTURE FROM 
INVADING AMERICANS BY SCOTT KRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Scott Kraft, The Times bureau chief in Paris, interviewed 
Balladur in his office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jacques Chirac led the Gaullist conservatives to an overwhelming victory 
in national elections last year, he had his eye on a bigger prize -- the 
presidency. Unfortunately, the sitting president, Francois Mitterrand, planned 
to keep the job until his term expired in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 So the conservatives devised a cunning, though politically risky strategy. 
They selected Edouard Balladur, one of Chirac's oldest friends, a modest man 
without presidential aspirations or thundering charisma, to take the job of 
prime minister, the nation's second-most-powerful job. That way, they figured, 
Chirac would be free to run for president while the mild-mannered Balladur, a 
seasoned politician, attempted to "cohabit" with Mitterrand and grapple with 
the domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But, to the surprise of many and to the dismay of Chirac, Balladur has in just 
a year on the job become the odds-on favorite to replace Mitterrand, a 
Socialist, in the country's highest office. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-year-old prime minister's popularity has baffled political analysts, 
journalists and even his own colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Balladur's popularity stems, in part, from his relative 
anonymity. Although a career government official, whose jobs included chief of 
staff to President Georges Pompidou in the 1970s, Balladur was not well-known 
to most voters. And many in France were looking for a fresh face. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur is known for his formality and his courtesy, characteristics that 
have helped him stay out of range of the arrows frequently fired by his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sat for a rare interview at Matignon, the prime minister's office on the 
Left Bank of Paris, he wore a tailored, Saville Row suit and kept the jacket 
buttoned. He is not a large man, standing just 5-foot-7, and he wears his 
thinning gray hair combed back.  
</P>
<P>
 Balladur usually arrives at his office around 7:30 a.m. and leaves at 8 p.m., 
heading back to his home across the Seine River in the up-scale 16th 
arrondisement . He and his wife, Marie-Josephe, married for 29 years, have four 
grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Turkey to a well-to-do French banker, Balladur earned a degree from 
the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the school of France's bureaucratic 
elite. He understands English, but prefers to speak in French. "I have a 
complex with English," he explained. "I don't like to appear ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Though an unabashed protector of things French, the prime minister is fond of 
the United States and Americans. Under his guidance, the government is spending 
millions of dollars this year on D-Day landing ceremonies. And, at the 
government's invitation, President Bill Clinton will become only the second 
foreigner in decades to address Parliament next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Many Americans, and many people in Southern California where the 
film industry is primarily based, are beginning to believe that France wants to 
close its cultural doors to competition. What's your feeling?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Yesterday, Ted Turner was in this office and we talked about 
that. I think there is one thing that must be understood: We are strongly 
against a uniform world culture with one single world language. 
</P>
<P>
 We the French consider that we have a great culture and a great civilization 
language and that it's perfectly legitimate that we should defend our culture. 
I forget what the exact percentages are, but American films have much more than 
50% of the French market. And French films in the United States are just a few 
percentage points. So I think really the question is for me to put to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Maybe you should put it to Ted Turner.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I said the same thing to Ted Turner, and he agreed with me that we need a 
diversity of culture worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The question is, though, can you protect it by legislation, by law?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think one can, yes. And it's our firm intention to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this brings up a problem. It's really a problem of principle. Should 
world progress only spring from the law of the markets? And that applies to 
everything. Economy, trade, culture. If that is the case, then nations are no 
longer of any use. We could just "leave it to nature," so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, the tendency of nature is that the strongest become stronger, and 
the weakest become weaker. The basis of civilizations is their struggle against 
nature. That is the basis of education, of religion, of democracy, of law. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it is a civilization endeavor that we are engaged in. It's a bit of a 
paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's pretty philosophical.  
</P>
<P>
 A: (laughs) It's an interesting idea, you might say. I don't know if you can 
put that in your newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What baffles many Americans is why France, such a powerful country and with 
such a rich culture, needs laws to protect its culture and its language. The 
French didn't need to protect their culture in the 19th Century.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are two different aspects. First is the language and, secondly, there 
is what you might call the cultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the language itself, this is not something new we are doing. Three and 
a half centuries ago, the Academie Francaise was set up (to protect the 
language). It's not something my government has thought up that is new. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to have an open mind on this. Words like le weekend are part of the 
French language now. The only thing is, you shouldn't overdo this. When the 
precise French word exists, there's no point in not using it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And culture?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What is more interesting, really, is the cultural industry, the cultural 
economy, if you like. You're perfectly right. In the 19th Century, this wasn't 
necessary, nor at the beginning of the 20th Century. But cultural activity has 
become a very big consumer product. It's true of books, films, shows. It needs 
a market to live. 
</P>
<P>
 And a country whose territory isn't big enough needs to help those cultural 
activities, to give them what the market cannot provide. It's a problem you 
don't have in the United States, because the market is already there. You have 
almost 300 million consumers of cultural products. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a problem in Europe, and especially in European countries that don't 
use English as a national language. 
</P>
<P>
 The inadequacy of the market has caused a certain number of film industries to 
almost completely disappear in Europe. Luckily, the French film industry still 
exists, but I think it exists only thanks to this machinery that we have. And 
that's why you have to correct market forces. 
</P>
<P>
 If we had a Francophone market with 300 million people, then we wouldn't need 
to have this machinery. But your products and your cultural activities already 
pay for themselves in the U.S. market, and, therefore, they can be exported at 
a very low cost. We can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 So I think it's a consequence of the fact that France is smaller than the 
United States, both in geographical terms and in population. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you watch films or television?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Television, yes. I do look at films sometimes on television. I don't go to 
the cinema often because people recognize me on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I like sentimental films. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Such as?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I like "Dr. Zhivago," "Gone With the Wind," "Love Story." They are very 
pretty films. I don't like horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Action pictures?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I like a good war film. I like comedies. I don't like sad pictures, 
even though "Love Story" is sad and "Dr. Zhivago" is sad, too, in the end. But 
they are very beautiful films. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently saw Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor." It was an excellent film. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Clint Eastwood was recently honored by the French culture minister for his 
work in films. That kind of thing is confusing to many Americans. The French 
seem to like Hollywood films, but the government seems to not want them to like 
those films.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's not at all it. First of all, Clint Eastwood wouldn't have had his 
declaration if the government hadn't agreed. But you need both. We like 
American films. I'm very fond of American films and American actors and 
actresses. There are some very fine actors. But it doesn't mean that they 
should be the only ones on the screens. They have a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 We also were a very powerful country in the past, and our tendency at the 
time, probably, was also to consider that French language and French culture 
excluded all others. Now history has moved. Things have changed. And things 
will go on changing. One day you (Americans) may have to defend yourself 
against Chinese films. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of that reduction in French power. Is it difficult for the French 
to accept a lesser role in world affairs?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the French people have gotten used to this for a number of years. 
But at the same time, I think at the heart of every Frenchman there is a 
feeling that his civilization has a worldwide value. It's a heritage we get 
from the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of all French men and women is the feeling, perhaps, that they 
embody an international value, related to principles, to rules, to laws, to 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look at our colonial past, it essentially consisted of seeing to it 
that the largest possible number of populations were able to join the French 
model of civilization.  
</P>
<P>
 There are two ways of looking at that phenomenon. You can say that it was 
generosity, if you like. But you can also say it was a sort of imperialism. You 
can say both and there probably is a bit of truth in both, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 So, basically, France considers that she has a special mission in the service 
of peace and human rights. That doesn't mean she always fulfills that mission 
in a proper way, but she tries to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So France feels a world responsibility, much in the way the United States 
does.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but in the United States, you have public-opinion reactions that are 
somewhat contradictory. Some people say, "Why aren't you doing something in 
this or that country?" and others say, "Why did you try to deal with another 
country's problems when you have problems of your own at home?" American public 
opinion oscillates between those two attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A few months ago, President Clinton suggested that America should try to 
strengthen its economic ties with Asia rather than focus only on Europe. Does 
that worry you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I do not share your analysis. If he shows a bigger overture to Asia, such 
an evolution seems to me to be natural. It's the same for us. We are more 
interested in Asia than 10 years ago. It should not be interpreted as U.S. 
disinterest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 We often forget in Europe that a seashore of your country is turned toward the 
Pacific, and that your interest in Asia is ancient and constant. But it does 
not constitute an alternative to the privileged relations that have to go on 
between the two seashores of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are relations between France and the United States at the moment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I am satisfied by the state of Franco-American relations now, and 
optimistic about their future. France and the United States base their 
relations on identical, fundamental interests. We have always found solutions 
to our temporary problems without affecting the privileged character of our 
alliance, which has seen our countries side by side in major crises. 
</P>
<P>
 This was true in the time of Gen. (Charles) de Gaulle, during the Cuban 
missile crisis, and it was even more true during the Gulf War. The celebration 
of D-Day in Normandy next month will give us the opportunity to again celebrate 
an important page of our common history.*

 * There were a few errors in Gilbert Roland's obituary (May 17).He did not win 
his greatest critical praise for "The Bullfighter and the Lady," but for his 
role in "The Bad and the Beautiful." And "Bullfighter" was hardly "the only one 
of his films ever nominated" for an Oscar. "The Sea Hawk" received a 
nomination; "The Bad and the Beautiful" received five, winning four Oscars; and 
"Around the World in 80 Days" received seven, winning four -- including one for 
Best Picture.

WOMEN'S BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your May 7 editorial, "Dream Team," was right on point. It's about time 
women are competing with men in professional baseball.Baseball is not a sport 
which is based upon strength alone. Speed, coordination and savvy are just a 
few of the essentials of a good baseball player. And women have just as much of 
these qualities as do their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope we will see women playing major-league ball by the end of the decade. 
After all, if 46-year-old men are pitching successfully in the major leagues, 
women in their 20s certainly can play just as well.

SCHWARTZ, HAUPTMAN, COEN, BLOCK AS JUDGES; ENDORSEMENTS FOR FOUR SEATS ON THE 
SUPERIOR COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H ere are The Times' endorsements in four judicial races for Superior Court in 
Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 Office No. 4: Teri Schwartz 
</P>
<P>
 This race presents a difficult choice. Thomas H. Parrott is a Superior Court 
commissioner who since his appointment in 1990 has heard criminal, family law 
and civil cases. Parrott brings broad experience to the bench; he has been a 
police officer, a college instructor, a reserve deputy sheriff and a private 
attorney. But he has had difficulty managing his caseload, a problem in this 
large and chronically crowded court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Bar Assn. has rated Parrott as "qualified" but rated 
his opponent, Teri Schwartz, "well qualified." Schwartz is a prosecutor with 
the hard-core gang division of the L. A. district attorney's office; previously 
she handled both criminal and civil cases while a private practitioner. Her 
experience is more limited than Parrott's, but Schwartz has won the respect of 
lawyers and judges for her skill, intelligence and demeanor. (A third 
candidate, Samuel Rubino, appears on the ballot but has withdrawn from the 
race.) We endorse Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Office No. 23: H. Ronald Hauptman 
</P>
<P>
 The choice here is clear. Superior Court Commissioner H. Ronald Hauptman is an 
experienced and capable jurist. A commissioner since 1984, Hauptman has heard 
mostly criminal cases, presiding very much like a judge. Previously, he spent 
23 years in private legal practice. The county bar rates Hauptman as "well 
qualified." Not so his opponent, Municipal Court Judge Marlene A. Kristovich, 
who was rated "not qualified." Appointed to the Municipal Court in 1990 after 
practicing tax law, Kristovich has heard both civil and criminal matters. Her 
experience and knowledge of the law notwithstanding, Kristovich has a 
reputation as being abrasive and inconsistent. We endorse Hauptman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Office No. 39: Ronald S. Coen 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bar has rated Coen, the incumbent, as "qualified," while his 
challenger, Charles J. Fleishman, was rated "well qualified," the bottom line 
is that Fleishman, a private attorney, seems to have entered this race to 
settle a grudge with Coen about a ruling by the judge in a medical malpractice 
lawsuit. That is not enough to sustain a candidacy, and Fleishman has trouble 
articulating a larger vision of why he wants the court seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Coen has a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense judge; critics say he can also 
be rigid, even impatient. While he would do well to take those comments as 
instructive, his rulings have held up well on appeal. We endorse Coen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Office No. 93: Mitchell Block 
</P>
<P>
 None of the five candidates stands out dramatically. Donald Barnett, a Century 
City attorney for 32 years, lost in a campaign to unseat Judge Joyce Karlin two 
years ago. Mitchell Block, a Municipal Court commissioner for the last seven 
years, has heard criminal and civil matters. Susan Bryant-Deason is a federal 
prosecutor who specializes in narcotics cases. Gary Robert Einstein is an 
Eastside attorney who handles mostly civil cases. John P. Schock is a Glendale 
attorney who has handled mostly commercial cases for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The race comes down to Block and Bryant-Deason, the only two rated "well 
qualified" by the bar association. Block can claim he will not have to learn 
how to conduct himself as a bench officer. Bryant-Deason is an aggressive 
prosecutor, but she showed poor judgment a few years ago in keeping notations 
that led to charges that the U.S. attorney's office improperly targeted blacks 
and Latinos for dealing drugs near schools. We give the slight edge to Block.

A NEW LIGHT ON INDIA; U.S. REASSESSES THAT NATION AS IT TRANSFORMS ITS ECONOMY 
IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the last half-century, the relationship between the United States 
and India was colored by Cold War distrust. Differences between the world's two 
most populous democracies were frequent, with Washington voicing concern over 
India's ties to the Soviet Union, its nonaligned status, its state-dominated 
economy and its nuclear weapons program. From a U.S. perspective, there was 
cause for suspicion, and that suspicion was the basis for a longstanding U.S. 
policy in South Asia that favored Pakistan, India's neighbor and bitter rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the Soviet Union is gone and India is making a revolutionary 
transformation from socialist protectionism to a market-oriented economy. In 
light of this and the fact that Pakistan now has nuclear weapons, the United 
States is being forced to reassess the Indo-American relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic cooperation between the two nations is important. The United States 
already is India's largest export market, and U.S. corporations like AT&T, 
Ford, General Electric, Coca-Cola and IBM have operations in India. An enduring 
economic relationship appears certain. In a speech this month before a joint 
session of the U.S. Congress, Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao 
emphasized the new economic ties between Washington and New Delhi. For that 
matter, so has Ambassador-designate Frank Wisner, who will fill a 16-month 
vacancy and is expected to be confirmed when the Senate reconvenes after the 
Memorial Day holiday recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Such optimistic assessments are certainly welcome. But as the United States 
becomes more economically linked to India, it will be forced to face up to some 
uncomfortable differences that persist. These include India's continuing 
attempt to develop nuclear weapons and its efforts, much criticized by human 
rights groups, to crush a separatist insurrection in Kashmir. The violence in 
Kashmir reportedly has claimed as many as 20,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States and India can easily agree on the benefits of a 
stronger economic relationship, they aren't likely to find the going smooth as 
they confront the political challenges.

 Kudos to the Times and Ted Rohrlich for bringing attention to the 
inefficiencies in the financing of low-income housing ("Housing Project a 
Costly Lesson for Taxpayers," May 16).As president of the City of Los Angeles 
Affordable Housing Commission, I share these concerns. The commission plans to 
submit recommendations to the city this summer with respect to solving these 
problems. We welcome your contribution to this dialogue and also invite the 
public to participate.

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS NEEDS YAROSLAVSKY; L.A. COUNCILMAN WOULD BRING A FINE 
RECORD AND A REPUTATION FOR OPENNESS TO 3RD DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the June 7 primary election only one open seat on the powerful Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors is on the ballot. Residents of the 3rd District -- 
which runs along the coast from the Ventura County line to Santa Monica and 
inland to West Hollywood and then sprawls northward to cover most of the San 
Fernando Valley -- will vote to replace the retiring Edmund D. Edelman on the 
five-member body that governs the nation's most populous county. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying to replace Edelman are four candidates: retired Los Angeles Fire Captain 
Don Wallace of Calabasas, environmental consultant Michael S. Hirsch of Van 
Nuys, attorney Elgin M. Trammell Sr. of Lake View Terrace and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional political wisdom concedes the race to Yaroslavsky, a veteran 
Westside councilman who has raised nearly $1 million for his campaign. 
Obviously he can heavily outspend a candidate like Hirsch, who has interesting 
ideas but a campaign budget of only about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be a mistake to assume Yaroslavsky is a shoo-in. For while he is 
well-known on the Westside, he is still a relative newcomer to the Valley -- 
and a somewhat suspect newcomer at that, coming as he does from the "other 
side" of the Hollywood Hills. Wallace, a community activist in the West Valley 
who has run for county supervisor before, is counting on those facts to work in 
his favor, along with his three years' experience as an Edelman deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace's experience in the County Hall of Administration gives him an air of 
authority in criticizing the size of the county bureaucracy and buttresses his 
argument that more money for the strapped county budget can be found through 
downsizing. Yaroslavsky makes the same argument, however, and can back it up 
with nearly 20 years of experience in City Hall as one of the most consistent 
voices for economy and openness in city government. To ease any suspicion they 
may harbor against an outsider, Valley voters should recall Yaroslavsky's 
efforts to get aid to Sherman Oaks, which he represents, after the Jan. 17 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky's theme of openness in government is what sways us to his 
side. Openness was conspicuously absent at the Hall of Administration until 
Gloria Molina was elected in 1991. She and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke have 
provided a welcome breath of fresh air in county government. More is needed 
and, based on his City Hall record, Yaroslavsky should do the job.

PROM FOR GAY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gay Los Angeles Unified School District students recently had the 
opportunity to enjoy an all-gay prom, free from the stresses of the outside 
world (May 22). An all-gay prom may temporarily serve the gay students' 
self-esteem but it does nothing to help them deal with the real world. If LAUSD 
wants to teach these students that they can only feel safe inside a gay ghetto, 
a separate gay prom is a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that both gay and non-gay students would be better served by gay 
students taking their same-sex dates to the regular school prom. Last I 
checked, the school prom was not designated "straights only." LAUSD should 
encourage its students to attend the school prom with dates of any gender they 
like and step in if anyone acts out of line. LAUSD should encourage gay 
students to live openly among their non-gay peers and encourage non-gay 
students to live respectfully with their gay peers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that this story of a "separate but equal" prom comes in the same 
week as the 40th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. The 
openly gay community faces separatism similar to that experienced by African 
Americans until the 1950s, except the forces of separatism often come from 
within the gay community itself. Gay proms, West Hollywood, domestic 
partnership laws: These are all separate and unequal ghettos created by gays 
who rightfully didn't feel safe in the straight world. The time has come for 
the gay community to rejoin the larger American community. Of course, then 
there is the question of whether or not gays will be let in. 
</P>

 * We would like to offer our sincere thanks to everyone involved in 
coordinating "Live to Tell," the gay and lesbian prom night held May 20 at the 
Los Angeles Hilton. Our 16-year-old son attended with his friend, and what he 
found at this event was a strong, protective, validating network of truly 
loving peers and adults. We know this helps him considerably in his own rite of 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 We need more activities of this nature for our gay and lesbian youth in order 
to balance or even quell the prejudice and intolerance of the "religious right" 
or the downright ignorant. Fortunately, the pride and happiness we witnessed on 
this night rendered the protesters outside the Hilton virtually voiceless. 
</P>
<P>
 Our one concern about this event was the possibility of hecklers. However, 
after seeing how organized and chaperoned it was, we were able to leave feeling 
very comfortable and peaceful knowing that our son and others could enjoy an 
event that should be a part of all young people's high school experience. The 
ballroom was beautifully decorated, the chaperons supportive, and the young 
faces radiant with pride. As it should be.

POLICE OFFICERS REJECT CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "The Beat Cop Takes a Back Seat, Again" by Marvin Braude, 
Commentary, May 23: 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Braude implies that the patrol officers were led astray by the 
Police Protective League leadership when the city's contract offer was 
rejected. I would remind Braude that the league's board of directors vigorously 
advocated ratification of the contract. What led to its rejection was a 
groundswell of resentment among the very patrol officers that Braude claims to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 When I joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1982 we were among the best 
paid police officers in the state, if not the country. We have since fallen far 
behind other agencies in pay and benefits while the challenges we face have 
steadily increased. We are no longer attracting the most qualified applicants 
and many fine young officers are leaving the LAPD for other departments where 
they are better paid and enjoy more public support. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I think it is dangerous to impose the will of the Christopher 
Commission without challenge. Warren Christopher was touted as an expert on law 
enforcement issues, but as secretary of state he is supposed to be an expert on 
foreign affairs. The current state of our foreign policy casts doubt on his 
expertise.

 Detective, LAPD

 * Regarding the stalemate between the LAPD and the City Council, I believe the 
council is in error. The council's job is to either give the officers a raise 
they can or will accept, or convince them (the LAPD) that they don't deserve a 
raise.

 I sincerely hope that the LAPD will not resort to a slowdown, or a sick-out, 
or any other such maneuver, which could only undermine their image. The police 
should carry on doing their job protecting the citizens of Los Angeles, which 
they were hired to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that the union executives attempt to get enough signatures to place 
a motion on the ballot as to whether or not the voters want our police officers 
compensated adequately for the tremendous job they are asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I would rather pay a higher tax for the protection of our city than pay the 
tremendous cost of allowing our city to be polluted by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving our city councilmen/women a raise certainly doesn't seem to help.

 * I agree with Charles L. Lindner's assessment of our local government's inept 
behavior with regard to the implementation of the Americans With Disabilities 
Act (Opinion, May 8). Two years ago a friend of mine was subjected to 
bureaucratic runarounds when he tried to remedy a situation concerning a local 
restaurant's policy of chaining off a designated-handicapped parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn frequented a nearby cafe for his daily cup of Java. When he politely 
asked why they had chained off a parking space he was entitled to use, the 
manager copped a caustic attitude that "everyone is equally denied access to 
the parking lot." Shawn then called the police only to be informed that there 
was nothing they could do. Shawn elicited help from various city officials and 
was met by sympathetic, impotent responses. 
</P>
<P>
 After many months of governmental inaction he took the owner to court and won, 
the judge strongly warning the owner to take down the chain as a matter of 
public policy and decency. But 1 1/2 years later the chain is still up and the 
owner removed the international handicapped lavatory signs from his cafe's 
bathroom as a further act of defiance. Without effective enforcement the 
American With Disabilities Act is a mockery of the disabled community.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: EPA BLOWS SMOKE ON RISK OF BREATHING IT; 
GOVERNMENT, JUGGLING STATISTICS, REACHES A CONCLUSION TO MATCH ITS FLAWED 
HYPOTHESIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former national correspondent for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does the truth matter? Evidently not, when it comes to attacking the tobacco 
industry. Respectable newspapers like this one carried the "Doonesbury" cartoon 
strip that branded tobacco executives, by name, as indicted for perjury. True, 
there was an editor's disclaimer in The Times advising that it was merely 
satire, but previous "Doonesbury" strips smearing individuals, including one 
that linked Frank Sinatra with organized crime, were not printed. Apparently 
tobacco executives are subject to a lower standard of fair play.  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times brazenly asserted just that in an editorial last week: 
"Americans generally think it unsporting to kick an opponent who is down. But 
the sellers of cigarettes, given their history of arrogance and mendacity, 
provide a target too tempting, and deserving, to resist." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, without examining the evidence, the newspaper accused industry 
executives of chicanery for daring to challenge the EPA's labeling 
environmental tobacco smoke a Class A carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, this time the tobacco industry seems to be right. This time it is the 
EPA that appears to have juggled statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA conducted no new studies in rendering its judgment on secondhand 
smoke. Instead, the agency re-evaluated the results of 30 previous studies done 
throughout the world on couples in which only one spouse smoked.  
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, those studies made as strong a case for a protective effect from 
breathing secondhand smoke as they did for a deleterious outcome. As the 
Congressional Research Service pointed out, "six (studies) found a 
statistically significant (but small) effect, 24 found no statistically 
significant effect and six of the 24 found a passive smoking effect opposite to 
the expected relationship."  
</P>
<P>
 What to do? After summarizing those worldwide results, the EPA chose to ignore 
all but the 11 studies that had been conducted within the United States. 
Perhaps there are valid reasons for such narrowing of the inquiry on the 
grounds that home-grown data are more relevant and more easily monitored.  
</P>
<P>
 But why then did the EPA also ignore the largest and most recent U.S. study, 
conducted in 1992 for the National Cancer Institute? Perhaps it was 
disappointment with the study's conclusion: "We found no statistically 
significant increase in risk associated with exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke at work or during social activities."  
</P>
<P>
 Even the 11 previous U.S. studies that the EPA chose to use as the basis for 
its report did not provide a significant link between secondhand smoke and lung 
cancer. The EPA then readjusted the data in the original studies to see if the 
results might come out differently. But despite such efforts, 10 of the 11 
studies still showed no statistically significant connection.  
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this challenge to its a priori hypothesis, the EPA simply changed 
its research rules: It combined the 11 studies into one and changed the 
acceptable margin of error from 5% to 10%. Eureka! At last a slight correlation 
could be shown. How slight? They predicted that in a nation of more than 250 
million people, 3,000 would die of lung cancer as a result of secondhand smoke. 
About the same chance as dying in a bicycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very thin reed on which to base sweeping changes in public policy. 
As the Congressional Research Service noted after evaluating the EPA's 
methodology: "It is unusual to return to a study after the fact, lower the 
required significance level and declare its results to be supportive rather 
than unsupportive of the effect one's theory suggests should be present." 
</P>
<P>
 That polite but devastating analysis suggests that it is anti-smoking hysteria 
and not science that is driving policy here. We would expect that from 
advocates on various sides of an issue, but not from a government agency whose 
data we need to trust if we are to follow its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifestyle changes do not come easily. A very strong case can be made for 
giving up smoking, and failing that, for being considerate of others. The good 
news is that there is general agreement that secondhand smoke dilutes quickly 
in open air or well-ventilated places, making this a fixable problem if there 
is goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are not going to alter the behavior of 50 million smokers by making 
them pariahs or by holding tobacco executives responsible for a habit that 
adults choose despite all the warnings. One can make the case for smoke-free 
public spaces on the basis of civility alone, without piling on the false guilt 
about killing people with secondhand smoke.

DECIDE NOW HOW YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE; MEDICINE: BY SIGNING AN 'ADVANCE 
DIRECTIVE,' MR. NIXON AND MRS. ONASSIS SPARED THEIR FAMILIES INCALCULABLE 
HEARTACHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL S. WENGER and MARTIN F. SHAPIRO, Drs. Neil S. Wenger and Martin F. 
Shapiro teach medicine at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis may have agreed on little during 
their lives, but in dying they chose a similar route, setting an important 
example: They anticipated death and chose to meet it without aggressive medical 
care.  
</P>
<P>
 The former President suffered a massive stroke, a disease quite different from 
the former First Lady's aggressive tumor of the lymph nodes. Mr. Nixon's 
illness came on suddenly, while Mrs. Onassis had received treatment for several 
months. The key to the decision made by each of these individuals was to 
consider in advance how they wanted to spend their last days. Each completed an 
"advance directive," a document that states an individual's wishes regarding 
medical care, should he or she be unable to participate when decisions have to 
be made. Because of this advance planning, family and physicians knew that Mr. 
Nixon and Mrs. Onassis desired a focus on quality, not quantity, of life when 
the prognosis became bleak. The resultant medical care allowed death to come in 
a "dignified" way. 
</P>
<P>
 Making advance decisions about medical care is difficult for Americans. It 
means explicitly considering prognosis, the risks and benefits of treatment and 
the effects of illness and treatment on quality of life. What's perhaps most 
difficult is that such decisions require a recognition of the limits of modern 
medicine, a concept blurred if not buried in the nearly constant reports of new 
cures, scientific breakthroughs and unique, remarkable cases. Making future 
medical decisions may mean coming to terms with data on how likely a treatment 
is to fail without necessarily "giving up hope." Such decisions may also mean 
letting go of the expectation for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 These decisions are difficult because death is often the only alternative to 
aggressive care. Mr. Nixon could have been placed on a mechanical ventilator to 
breathe for him, perhaps extending his life substantially and permitting some 
neurologic recovery. It is not possible to exclude the slim chance of full 
recovery to his prior state of health, although the probability of such an 
outcome is so low that it would have to be regarded as miraculous. But the 
downside also must be considered: the days or weeks or months spent 
uncomfortably in the intensive-care unit, the much greater likelihood that any 
recovery would be to a severely impaired state and the probability of future 
suffering.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis could have chosen from even more available options. While dying 
from a tumor that would not respond to therapy, she developed a pneumonia; she 
had a treatable illness in the setting of a rapidly terminal disease. The 
physicians could have treated, and perhaps cured, the pneumonia, only to have 
Mrs. Onassis die of the tumor. If she lived long enough after surviving the 
pneumonia, Mrs. Onassis could have searched for another therapy for her tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 There is always another, though less likely to be successful, treatment 
option. And if not, there's probably an experimental protocol. For some people, 
the "last resort," is the option preferred. But patients and families making 
decisions at the brink of life must recognize that these are exceedingly likely 
to be unsuccessful and result in a death in the hospital. Mrs. Onassis chose to 
die at home, in familiar surroundings, encircled by family. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that, given similar clinical circumstances, all patients 
would or should choose a similar course, although surveys of Americans about 
end-of-life preferences suggest that many, if not most, would have made similar 
choices. However, without advance discussions, the families and physicians of 
such individuals would not know these patients' preferences. As a result, these 
individuals would have ended up in intensive-care units on mechanical 
ventilators, most dying there days or weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Many patients whose preferences are not known will die while receiving 
aggressive care. Vast medical resources are expended in the process of these 
deaths. In part due to aggressive care at the end of life, the United States 
invests about 1% of the gross national product in intensive care, far more than 
any other nation. This is not to say that we should not employ intensive care, 
utilize modern technology and marvel at medical breakthroughs -- only that such 
advances must be used in order to reach the patient's goals, not necessarily 
just to prolong life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of usual medical care, the end-of-life decisions of Mr. Nixon 
and Mrs. Onassis were special. May we learn from their example and examine our 
values, scrutinize our medical care and discuss and complete advance directives 
for future care.

PERSPECTIVE ON IRAQ; BARBS AIMED AT SADDAM MISFIRE; THE U.N. EMBARGO HAS 
SHATTERED THE ONCE-SUBSTANTIAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS HELD BY WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARITA PAPANDREOU, Margarita Papandreou is the American-born former first 
lady of Greece. She is global coordinator of Women for Mutual Security, a peace 
network. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I recently attended a human-rights conference in Baghdad. When I told a friend 
that the Iraqi Federation of Women had invited me for this purpose, she smirked 
and, in a voice dripping with sarcasm, said, "Human rights? In Iraq?" 
</P>
<P>
 No one can condone any of the human-rights violations by Iraq, such as the 
suppression of the Kurdish and Shiite peoples or the invasion of Kuwait. But 
there are other parts to this story, especially concerning the status of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, before its long war with Iran and during the brief two-year interlude 
before the Gulf War, was one of the most progressive Arab states on women's 
rights. Women's education, for example, benefited from the law on compulsory 
education of 1976, the national comprehensive literacy campaign of 1978 and the 
law of higher education and scientific research of 1987. For 15 years, there 
was a close association between Iraqi women and the organization I headed, the 
Women's Union of Greece. In 1979, I visited many after-hours classes in 
elementary schools where women of all ages were learning to read and write. 
Thousands of young women were on government scholarships studying abroad, 
encouraged to enter any and all professions.  
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi women's political rights included the following: the right to vote 
and hold parliamentary office and membership in political parties, the right to 
membership in non-governmental organizations and associations, and the right to 
hold public-sector jobs. Compare this to women's situation in Saudi Arabia or 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these rights were wiped out by the conditions created when the United 
States and its allies dropped 88,500 tons of bombs -- equal to seven Hiroshimas 
-- on this land. The bombing killed and wounded tens of thousands of men, women 
and children, hitting mosques, churches, hospitals, schools, homes for children 
and the disabled and civilian shelters. Bombs and missiles also destroyed power 
stations, sewage systems and municipal services. This is a breach of Article 51 
of the first protocol of the Geneva conventions of 1977, which calls for 
protection of civilians against military operations and forbids attacks 
targeting them. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. economic sanctions were placed on Iraq for refusing to withdraw from 
Kuwait and were continued after Iraqi troops pulled out, following the 
cease-fire. The stated aim was to compel destruction of the country's capacity 
to produce chemical and nuclear weapons. The whispered aim was to bring down 
Saddam Hussein and to aid the Kurds and the Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam is still in power, with a weary and impoverished population unable to 
gather the revolutionary zeal for his overthrow expected by President Bush. As 
for the Kurds, the United States has never been a friend of the Kurdish 
struggle for self-determination. Its policy after the war produced the painful 
exodus of the Kurds, resulting in thousands of dead and homeless, hungry 
people. Now it is trying to assuage its guilt by dropping pallets of food into 
refugee camps while Turkey carries out military raids against Kurdish villages 
in Iraq. The U.S. call for an uprising of the Shiites, only to abandon those 
who made the attempt, resulted in the deaths of thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions have, however, managed to create a weak economy, a physically 
debilitated people and three societal problems practically unheard of in prewar 
Iraq: crime, unemployment and prostitution. Women and children are bearing the 
brunt of these sanctions. Women whose partners were lost were thrown into the 
job market to feed their children. Divorce rates are up in two-parent families 
because of the stress and strain. Girls are dropping out of school to help in 
the home. The acute shortage of basic food and medicines as well as their 
soaring prices has triggered a nearly 550% increase since 1990 in the mortality 
rate of children under 5. And women are withdrawing from political activity, 
unable to handle all the added responsibilities they now have. 
</P>
<P>
 The stated aim of the U.N. resolution on sanctions was to stop Iraq's 
production of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has complied with all the 
conditions. It has officially dropped its claim to Kuwait as Iraq's 19th 
province. And it has agreed to long-term monitoring to ensure it is not 
resuscitating its weapons program. What is the purpose of continuing the 
sanctions? A healthy, vibrant society is in a much better position to work for 
political change, to correct human-rights abuses, to build a democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
 If the civilized world is to carry the banner of human rights, it has to look 
at its own actions. Denying people food, medications, sovereignty and peace of 
mind is another form of war. The Clinton Administration inherited a policy. It 
is time it examined that inheritance and took the bold, humane action of 
removing the sanctions.

COLUMN RIGHT/ ALAN CHARLES RAUL: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, NOT STUPIDITY; 
TOO-STRICT STANDARDS WASTE TAX MONEY NEEDED ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CHARLES RAUL, Alan Charles Raul, a lawyer in Washington, was general 
counsel of the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget 
in the Bush and Reagan administrations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalism isn't what it used to be. An awareness is building that not 
every program identifying itself as "good" for the environment delivers real 
value to society. Many voices are now being raised in favor of more common 
sense and realism in allocating the burdens and benefits of environmental 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 So the opponents of environmental legislation have become the 
environmentalists themselves. The reauthorization of environmental statutes is 
being stalled on Pennsylvania Avenue not by conservatives, but by liberals. 
Their fear is that the Zeitgeist no longer favors unqualified environmentalism. 
The environmentalist imperative to preserve the status quo is best evidenced by 
their campaign to kill congressional reform of the Superfund law. Likewise, 
Congress has been stymied in reauthorizing the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act and the Endangered Species Act. Even the bill to give the EPA 
Cabinet-level status was stopped in its tracks by the environmental side of the 
aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension between balanced and absolute environmentalism has hit a social 
nerve because a particular form of conservation -- the need to save money -- 
has become so urgent. It costs business owners, shareholders, workers and 
consumers, as well as state and local governments, hundreds of billions of 
dollars a year to comply with the existing environmental laws enacted by 
Congress. This money is well spent only if the results are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the public loathes pollution and loves the idea of a 
green world. But people are starting to object to policies that protect the 
environment stupidly. Crime can't be fought, children educated, cancer cured or 
welfare reformed if environmental-protection money isn't used wisely. Cleaning 
up dirt at industrial Superfund sites to edible levels, forcing schools to rip 
asbestos from behind sealed walls or sacrificing jobs to protect subspecies can 
seem disproportionate to our more dangerous risks.  
</P>
<P>
 Environmental realism seeks to find a balance by enhancing respect for honest 
science, private property and state and local budgets. There is growing 
consensus on the common-sense need to assess risks scientifically, compare 
relative risks and weigh the costs and benefits of government mandates. Some 
reactionary environmentalists disparage the principles of "risk analysis," 
"property rights" and "unfunded mandates" as an "unholy trinity" intended to 
gut the environment as we know it. But if lawmakers and the public are kept in 
the dark about real risks and costs, the country will continue to buy 
environmental protection of the wrong kinds and amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense is also rooted in the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment promises 
that the government will not take private property for public purposes without 
paying just compensation. This clause has been increasingly invoked by 
landowners prohibited from using their property by regulations designed to 
protect wetlands, species, beaches and green space. These are worthwhile public 
objectives. But if their cost is too much for the public's coffers, why should 
private citizens foot the bill?  
</P>
<P>
 The final common-sense standard is a straightforward money question. Congress 
keeps passing laws that compel state and local governments to spend billions to 
comply with federal mandates. Goals like safe drinking water and clean air are 
good and necessary. But as Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) has said, Congress has an 
insatiable impulse to pass the buck but not the bucks. Governors and mayors 
just cannot afford these unfunded mandates without depriving their constituents 
of a lot of other public services. If the federal money isn't there for the 
taking, which it isn't, then the minimum that good government can do is insist 
on a careful ordering of regulatory priorities. The more mandates, the higher 
the property, sewer and water taxes -- and these don't hit the rich hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior environmental officials in the Clinton Administration are uncomfortable 
with the Democrat and Republican legislators who want to build these standards 
into law. This oldthink will not wash in 1994 any more than it did in 1969. 
Then, the National Environmental Policy Act ordered all federal decision-makers 
to consider environmental impacts before any major action. Surely it is no less 
desirable that the major impacts of environmental actions be considered just as 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 The new environmental realism will improve, not stifle, environmental 
protection if results are measured in terms of value received. No one really 
believes that the billions of environmental dollars spent today are spent well 
enough.

THE STATE; IS THERE A PAYOFF FOR DEMOCRATIC DEFENSIVENESS? DON'T BET ON IT

 This should be the Democrats' year in California. The recession refuses to 
abate, especially in vote-rich Los Angeles. Pete Wilson, a governor who 
combines the common touch of George Bush with the affability of Richard M. 
Nixon, has presided over the worst economy since the 1930s. By any theory of 
accountability, Wilson should already be halfway out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not -- in large part, because he's also inherited Nixon's genius for 
scapegoating, for those racially charged wedge issues that have been the 
linchpin of post-1968 Republicanism. Who wants to talk de-industrialization? 
The problem is immigrants. The problem is liberal values that have impeded 
executions and limited the growth of the all-important prison sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on, though. These are Bill Clinton Democrats who Wilson is attacking. 
Following the strategy that won Clinton the White House, they're willing to 
keep Wilson company part of the way down the path to social conservatism -- so 
long as they can also take him to task for neglecting the public investment on 
which California has always relied. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is the theory that underpins the gubernatorial campaigns of 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. In the more 
inelegant realm of practice, it's often looked more like simply caving in. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been less of a stretch for Garamendi, who came into the race with a long 
record of support for the death penalty and skepticism toward Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr.'s judicial appointments. But Kathleen Brown has been compelled to 
embark on an odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome the stigma of her opposition to the death penalty, Brown has had 
to commit to the "three strikes and you're out" initiative. Garamendi has 
prudently backed off his initial support for the measure. State Sen. Tom Hayden 
has never favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of an occasional Hayden, the California Democrats have 
learned to play defense, to embrace a "three strikes" here, a spate of 
executions there. (There are limits to how far they can be pushed: Garamendi 
opposes the militarization of the border; Brown vows to campaign against the 
initiative denying medical care to illegal immigrants.) And, thus inoculated 
against the worst of Wilson's charges, they are presumably able to take it to 
Wilson on the economy. The payoff for all this defensiveness is their ability 
to go on the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 So where's the offense? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that there aren't real differences of economic vision between the two 
parties. Like their Republican counterparts, most California Democrats pay 
ritual homage to the cult of deregulation. But they part company from the GOP 
with their new-found stress on public investment. As they tell the tale, the 
California Creation Epic is all about how Earl Warren and Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr. built the world's greatest public schools and universities, the world's 
best roads and infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite rightly, they call for a latter-day version of these policies today. 
They've become apostles (Hayden particularly) of an enviro-industrial policy: 
Electric cars and light rail glide across a hundred position papers. They're 
pushing blue-collar public-works projects like the Alameda Corridor, and 
white-collar ones like the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than their policies of social retreat, these policies of public 
investment mark a break from recent past Democratic practice. The gubernatorial 
campaigns of Tom Bradley, John Van De Kamp and Dianne Feinstein assumed, as a 
matter of course, the continuation of the California postwar boom. Garamendi, 
Hayden and Brown make no such assumption. With programs such as these, they 
propose both to reshape our economy and to give it a jump-start. 
</P>
<P>
 The jump-start is the hard part. While a state can pursue its own distinctly 
progressive investment priorities in boom times (that's precisely what Pat 
Brown did), it lacks most of the tools to engineer its own recovery. A state 
has no obvious way to fund a stimulus. The Democrats cannot propose higher 
taxes in the midst of a recession. They cannot, unlike the feds, rely on 
deficit spending; that is forbidden, here as in all states, by law. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left for the Democrats are stimulus substitutes. Their candidates for 
governor, treasurer and controller all call for setting aside a portion of the 
state-employee pension funds for in-state investment, for giving an edge to 
in-state bidders on public-sector contracts. (Just a few years ago, California 
Democrats derided this kind of "domestic content" mind-set as appropriate for a 
fossilized economy like Michigan's, but not for so dynamic a state as ours. 
Then aerospace turned to a fossil.) They call for the more expeditious sale of 
bonds. And they call -- Kathleen Brown, in particular -- for targeting tax 
breaks to companies that create good jobs, for tax moratoriums on new small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 These last programs aren't all that different from some of Wilson's. Indeed, 
the Democrats can fire away at Wilson's cluelessness when it comes to the 
long-term rebuilding of the state economy. But generating a plausible 
short-term recovery plan at the state level is almost impossible -- without the 
feds. 
</P>
<P>
 The feds -- more precisely, the President -- certainly wanted to be here. 
California is the key to his electoral calculus, and a good chunk of his 
public-investment plan on which he campaigned was supposed to end up retooling 
our shuttered defense plants and rebuilding our shattered inner cities. But the 
Clinton plan of '92 was axed in '93. By the time the deficit hawks finished 
dismembering it, even the President had been reduced to such stimulus 
substitutes as quake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say, the California Democrats are a pretty good mirror of the 
national party's frustration. They've lurched rightward on social issues to 
preserve their credibility with a majority of voters. They've forged an 
activist economics to halt the state's decline and cement that majority's 
allegiance. And they're having one hell of a time putting that economics to 
work. Until they can, they're still on defense -- and Wilson, telling voters 
that the crucial task of government is to put up prisons and hunt down 
immigrants, is still in the gubernatorial game.*

shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * DOWNTOWN CLEANUP: Approved a motion that will transfer $150,000 from the 
Disaster Assistance Loan Program to the Clean and Safe Business Improvement 
District, which aims to provide security and cleanup to the Downtown area. 
Councilwoman Rita Walters initially objected to the proposal because the money 
was coming from federal funds earmarked for assisting businesses hurt by the 
1992 riots. But she voted in favor of the proposal after amending it to include 
a study of similar ways to improve riot-impacted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * BICYCLE PATROL: Approved the use of $1,080 from the city's General Purpose 
Fund to purchase a police patrol bicycle and accessories for the Los Angeles

building of six single-family homes in the Baldwin Hills area. The development, 
at Don Ricardo Drive and Hillcrest Drive, was originally planned for 12 homes 
but was delayed because of complaints by neighborhood residents. The 
neighborhood's City Council representative, Mark Ridley-Thomas, was against 
building any new homes. But the council, after advice from the city attorney's 
office, voted for the compromise. Passed 10-1. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, 
Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Rita Walters. Voting no: Ridley-Thomas.

DODGERS FEEL OUT OF PLACE; BASEBALL: ASTACIO, WHO HAS BEEN NEARLY UNBEATABLE AT 
HOME, LOSES TO THE PIRATES, 7-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who had won 11 of their last 14 games, lost their second baseman 
Saturday night to the disabled list, their shortstop to the flu, were without 
their starting catcher for the second consecutive game and watched their most 
successful pitcher at home self-destruct in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pirates, who had lost 11 of their last 14 games, sent out a 
pitcher who somehow does better in the state of California, and Pittsburgh beat 
the Dodgers, 7-2, before 47,771 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the action, we had 12 hits, we had the baserunners, we just weren't 
able to capitalize," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "If someone would have told me 
before the game we would get 12 hits and lose, I wouldn't have believed them." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, there were no ninth-inning theatrics. Despite leaving 10 runners on 
base, the Dodgers, who lead the league in one-run games with 25, couldn't get 
close to the Pirates after the fourth inning, during which starter Pedro 
Astacio turned the Dodgers' 2-1 deficit into 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had several opportunities and we had 11 or 12 hits we just couldn't put 
together, but fortunately for us, the Giants lost too," first baseman Eric 
Karros said, referring to the fact that the Dodgers remained three games ahead 
of San Francisco atop the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's start, Astacio had a 1.75 earned-run average in 25 2/3 
innings at home, holding opponents to a .182 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 From the onset of Saturday's game, though, Astacio was shaky. His first pitch 
hit leadoff hitter Carlos Garcia in the first inning, and Garcia eventually 
scored on a double by Andy Van Slyke. Cleanup hitter Dave Clark drove in Van 
Slyke with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, during the fourth inning, Astacio gave up four runs on three hits -- 
including a two-run single by starter Denny Neagle and a two-run double by Jay 
Bell -- and a sacrifice bunt by Garcia. Astacio helped the runs along with two 
walks.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored in the bottom of the first inning when Raul Mondesi hit an 
0-and-1 pitch by the left-handed Neagle into the right-field pavilion for his 
seventh home run of the season. Brett Butler led off the seventh with a triple 
-- his league-leading seventh -- into the right-field corner and scored on a 
single to center by Mitch Webster.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler's triple was the Dodgers' ninth hit against Neagle, and it was enough 
for Manager Jim Leyland to bring in reliever Rick White, who gave up Webster's 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept us off-balance all night, changing speeds real well," said Cory 
Snyder, who has two hits in his last 19 at-bats and kicked a dugout trash can 
in frustration after he struck out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several times tonight we were looking for that changeup away and 
he would take a little off or speed up. He didn't make many mistakes tonight. 
He also had a 6-1 lead, so he could play around a bit, and he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I just haven't been playing very much and haven't felt real 
comfortable. I need to get back in the groove and start contributing." 
</P>
<P>
 Neagle (5-5) has won three of his last four starts and given up only seven 
runs during that span. In his 13 California starts, he has a 3-1 record and an 
ERA under 2.00.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had their chances against him. In the second and third innings 
they left a total of four runners on base, stranding Butler on third base in 
the third after he made it there with none out. After that, Neagle held the 
Dodgers to two hits until the sixth, when Karros led off with a single to 
center and moved to second on a pop-fly single to shallow center by Carlos 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one out, the Dodgers still couldn't score. Garey Ingram struck out 
and Henry Rodriguez, pinch-hitting for Gary Wayne, lined out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who made his second consecutive start in place of Mike Piazza, who 
is sidelined because of a bruised rib, got three hits, tying a career high.

EWING THROWS BRICKS AS PACERS WIN, 88-68; NBA PLAYOFFS: BACK HOME AGAIN, 
INDIANA NARROWS THE GAP TO 2-1 BY HOLDING CENTER TO ONE POINT AND KNICKS TO 
RECORD LOW SCORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And they call the racetrack across town the Brickyard? 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors brought a Mason to Market Square Arena Saturday afternoon -- 
forward Anthony Mason -- proving that they must have known it would be bad. But 
no one could have imagined it would be this bad: Patrick Ewing scoring one 
point and missing all 10 of his shots and the New York Knicks setting an NBA 
playoff record for offensive futility while losing to the Indiana Pacers, 
88-68. 
</P>
<P>
 It was bad even by the Knicks' standards as they saw their lead in the 
best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals shrink to 2-1: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 68 points were the fewest in the playoffs since the shot clock was 
introduced in 1954-55. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 34.3% was the lowest shooting percentage ever against the Pacers in 
an NBA playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The one point by Ewing was a career low, postseason or otherwise, and is 
believed to be the first time he has ever gone an entire NBA game without a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we defended pretty well," Pacer Coach Larry Brown understated. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana defended so well that even its free-throw defense was great. New York 
made only 21 of 39 attempts, or 53.8%. The Pacers shot almost that well from 
the field, 49.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 But, yeah, it was the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called it the Pacers' best defensive game of the season, but that can 
probably be pinpointed to one area, Ewing, after he had scored 28 and 32 points 
in the first two games. They had double-teamed him both times at Madison Square 
Garden, but made an adjustment Saturday by sending a second player to the post 
sooner, intending to force him to pass more often and hoping ultimately to slow 
him down. What they got instead was a complete stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing missed all three of his shots in the first quarter and four more in the 
second, although the Knicks led at halftime, 39-37. The second half brought 
another obstacle, foul problems, his third coming only 51 seconds into the 
third period. He had to come out, and the Knicks collapsed, making three of 12 
shots from the field and seven of 14 from the line while he was on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Ewing returned to start the fourth period, the Knicks trailed, 
62-52, and their superstar center was being outscored by LaSalle Thompson, 2-0. 
The Pacers played Haywoode Workman and Lester Conner together in the backcourt 
for the first time this season and surrounded them with the likes of Kenny 
Williams, Dale Davis and Thompson -- the definition of the phrase "makeshift 
lineup" -- and increased their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing picked up only one more foul the rest of the way, going nine minutes in 
the final quarter and 28 in all, but he was still of little use to the Knicks. 
He closed by missing three more shots before leaving with 3:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the shots he took," Brown said. "I don't think they're the kind 
where you go 10 for 10 on those shots. But I certainly never thought I'd coach 
in a game where he scored one point." 
</P>
<P>
 Get in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen that before in my life," said Antonio Davis, the Pacers' 
backup center and power forward. "I've watched Patrick Ewing through his 
college years and the pros. He's a great scorer and is tough to defend. You 
never think you're going to see him score just one point." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was humbled but not distraught. And certainly, he noted, not 
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pay me to be the hero and they pay me to be the goat," he said. "I guess 
I was the goat today. There will always be days like this." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that for Ewing, they tend to come once every couple of decades. The 
last time he was limited to one point, he recalled, was in his first high 
school game in Massachusetts, where he was coached by Mike Jarvis, now at 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Postscript: In high school, Ewing redeemed himself the next game, going for 
some huge numbers he doesn't exactly remember. The Pacers will keep that in 
mind heading into Game 4 Monday, when they will either even the series or fall 
into a 3-1 hole heading back to New York.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; STAFFORD ONLY AMERICAN WOMAN LEFT AFTER BITTERSWEET 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shaun Stafford of Gainesville, Fla., is the only U.S. woman left in singles 
competition at the French Open. She reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam 
tournament for the first time Saturday by defeating Ann Grossman of Grove City, 
Ohio, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stafford had mixed emotions afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ann's a really good friend," she said. "For me, to look across the net and 
see Ann. . . . I had to scream to let out the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford, ranked No. 72, and Grossman let their feelings show in a tense third 
set that had five service breaks. Playing in an intimate setting on Court 10, 
away from the showcase stadiums of Roland Garros, Stafford enjoyed her biggest 
moment in six years as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doubles partner, Jill Hetherington, who is close with both players, told 
Stafford to celebrate the accomplishment. But all she could think about was 
Grossman's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned," Stafford said. "She probably hates me." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Tennis Assn. is surely happy with Stafford's effort after No. 
9-seeded Lindsay Davenport became the ninth seeded player to lose. She was 
upset by 24th-ranked Julie Halard, 6-4, 6-2, who became one of three French 
women to reach the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, 17, of Murrieta Valley High, could not control the quick-moving 
Halard and looked flat. "She had me on a string," Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Davenport, Martina Navratilova, Mary Joe Fernandez and Zina 
Garrison-Jackson out, and Jennifer Capriati not playing, the strength of U.S. 
women's tennis rests with Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was staying focused (against Grossman)," Stafford said. "I was 
letting it get away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 She expects to concentrate better against No. 16 Sabine Hack, whom Stafford 
does not count as a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing in straight sets Saturday were No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of 
Spain, No. 3 Conchita Martinez of Spain, No. 7 Natalia Zvereva of Belarus and 
No. 11 Anke Huber of Germany. ELLIOTT ALMOND

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; CHANG ALMOST TURNS BACK THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The magic of Michael Chang momentarily reappeared early Saturday evening on 
the stage where he left tennis fans spellbound in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The former French Open champion nearly overcame a two-set deficit to Jaime 
Yzaga of Peru, but faltered at the finish to lose, 6-2, 6-3, 5-7, 1-6, 7-5, in 
the third round of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9-seeded Todd Martin of Lansing, Mich., joined No. 8 Chang as an upset 
victim at Roland Garros Stadium, losing to Magnus Larsson of Sweden, 6-7 (7-5), 
6-3, 6-0, 1-6, 6-3. Five of the day's eight third-round matches went five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 That left No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia as the lower bracket's only 
remaining seeded player. He advanced to a fourth-round match against Andrea 
Gaudenzi of Italy with a strong comeback of his own, dropping the first two 
sets before defeating Alex Corretja of Spain, 6-7 (7-3), 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "(There's) no respect for seeded players anymore in this sport, so it is more 
(of an) advantage to be not seeded," Ivanisevic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Chang, then 17, enchanted clay-court fans with a gritty 
performance that has come to characterize his game. Despite cramping, he 
returned the ball any way he could to beat Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg in five 
sets each en route to his only Grand Slam tournament victory. He is 16-7 in 
five-set matches and has won six times after losing the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 After dropping only one set in his first two matches here this year, Chang 
came out flat against Yzaga, who had reached the third round here twice. And 
Yzaga looked as if he would win in straight sets when he took a 2-0 lead in the 
third set. 
</P>
<P>
 But not against Chang, not at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking back, Chang saw an opportunity. Between the third and fourth sets, 
Yzaga lost his serve 10 consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in these kinds of situations before, and sometimes I am able to 
get through them," Chang said. "A lot of times, little things can really change 
a match." 
</P>
<P>
 Yzaga was aware of Chang's reputation, and after losing the third set, 
realized this one was going five. "I was saving for the fifth," he said of his 
letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The match tightened when the error-prone opponents raised their games. Their 
shots started hitting the lines, and rallies took longer in a tactical matchup. 
Chang saved three break points to take a 3-2 lead in the fifth set. But Yzaga, 
who reached the fourth round of the 1985 U.S. Open in his first major 
tournament, saved a break point to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Chang faltered at an inopportune time. He lost his serve after his first 
double fault of the day made it 40-40. When Yzaga went ahead, 5-3, Chang was 
asked to perform one more trick. 
</P>
<P>
 He said later he was suffering from a sore back and could not put much on his 
first serve. But the reason for his problem sounded as creative as his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sleeping on soft beds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chang won his serve in four points, then broke Yzaga when the Peruvian 
hit a backhand wide. The scenario could not have been better for Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 All he needed to do was hold his serve to at least force a tiebreaker. But he 
fell behind 0-30, then made a nice forehand half volley and a serve and volley 
to make it 30-30. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next exchange, he raced to his right toward Yzaga's drop volley but 
slipped and crashed headfirst into a stand next to the net judge. He was slow 
in getting up, and had to wipe away the red dirt caked to his legs after he 
did.  
</P>
<P>
 Chang lost the next point, and the opportunity slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Yzaga was in fine shape. Serving for the match for the second time, he 
reached his first match point at 40-30, after 4 hours 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang handled his serve, but Yzaga kept him off balance during the rally. When 
he hit a powerful backhand deep down the line, Chang was late reaching it. He 
mis-hit the ball, which sailed two feet wide and almost through the 
outstretched hands of Yzaga, who was already celebrating.

KLOPAS SCORES FOR 'HOME' FANS; SOCCER: GREEK-BORN STRIKER SCORES U.S. GOAL IN 
1-1 TIE WITH GREECE BEFORE PARTISAN CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the 21,317 soccer fans who went to the Yale Bowl Saturday, at least half 
were Greek. They were easy to identify not only because they were wearing the 
colors of the Greek flag -- blue and white -- but also because they were the 
ones making all the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as Greece's coach, Alkis Panagoulias, appreciated the support from 
the stands, he could have done with one fewer Greek on the field. "He can't do 
that," Panagoulias said after the United States' Frank Klopas scored his team's 
only goal in a 1-1 tie. "How can he score against Greece?" 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if Klopas can score against anyone, having done so seven times in 
his last eight games, but this one was particularly important for the striker 
who was born in Greece and plays professionally there.  
</P>
<P>
 His left-footed shot from 15 yards out in the final minute of the first half 
from a nifty crossing pass from Paul Caligiuri beat Klopas' teammate with AEK 
Athens, goalkeeper Ilias Atmatzidis. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the game, the Greek players were joking, 'OK, you're going to be back 
in Greece now,' " said Klopas, who feared he might not be asked to return after 
sitting out part of last season because of an injury. "They said, 'You've got a 
big contract to sign.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A more immediate goal for Klopas is to earn a berth on the United States' 
final 22-man roster, which will be announced Thursday. But not only does it 
appear that he has a lock on that, he might even be a starter when the United 
States opens World Cup play on June 18 against Switzerland.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the team's other striker, Ernie Stewart, is more mobile, it will be 
difficult for U.S. coaches to leave a hot scorer on the bench. Of 10 U.S. goals 
since April 20, Klopas has scored five, including four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece, also a World Cup qualifier, came back to tie in the fourth minute of 
the second half on a superb shot from 18 yards out by Minas Chatzidis. But 
afterward, the U.S. players said the result was as good as a victory for them, 
especially after playing the final 20 minutes with only 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when sweeper Marcelo Balboa was ordered off the field with a red card 
after a tackle that referee Benito Archundia of Mexico thought was overly 
aggressive. As a result, Balboa has to sit out the United States' final 
pre-World Cup exhibition -- next Saturday at the Rose Bowl against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering its 4-5-8 record in full international games since the beginning 
of the year, the United States is about as optimistic as possible at this 
point. With the integration of some of the foreign-based players into the 
offense, most notably Tab Ramos from Spain, Eric Wynalda from Germany, Roy 
Wegerle from England and Stewart from the Netherlands, the team has developed a 
more positive attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda weaved through three defenders on an outstanding 30-yard run in the 
second half Saturday. Even though his shot was just off the mark, it was easily 
the play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's weakness remains in the defense, but the midfielders and forwards 
made more of an effort to help the defenders than they did in last Wednesday's 
scoreless draw with Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bora Milutinovic continued to insist that none of the games are 
significant until the United States plays Switzerland. But he did allow himself 
a smile in reference to the one-sided crowd. "It was a good result," he said, 
"for playing in Greece."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS ARE COOKING AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians have been able to call Jacobs Field home for only 18 
games now, but it has already become an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Clark pitched his third complete game in his last four starts Saturday as 
the Indians beat the Oakland Athletics, 4-2, for their eighth consecutive home 
victory. It's the first time Cleveland has won eight in a row at home since 
1982. The current streak was interrupted by a 2-4 trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll just stay at home and not go on road trips," said Clark, who is 
4-0 with a 2.70 earned-run average at Jacobs Field, compared with 1-1 and 7.32 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's lost for the 30th time in their last 36 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Baerga homered and Paul Sorrento, Kenny Lofton and Alvaro Espinoza also 
drove in runs for Cleveland, and Clark blanked the A's on three hits until the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Baltimore 2 -- Frank Thomas homered for the fourth consecutive game 
to help the White Sox win their seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, batting .466 in May, hit his 19th homer and Julio Franco drove in 
three runs as the White Sox won for the 10th time in 11 games before 43,589, 
the largest crowd in four seasons at the new Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere (6-1) gave up three hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings in besting 
Baltimore's Ben McDonald (8-3), who gave up three runs and four hits in 2 2/3 
innings -- his shortest outing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Seattle 5 -- B.J. Surhoff drove in three runs and Ricky Bones 
snapped a month-long losing skid for the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 22nd homer in the ninth inning for Seattle, which lost 
for the 19th time in 24 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones (4-4), who last won on April 24 against Kansas City, gave up six hits in 
eight-plus innings. He retired 11 batters in a row during one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 3, Texas 2 -- Carlos Rodriguez doubled home the go-ahead run in the 
10th inning as the Red Sox won at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston, held hitless by former Red Sox Bruce Hurst until Mo Vaughn homered 
with one out in the sixth inning, tied it in the ninth on Mike Greenwell's 
double off Rick Honeycutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper led off the 10th with a single against Cris Carpenter (2-2). Cooper 
moved to second on Dave Valle's sacrifice bunt and scored when Rodriguez 
doubled down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst, trying for his first major league victory since 1992, allowed one run 
and two hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Kansas City 3 -- Three pitches after accidentally hitting plate 
umpire Dave Phillips with his bat and causing a concussion, Jim Leyritz hit a 
home run in the 10th inning to give the Yankees a victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Daryl Boston's two-run homer against Royal closer Jeff Montgomery 
(0-2) tied it in the ninth. The Yankees won their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyritz hit Phillips in the head with his backswing, and the umpire sustained 
a mild concussion and bruised left temple. He left the game but is expected to 
be ready to work today. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Hernandez (3-2) got the victory. Steve Howe pitched the ninth for his 
fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 10, Detroit 9 -- Rookie Steve Dunn's two-out RBI double in the 10th 
inning at Minneapolis gave the Twins a victory over the Tigers, who got two 
homers from Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, celebrating his 37th birthday, homered in the seventh and ninth 
innings for Detroit, which rallied from an 8-2 deficit to take the lead before 
the Twins tied it at, 9-9, in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Dunn drove a Mike Henneman (1-1) pitch into right field to score 
Dave Winfield.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / NCAA REGIONALS; TROJANS NEED TWO VICTORIES AT LSU TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC survived to see another day in the NCAA South Regional at Baton Rouge, 
La., but the Trojans' road to their first College World Series berth since 1978 
includes a major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 USC lost to defending national champion Louisiana State, 6-2, Saturday then 
came back in the evening and put together a 13-run first inning en route to a 
25-9 victory over North Carolina Greesnboro.The Trojans must defeat LSU twice 
on its home field today to advance to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very do-able," said USC outfielder Geoff Jenkins, who hit home runs in 
both games Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is hoping for a role reversal against LSU, which defeated the Trojans 
twice on the final day of a 1990 regional at Alex Box Stadium to earn a trip to 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU sophomore right-hander Brett Laxton (4-4) gave up two runs and six hits 
and struck out three in 8 1/3 innings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games involving Southland teams, Cal State Fullerton right-hander 
Mike Parisi (11-3) gave up one run in 7 2/3 innings as the Titans defeated 
Texas Christian, 4-1, in the second round of the Midwest I Regional at 
Stillwater, Okla. Tonight, Fullerton will play the winner of an elimination 
game between TCU and Oklahoma State. A Fullerton victory would put the Titans 
one victory away from their second World Series appearance in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State stayed alive in the Midwest II Regional at Wichita, Kan., 
with a 16-9 victory over Connecticut. Long Beach will play an elimination game 
today against Santa Clara, an 11-7 loser to Washington Saturday. If the 49ers 
win, they will play tonight against the loser of today's game between Georgia 
Tech and Washington.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; AFTER LOSING TWICE, MARLINS BEAT GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins had two big losses Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 They also had a victory, 3-2 at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Gary Sheffield and Bryan Harvey, fresh off the disabled list, broke 
down again. Sheffield is already back on the list, and Harvey might soon join 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, who had been sidelined a month because of a strained elbow, warmed up 
in the bullpen after Chuck Carr's ninth-inning RBI single gave the Marlins a 
3-2 lead. But Jeremy Hernandez (3-3) stayed in for the bottom of the ninth and 
closed out the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harvey didn't feel good warming up, so we shut him down," Florida Manager 
Rene Lachemann said. "He would have been our guy. It was a save situation. He 
got loosened up, but the tightness (in the elbow) is still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann met with his coaches for almost an hour after the game before 
emerging to discuss Harvey's status, which remains uncertain overnight. 
Sheffield's is less uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old thing," said Sheffield, who re-injured his left shoulder 
while trying to make a diving catch in right field Friday night. "This morning, 
I really felt it. Seems like we need to give it more time. They don't want to 
rush it this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants left five runners on base in the seventh and eighth innings without 
scoring, and their record went to 0-6 when tied after seven innings, 1-7 when 
tied after eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 3, Montreal 2 -- Joe Girardi singled home the go-ahead run with two 
out in the 10th inning as the Rockies took advantage of three errors by the 
Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Bichette led off the 10th with a single against Tim Scott (1-2) and 
Charlie Hayes also singled. Bichette moved to third base on a fly ball and 
scored on Girardi's single against Jeff Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ruffin (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory. Former Expo 
pitcher Kent Bottenfield got three outs for his first save of the season, the 
second of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Cincinnati 4 -- Bobby Bonilla homered and doubled twice at New 
York, where the Mets sent the Reds to their seventh loss in eight games. 
Bonilla tied a team record by driving in a run in his eighth consecutive game 
and has hit in 10 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Thompson homered and drove in three runs for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Maddux (1-0) shut out Cincinnati on two hits in 3 1/3 innings of relief. 
John Franco worked the ninth inning for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smiley (4-6) gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings for the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Philadelphia 5 -- Luis Gonzalez's sacrifice fly scored the go-ahead 
run in the seventh inning as the Astros used three relievers, but not Mitch 
Williams, at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who nearly blew Friday night's game by walking and hitting a batter 
in the ninth inning, warmed up but didn't get the call as Houston Manager Terry 
Collins went to his bullpen three times in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, returning to Philadelphia this weekend for the first time since 
being traded to the Astros in December, said Friday he expected to be released 
and hinted retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's long fly ball to center scored Jeff Bagwell, who had greeted 
reliever Andy Carter (0-2) with a double and moved to third on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Williams (1-2) got the victory, despite giving up five runs and 10 hits 
in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, Atlanta 2 -- Anthony Young (3-3) gave up one run and five hits in 
six innings against the Braves at Atlanta. The last time he faced them, on 
April 15, they scored eight runs and had eight hits in 1 1/3 innings against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last five starts, Young is 3-1 with a 2.31 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Mercker (3-1) lost for the first time since last July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 4, St. Louis 0 -- Wally Whitehurst combined with two relievers on a 
six-hit shutout and Bip Roberts tripled in two runs for the Padres at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst (4-5) went five innings for the victory before being lifted for a 
pinch-hitter because of tenderness in his pitching elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres have won five of their last seven. The Cardinals have lost eight in 
a row in San Diego.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Wayne Black of USC and Mark Merklein of Florida advanced to the 
NCAA men's tennis singles finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, the No. 1 player in the country, eliminated Joakim Appelqvist of 
Mississippi, 6-4, 6-4, and Merklein defeated No. 2-seeded Marcus Hilpert of 
Arkansas, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Black will also be in the doubles final today as he and Jon Leach beat Andy

Mahony and Pablo Montana of Tennessee, 6-3, 7-5 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Merklein (37-5) beat Black (30-4), when they first met in February in the 
National Indoor Championship at Louisville, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Merklein, the No. 4 national singles player, started strongly against Hilpert, 
going up 4-0 in the first set. "If I play the way I did today, I have a good 
shot at the title," Merklein said.

PUBLICATIONS; AFTER 50 YEARS, 'PAT THE BUNNY' STILL TOUCHSTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a lot of new parents, the first sign of intelligent life comes when the 
baby -- heretofore a drooling blob -- lifts its teeny-weeny finger and lightly 
touches a furry bunny. (As in: "Judy can pat the bunny. Now you pat the 
bunny.") 
</P>
<P>
 Yesssssss! Mom and Dad quietly cheer. Little Precious can do something other 
than eat, poop and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Little Precious doesn't? More than a few parents have panicked 
after their 10th suggestion to "Pat the damn bunny!" goes unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too early to hire a tutor for bunny patting? 
</P>
<P>
 This may seem neurotic, but this isn't just any book. After more than 50 years 
in print, "Pat the Bunny" continues to be an important development touchstone, 
so to speak, that babies are people too. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole generations have cooed as they imitated characters Paul and Judy lifting 
a piece of blue cloth in a game of peekaboo, peering into a miniature mirror, 
touching Daddy's scratchy beard (actually a piece of sandpaper) and putting a 
finger through Mommy's (cardboard) ring.  
</P>
<P>
 With 200,024 copies sold last year, "Pat the Bunny" remains a best seller -- 
second only in all-time sales to "The Tale of Peter Rabbit." Which may have 
philosophers pondering: What's with rabbits? But really, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
 According to a press release from Golden Books, which publishes the perennial 
"Pat," 2,266 yards of white acrylic fur for the bunny -- enough fur to coat and 
warm about 1 1/4 miles of the Alaskan landscape -- is used every year in "Pat 
the Bunny" books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat the Bunny" has been such a huge success that it has inspired not only 
imitators but a whole "pat" genre of touch-and-feel books. 
</P>
<P>
 The style has been so enduringly popular that '90s publicists have been know 
to refer to the late Dorothy Kunhardt, author of "Pat the Bunny," as the 
originator of the "interactive children's book." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunhardt, who died in 1979, certainly would have gotten a laugh out of that 
one, says her daughter, Edith Kunhardt, author of "Pat the Cat," "Pat the 
Puppy" and 60 other non-pat children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genius of 'Pat the Bunny' is that it allows babies to do what they are 
just discovering they can do -- touch, smell, look," says Kunhardt, 57. "I'm 
not sure it's any more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Kunhardt began writing children's books to support her family after 
her husband lost his job during the Depression. Her first big hit was 1934's 
"Junket Is Nice," with crazy drawings of people guessing what an old man was 
eating out of a bowl. It sold a million copies in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, Kunhardt wrote a book for her baby Edith, the youngest of four 
children. She took paper and pencils and drew the simple figures of Paul and 
Judy and the itinerant bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first edition, Judy could make her doll's ball squeak; in the second 
edition, Judy could shake Mommy's button box ("Rattle rattle go the buttons"). 
By the third edition, the squeaker and the buttons were gone and the mirror and 
flowers had appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, Edith Kunhardt, who grew up 
in New Jersey, talked about the enormous effort her mother put into 
researching, drawing and writing her books. In particular, she recalled the 
research for a now out-of-print book, "Billy the Barber." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember she went visiting a barber school where students were learning by 
shaving balloons," Kunhardt says. "If the balloon popped, they failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunhardt had no intention of becoming an author herself -- although she was 
married until 1971 to the son of Lavina Davis, a well-known children's book 
writer and author of "Hobbyhorse Hill." After her divorce, Kunhardt worked as 
an editor at Golden Books.  
</P>
<P>
 "I considered Mother the writer," she says. "I was the editor." 
</P>
<P>
 But after her mother died, Kunhardt took up the craft and her mother's passion 
for research. She tells delightful stories of getting up at 3 a.m. to follow a 
milkman on his route and of spending time with a family living on a Long Island 
farm for "I Want to Be a Farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 After writing 20 books for different publishers, Golden Books approached her 
in 1984 to write a sequel to "Pat the Bunny." At first, she resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt 'Pat the Bunny' should stand on its own," she says. "But then I came 
to feel that there was a reason to publish a companion. It would enhance rather 
than compete if it was by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had never illustrated a book, she decided to give it a try for 
her mother's legacy. In fact, Martha and Neddy of "Pat the Cat," who do such 
modern things as go to the ATM with their parents and scratch and sniff ginger 
snaps, look like urbane cousins of Paul and Judy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Kunhardt wrote "Pat the Puppy," which is not only updated, it's 
downright politically proper: Grandpa makes brownies; Grandma jogs, and Tom and 
Sarah are invited to help Grandma unfasten her Velcro sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do that to be politically correct," Kunhardt says. "But I also 
didn't want Grandma to be baking brownies." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of displaying expensive coffee-table books in her living room, 
Kunhardt has artfully laid out all her "Pat" books, as well as a hardback about 
Abe Lincoln, a Kunhardt obsession. Kunhardt's grandfather owned one of the 
largest collections of Lincoln photographs; her mother was a Lincoln scholar. 
Her brother Philip, a former managing editor of Life magazine, wrote a 
television series with his son about the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, following the death of her son, Neddy (he died of a bacterial 
infection at age 27), Edith Kunhardt briefly put aside her career in children's 
literature. Although she admits that her best tribute to her son was naming one 
of the characters "Neddy" in "Pat the Cat," she is also writing an 
inspirational book about his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since writing "Pat the Puppy" last year, Kunhardt doesn't rule out taking the 
"Pat" legacy into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing she does rule out -- vehemently -- is the notion that the popularity 
of her mother's classic has nothing to do with its compelling story line or 
appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so many copies are sold because families buy multiple copies? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few facts "Pat the Bunny" publicists don't supply is the average 
number of copies owned by the average family or, better yet, the statistical 
evidence of what is destroyed first: the peekaboo flap or Judy's book, as in: 
"Judy can read her book. Now you read Judy's book." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that people buy two or three copies," Kunhardt says. "I don't like 
to think of people pulling them apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps. But Little Precious isn't quite "people" just yet.

THOUSANDS SEEK U.S. CITIZENSHIP TO SOOTHE FEARS; SCHOOLS: FOREIGN-BORN 
RESIDENTS, FEELING THREATENED BY ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT, ARE STUDYING TO 
BECOME AMERICANS. A RECORD 5,200 STUDENTS HAVE ENROLLED IN L.A. DISTRICT.

<P>
 Leonel Martinez wants to become a U.S. citizen, but he's doing it out of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who came from El Salvador and got his green card in 1974, grew 
concerned after hearing politicians blame California's economic woes on illegal 
immigrants and propose restrictions in benefits for non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, it was safe to be a (permanent) resident," said the 46-year-old 
father of six. "But not now, because anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is one of the record 5,200 students who have enrolled this year in 
U.S. citizenship classes offered by the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
27 adult schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, political analysts and community activists say 
anti-immigrant sentiment is helping to propel the staggering increase in 
attendance at the citizenship classes, which averaged only 300 students 
annually from 1990 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't anticipate that amount" of enrollment, said Domingo Rodriguez, 
coordinator of the district's adult citizenship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors are also contributing to the dramatic increase, officials say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increased citizenship awareness efforts by community action groups and the 
media began earlier this year. The district itself began a campaign in January 
that advertised not only citizenship classes, but also additional services such 
as fingerprinting and photo IDs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new $70 fee was imposed to renew green cards every 10 years. It only costs 
$90 to apply for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recent eligibility for U.S. naturalization among those who became legal 
residents through the 1986 Amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials and political analysts say the huge increase far exceeds 
what they were expecting from the amnesty program, which made those immigrants 
eligible for citizenship as early as last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total district enrollment, for example, 65% are non-amnesty, longtime 
California residents. And fear over immigrant bashing and a desire to gain a 
voice in American political affairs appear to be the primary reasons for 
enrolling in the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they're legal and they're permanent residents and they can own 
property, they're still affected. They feel insecure," Rodriguez said. "The 
rhetoric is against illegals , but they still hear immigrant ." 
</P>
<P>
 When most students discuss anti-immigrant sentiment, they usually identify it 
with Gov. Pete Wilson's remarks about undocumented immigrants, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's blaming us for everything that's going on here," said Martinez. "I don't 
understand why he's focusing on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Martinez, Maria P. Moy is a longtime Los Angeles resident who is 
attending citizenship classes. Moy came from Mexico in 1969 and got her green 
card nine years later. But she never considered applying for citizenship until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not feel safe," said Moy, a widow with three children. "It's true that 
laws change day by day. . . . I think if I become a citizen, I'm going to feel 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 David Ayon, professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University, 
considers the fear factor part of an overall drive by Mexican Americans and 
other Latinos to protect their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are responding to the sense of being under fire," said Ayon, who 
also teaches Chicano studies. "There's a feeling of vulnerability there." 
</P>
<P>
 Citizenship has "always involved empowerment," Ayon said. "I really don't know 
if there's any increasing sense of love of country in the old-fashioned way." 
</P>
<P>
 So "there's a sense of concern on one hand, there's a sense of opportunity on 
the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, just want to integrate into American society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I'm Hispanic, I do not believe in holding hands with the Spanish 
people and say I have power," said Maria Monroy, 55, of Los Angeles, a 
citizenship student who immigrated from Colombia in 1963. "I don't want the 
Hispanic people to have the power because there will be a division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had all the advantages," she said. "I don't feel shortchanged." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Latinos are not the only ethnic minorities who have felt 
threatened by negative remarks about immigrants or proposed legislation that 
would affect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian immigrants are responding in droves, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asian immigrants who have come to our workshops have increased because 
they have learned that elected officials are proposing in Washington to cut off 
Social Security benefits," said Edmund Anciano, who runs the U.S. Citizenship 
Project for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including many Korean immigrants, are seeking citizenship primarily 
because they want to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the leaders in their community realize that they were basically 
voiceless when it came to speaking out about their concerns after the riots," 
Anciano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is trying to gain that voice by attending a citizenship class at 
Belmont Community Adult School near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, I'm afraid they'll take away the permit to work and live here 
-- the way that things are going," said Martinez, a truck driver. "I want to 
have the right to vote . . . and hopefully to be treated equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont school offers seven classes for more than 500 students -- the highest 
enrollment among the 27 adult schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park-Bell ranks second in district enrollment at just under 500, 
followed by Roosevelt-Bilingual at 441 and Van Nuys at 347, said Rodriguez, 
district citizenship coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the high number of students, most schools -- like 
Venice-Hamilton Community Adult School in West Los Angeles -- have had to open 
new citizenship classes and hire additional teachers, he said. Funding in part 
comes from monies not used for English as a Second Language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Belmont's case, the school had to keep more than 100 people on a 
waiting list while administrators try to find teachers for them, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most classes at Belmont are held on Saturday mornings. Students pay a $5 
registration fee and the cost of their books, although other adult schools 
offer courses for free. They mainly sharpen their English skills in the 
classroom and study American history and government to prepare for their 
citizenship tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth has caused excitement even among some of the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago when I started, I had 72 students and at that time, I didn't 
have any who wanted to become a citizen," said Alex Alexander, one of the 
Belmont teachers. "It took a while to even get three or four who had made the 
decision to actually become a citizen."

BACKERS PRAISE BAN ON DAY LABORERS; JOBS: LADERA HEIGHTS RESIDENTS WHO FIRST 
SOUGHT THE MEASURE EXPRESS SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION THAT THE COUNTY ADOPTED IT 
DESPITE PROTESTS BY THE ACLU AND OTHERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ronnie Cooper could barely contain her jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 "By God, she (County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke) did it!" exclaimed 
Cooper, president of the Ladera Civic Assn. and one of the primary supporters 
of a county law adopted Tuesday that bans laborers from curbside solicitation 
of jobs in unincorporated areas of the county. "She's taken a lot of stuff. . . 
. People can say whatever they want, but politicians are supposed to represent 
the community. And she represented us." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and many other Ladera Heights homeowners reveled in their victory last 
week after the County Board of Supervisors voted for a law that residents had 
sought for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was essentially the same measure proposed last month by Burke at 
the prompting of Ladera Heights homeowners, who had complained for years about 
traffic and other problems they said the laborers caused. But that measure was 
temporarily scaled down after the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant 
rights groups loudly protested that the law violated the laborers' 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption of the new ordinance followed a state appellate court ruling two 
weeks ago upholding a similar law restricting day laborers in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hellwig, a 24-year Ladera Heights resident, said laborers crossed a line 
when they began urinating and defecating on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against anybody seeking work, but there has been a bit of a problem," 
he said. "People felt uneasy about passing by them." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance takes effect in July and makes curbside job-seeking a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shocking that it passed," said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the 
ACLU of Southern California. "It's another one of those attempts by government 
to pander to the public to make people think they're really doing something 
about a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, whose district includes Ladera Heights, said that the strong opinions 
voiced for several years by her constituents left her no choice but to vote for 
the measure. She added that her office worked hard to find a hiring work site 
as part of a compromise between homeowners and laborers, but none could be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply could not find (a site)," she said. "We'd still like to find one. 
But the bottom line is the community doesn't want the day laborers negatively 
impacting the area. They and their kids want to able to come and go 
peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro Maldonado, director of the Pro-Immigrant Mobilization Coalition, said 
that the ordinance capitalizes on anti-immigrant sentiment and unfairly targets 
poor Latinos who simply need jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very, very devastating," said Maldonado, whose group picketed against 
Burke's original ordinance last month in front of her field office. "It's 
criminalizing people who need work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some area residents sided with Maldonado or expressed sympathy for the plight 
of the day laborers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about human beings here," said Faz Elahi, president of South 
Ladera Neighbors. "There's nowhere for them to go, nothing for them to do. A 
law is fine, but this law is not consistent with reality. It's not really going 
to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Anderson, a 10-year resident of Mosley Avenue, said he understands 
homeowners' frustration but believes the larger issue of civil rights 
supersedes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad behavior of one guy magnifies everybody in a negative way," he said. 
"I may have seen one of (the laborers) with a beer bottle, but that's it. I 
really don't think they're interested in making nuisances of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said she is confident that most residents will help enforce the new law 
by promptly calling sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is preserve and maintain our community and not have a bunch 
of outsiders who don't pay taxes come in and take advantage. We just wanted 
them to not be there."

DEADLINE FOR MAGNET SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has extended the deadline for 
applications to its expanded magnet school program to Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board expanded the program May 2 to help alleviate long waiting 
lists and to offer a wider choice of schools.The move is expected to create 24 
new magnet centers and will accommodate nearly 8,000 more students, said 
district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who applied before the original deadline of April 15 but who wish to 
be considered for the new locations must reapply, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the district received more than 40,000 applications. The program 
has 9,500 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in the late 1970s in response to pressure to desegregate the district, 
magnet classes specialize in particular subjects, are smaller and tend to 
produce higher test scores, officials said. The program now has 108 centers and 
schools, and serves nearly 37,000 students.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; EX-BUFFALO SOLDIERS GIVE HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They are a part of history that Charles Johnson has never read about in any 
textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Johnson and 100 other students at Dorsey High School got a 
firsthand account of what it was like to belong to a black cavalry unit that 
served in a segregated army.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the stuff they're telling us we don't really know," said Johnson, a 
junior. "At first I thought the Buffalo Soldiers were from the Civil War maybe, 
but I didn't know much about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at attention, John Tull, Franklin Henderson and Frederick Jones 
shared their memories during a two-hour assembly of serving in North Africa, 
Korea and patrolling the Western states.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are finally recognizing the omission of many different 
cultures' history," said Henderson, who is president of the Buffalo Soldiers 
national association. 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1866, the Buffalo Soldiers helped patrol the West on horseback. 
They later served in World War II and several other conflicts. More recently, 
the men of the all-black cavalry unit were honored by the Postal Service with a 
stamp and by the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Tull, who joined the Buffalo Soldiers after graduating from college, said he 
was drawn to the military because of the lack of jobs for African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at all the guys who had gone to school with me and they were 
carrying mail bags or working as janitors. I said I would do better than that 
and I joined the army because my grandmother, who was a slave, said, 'You've 
got to get into the cavalry,' " Tull, 75, told students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army disbanded the Buffalo Soldiers in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sabrina Jackson, 17, the oral histories proved to be a lesson she won't 
soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (teen-agers) hear so much about slavery and the downfall of blacks rather 
than the positive side of what we've achieved. This is long overdue," Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With hands waving in the air, students strained to ask questions that evoked 
painful memories of loss, isolation and conflict.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers "would go around to bars and tell the owners not to serve blacks," 
said Jones, 73, as he described his service in North Africa. "Segregation 
seemed to follow us wherever we went." 
</P>
<P>
 James Berger, a history teacher at Dorsey, arranged for the veterans to visit 
the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is get students to talk to people, whether it be to 
their parents or their grandparents about their history," said Berger. SANDRA

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: BALDWIN HILLS; DON'T RELY ON POLICE, ACTIVIST TELLS 
GROUP

<P>
 The voice was a tad hoarser than usual, but the controversial views of 
community activist Celes King III were at full strength during his first public 
appearance since being sidelined by a mugging five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old bail bondsman addressed about 50 members of the Consolidated 
Realty Board in Baldwin Hills at a breakfast meeting Wednesday sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic was fitting -- urban violence and what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 King, a staunch Republican and brigadier general with the California military 
reserve, has not softened his tough views on solving South Los Angeles' crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He proclaimed the right of individuals to bear arms to protect themselves, 
though his assailant disarmed him. "I'm in the process of getting another (gun) 
right now," said King, who years ago sued former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
and other city officials to obtain a concealed-weapon permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals are winning the war against Los Angeles citizenry, King warned. 
Instead of depending on police, he said, businesses and homeowners should hire 
private security, install burglar alarms and take other anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to begin to spend the bucks in the private sector," he said. "Willie 
Williams is a great police chief, but we've sent him to do war with a cap 
pistol."  
</P>
<P>
 King was kidnaped, robbed and assaulted before dawn April 21 near his Country 
Club Park residence in the Mid-City area. An assailant beat King and stole an 
undetermined amount of cash before dropping him off on Ardmore Avenue in 
Koreatown. King sustained a concussion, broken bones in his right hand and 
puncture wounds during the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you wonder why I speak so radically, it's because I was so recently a 
victim," he said. "Our criminal justice system no longer protects us. And I 
know from personal experience it's going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the audience was mostly supportive of King, some took issue with his 
views. Consolidated Realty Board member Marvin Jackson suggested that King 
focus more on the root causes of crime such as poverty and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've invested much of my life in looking at those root causes," replied King, 
who co-founded the city's Human Relations Commission and chairs the state 
Congress on Racial Equality. "And I don't know if we're moving in the right 
direction now." ERIN J. AUBRY

 The dance was a crazy quilt of ethnic influences -- a Swedish traditional 
number fashioned into a stylized gang confrontation and performed by black and 
Latino students -- but the audience's enthusiastic approval knew no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 300 students that convened at Audubon Middle School likewise 
were enthralled by a dance troupe that featured black, white, Asian and Latino 
girls. Wrapped head to ankle in colorful kente cloth, they moved in perfect 
sync to the beat of Nigerian drums and the wild applause of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances symbolized the spirit of "Hands Across the District," an 
annual event at Audubon that brings together students from different schools 
and ethnic backgrounds whose paths ordinarily do not cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Through cultural performances, presentations and discussion groups, Audubon 
Assistant Principal David Balok said, the event seeks to forge better relations 
among students and dispel racial myths that too often keep them apart. Last 
week's event brought together students from Audubon in Leimert Park, the Los 
Angeles Center for Enriched Studies in the Fairfax district and the 32nd Street 
Magnet School in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not nearly enough effort goes into improving human relations among students," 
said Sharon Curson, a teacher from 32nd Street. "People talk about it, but no 
one does anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Audubon English teacher Evaline Kruse started the event in 1976, the year the 
United States celebrated its bicentennial. Together with her magnet classes, 
Kruse put together a program she thought best reflected the American melting 
pot ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always emphasized that we were American-Lebanese, not the other way 
around," said Kruse, who was born in Biloxi, Miss. "He was very pro-American, 
whatever people's race." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to musical performances and a talent show, this year's "Hands" 
featured writer and KCET television host Ruben Martinez speaking on the 
critical need for racial interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, diversity isn't easy," he told the audience. "It's a lot of hard work. 
But you can't have a democracy if the freedom of even one person is 
compromised. So we have to make it work. We have to learn to talk to our 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Students spent their lunch hour huddled in discussion groups on the stage and 
auditorium floor. Icebreaker questions that a student moderator gave to each 
group -- What would you change in the world? What do you consider a positive 
statement? -- were slow to generate conversation. But the students, who started 
off the day as strangers, soon warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Audubon student Esther Lee, 13, talked passionately about media-driven 
misconceptions about South-Central that make people steer clear of blacks and 
Latinos. "I have a lot of friends who are black, and people say I'm 
'blackwashed,' " said Lee, who is of Korean descent. "That's not right. The 
truth is, we're all mixed up in this society." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNTIY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; PRESERVING HISTORY RUNS IN THE FAMILY 
</P>

<P>
 The Grier Musser Museum, sitting in a crowded block of Bonnie Brae Street, 
offers a glimpse into the city's past in a neighborhood where residents work 
for a better future while battling contemporary urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is a 13-room house built in 1898 in the Queen Anne-style of 
Victorian architecture for a man named Jonathan Hill at a cost of $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership of the house changed hands a few times after Hill, identified in 
records only as "a man of independent means," sold it sometime after 1900; at 
one point it was a doctor's home and later a rooming house. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Dr. Anna Krieger and her daughters, Nancy Krieger and Susan Tejada, 
purchased the jade-green house and turned it into a museum in honor of Dr. 
Krieger's mother, Anna Grier Musser, an antiques dealer and collector of 
knickknacks from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Grier Musser's hobby passed from one generation to the next and the family now 
has thousands of heirlooms and collectibles, including 19th-Century dolls, 
games, trinkets and clothing gleaned from yard sales and auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 A fascination with history and an impulse to share it with others proved 
impetus enough for the family to establish the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done this for our own enjoyment but also to show people what a house in 
this neighborhood might have looked like around the turn of the century," 
Tejada said.  
</P>
<P>
 Few houses from that era remain in the neighborhood, and the museum is 
overshadowed by large apartment buildings on the block.  
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood changed in other ways too. For example, drug dealers and 
their customers have used the corner of Third Street and Bonnie Brae Street to 
do business. But a recent police sweep that netted dozens of suspects and the 
creation of a three-block no-parking zone in front of the museum on Bonnie Brae 
Street have reduced the level of visible criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the museum also hosted meetings of the neighborhood group More 
Advocates for Safer Homes (MASH), which works with police officers assigned to 
the area and sponsors regular trash and graffiti cleanups as part of a campaign 
to improve the neighborhood. Although MASH now meets at a larger site, Tejada, 
who lives near Koreatown, still attends the meetings and lends a hand during 
cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outside world never intrudes on the museum. "It's really quiet 
inside," Tejada said. "It's like a whole other world." 
</P>
<P>
 Every inch of the two-story house contains its own treasures: antique 
furniture, cupboards of blue and white willowware, ostrich-feather fans, music 
boxes, life-size dolls in Victorian clothing, stained-glass windows above the 
stairway, chandeliers, a spinning wheel and a wood-burning kitchen stove. 
</P>
<P>
 Special exhibits throughout the house alternate monthly and feature items to 
commemorate holidays such as Valentine's Day or Mother's Day. Some months 
there's even room for more contemporary collectibles by which to remember 
luminaries ranging from President Kennedy to Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturdays, Tejada's uncle, John Krieger, presents a 15-minute show 
featuring postcards of Los Angeles in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of older ladies who used to live in the neighborhood come by 
and they say (the museum) brings back a lot of nice memories," Tejada said. 
"We're just doing it to have fun. That's the whole purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the city designated the house at 403 Bonnie Brae St. a 
historic-cultural monument. It is open Wednesday through Friday from noon to 4 
p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. There is a $5 admission fee for 
adults, $3 for senior citizens and students. There is a small parking lot. Call 
before visiting.

COMMUNTIY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; SURVEY: MINORS CAN EASILY BUY CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A survey conducted by teen-agers of 519 Los Angeles County stores found that 
60% illegally sell cigarettes to minors, including 83% of the 18 stores 
surveyed in Pico-Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, coordinated by the Los Angeles Regional Tobacco Control Community 
Linkage Project, involved 118 youths ages 14 to 17 who tried to buy cigarettes 
at supermarkets, gas stations, and grocery, liquor and convenience stores.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the youths actually purchased any cigarettes; if a clerk agreed to 
make a sale, the minors said they had insufficient money and left the store. 
But adult members of the survey team watched surreptitiously and recorded the 
successful attempted buys as sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, it is illegal to sell cigarettes to under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 12 communities surveyed, sales to minors ranged from a low of 36% in 
Silver Lake to a high of 83% in Pico-Union, where minors made successful 
attempted buys at 15 of 18 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In Echo Park and South-Central, minors were able to buy cigarettes at 60% of 
the stores surveyed, compared with 43% in the Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in October, states failing to enforce tobacco sales laws risk losing 
federal block grants; for California the loss could be as much as $140 million 
over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill before the state Senate would boost California's enforcement measures 
and introduce stiffer penalties for offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths who participated in the survey said they plan to produce public service 
announcements, distribute stickers spelling out sales laws and host awareness 
meetings for merchants as part of a campaign to reduce cigarette sales to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of peer pressure and pressure from the media to smoke, and a 
lot of people think it's cool," said Luigi Rao, 14. "At some stores they ask 
you your age but mostly they just want to make money." At seven of the 10 
stores Rao visited, clerks were willing to sell him cigarettes. JAKE DOHERTY

 A Koreatown boy whose mother was injured by a drunk motorcyclist has won first 
place in a national poster and essay contest sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD). 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Suh, who attends Sepulveda Gifted Magnet High School, was one of seven 
contest winners selected from 80,000 students who entered.The 13-year-old 
seventh-grader, who won the grades 7-9 poster division, received a $1,000 
savings bond, a plaque and a trip to Dallas-Fort Worth for his winning poster, 
"My Future Is in Your Hands: Don't Drink and Drive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to use my artistic talent for a good purpose," said Eugene, whose 
mother has since recovered from her injuries in the Pasadena accident 18 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In his poster, Eugene used charcoal and pastels to draw an alcohol bottle. 
Inside the bottle, he drew a college student holding a diploma, a nurse holding 
a baby and a Boy Scout. "I was riding a train when I thought about the design," 
Eugene said. "We were entering a tunnel, so I included that in my drawing." 
</P>
<P>
 MADD created the contest in 1984 to educate young people about the dangers of 
drinking and driving. This year, 7-Eleven sponsored the event and featured 
contest information at its stores throughout the country. DIANE SEO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; PARENTS HONE SKILLS IN RAISING CHILDREN

 Dressed in a plaid school uniform, Gloria Ybarra smiled and applauded as she 
watched her mother, Maria, walk toward the front of the auditorium at the San 
Miguel Community Center in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't scream at us that much now and I can talk to her a lot more about 
things," 10-year-old Gloria said proudly during a graduation ceremony for 
parents who completed an 11-week parenting education program Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ybarra was among 28 residents who took part in the program aimed at 
helping parents cope with difficulties of child-rearing. The free weekly 
bilingual classes focus on child development and discipline, as well as 
providing support for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is here to enhance parents' ability to raise their kids, to 
reduce child abuse and to let parents know what to expect from their kids," 
said Ernestine Myers, region program director for El Nido Family Center, a 
nonprofit counseling center that has sponsored three such workshops in Watts 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents such as Ofelia Gonzales, the weekly meetings provided a chance to 
talk with other parents who faced similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We parents think sometimes that parenting just means giving your child a roof 
over their head and food," Gonzalez said. "I'm here because I have three kids 
and the youngest is 11. They are getting a bit difficult now . . . I should 
have started these classes earlier, but it's not too late to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Program coordinators hope to establish a support group for the graduates, said 
Ava Chavez, an instructor with El Nido. 
</P>
<P>
 The next parenting course is scheduled to begin in June. The program is funded 
through a $134,000 grant from the city.

 With the ease of a video game veteran, Thurman Williams' eyes dart back and 
forth between the screen and hand controls, as he struggles to beat the clock.  
</P>
<P>
 Like most teen-agers, Thurman's attention has been captured by video games. 
But rather than spending hours at an arcade, he is one of about 65 students 
receiving help with math, science and business skills in the SOAR Youth 
Empowerment program, which uses computer games to help kids learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun and you can do any kind of math problem you want from addition to 
multiplication to anything," said Thurman, 14, an eighth-grader at an Inglewood 
private school who was working on his math skills at the small tutoring and 
counseling center at 1328 W. Manchester Ave. "Besides, if I went to get help at 
school I'd have to pay for it. Here it's free." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at one of four computers, Thurman is concentrating on "Moon Flight," a 
math tutoring program that challenges students to solve addition and 
subtraction problems in seconds. Each correct answer helps boost a video rocket 
into space. Students must master the problems and launch the rocket before they 
can advance to the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 Established last fall with a $43,000 grant from the United Way, the program 
focuses on providing free one-on-one tutoring and mentoring to students ages 11 
to 14 who face academic problems. Staffed by four paid coordinators and a corps 
of about 20 volunteers, students meet three times weekly with tutors, who 
monitor each youth's academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Students rotate through the center, moving from computers to one-on-one 
reading labs to small groups where quotes from historical figures such as 
Frederick Douglass are discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's hard to come here and work when I see people playing 
basketball outside," said Cal Von Roberson, 11. "But I stay because I've 
realized that if I keep going this way, I can grow up to be something 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The program has recently expanded to include a small entrepreneurial program 
that is aimed at helping students apply math and language skills to everyday 
life. Earlier this year, students designed T-shirts depicting problems of 
homelessness and crime in the area and urging residents to "heal our 
neighborhood." They developed marketing strategies for the venture, including 
targeting local businesses and parents as potential clients, and sales have 
topped $2,300.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; TEENS QUESTION LEADERS ON VIOLENCE

<P>
 The lights on stage were glaring, but most of the heat in the auditorium was 
generated by a group of high school students who were questioning politicians, 
educators and other professionals about how well -- or how poorly -- they've 
been addressing the issue of violence among youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal daylong hearing last week at Manual Arts High School brought 
together nearly 500 students from 15 schools to hear the testimony of guest 
panelists from the media, politics, education, public safety, substance abuse 
prevention, education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of students flanked the various panels Monday and took issue with 
everything from the negative portrayal of inner-city youth in movies to the 
sluggish national response to AIDS, particularly among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, part of the Bringing Everybody's Strength Together foundation's 
"Spring for Peace" anti-violence campaign, was conceived by BEST volunteer 
Daniel Tabor, who is also Southern California project liaison with the U.S. 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults are never held accountable by young people," said Tabor. "This gives 
them the opportunity to force adults to explain exactly what they're going to 
do to improve the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, RLA attorney Linda 
Wong and about 18 other guests found themselves defending the sincerity of 
their efforts to stop acts of violence among young people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the liveliest sessions was on media and entertainment, which sparked a 
debate about whether the media mines urban violence for profit at the expense 
of impressionable youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts student Lourdes Valdes questioned producer Daniel Haro about one 
of his company's films, Edward James Olmos' "American Me." "Why did it portray 
just Latinos as gang members?" she asked as fellow students applauded. "Why 
weren't other kinds of people represented? It's not balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Cooper of Grant High asked why television news continues to distort 
the incidence of crime by continually leading their newscasts with crime 
stories. "Violent movies have been shown to increase violent reactions in 
people," she said, citing a national study. "But TV doesn't really seem to 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 KCOP-TV Channel 13 reporter Brian Jenkins conceded that "body-bag journalism" 
is prevalent, but that young viewers have the choice of turning off offending 
programs and writing letters of complaint. "You have more power than you 
think," he said to students. "TV likes to push buttons, particularly with crime 
and race issues, and then they don't have to address issues. You can force the 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The student examiners were comprised of leaders from participating high 
schools and continuation programs, including the Center for Enriched Studies, 
the Hollenbeck Youth Center and Manual Arts, Grant, Alhambra, Van Nuys, Reseda 
and Lincoln high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings were coordinated by the BEST Foundation for a Drug-Free Tomorrow, 
a Sherman Oaks-based organization that works with schools and community 
coalitions to prevent substance abuse. The event was co-sponsored by Friday 
Night Live of Los Angeles County, the USC Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics and 
the Commerce Department's California Task Force. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: COMMERCE; LABOR DISPUTE MAY CLOSE ZACKY PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers and managers at Zacky Farms have met with a federal mediator in an 
attempt to keep the poultry packing plant open, but the facility's fate remains 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company suspended operations May 13 and informed the union that because of 
financial difficulties, the plant would close July 15, a move that union 
officials said could be a ploy to force the workers to back down on their 
demand for wage parity. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations stalled because the company refused to meet union demands that 
the 136 workers in Commerce be paid the same wages as 1,000 employees who do 
similar work at the company's Fresno plant, said Jim Rodriguez, director of 
United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, which represents about 30,000 
supermarket, drugstore and packinghouse workers in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce employees earn an hourly average of $7.13, Rodriguez said. Fresno 
employees in similar jobs earn 45 cents more an hour and are due for a raise of 
11 cents per hour in August. Company officials told the union that the Commerce 
plant costs $1.2 million more to operate than the Fresno facility because of 
aging equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce plant, at 6101 Sheila St., slaughters and processes roasters and 
fryers for sale at supermarket deli counters. The Fresno plant processes 
turkeys, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacky Farms personnel manager Bill Dukes refused to comment on negotiations or 
on the company's financial health. Royce Peterson, the company's state director 
of personnel and human resources, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 During mediation last week, the company demanded "take-aways and concessions 
that we couldn't even consider," Rodriguez said. The company requested a wage 
freeze, fewer paid holidays, lower starting pay and other concessions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union requested that the company restart operations and allow the 
employees to return to work during negotiations, but the company refused, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers attempted to return to the plant on Monday, but were rebuffed by 
company officials, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce employees went on strike May 5 after working without a contract for 
nine months. They were told that if they did not return to work by May 9, they 
would be permanently replaced, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 13, the company notified union officials by fax that plant operations 
would be suspended effective May 16 and that the plant would close permanently 
July 15. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; WORKERS TO BID FOR SHARE OF CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bicycle Club employees have taken a small but important step toward buying the 
federal government's stake in the card casino by narrowly winning the support 
of the City Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees are ecstatic," said attorney Regina Saborsky of the Beverly 
Hills-based firm Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman, which represents the 2,100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 card dealers, waitresses and other workers packed City Hall last 
week to ask council members, who also serve as the redevelopment agency, to 
support their efforts to form an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The ESOP would, 
in essence, buy out the government's 36% interest in the casino and set up a 
pension plan for workers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government became a general partner in the card club after 
officials uncovered a complex racketeering and money-laundering scheme and 
seized about a third of the club's assets. In April, 1990, a federal jury found 
that one Bicycle Club investor had used $12 million in drug smuggling money to 
build the facility, and the government seized his portion of the business. 
Profits from the government's 36% share of the operation have been placed in a 
special U.S. Marshal account now overseen by court-appointed trustee Harry 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a court-mandated forfeiture process, the government is preparing to 
auction or sell its share in the club, Richard said, and the casino's employees 
are among interested parties that he would not disclose. The city, which 
receives more than half its tax revenue from the casino, licenses the club and 
has final approval over any change in ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted, 3 to 1, with Councilwoman Maria Chacon abstaining, to 
approve the employees' plan. Councilman Rudy Garcia, who voted in opposition, 
and Chacon both said they wanted more time to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for anything that's going to help a working man get a retirement 
plan," Garcia said. "The only thing I'm against is that they haven't been able 
to give me any numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite initial support from the majority of council members, casino employees 
face a financial challenge, Saborsky said. They must come up with an estimated 
$35 million to pay for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take creative financing," Saborsky said. "It's not going to be 
easy. It may not happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, under a strict reading of gaming laws, each participating 
employee would need to register as a casino partner, which would cost about 
$500 per employee, Saborsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual acquisition of the government's stake could take months, Saborsky said. 
Workers will first place a bid for the federal government's share of the club. 
If the bid is accepted, a corporation will be formed. The new company would 
create an employee stock ownership plan and seek loans to help it purchase the 
government's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Saborsky is seeking third-party financing and the workers may return to the 
redevelopment agency to request that bonds be issued to help them purchase the 
casino, which is in a designated redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has the right to issue bonds to help individuals acquire or improve 
property if the project "helps to implement the redevelopment plan," said City 
Atty. Michael Estrada. But, he added, the city "would rather not do any 
financing and we really hope they don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the workers can raise the money to buy a share in the casino, their 
involvement could help erase "that taint" remaining from the racketeering 
scandal, Saborsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an ESOP is done well, you see an increase in morale, stability in the 
work force and an almost self-policing," Saborsky said. "I think you'd see an 
increased profitability in the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, the trustee, agreed that employee ownership could be a positive 
influence. "An employee will take more care in making sure everything is done 
properly," he said. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; BIDDING WAR ERUPTS OVER EX-FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A bidding war has begun for ownership of Fire Station 52, a property that has 
stood vacant and neglected for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis Medical Center bid $75,000 for the property after Pasadena-based 
Southland Leasing and Development Corp. recently made the city an undisclosed 
offer to buy the abandoned building and renovate it as affordable housing for 
seniors. Public Works Director James Biery said the raw property is worth about 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical center had earlier proposed that the city turn over the fire 
station property as a gift for use as a community health clinic. The Commission 
for South Gate Youth has also requested that the property be donated to them, 
in hopes of creating a youth recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 "(City officials) made it clear that we weren't going to go anywhere if we 
asked for the property as a gift," said St. Francis Vice President Ron 
Dahlgren. "We were basically told we were not going to be in the running." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlgren said the center would offer free screenings for cholesterol and 
tuberculosis, immunizations for children and other services as part of its 
proposal to obtain the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland Leasing initially was the only applicant willing to pay for the 
property, making its proposal particularly attractive to the city, an official 
said. Details of the proposal have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received seven proposals for development of the site, but only three 
parties completed the final application process, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 The county closed the fire house in 1985 and the property was turned over to 
the city last December. In recent years, the building has been occupied by 
transients, and neighbors have complained that it has become an eyesore, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The site will require environmental cleanup because an underground fuel tank 
once used to fill the station's fire trucks has leaked, contaminating 
surrounding soil. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; BAR'S LIQUOR LICENSE REQUEST WITHDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Cometa, a bar that had applied for the transfer of its liquor license to 
its new owner and for permission to open a dance hall, has withdrawn those 
requests and will no longer sell alcohol, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal came after months of investigations by the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Hollenbeck Vice Division of the establishment at 2907 1/2 E. 1st 
St., and residents' opposition to the sale of liquor in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls made to El Cometa were unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 The news last week drew praise from neighbors and police who say their streets 
already have too many liquor stores and bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope that's a lesson that they better stay out of here," said Yolanda 
Robles, who lives in Boyle Heights. Robles gathered signatures from neighbors 
opposing El Cometa's liquor license transfer and has testified before city 
zoning hearings against allowing new bars or liquor stores to open in her 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sgt. Ron Katona, who heads the Vice Division at Hollenbeck, the withdrawal 
was a small victory in the fight against what many view as an overabundance of 
liquor establishments on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollenbeck division, there are 460 businesses operating with Alcohol 
and Beverage Control licenses. And on one block of First Street between 
Savannah Street and Evergreen Avenue, there are four bars and one liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a terrific (number of liquor establishments) that one place should 
endure," Katona said. "There are a host of problems that come with that. It 
seems like hand in hand with (liquor establishments) is narcotics activity."  
</P>
<P>
 Katona and his officers investigate businesses that apply for new licenses or, 
as in the case of El Cometa, want an existing license transferred to a new 
owner. They take into account the number of bars and liquor stores in the area, 
how close the proposed business is to churches, schools and homes and tally up 
the crime statistics to present to the police commission, which makes 
recommendations to the ABC board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to determine if it's going to be detrimental to the community," Katona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the older, established businesses, even if they are close to churches 
and schools, cannot be closed down because their licenses were issued during a 
period when those factors were not considered, Katona said.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, a host of requirements has slowed down the number of new 
applications. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 More than 50 residents who feared their homes were targeted for possible 
demolition under a study to revitalize some Eastside neighborhoods were told 
last week that there are no such plans in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents left a meeting on the ongoing Adelante Eastside study with 
assurances from the Community Advisory Committee that, although housing in the 
neighborhoods was evaluated in the original 16-month study, there are no plans 
to demolish homes in favor of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This housing and residential (component) is over with," said committee 
chairman Steve Barba when a resident asked for a vote to ensure that homes 
would not be torn down. "What the committee presented to the City Council was 
two areas to study -- the commercial and industrial." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who attended said they had received flyers or heard from neighbors that 
housing within the 10-square-mile area studied for revitalization could be torn 
down to make way for commercial and industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has outlined local business corridors that it hopes residents, 
who currently travel outside the area to shop, will use and thus raise the 
local tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrio Planners Inc., an architectural firm, is conducting a technical study 
of the area to document conditions of blight as defined by state law, whether 
in buildings, streets or other physical characteristics. It will also study the 
area's economy and determine sources of tax revenue. With city approval, the 
redevelopment area could then be established. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they received assurances that their homes were safe, many in 
attendance at Wednesday night's meeting complained that the community is not 
aware of the study and its potential impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela Herman, who has attended meetings for 13 months, said the committee has 
not been receptive to comments from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come and the community tries to talk and then time runs out," she said. 
Herman thanked the committee for listening to residents' concerns Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Community Advisory Committee meeting will be from 6 to 8 p.m. June 22 
at the Boyle Heights Senior Citizens Center, 2839 E. 3rd St. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; LIBRARY TO CHECK IN TO NEW, BIGGER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are expected to finalize by Wednesday a 10-year lease for the 
Little Tokyo Branch Library's new home on the ground floor of the Neptune 
Building on 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location is very prominent and accessible," said Carmen Martinez, 
director of library branches for Los Angeles. "We hope to move in in August." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council in March approved spending $56,000 a year for the 
5,000-square-foot space, ending the branch library's nearly two-year search to 
relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the branch opened in April, 1989, Little Tokyo library officials have 
been working out of a smaller, 2,400-square-foot room in the Centenary United 
Methodist Church at 948 E. 2nd St. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch, which circulated 131,739 materials last year, has outgrown its 
rented space and needs more room for its 21,000-book collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to move into the historic Union Church of Los Angeles on San Pedro 
Street never checked out, so the city Board of Library Commissioners settled on 
the Neptune Building at 701 E. 3rd St. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the early 1920s, the four-story concrete structure was named after 
its original owner, the Neptune Water Meter Co., said Hoss MacVaugh, vice 
president of Cutting/MacVaugh Real Estate Services. Cutting/MacVaugh now 
manages the building for Oakwood Third Street Assn., a partnership of 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50,000-square-foot building, however, is probably more recognized for its 
two bulging statues of the Greek god Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the lease agreement, MacVaugh said his firm will spend an estimated 
$125,000 for such tenant improvements as wire and cable installations, 
carpeting and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new branch will feature a communications room and administrative offices 
for four full-time and five part-time staff. Most of the 5,000-square-foot 
space will be devoted to library users, according to a drawing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Library branch director Martinez doesn't anticipate any problems with the 
August move of the branch's mostly Japanese-language volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this all the time," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just mark the boxes according to the (book) numbers. . . . There's a 
system we have, and we get them back on the shelf real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Library supporters are eager to see their dream of an expanded Little Tokyo 
Branch come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just thrilled now that we are going to larger quarters," said Janet 
Minami, president of Friends of Little Tokyo Branch Library. "But it's been a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Tokyo library is one of 63 branches run by the city. Library 
officials also expect to open a new location for the city's Echo Park branch 
later this year. TOMMY LI

COVER STORY; THE WHEELS ON THE BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND (AND ROUND AND ROUND ... 
ALL OVER TOWN); THE DISTRICT'S BUSING PROGRAMS HAVE ENABLED MANY SUBURBAN 
SCHOOLS WITH DECLINING LOCAL ENROLLMENTS TO STAY OPEN. BUT THE LONG TREKS ARE 
OPPOSED BY MANY, WHO BLAME INNER-CITY STUDENTS FOR VIOLENCE, GRAFFITI AND LOW 
TEST SCORES.

<P>
 JOLTED OUT OF BED BEfore dawn, they arrive at street corners as early as 6 
with notebooks in hand and backpacks slumped over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 In darkness, rain or sunlight, tens of thousands of students -- some barely 
old enough to tie their own shoes -- wait for buses that will transport them 
from their inner-city neighborhoods to schools in the San Fernando Valley or on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who climb aboard the bright-yellow fleet believe suburban schools will 
offer them a better education and are taking advantage of voluntary integration 
programs. Some have no choice but to ride across town because their 
neighborhood schools are filled to capacity. And others are being sent to new 
campuses for disciplinary or academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, cross-town busing is a way of life for at least 26,000 students in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, who travel from such communities as 
South-Central, Boyle Heights and Koreatown to suburban areas such as Woodland 
Hills, Brentwood and Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've changed a lot since I started coming here," said Nancy Vasquez, a junior 
at Woodland Hills' El Camino Real High School who rides the bus from 
South-Central. "Before, I was failing all my classes; now I'm on the student 
council. It's hard, though. The bused kids have to go an extra mile because 
we're trying to rise above." 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly black, Latino and Asian students who make the daily 
cross-town haul have helped diversify Valley and Westside schools and enabled 
many suburban campuses faced with declining local enrollments to stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district's $39-million busing programs also are bitterly resented by 
many Valley and Westside residents, who blame inner-city students for the 
violence, graffiti and low test scores besetting their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family feels they should stay at their own schools because they feel they 
bring trouble," said Hollyn Nemecek, a freshman at El Camino Real. "I don't 
even bother trying to be friends with them. I feel more comfortable with kids 
from around here because I couldn't even go down to their inner-city 
neighborhoods without being afraid of being shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Busing to the suburbs began in the late 1960s, when the school district 
launched a controversial voluntary busing program to integrate Los Angeles 
schools. About 9,700 students from predominantly minority areas, including the 
east Valley, are now bused to Valley and Westside schools as part of various 
voluntary integration programs. About 1,300 of those students are at the 
elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 16,000 students -- including 7,600 elementary school children -- 
are forced to travel to other campuses because their neighborhood schools in 
areas such as Pico-Union, Bell and Huntington Park are overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of magnet and special education students also ride the bus, while 
regular permits are given to other students who find their own transportation 
to schools outside their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the number of bused students has declined as the district's 
total enrollment has dropped and new schools have been built in areas that were 
overcrowded. Three years ago, for instance, more than 38,000 students were 
bused for integration and overcrowding reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But cross-town busing is still a ubiquitous part of the 640,000-student school 
district, essentially blurring racial distinctions between suburban and 
inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that kids are going everywhere and schools are becoming 
more and more alike," said Brenda Morton, an assistant principal at University 
High School in West Los Angeles, where more than half of the school's 2,250 
students live outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising before dawn and riding the bus up to three hours a day is a grueling 
sacrifice many students are willing to make because, they say, suburban schools 
are safer and academically more challenging than those in their own 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Custodio, an 18-year-old honor student at Tujunga's Verdugo Hills 
High School, wakes up at 4:30 to get ready for school. After showering and 
dressing at her two-bedroom apartment near Hollywood, her brother drives her 
four blocks to her bus stop. By 6:45, she is heading toward school. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, Katherine read William Faulkner's "A Light in August" 
during the 45-minute drive to school. She sat alone, while others slept, 
listened to music on portable stereos or talked loudly among their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the neighborhoods over here, it's like 'Mister Rogers' 
Neighborhood' up there," she said. "Sometimes, I'm tempted not to go to school 
in the mornings, but I've never missed the bus because I know I have a 
responsibility to go. I have a better opportunity to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katherine's mother, Agnes Anciano, worries that her daughter isn't 
getting enough sleep, she is grateful for the district's busing program. "It's 
a big help to single parents like me because I don't drive and I've been laid 
off since August," she said. "Katherine would otherwise go to Belmont (High 
School), and the area around there is really rough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anciano, who has never seen Verdugo Hills High, can't help but worry about 
her daughter's long daily trek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, she leaves the house when it's still dark," she said. "And one 
time, there was a problem on the bus and she didn't come home until 5 o'clock. 
I called one of her classmates and she said, 'Katherine left school at 3 p.m.' 
I was so worried, I sent my son looking for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Although students such as Katherine stoically accept their rigorous daily 
routines, cross-town busing has taken its toll on others. Absences are frequent 
among students who ride the bus, and teachers say many of them appear sluggish 
and tired in class. Traveling students also have difficulty participating in 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play basketball, but I had to quit because I got home too late," 
said Garth Lawrence, a senior at El Camino Real who lives in the Koreatown 
area. "I wouldn't get home until 8 o'clock. It was too much of a time 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bused students also feel out of place at suburban schools and long to 
return to their neighborhood schools and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Miguel Barajas was sent to Verdugo Hills High School because 
Bell High School was overcrowded. Three years have passed, and the 17-year-old 
still resents having to wake up at 5:30 every morning for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset about it," he said. "If I went to Bell, I would have more time to 
spend with my family and I would probably play sports. . . . I have friends 
here but they live all over the place. It's like we say 'Hi' when we come to 
school and then 'Bye' at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas also dislikes the racial tensions brewing at school. During lunch, for 
instance, Barajas said students hang out together almost exclusively by race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like white dudes against the brown dudes," he said. "Some of the 
skinheads pick fights with us because they don't want us over here." 
</P>

 Verdugo Hills Principal Gary Turner said racially motivated fights have broken 
out this year between bused students and the mostly white local students. About 
70% of the school's 1,800 students are minorities, and about 60% of the 
school's student body is bused. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had really good race relations in the past, but this year we've had 
more problems," Turner said. "For the most part, our bused-in kids have been 
very well-accepted here at school, but there are always going to be those who 
don't like the busing in of minority students." 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner said many local residents don't realize that the school is 
dependent on its traveling student population to stay open: "You need about 
1,800 students to make up a high school. When you fall below that, you're in 
big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Westside and Valley residents would like nothing more than to see 
the bused students return to schools in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The February, 1993, fatal shooting of Reseda High School student Michael Shean 
Ensley fueled such angry sentiments. The 17-year-old came to Reseda by bus from 
South Los Angeles, while his attacker, Robert Heard, 15, took the bus from 
Panorama City. Both had been attending Reseda on an opportunity transfer, which 
is designed to move students with discipline and academic problems to different 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the students being bused in because it doesn't really make a 
difference to me," said Negin Brokhim, a junior at University High School who 
lives near the school. "But sometimes, I see people getting busted for drugs or 
something and then I see them getting on the bus after school. That's when I 
think that they shouldn't have busing." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a also a feeling among some Westside and Valley educators that 
overcrowded schools are holding on to their most talented students. Although 
overcrowded schools generally enroll students on a first-come, first-served 
basis, they often make exceptions for students they want to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a school is going to pull out kids, they won't send us their most academic 
kids," said Gerald Citrin, an art teacher at University High School. "The bused 
kids here are very streetwise and nice, but a lot of them have learning and 
disciplinary problems. And because some come from such long distances, they're 
worn out by the time they come to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Bused students at Verdugo Hills, however, tend to perform about the same 
academically as local students and get into trouble less often than local 
students, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that bused people all bring weapons to school and cause 
trouble," said Yesenia Carriera, a sophomore at Verdugo Hills High who lives 
near Belmont High. "I feel bad about it because I choose to come here and I 
want to come to a school where I feel welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 But Damian-Jason Young, a senior at University High who is bused from West 
Adams, said many bused students do cause trouble at school, which spoils the 
reputation of all traveling students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame people for thinking bused students cause trouble because some 
kids who are bused don't take pride in our school," he said. "They trash the 
school and cause trouble because they know they'll just leave after school. But 
that's not like me. I take a lot of pride in my school." 
</P>
<P>
 Busing, in some ways, has destroyed the idea of neighborhood schools, Citrin 
said. "Many kids are here for the day, and then they go home to their 
environments." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools with large numbers of bused students also struggle to involve parents 
in school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have an open house event from 7 to 9 p.m., the buses have to pick up 
the parents about 4:30," said Michael B. Bennett, principal of Woodland Hills 
Parkman Middle School. "You're not going to get a lot of people who can leave 
work that early or take the time needed to come up here for events." 
</P>
<P>
 To help bridge the gap between the school and its bused population, the entire 
staff at Parkman recently traveled to South-Central's Carver Middle School to 
meet the parents of traveling students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took everybody, including our classified workers, janitors and 
secretaries," said Bennett, who plans to make the visit an annual event. "We 
had over 100 parents waiting for us at Carver and they were overwhelmed that we 
all came down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with reaching out to parents, Orlando Martinez-Miller, principal at 
Encino Elementary, believes it's essential for schools to make bused students 
feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat them well when they come here," he said of the school's 325 bused 
students. "I tell them that they're not visitors, and that they're part of the 
school. . . . Soon enough, they feel coming over here for school is normal. 
It's just part of life."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Come by the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo this weekend and 
learn how to decorate and shape your own bonsai tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Ai Fu Kai Bonsai Club will offer workshops Saturday and June 5 
on the traditional Japanese art form. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 40 visitors at each session will receive a one-gallon-size bonsai -- 
which translated means "tray or platter plant," museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the tree's height at an average of three feet, growers often prune its 
roots and trim its leaves, watering only small amounts daily, said Chris Komai, 
museum spokesman. "What you (will eventually) have are trees that are 100 years 
old that are no taller than 3 feet," Komai said. "They are truly miniature 
trees." 
</P>

CAMPAIGNING HEATS UP IN 49TH DISTRICT; POLITICS: JUDY CHU ATTACKS INCUMBENT 
DIANE MARTINEZ AS INEFFECTIVE AND UNABLE TO RETAIN STAFF. THE FRESHMAN 
ASSEMBLYWOMAN DENOUNCES THE CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fanning the flames of her underdog campaign, Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu has 
intensified her attack on Assemblywoman Diane Martinez, calling her an 
ineffective legislator who cannot get bills passed or even hold on to her 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (D-Monterey Park) gave Chu new ammunition when she brought up one of 
her most closely watched bills for a vote last week -- only to have it fall one 
vote short of passage. The bill would have helped clear the way for Caltrans to 
extend the Long Beach (710) Freeway through South Pasadena without approval of 
the city, which is a vehement opponent of the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's 49th District includes parts of Alhambra, which strongly supports 
the extension, as well as portions of Monterey Park, San Gabriel, Rosemead, 
Temple City, El Monte, Los Angeles and unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the freeway vote, three members of Martinez's six-person 
Sacramento staff left her office for reasons that are unclear. Two of the 
employees, an analyst and a secretary, apparently left on bad terms after a 
fierce argument with the assemblywoman, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is ineffective in Sacramento," Chu said in a recent interview. "She can't 
even keep her staff. How can you operate your office with that kind of 
turnover?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez denied there was a staff blowup, saying the analyst left of her own 
accord and the secretary left to seek lighter duty because of her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband of Danielle Woern, who is pregnant and one of the employees who 
reportedly argued with Martinez, answered a phone call from The Times but would 
not allow his wife to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst, Linda Joplin, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman also downplayed the importance of the vote on the 710 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the votes are there," said Martinez, who has scheduled the bill for 
reconsideration. "I don't intend to lose this bill." Then Martinez fired back 
at Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always set on the track of deliberately skewing information," Martinez 
said. "She has people here and there and everywhere trying to spread rumors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Martinez/Chu race is drawing particular interest because it pits a Latina 
incumbent, who has the blessing of Democratic leaders, against a well-financed 
Chinese American candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chu, a college psychology professor, is fighting an uphill battle against 
Martinez, a freshman assemblywoman and the daughter of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez 
(D-Monterey Park). 
</P>
<P>
 The district is considered one of the best for Asian candidates because of its 
growing Asian population. But Latinos still account for about 55% of the 
population; Asians make up 29% -- a clear advantage for the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 A third candidate, Roy T. Torres, is running for election in the June 7 
Democratic primary, but his campaign is under-funded and his chances are seen 
as poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican George H. Nirschl III is running unopposed in the GOP primary but 
is expected to have little chance in November; Democrats outnumber Republicans 
in the district by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian Kim Goldsworthy also is seeking the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two weeks before the June 7 election, the race for the 52nd 
Assemby District has turned into a low-key affair, with no forums and little 
campaigning from the candidates. Page 24

REP. ROYBAL-ALLARD IS FACING POLITICAL NEWCOMER IN PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshman Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) is considered a heavy 
favorite to recapture the 33rd Congressional District seat she won two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roybal faces only one challenger in the primary, a political newcomer making 
his first bid for elective office, and there are no Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Roybal-Allard, 52, succeeded her father, Edward R. Roybal, who represented the 
33rd District for nearly 30 years before his retirement in 1992. She won easy 
victories in the primary and general election in that same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roybal-Allard's Democratic challenger is Charles E. Green, 73, a 
self-described human-rights advocate who says he served 10 years on a senior 
citizens' advisory panel to the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Peace and Freedom candidate Kermit Booker, 57, a teacher 
at Lynwood High School.

VOICES: ACTION FIGURE; CHARLIE WOO MADE A BIG IMPACT ON BUSINESS IN 'TOYTOWN,' 
A THRIVING COLLECTION OF WHOLESALE TOY COMPANIES. WITH THE CITY'S HELP, HE 
SAYS, MORE COULD BE DONE TO REVITALIZE DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLIE WOO, Charlie Woo, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, is known as the father 
of Toytown, a cluster of hundreds of wholesale toy operations that has 
revitalized a portion of the east side of Downtown Los Angeles. He is chairman 
of the Central City East Assn. and was recently elected to the board of the Los 
Angeles Chamber of Commerce. His family companies, ABC Toys and Megatoys Inc., 
have estimated annual sales of $30 million. Woo and his wife, Ying, have two 
children, ages 5 and 4. He was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I feel a really strong sense of responsibility to the small-businessmen in my 
area. I really believe the small, entrepreneurial spirit is what we will need 
in the future. Big business is downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 This side of Downtown, the eastern section, is not as glamorous as the west 
side, but it's just as important. This is an area generating the blue-collar 
jobs that are not that easy to come by these days. This is the center for a lot 
of industries -- toys, flowers, seafood, garments, produce. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this area can receive some attention from the city in the next few 
years. Slowly, Downtown is being revolutionized, but we have a lot of minds to 
change. The city has really concentrated on the white-collar industries and on 
the high-rises and the glamour companies. 
</P>
<P>
 We've done a lot here by ourselves, but with the city's support we could do a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 My father and my brothers and I opened a wholesale toy business in 1979. We 
had been looking for several years for an opportunity to get into our own 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 My father had been a businessman in Hong Kong. He emigrated there from China's 
southern Guangdong province in 1949. He had an import-export business in 
construction machine parts and owned a warehouse in Hong Kong where merchandise 
was stored as it came off the ships. 
</P>
<P>
 I came to the United States in 1968, to study at UCLA and be a physicist. I 
earned bachelor's and master's degrees in physics and was on the verge of 
getting my Ph.D when I took the summer off to help the family business get 
started. I got very busy, and I never went back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 We evaluated what types of products we should import, and we decided on toys 
manufactured mostly in Asia -- at that time it was Hong Kong and Taiwan. We 
spoke the languages, we could communicate with the factories; we figured we'd 
be ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, small retailers only sold toys at Christmastime. The really big 
toy industry was the domain of a few major corporations, like Mattel. Most 
importers only dealt with toys on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 We rented warehouse space for $400 a month, and we had no employees at all for 
the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company tripled and quadrupled in the first years because we had such 
large amounts of sales. The first company we had was called ABC Toys. Five 
years ago we opened Megatoys, the company that I manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Within several years after we started our business, there was a large influx 
of immigrants into the area.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of them were entrepreneurs from Vietnam, Hong Kong and Taiwan. When they 
started out, many were penniless. A lot of them got menial labor jobs on the 
weekdays and then they would go to swap meets on weekends and try to sell items 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 I developed relationships with many of them who were buying toys from me. In 
the early 1980s, I encouraged some of them to rent warehouses and go into the 
wholesale business. 
</P>
<P>
 I had first rented a space. Then I made money, and I started buying 
warehouses. As these people approached me, I started buying more warehouses and 
renting to them.  
</P>
<P>
 That's how Toytown got started, a whole network of small operations all 
manufacturing and importing toys. Now, it's a billion-dollar industry clustered 
around 3rd and 5th streets and San Pedro and Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first came to this part of Downtown, there were a lot of abandoned 
warehouses and deserted office buildings. Now, we have visitors coming in from 
all over the world, from the East Coast, the Midwest, Mexico, South America -- 
even some from Eastern Europe and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 There is such a concentration of toy items here that it's a lot easier for 
retailers to come to Los Angeles and get everything they need than for them to 
go to Hong Kong and China and look for things bit by bit. Everything from all 
over the Pacific Rim is here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm always optimistic about the future. Being an immigrant and a business 
person, I didn't make it the easy way. If I can make it, other people can 
overcome the challenges and make it too. That's what's unique about L.A., with 
our diversity and our opportunities.

VOICES: GLOBAL TRADER; DAVID TSAI HOPES TO BUILD A BUSINESS NETWORK BASED ON 
THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT SKILLS. THAT'S WHY HE 
FOUNDED THE ASIAN PACIFIC MART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID TSAI, David Tsai, 46, is the founder of the Asian Pacific Mart at 11th 
and Flower streets, one block from the Los Angeles Convention Center. The mart 
offers international traders 64,000 square feet of exhibit space, with plans in 
the works to add 170,000 square feet of showrooms and a 216-room business 
hotel. The mart offers exhibit booths to sellers of goods and services from all 
parts of the Pacific Rim. Born in Taiwan, Tsai has worked in Southern 
California for 23 years and lives in Santa Monica. He and his wife, Shelly, 
have a 14-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son. He was interviewed by Karen 
E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We try to be a bridge that can connect Asia and the United States and Latin 
America. That's one of the very basic goals of our mart. 
</P>
<P>
 People need to know that there are differences and also similarities between 
different countries and different areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In our showrooms, you could find products from Taiwan and from China and 
selected items produced locally. It's sort of a mix at this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have lots of other activities, like cultural programs and trade fairs. 
Various cities hold fairs here and they bring their products and other kinds of 
goods over to display them. The Black Businessmen's Assn. will be holding a 
fair here soon targeted at the Asian populations. Indonesia is going to have a 
trade fair here, showcasing the products they produce and the business 
opportunities they have in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 We try to create grass-roots programs, like arts exhibitions, cultural 
performances and seminars. We know that trade activities lead to the exchange 
of money and goods, but we feel we should get more involved in the exchange of 
politics and culture in order to know the whole spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing we do is arrange contacts between business people from various 
countries who want to expand into the international arena. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, we set up some meetings recently for the president of the Nestle 
Corp. because that firm wants to expand into Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese people are familiar with Nestle products from before and during 
the Vietnam War. In the last two years, their products have been available on 
the black market in Vietnam and they have become very popular, especially to 
give as gifts when people visit other homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's natural for Nestle to expand there because there is already a market 
for their products. When the president of the company planned a trip to 
Vietnam, he asked us to give him some leads with businessmen in the country and 
we gave him some people he could talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 Connections are very important in business, especially in Asia. That's why our 
company can be so successful in that part of the world. It's a cultural thing 
that has been influenced a lot by the Japanese. That is their business pattern 
and model -- to develop a large network of business contacts and connections 
whenever they go into a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 I was born in Taiwan and came to study at UCLA in 1973 to finish my master's 
degree in urban design. I had studied architectural design in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 My uncle was in the import/export business in Taiwan, trading mostly between 
Taiwan and Japan. My father worked as an engineer for the government, building 
hydroelectric power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 I was with my uncle all the time and I got my business knowledge from him. Our 
family originally came from China's Fujian province in the southern part of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, I opened a design and construction company here called VIT 
Construction Co. that I still own. It does commercial and residential real 
estate development. In 1978, I started doing some importing and exporting 
through a company I started called Lumax International. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I had been here several years, I still had lots of friends 
throughout the Asian countries, particularly because I had been involved in my 
uncle's import/export business. 
</P>
<P>
 So I worked on that and on real estate development during the 1980s. I was 
involved in urban development downtown. I remember when I first came here in 
the early 1970s, nobody dared come to downtown. That was true even in the late 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 But I had a dream that was based on what I saw going on in Hong Kong and 
Taiwan and Japan. The younger generations were so successful there. Everybody 
was exchanging information and promoting management skills. I wanted to see the 
same thing happening here in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to pull people together, especially with trade with China opening up 
and Asian markets becoming so huge now. That's why we opened the mart last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 I bought the property at 11th and Flower when it was all abandoned warehouses 
five years ago, because I foresaw there would be redevelopment there. 
</P>
<P>
 I rehabilitated a three-story historical warehouse for the first stage of the 
mart. We have our showroom, a library and a conference room now. Crime is not 
heavy here because we are isolated from the rest of downtown, in a way.

 Originally, when we opened the mart we were planning to work mostly with Asian 
entrepreneurs. But very surprisingly, after we opened the mart we found that 
many Latin American countries fell in love with us. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico -- they want to do business with Asian countries 
too, but they have no way to get started. If Latin American business people 
want to go to China, the Chinese Embassy usually recommends that they come and 
see us first.

INTERIM POLICE CHIEF FOR HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Huntington Park has offered the position of interim police chief 
to William F. Reed, a retired captain from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, a former member of the county's elite Special Enforcement Bureau, 
replaces Frank Sullivan, who stepped down under duress earlier this month amid 
allegations of discrimination, favoritism and corruption in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-1 decision, with Councilwoman Jessica Maes voting in 
opposition, was made during a closed session Wednesday. Councilman Tom Jackson 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, a former Marine with a background in public administration, contracted 
with the Huntington Park Police Department during the late 1980s as a 
consultant. He devised systems to tighten booking and records procedures and to 
improve security.

ASSEMBLY REMATCH IS ATTRACTING LITTLE NOTICE; POLITICS: DESPITE CONTROVERSIES 
SURROUNDING TWO MAJOR CANDIDATES, THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN THE 52ND DISTRICT 
HAS BEEN QUIETER THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The race for the 52nd Assembly District had the makings of a true political 
thriller, featuring two candidates whose public lives have been peppered by 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) has been widely condemned by 
Compton civic leaders for supporting a state takeover of the insolvent Compton 
school district last year. Former Compton City Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore, 
one of the three challengers in the Democratic primary, has provoked criticism 
that she is a political opportunist who surfaces at high-profile incidents 
involving African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential for a raucous campaign filled with accusations, the 
contest has instead turned into a real sleeper with less than two weeks before 
the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is one of six Assembly contests quietly being waged in the Southeast. 
In four others, incumbents face no opposition for their party's nomination. A 
fifth incumbent faces only a modest challenge from a businessman with limited 
campaign funds.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 52nd District, which covers Compton, Lynwood, Paramount, Gardena and 
part of south Los Angeles, including Willowbrook and parts of the Florence 
area, there have been no forums and little campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, 63, said he has been speaking to church and community groups when he 
flies home from Sacramento at the end of each week. He routinely makes the trip 
as part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray already is predicting victory over Moore and a third candidate, Los 
Angeles businessman Stephen Hamlin, 29. The winner of the primary will face 
Republican Richard A. Rorex, a Gardena engineer, in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've won three elections fairly handily," said Murray, who beat Moore two 
years ago and is seeking his fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 46, says she's had little time to campaign because she has been caring 
for her ailing mother. Moore said she had not planned to run until she received 
numerous phone calls from residents complaining that Murray had lost touch with 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willard Murray wants to sit back and be a dictator, with no proven record," 
said Moore, referring to Murray's support for state involvement in Compton 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray said the state takeover should be considered one of his significant 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Murray sponsored legislation granting the Compton school system an 
emergency, multimillion-dollar bailout loan. The district fell under state 
control as a condition of the loan. School board members denounced the state 
intervention, arguing that it was wrong to usurp local control, but Murray said 
the move was necessary to salvage a district in financial and academic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's critics portray him as an aloof legislator unconcerned with his 
constituents' problems. His opponents point out that Murray received the lowest 
rating among 78 Assembly members in a recent survey by California Journal, a 
magazine that covers state politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released in March, was sent to nearly 1,800 state politicians and 
their staffs and to journalists. Legislators were ranked on integrity, 
intelligence, effectiveness and other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray dismissed the findings, pointing out that less than 17% of those polled 
actually returned the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore also has political liabilities. She is an alleged target in an FBI 
bribery probe dating to her time as a Compton city councilwoman. Moore said she 
has not been contacted by federal authorities and knows nothing of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton's close-knit political world, she has been condemned at times by 
those who say she has readily exploited tragedies, particularly those involving 
African Americans, for her own advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time candidate Hamlin, meanwhile, believes he offers a fresh alternative 
for voters. A resident of southern Los Angeles, Hamlin said he is walking door 
to door in the district to highlight his platform, which calls for improved 
schools, more jobs and police reform. "I won't say I'm very well-known right 
now, but I'm building up a lot of support," he said.

EVEN A COLD CAN'T COOL OFF GRANVILLE IN MASTERS 800; SOPHOMORE RUNS 1:50.76 IN 
WIRE-TO-WIRE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Michael Granville of Bell Gardens was not at his best but he was still the 
class of the field in the 800 meters at the Masters meet Friday night at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville dominated his eight opponents, made up of the top competitors from 
the Southern Section division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite fighting a cold that limited his training to easy jogging during the 
week, the sophomore raced to a wire-to-wire victory in 1 minute, 50.76 seconds, 
the second-fastest time in the nation. He ran the fastest time in the nation of 
1:48.98 last week at the Southern Section division finals, the fastest time 
ever for a high school sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Teson of Chino Hills Ayala and Obea Moore of Pasadena Muir were second 
and third in 1:52.87 and 1:52.91. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what was going to happen because I have been feeling bad," 
Granville said. "I can't run other people's races so I go out there and do my 
thing. One of my priorities is to take the lead, it makes me comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 170-pound Granville used a similar strategy in the Southern 
Section finals last week at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, setting a national 
sophomore record of 1:48.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's mark shattered an 18-year-old standard of 1:50.8 shared by William 
Contee of Washington D.C. and Fred Bronner of New Jersey and eclipsed his 
previous best of 1:51.03 run last year en route to a freshman national record. 
</P>
<P>
 The time also surpassed the 1981 Southern Section Division I standard of 
1:49.45 held by Eddie Davis of Compton. Putting the performance in perspective, 
Granville's time was fast enough to win at this year's Pacific 10 Conference 
championships by nearly a second and the California Community College meet by 
nearly two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked to run under 1:50," Granville said. "I felt real energetic. I 
felt like I was going faster and faster with each step." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, his voice cracking, said he didn't have the same bounce in his 
stride Friday night, but he did not hesitate to bolt into the lead coming off 
the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached the 400-meter mark in 54 seconds with only Moore contending. 
Granville pulled away from the Southern Section Division I 400-meter champion 
with 300 meters to go and powered down the backstretch for a 15-meter victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville didn't match his performance at the Southern Section finals, but no 
one has run faster than his time Friday. Granville and Telly Moss of Temple, 
Texas, who has run 1:50.87, are the only athletes to crack 1:51 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first quarter was a little slow and I got too comfortable," Granville 
said. "I just wanted to qualify for the state and thought it would take a time 
in the low 1:50s. My tonsils and throat were hurting, but I didn't let the cold 
set me back. I just hope to God I get well. The times will come with the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The top five finishers in the Masters meet advanced to the State meet Friday 
and Saturday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Granville's performance, it was a breakthrough meet for Jason 
Barreda of Loyola, who clipped nearly four seconds off his best to qualify in 
4:16.38. Eric Dunn of Arroyo Grande won the race in 4:14.47, edging Brett 
Strahan of Newhall Hart (4:14.73) and Ricardo Etheridge of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreda was sixth with 300 meters left, but overtook Jonathan Lee of Torrance 
Bishop Montgomery and Kevin Marsden of Thousand Oaks on the backstretch and 
held off a late charge by Jeff Fisher of Thousand Oaks by 0.31 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Pentecost of Loyola was third in the discus after his first throw of 160 
feet 1 inch. Pentecost, though, failed to improve on his next three attempts 
with throws of 155-5, 153-1 and 157-7. Chad Jones of Arroyo Grande edged 
Pentecost for the final qualifying spot with a toss of 163-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman Johnson of Riverside Poly won the discus with a throw of 182-3 to 
easily outdistance runner-up Steve Gonzales of Newport Harbor (169-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Cogan of Loyola turned in a 49.1-second anchor leg, but the Cubs 
finished a non-qualifying seventh in the 1,600 relay in 3:22.35. Granville's

CITY 3-A PLAYOFFS; LINCOLN HAS ENOUGH TO BEAT DORSEY; BASEBALL: ERAMI AND

 It's hard to say which was more of a surprise: Dorsey making the playoffs 
after going winless (0-38) its last two seasons, or Lincoln being the No. 1 
seed after an early exit in the first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dorsey lost to Lincoln, 4-0, in a first-round playoff game Friday at 
Rose Hills Playground, the Dons proved their surprising season was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost by only four runs to the top-seeded team," Dorsey Coach John Turner 
said. "We only have three seniors on this team and we will be back next 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's Jorge Erami and Cesar Castaneda provided all the offense the Tigers 
needed. Erami's two-out single in the first inning drove in two runs. In the 
fourth inning, after Dorsey pitcher Reggie Douglas balked home a run to make 
the score 3-0, Castaneda hit a double to drive in Lincoln's final run. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey outhit Lincoln, 6-4, but could not capitalize against starter and 
winner Hector Arroyo. CHARLES SMITH

SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS; BARREDA PACES HIMSELF THIS TIME -- AND WINS; TRACK: 
LOYOLA RUNNER RELIES ON A STRONG FINISHING KICK TO COME FROM BEHIND AND CAPTURE 
HIS SECOND STRAIGHT 1,600 TITLE.

 A tactical error cost Jason Barreda the Mission League 1,600-meter title. But 
the Loyola High senior didn't make the same mistake in the Southern Section 
finals May 21 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreda won the Division III title in 4 minutes 20.97 seconds, pulling away 
with a 61-second final 400 to win the event for the second year in a row. He is 
only the second Loyola athlete to repeat as Southern Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Lee of Bishop Montgomery, who had defeated Barreda in the Mission 
League meet, was second in 4:22.25 and Dave Mitchell of Morro Bay was third in 
4:22.99. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had made a mistake in league finals and had run a tactically poor 
race. This time I ran the perfect race," Barreda said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mission League finals, Barreda attempted to lead from the start but was 
overtaken by Lee on the final straightaway of the May 6 race. On Saturday, 
Barreda stayed in the pack before moving into second heading into the bell lap. 
He swept by Mitchell with half a lap remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pace was slow and I didn't worry about the time," Barreda said. "I knew I 
had one of the stronger kicks and all I had to do was be within two seconds of 
the lead with 300 meters to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreda, who is being recruited by UCLA and California, also finished fifth in 
the 3,200 meters in 9:40.94 to help Loyola to second in the team standings with 
59 points behind Morningside, which won its third consecutive title with 78 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Pentecost of Loyola finished second in the discus with a throw of 158 
feet 11 inches and third in the shotput with a heave of 49-9. Vince Cogan and 
Brian Duff were third in the 400 (49.08) and 800 (1:55.79), respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Cogan anchored the 1,600-meter relay team of Duff, Ed Opucku and Damon 
Hamilton to third in 3:22.62. Duff and Cogan also combined with Hamilton and 
Francisco Paredes to finish third in the 400-meter relay in 42.96. Paredes 
bounded 44-8 to finish second in the triple jump and Loyola's Dan Baumeister 
also cleared 13-6 for fifth in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Williams, formerly of Dorsey, anchored the Long Beach City College 
men's 1,600-meter relay team to a school-record 3:06.81 with a 45.9 anchor in 
the State junior college championships at Cerritos College. Williams was also 
fourth in the 400 in 47.52 to help the Vikings tie Riverside for the team title 
with 100 points and earn a share of their 11th state championship in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Auria Roberto of Glendale, last year's City runner-up at 3,200 meters for 
Belmont High, shaved nearly four seconds off her school record in the 5,000 to 
take fifth in 17:52.58 and came back to take sixth in the 1,500 in 4:45.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynette Christian of West Los Angeles, a three-time City long jump champion 
for Dorsey, finished third in her specialty with a leap of 19-1 and fifth in 
the 100 in 12.17. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivo Rodriguez of Trade Tech was second in the 10,000 in 29:57.49 in a race won 
by Riverside's Wilhelm Gidabuday in a meet-record 29:39.31 and also finished 
fifth in the 5,000 in 14:30.76. Brian Clark of Santa Monica, a state finalist 
in the long jump for Fremont last year, was fifth at 23-4.

VOLLEYBALL; LOYOLA FALLS AFTER BEING POINT AWAY FROM VICTORY

 It took 3 hours 20 minutes for Laguna Beach to beat Loyola, 9-15, 15-8, 15-13, 
12-15, 16-14, in a Southern Section Division I boys' volleyball semifinal 
Wednesday at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in the playoffs, Laguna Beach was a point away from being 
eliminated when the Cubs took a 14-13 lead and had the serve in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dan Styles and Beau Bianchi, who had 36 and 27 kills, respectively, 
kept the Artists alive with several key plays. After Styles held off Loyola 
with a pair of crucial side outs, Bianchi put a spike on the line to draw the 
Artists even, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded sideouts before Bianchi teamed with Trevor Whalley on a block 
to give the Artists a match point. Loyola outside hitter David Olson was then 
whistled for sliding under the net, giving Laguna Beach the deciding point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a well-played match on both sides," Loyola Coach Darrick 
Lucero said, "but we made a few mistakes in the late stages of the fifth game 
that cost us the match. We had problems with our blocking the last few plays of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs (20-2) return five of their six starters next season. Olson, who will 
attend Harvard, is the only graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 After Loyola dominated the first game, Laguna Beach came to life in Game 2 and 
jumped out to a 14-4 lead on the way to evening the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third game, the Artists blew leads of 10-5 and 13-10, but eventually 
won the game on a Justin Maison service ace. The biggest battle was in Game 4 
as the teams went through 22 consecutive sideouts before the Cubs won.

 Huntington Park 7, Crenshaw 6 -- Darryl Strawberry will not be returning to 
Dodger Stadium and neither will his alma mater, Crenshaw.

CITY SECTION FINALS; DORSEY SPRINTS AWAY FROM FIELD TO GRAB TITLE; TRACK: A 
BALANCED BOYS' TEAM SCORES FINISHES WELL AHEAD OF RUNNER-UP WASHINGTON FOR ITS 
SECOND STRAIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP. DORSEY GIRLS TIE FOR SECOND.

 The Dorsey High boys' bid to repeat as team track champion was never in doubt 
in the City Section finals Thursday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons amassed 75 points, scoring in 11 of 15 events, to become the first 
school in seven years to win consecutive City titles. It was the fifth 
championship for Dorsey, which also won titles in 1966, '68 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, powered by Jim McElroy's victories in the 100 (10.81) and 200 
(21.47), was second with 42 points and El Camino Real was third with 40. 
Roosevelt and Belmont tied with Granada Hills for sixth with 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really focus on the team title, but scoring in every event," said 
Dorsey senior Anthony Mabry, who placed second in the 110-meter high hurdles in 
14.84 seconds and sixth in the 300 intermediate hurdles in 40.34. "If everybody 
placed in the events they were in, we thought we would come out on top again or 
at least in the first two." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, about the only uncertainty for Dorsey was its reign in the 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax gave Dorsey a scare but could not prevent the Dons from capturing 
their second consecutive 400-meter relay title and an unprecedented sixth 
1,600-meter relay title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick Brown out-leaned Fairfax's Az-zahir Hakim to give Dorsey a 0.02-second 
victory in the 400 relay in 40.68. In the 1,600 relay, Gene Shepard withstood a 
late charge from Jason Lewis of Fairfax as the Dons squeaked by the Lions, 
3:17.19 to 3:17.76. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had a lot more depth," said Dorsey Coach Ralph Tilley. "I don't 
know which title is more gratifying. This win was a lot harder mentally on the 
coaching staff. I was hoping to just win, 30 points or one point would have 
been fine. The kids came through with heart. Everybody put out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabry ran on both relays along with Leo Settle, who finished second in the 100 
and 200 meters in 10.85 and 21.63. Jabulani Smith-Freeman was fourth in the 
long jump and triple jump and ran a leg on the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard and Anthony Wheeler, a member of the 1,600-meter relay, were second in 
the 400 (48.76) and 800 (1:58.49) while Keith Friday added a third-place finish 
in the high jump (6-4) for the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers in each event advance to the State meet Friday and 
Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' competition, Betty Butler of Dorsey won the 400 and 800 in 57.41 and 
2:19.10. The sophomore also anchored the Dons' 1,600-meter relay team to third 
in 4:04.15 as Dorsey tied Westchester for second with 47 points. Gardena won 
its first title with 75 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Glenn of Dorsey finished third in the 100 hurdles in 16.38 and placed 
first in the high jump, clearing 4-10 to win on fewer misses.  
</P>
<P>
 An untied shoelace did not prevent Keisha Griffis of Washington from defending 
her 300-meter low hurdle title in 43.59. The junior also finished second in the 
100 hurdles. Humberto Sanchez of South Gate qualified State meet Friday and 
Saturday in the 3,200, winning in 9:35.35, and in the 1,600, placing third in 
4:29.07. Ray Duarte of Roosevelt won the 800 in 1:57.86 and Amar Brisco of 
Washington sailed 23-0 to win the long jump.

ANDRETTI TRIES A LAST TIME TO SHAKE INDY 500 JINX; THIS IS HIS 29TH AND FINAL 
RACE; HE'S WON ONCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can it be true that today will be Mario Andretti's 29th and last Indianapolis 
500 -- and he has won it only once? 
</P>
<P>
 Since he came here and finished third as a rookie in 1965, Andretti and the 
500 have been as synonymous as bacon and eggs, mother and apple pie or Babe 
Ruth and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He won in 1969, before several of the drivers in today's race were born, but 
his presence has dominated the month of May almost every year he's been here. 
He has started on the pole three times, been on the front row eight times and 
led more laps than anyone but Al Unser Jr. and Ralph DePalma. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been the favorite more times than he can remember. But only once has he 
taken the checkered flag, and when he did it was the least expected. He had 
crashed his car in practice, burning his face, before painfully driving a 
year-old backup car to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I won, I felt it was about time, it was going to be just the first of 
many, but something happened, I guess you could call it fate," he said. "I'm 
still looking for that second one. Maybe this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Andretti has announced that this is his final season, he is not 
leaving the way that A.J. Foyt, Richard Petty and some others have left -- as 
noncompetitive drivers hanging on and embarrassing themselves with 
back-in-the-pack runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti figures to be a force in today's 500 miles. He qualified on the third 
row in one of new Lola-Ford Cosworths entered by Paul Newman and Carl Haas. He 
has been running well all month and last Thursday was the quickest car on 
Carburetion Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'm as quick as I used to be, but I'm quick enough to be 
involved," he said. "I feel that I'm still a factor and I can be part of the 
boys who are playing up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Andretti led 72 of the 200 laps and was still in front after 435 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have won it except for a bad set of tires we put on during my last 
pit stop," he said. "They unbalanced the car, and I dropped back and finished 
fifth. But I had been in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 When Andretti won the Phoenix 200 last year at 53, he became the oldest driver 
to win an Indy car race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear people say I fell into it after (Paul) Tracy and Emmo (Emerson 
Fittipaldi) dropped out, but I look at it as payback," he said. "I've given up 
more than my share of them that way . . . especially at this place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indianapolis might not owe me one, but it sure would be nice if it were 
kinder to me. I've certainly had a lot of disappointments here because of the 
fact that I've led a lot of laps, but not the right one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were the Indianapolis 400, I'd probably have five wins." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to catalogue Andretti's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be 1987 when he had the fastest car all month, sat on the pole and 
led for 170 laps before announcer Tom Carnegie intoned those dreaded words, 
"Mario is slowing on the backstretch"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it 1982 when he was equally dominant and was wrecked before the race 
started? 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about 1981 when he was declared the winner after Bobby Unser was 
penalized for illegal passing, only to have the ruling changed and Unser 
reinstated as the winner? 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe 1966 and 1967 when he set qualifying records both years before 
dropping out with niggling engine problems? 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is crazy. Nothing makes sense," Andretti said. "I win when I 
shouldn't have because it was my day. It was like the year Danny Sullivan won. 
He spins all the way around and doesn't hit anything and goes on to beat me. It 
was his day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Rick Mears. He's led 429 laps and won four times. I've led 556 and 
won once. On the other hand, thank goodness I got that one under my belt. If I 
had been blanked, it would be like Dale Earnhardt and the Daytona 500. You 
can't tell me he's not a helluva better driver than a lot of guys who have won, 
but as long as he doesn't win, he's got the monkey on his back." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his personality has thrust him into the spotlight every year since 
he came here with Al Dean three decades ago, this has been Mario's busiest 
month ever. Media requests for interviews have been overwhelming, he has been 
the honored guest at a host of civic and racing functions, and last Thursday 
night he was toasted and roasted at an " Arrivederci , Mario" dinner in 
downtown Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm savoring every moment," he said, "but not at the expense of the race. I 
knew it would be difficult but not impossible. I still came here with the same 
purpose I came with in 1965, to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better believe I want to win this race. The pressure is on but that's the 
kind of pressure we like. We live under pressure so it's nothing really 
different, except it's the last opportunity I will have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to myself at night. I've said, 'Don't do anything different.' It 
doesn't work. The real test of how I handle the situation is the real challenge 
itself. I think I've been around long enough to know how to control that. I 
don't want to go into uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "My focus is the same as it has always been. I want to be competitive. If I 
can be competitive Sunday, maybe the fates will shine on me." 
</P>
<P>
 If not, it will still be Arrivederci , Mario.

FIXMEISTER OF HOOPS; BROWN LIFTS ABA BURDEN FROM PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ATTNER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Brown is at it again. The Fixmeister of Hoops has worked yet another 
miracle with his latest reconstruction project, the Pacers. He took over a team 
that was .500 last season, traded off its best player and goaded his charges 
into places the franchise has not visited since the ABA folded 18 seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this spring and a sweep of the overconfident Magic, the Pacers were 0-6 
in first-round appearances, 0-4 since 1990. By toppling the favored Hawks in 
round two, the Pacers are a heady four victories away from the conference 
championship. No Brown-coached NBA team had ever advanced beyond the second 
round; this group certainly seemed unlikely to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he has revitalized a franchise that was dying in the middle of prime 
basketball country. He has 'em dancing in the streets and blowing their car 
horns, something the fans did with great enthusiasm the night the Pacers 
finished their series against the Hawks. In the midst of all this revelry was a 
unifying theme, corny as it might be: Boom, Baby. That's what Bobby (Slick) 
Leonard, the former Pacers coach who works the radio broadcasts of games, says 
after a Pacer makes a 3-pointer. He was smart enough to copyright the phrase, 
which now appears on T-shirts and as the title of a team song. All this from a 
financially struggling franchise that even this season rarely sold out. Now try 
to find a game ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, first the Magic are gone despite winning three more games than the 
Pacers in the regular season; then the Hawks, which were plus-10 over the 
Pacers. So what if this fantasy won't have a happy ending; Brown's boys will 
lose in workmanlike fashion to the Knicks. We're still talking happy times here 
for a city and a team that stopped having a love affair about the same moment 
the red, white and blue basketball of the ABA was retired. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad NBA years have produced just three winning records. Even the revered 
Jack Ramsay quit seven games into his third season, tired of selfish players. 
But Brown walks into this turmoil and, following a 16-23 start, the Sonics had 
a better record over the final 43 games than anyone except the Sonics. And by 
eliminating the Hawks, they have won 15 of their last 17 games, including a 7-2 
playoff record. The Pacers' 47 victories set a team record, but that is nothing 
new for Brown. With the Spurs, Nuggets, Nets and Clippers, he established 
similar team-bests -- and quickly. Brown, who played and coached in the ABA, 
finally has lifted the burden of the gaudy ABA years from this franchise and 
introduced -- Boom, Baby -- a new era for the Pacers. About time. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodness gracious, what does Brown know about winning that eluded his 
predecessors at all these pro jobs? And here's another teaser: Will he stick 
around this time for more than a cup of coffee and a few wonderful memories? He 
has a new wife; come July, he will be a father for the fourth time; he has a 
general manager who is also his best friend; and he is surrounded by hard-core 
basketball fans who will really appreciate his accomplishments. If he is ever 
going to win an NBA title, this seems the place to settle down and ride it out. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has never made the commitment to finish what he always starts with such 
an impressive, ah, boom. Because of his relentless wanderlust -- Brown has held 
eight coaching jobs in 22 years and suffered only one losing season -- he has 
never been equated with Auerbach, Riley, Smith, Knight, Krzyzewski, even Daly. 
And that's a shame, because this guy is a great coach. Look what he has done 
with his bunch of overachievers. Neither NBC nor TNT featured a Pacers game 
this season. Good reason. Other than Reggie Miller, what is there to thrill you 
about the Pacers? They start CBA grad Haywoode Workman at playmaker and need 
significant minutes from Antonio Davis, who, like Workman, was playing in Italy 
last season. These guys in Prime Time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am flabbergasted," Brown says. "This was going to be a season of 
evaluation, so we could determine what we needed to do to get us to the next 
level. I never anticipated this." General Manager Donnie Walsh adds, "He's done 
an absolutely phenomenal coaching job. This may be only a happening in 1994, 
but we are going to ride it for all it's worth anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Brown know? It all stems from roots growing out of his college 
days at North Carolina under Frank McGuire, then Dean Smith. He's one of the 
last of a generation of coaches who yell and prod and provoke, who consider 
winning, not the feelings of players, to be most important, who have 
established rules and expect them to be followed without exception, who target 
their stars for the most verbal abuse. After an embarrassing second-game loss 
to the Hawks, Brown subjected his players to more than two hours of 
high-powered screaming. In a generation that rebels against such outbursts, he 
gets away with it because of his pedigree. These guys have been losers, he's 
been a success, so they shut up and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Larry, you have to accept what he says as being correct," says Spurs 
center David Robinson, who played under Brown for 3 1/2 seasons. "He's going to 
constantly correct you, and you have to understand that. If the players don't 
like him, it won't work." The Spurs were 21-61 in Brown's first year, 56-26 the 
next, after Robinson came aboard. But the players ultimately tuned him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Mitchell, the Pacers' veteran reserve forward, admits Brown's newest team 
resisted his intense ways. "But after a while, you have to give in," he says. 
"Because he won't let up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the young players to listen to what is being said and not to the tone 
and the intensity," says Byron Scott, the former Lakers star who was signed in 
December veteran leadership to a team that was de' pending on the flighty 
Miller for peer direction. But Scott admits that sometimes "it's tough to 
ignore the heat involved in how he says things." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Danny Manning finally rebelled. Manning, who was Brown's star when he 
coached Kansas to the NCAA title in 1988, found himself reunited with Brown 
when the Wandering Man took over the Clippers two years ago. They eventually 
had a yelling match in a hotel lobby, an experience that Brown says "was a 
killer for me, an enlightening thing because I care so much about Danny. I've 
adjusted. I want these guys to like me, I really do. It is important to me."

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; ALL NORMAL OPEN NIGHTMARES ARE NOW IN PLACE AT OAKMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Open is a little more than two weeks away from its shrunken-fairway, 
roller-coaster-green, ball-eating-rough, four-day joy-ride through Oakmont 
Country Club. Usually, it's a blast there, except if you happened to be unlucky 
enough to lose your ball in rough that is only slightly shorter than every club 
in your bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont isn't exactly a place for the faint of heart. The United States Golf 
Assn. has ruled that the rough be no more than four to five inches long, a far 
cry from 1983, the last time the Open was played there, when six-inch rough was 
standard and so was the complaining from the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairways are so narrow, you have to turn sideways to walk them. Actually, 
they are about 30 yards across, so hitting it straight will be at even more of 
a premium than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough, there are the greens. The only thing faster are the cars 
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which oddly bisects the course and puts holes 
Nos. 2 through 8 on the other side of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that somebody is going to pay the price for these conditions. It's 
happened there before, we have learned. The only thing that golf admires more 
than a great winner is a great loser, and Oakmont has had its share. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two of them are playing in this Open -- Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who won his only U.S. Open title in 1960 when his closest challenger 
was an amateur named Jack Nicklaus, probably could have won two more, in 1962 
and 1973. On the final day in 1962, Palmer and Nicklaus were tied with five 
holes to play, and both parred each hole to finish tied, although Palmer could 
have ended it. He missed birdie putts of less than 15 feet on Nos. 14, 17 and 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus won the playoff the next day with a 71, three strokes ahead of 
Palmer. It was Nicklaus' first Open as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was tied for the lead after 54 holes of the 1973 U.S. Open at three 
under par. His only problem was 26-year-old Johnny Miller, who was three over 
par and getting ready to shoot an Open-record 63 to deny Palmer again. Palmer's 
fourth round included a missed short birdie putt at No. 11 and three 
consecutive bogeys, after he looked at the scoreboard and was stunned to see 
Miller leading. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson arrived at Oakmont as the defending U.S. Open champion in 1983 and was 
well aware of what evil the course could conjure up. Watson had lost the 1978 
PGA Championship at Oakmont when he blew a five-shot lead after 54 holes -- and 
a four-shot lead with nine to go. Watson double-bogeyed No. 10, shot a 
three-over-par 38 on the back nine and lost to John Mahaffey in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the '83 Open, Oakmont's back nine got to Watson again. He had a 
three-shot lead with nine holes to go, but came home with another 38 and lost 
to Larry Nelson by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add Oakmont: Oakmont was designed before they found a place to put it. Henry 
C. Fownes, who sold his steel company to industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1896, 
and Fownes' son drew the layout of the course on paper, then set out to find 
the land on which to build it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fownes located the acreage he was looking for in the borough of Oakmont, about 
15 miles from Pittsburgh. But he also found a big problem, according to Jim 
Finegan in the June issue of Golf magazine: Too many oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to create a big, open layout like a British links course, so 
Townes had the trees cut down and in 1903 got what he wanted -- a bleak, barren 
and very long golf course -- eight par-fives, one par-six and a par of 80. 
There also was more sand than anyplace except the Mojave, with more than 200 
bunkers on the course. At one time, the bunkers numbered 350. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Armour, who won the first of Oakmont's U.S Opens in 1927, called it a 
"cruel and treacherous playground." 
</P>
<P>
 After six Opens, the trees at Oakmont are as large as the greens, although the 
putting surfaces still resembles Armour's playground with their speed and 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New racket: Except for the Champions tour and TeamTennis, Jimmy Connors is 
using his racket a lot less than his golf clubs these days. Connors, 41, winner 
of 109 tennis titles, including eight Grand Slams, has a list of 100 golf 
courses he would like to play and is working his way through it. 
</P>
<P>
 First on the list? "Augusta," said Connors, who lives in Santa Ynez and said 
he plays every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors is trying to arrange his schedule so he can be at Oakmont next month 
to watch the U.S. Open. He said the successful golfers at Oakmont could be the 
straight hitters on the narrow fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see Tom Kite or Corey Pavin doing well, or the old guys like Tom 
Watson, Jack Nicklaus or Raymond Floyd," said Connors, who also thinks Seve 
Ballesteros could prosper. The USGA did not give Ballesteros an exemption, and 
the 36-year-old Spanish player must be No. 1 or No. 2 on the European tour 
money list to be eligible for the Open. Ballesteros, who was No. 1 last week, 
played an event this week in Europe, so his current ranking will be known later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Golf Digest rates Nick Faldo as the favorite at Oakmont. 
</P>

 Abandon ship?: The Queen Mary Open has been around for 23 years. It's the 
tournament where such players as Fred Couples, Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson and 
Mark O'Mears made their pro debuts, but chances are it won't be back in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Ives, who founded the event and remains the chairman, said the Queen Mary 
Open may ship out if he can't find a sponsor for the event, which finished its 
1994 run Saturday at Lakewood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't scare tactics, this is reality," Ives said. "I'm tired of 
subsidizing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other players who made their pro debut in the Queen Mary Open are Corey Pavin, 
Bob Tway, Keith Clearwater, Jay Don Blake, Duffy Waldorf, Bill Glassen and Dan 
Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the Open have a rich tradition, it also carries a $100,000 
purse. But Ives said sponsor dollars are drying up and county fees are too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Queen Mary: Mac O'Grady played in the tournament at various times under 
three names -- Mac O'Grady, Phil McGleno, Phil O'Grady. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 PGA at Riviera: The PGA is looking for 2,000 volunteers for next year's PGA 
Championship, which will be played Aug. 7-13, 1995, at Riviera. For 
information, call (310) 573-7780. The last time the PGA Championship was held 
at Riviera was 1983, when Hal Sutton won by a stroke over Nicklaus. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Back, back back: Nancy Lopez, who hurt her back at the McDonald's LPGA 
Championship two weeks ago, picked up her clubs again to play in the JCPenney 
LPGA Skins Game in Frisco, Tex., this weekend. Lopez, the all-time leading 
money winner in Skins history with $320,000, had a bulging disk and was advised 
to take a month off. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez didn't. She isn't intimidated by injuries, or much of anything, with the 
possible exception of Laura Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the only person I'm intimidated by because I can't out-hit her," Lopez 
said. "She out-hits me by 40 yards. That's pretty intimidating." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaal Wilkes, Jerry West, Dick Butkus, James Worthy, Doug Christie, Luc 
Robitaille, Willie Gault, Steve Garvey, Elgin Baylor, Johnny Mathis, Cathy Lee 
Crosby, Andy Garcia, James Garner, James Woods, Peter Falk and others will play 
in the fifth Toyota/Jerry Buss celebrity golf tournament June 6 at Riviera. 
Proceeds from the event will benefit the Lakers-YMCA Junior League. Tickets for 
the dinner and auction are $65. Details: (310) 419-3127 . . . Vince Ferragamo's 
12th celebrity golf tournament to benefit the Orange County Special Olympics 
will be held June 7 at Los Coyotes Country Club in Buena Park. Last year's 
event raised $75,000. Details: (714) 633-1099 . . . Andrea Gaston of Canoga 
Park won the City women's golf tournament at Rancho Park. Gaston shot rounds of 
75-76-75 to finish five shots ahead of Barbara Stephan of Torrance. Gaston was 
the runner-up last year to Sue Rennie, who did not play. Stephan won the City 
women's senior title last year at Rancho Park . . . Deadline to enter the 77th 
City men's golf championship and handicap tournament is next Saturday. The 
stroke-play event will be held June 18-19 and 25-26 at Griffith Park and Rancho 
Park. The event is sponsored by the Department of Recreation and Parks. Scott 
Gibson of Huntington Beach is the defending champion.

SUNDAY PROFILE; ENOUGH IS ENOUGH; FOR 20 YEARS, ACTRESS LANI O'GRADY WAS 
GRIPPED BY PANIC ATTACKS. BUT LAST YEAR, A PSYCHIATRIST IN MISSION VIEJO 
ENTERED THE PICTURE AND HELPED HER TURN HER LIFE AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lani O'Grady played Mary, the Bradford clan's strong and self-confident eldest 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the series' heyday, however, fans were unaware that O'Grady suffered 
panic attacks so severe that she'd frequently run to her dressing room to pop a 
Valium or two and once shook and cried so much during a scene that someone had 
to drive her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest point in her 20-year bout with panic attacks came early last year, 
when agoraphobia kept her at home and her body was so toxic from abusing 
prescription drugs and alcohol that she was experiencing memory blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, mere panic attacks would have been a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in panic: Fear was the only four-letter word I used," said O'Grady, 
39, whose life changed dramatically last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The turn-around came when O'Grady was admitted to Charter Hospital in Mission 
Viejo, where a psychiatrist, Martin Jensen, discovered the cause of her 
problem: a brain chemical imbalance, which is now being treated with 
non-narcotic medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen describes O'Grady's condition when she checked into the hospital a year 
ago as no less than catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very near death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment, O'Grady said, has made all the difference in the world: "I have 
a life today." 
</P>
<P>
 Since an "Entertainment Tonight" segment on her ordeal aired last summer, 
O'Grady has been making the rounds of TV talk shows. Jensen, for whom she has 
been working as a personal assistant and office manager since last fall, always 
accompanies her on the air. As O'Grady said, "I can't answer the medical 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen initially brought O'Grady into his office to help answer mail. Their 
talk show appearances -- particularly one last year on "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- 
spurred thousands of viewers to write requesting information about brain 
chemical imbalances, which, Jensen said, can cause everything from panic 
attacks and depression to agoraphobia and "any type of feeling of mental 
discomfort." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady and Jensen, who recently returned from another round of talk shows, 
also garnered some unexpected publicity earlier this year: They found 
themselves the subject of a supermarket tabloid story in which Jensen's 
estranged wife claims that he walked out on their five-year marriage last fall 
to be with O'Grady. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said he was "let go" from his position as associate medical director at 
Charter Hospital in Mission Viejo as a result of the controversy created by the 
Star magazine story. A hospital spokeswoman declined to comment on Jensen's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions about his relationship with O'Grady, Jensen, 40, 
described it as being strictly on a "friendship level" and said he respects the 
"doctor-patient boundary." He calls the claims made in the article 
"destructive" and insists that they "should not be given any more attention. 
It's better for myself and Lani to let that pass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At O'Grady's request, Jensen was on hand to talk about the medical side of her 
story during an interview in Jensen's office in which she discussed her years 
of suffering panic attacks, her career as a child actress and her life today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures taken a few months before she was hospitalized a year ago show a 
barely recognizable O'Grady. She was overweight and bloated, largely because of 
her drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Now lean again, with stylish, honey-blond hair, she looks like only a slightly 
older version of Mary Bradford. Self-confident and assertive, she spoke 
enthusiastically about getting better. Her distinctively low voice broke only 
once as she described how she owes her life to Jensen's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happier than I have ever been in my entire life -- even before I started 
suffering -- and I'm a different person because I can help other people like me 
get well," said O'Grady, who often talks with Jensen's patients on the phone 
and when they come into the office. 
</P>
<P>
 When patients talk to her, she said, "they know they're talking to somebody 
who knows what they're feeling." And being a celebrity is an asset, she said. 
"They feel comfortable with me, so it's really neat. It's like my second 
career, and it beats the heck out of the first one." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say she hasn't always enjoyed acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other former child actors making the rounds of the talk shows paint a negative 
picture of their early years in show business. Not O'Grady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real hard time with people who have been successful in this business 
as young children . . . and (as adults) they are no longer wanted by Hollywood 
-- and, yeah, Hollywood is not a user-friendly place. 
</P>
<P>
 "But rather than accepting responsibility for their life, it's easier to say, 
'The business is the reason I'm so messed up today.' I hate that. It really 
angers me."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From her perspective as someone whose modeling career began as an infant and 
who began acting at a young age, O'Grady said, "the business is a wonderful 
thing to experience." 
</P>
<P>
 She followed the lead of her brother, Don Grady, one of the original 
Mousketeers, who went on to co-star in the popular '60s sitcom "My Three Sons" 
and is now a successful Hollywood composer. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers visiting her brother on the "My Three Sons" set when she was 6. 
When the show's star, Fred MacMurray, heard her low voice, he turned around and 
said, "Who said that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and said, 'I did, sir,' " she recalled. "And he said, 'Boy, you 
ought to be in the business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady, whose childhood goal was "to do a family show just like my brother," 
didn't have any trouble finding an agent. Her mother, Mary Grady, is one of the 
top children's agents in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 But knowing the emotional toll the rejection that accompanies an acting career 
can have on young actors, Mary Grady said she never pushed her daughter into 
acting. In fact, she said, it wasn't until her daughter was 13 and kept 
hounding her to send her out on an audition that she finally relented, "just to 
satisfy her." 
</P>
<P>
 Sent out to read for a two-line bit in "High Chaparral," Mary Grady said, her 
daughter wound up landing the lead in the episode, "and she just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady recalls that she worked so often as a teen-ager that "I was very 
rarely in school. And it was real uncomfortable when I'd go back because they'd 
all make fun of me, especially in junior high."  
</P>
<P>
 She legally changed her real name -- Lanita Rose Agrati -- to Lani O'Grady at 
18 when she landed her role in "Eight Is Enough" in 1974. For professional 
reasons, her mother and brother had already changed their last name from Agrati 
to Grady. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady recalls having her first "strong feeling of anxiety" when her parents 
divorced when she was 5, but any feelings of anxiety didn't resurface until she 
was 16 or 17 and then only sporadically: "It was nothing that I thought really 
meant anything. Anxiety? So what." 
</P>
<P>
 By 18, however, she had begun having regular panic attacks; the first doctor 
she saw prescribed Valium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took away every piece of anxiety I had, so I started using Valium 
regularly, and I found when I couldn't take the Valium I would have these panic 
attacks," O'Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until she was 21 that panic disorder was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last three or four years before that," she said, "I thought that 
maybe I had a mental problem: What's going on? Am I having a nervous 
breakdown?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to have the disorder "fixed," O'Grady said, she saw 32 different 
doctors -- psychiatrists, internists, neurologists -- over the years. "The only 
kind of doctor I didn't see was a vet." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the doctors prescribed Valium or another mild tranquilizer, Xanax. 
"What they did is they tried to fix the symptom, not the problem," said 
O'Grady, who experienced only minor panic attacks during the first few years of 
doing "Eight Is Enough." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the third or fourth year, she said, "it was necessary to take Valium 
during the day to just be OK enough to work, to calm me down." 
</P>
<P>
 When the actress playing the mother on the series died, the writers wrote her 
death into the script. Ironically, as the eldest daughter on the show, O'Grady 
said, her character "was pretty much the one who held everything together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing because in my own life I was beginning to fall apart, and to 
have to maintain that kind of strength on screen was, at times, extremely 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The series ended production in 1980; four months later, O'Grady checked into a 
hospital for Valium detox. She was in and out of four other rehabs over the 
next decade, a time in which she primarily lived in Dana Point and earned a 
living from occasional acting jobs, residuals and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But while she managed to remain sober for nearly six years in the '80s, she 
said, she continued to feel varying degrees of anxiety. Then it got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, O'Grady said, "I started really abusing prescription medication. You 
build up a resistance, and you need more to do the same, and it was getting 
pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she moved to Burbank to be near her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "A part of my family is very religious, and so they brought me to church," she 
said. "They thought that would be the way to solve my panic attacks. Well, 
heck, I was ready to try anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Grady said she was never aware her daughter experienced panic attacks 
during the time she was living at home, until her condition had become 
painfully obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what a mother does and that's try to help (your child) out," she said. 
"Finally, I couldn't stand watching her die." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time O'Grady first went to Jensen, about three years ago, she 
acknowledges, "I was in pretty bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept wanting to try different (non-narcotic) medications on me to get me 
well, and I was just not cooperative. I would try a medication, and I would go 
back to the Xanax or the Valium because it was easier than trying to get well. 
I wasn't ready. The bottom line is I hadn't gotten scared enough." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last two months before she went into the hospital, she said, she 
had been getting Valium prescriptions from four different doctors and "taking 
at least five times more than I should have." She also had begun drinking again 
and, she said, was agoraphobic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring she returned to Jensen "to see if I could get more drugs out of 
him, and he took one look at me and said, 'No more pills.' He said, 'You're not 
going to be one of the phone calls I get; you're not going to be a casualty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But what he next said to her, she said, changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Life is fleeting, like that' -- she snapped her fingers -- 'and 
there is no more. You're dead forever, not dead for a couple of days.' He 
looked me right in the eye, and I didn't lose eye contact the entire time he 
said it." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before she checked into Charter Hospital, O'Grady suffered a 
complete memory blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how toxic my body was," she said, adding that she doesn't remember her 
first two days in the hospital. "They were afraid I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said that although O'Grady had become motivated enough to get into the 
hospital, "we couldn't have made any progress unless the chemical imbalance 
were fixed. That's when the real change happens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said a variety of brain chemical imbalances can cause panic attacks. 
When he found the right medication for O'Grady, he said, it took less than an 
hour for her to feel the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was incredible," O'Grady said. "I had a feeling I hadn't had in 18 years, 
which was whatever normal is." She laughed, adding: "I didn't know what normal 
was anymore, but I felt like I had my life, I felt human." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady takes a non-narcotic medication daily. Today, she said, "I have no 
desire to drink at all, and I don't need to abuse any medication, because I'm 
fine; I don't have panic attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Since going to work in Jensen's office in the fall, O'Grady has set aside her 
acting career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money can't buy what I get from people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a script is being written for an "Eight Is Enough" TV movie, she said, and 
if it's given the go-ahead, she would happily join her co-stars on what would 
be the third Bradford family TV reunion since 1987 -- and the first since she 
has gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say that back then, if I had known there was someone like 
this, boy, I tell you. . . ," she said, looking at Jensen. "I love acting, but 
if I could have been fixed back then -- there were so many times I couldn't 
appreciate it because I was so sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing up, she added, "It makes me sad that I didn't find him earlier -- that 
I could have enjoyed what blessings I had even more than I did."

STANDARD METHOD DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK, JENSEN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission Viejo psychiatrist Martin Jensen says everyone has some degree of 
brain chemical differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they're assets; other times they're drawbacks," he said, but if 
they're causing problems concerning the quality of your life, "it's worth 
treating." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen believes the standard psychiatric method of diagnosis and treatment 
works for most people, "but it's a little limited in certain complex 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Valium is an appropriate treatment for people experiencing panic 
attacks, for example, he said, "but other times it's masking an underlying 
problem that can be corrected more efficiently and safely." The underlying 
problem, he said, can be deficiencies, instabilities or excesses of certain 
brain chemicals or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just making a diagnosis based on a patient's symptoms and then 
prescribing one medication, Jensen said, he usually prescribes a sequence of 
medications to further define the underlying brain chemistry and correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 The medication trials usually can be done at home, he said, and most chemical 
imbalances will be figured out within two office visits over a six-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said a patient's reactions to the different medications clue him to 
what brain transmitter system is disturbed, and it can then be treated with a 
safe, low-dose medication. He said that "when a proper match occurs between the 
medication and a person's chemical imbalance, they know it" usually within 24 
to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Other psychiatrists, however, say that it typically takes three or four weeks 
before the effects of many medications become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Globus, a Newport Beach psychiatrist, said not enough is known about 
brain chemistry or the effects of medications on brain chemistry to diagnose a 
neuro-chemical defect on the basis of medication response alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Globus, a professor of psychiatry and philosophy at UC Irvine, said treating 
brain chemical imbalances has become increasingly important as newer and better 
drugs have become available during the past 15 years and "are a very important 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in my opinion, it can be carried too far and the psychological aspects 
are neglected and they're very important to treat also. I think the interaction 
between medication and psychotherapy is more powerful than either treatment 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen, who is writing a manual on his treatment technique for doctors and 
patients, said he respects the standard approach to psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to add on to the current system a concept that has helped certain 
people that were not responsive" to standard treatment, he said. DENNIS

FACTS ARE CLEAR: A BLACK MAN IS DEAD; BUT THE TRUTH IS ELUSIVE; OAKLAND: FAMILY 
AND NEIGHBORS SAY AN INNOCENT MAN WAS KILLED PROTECTING HIS HOME. OFFICERS 
CONTEND THEY FIRED IN SELF-DEFENSE. THEY BROKE DOWN THE DOOR DURING A 
CREDIT-CARD FRAUD INVESTIGATION, BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING.

<P>
 Nathan Roy Cosby is dead. He was shot in the back of the head by a police 
officer during a raid on his home. He was not a suspect in any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, say Cosby's family and neighbors, is that an innocent black man was 
gunned down protecting his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, says the Oakland Police Department, is that the officer fired in 
self-defense after Cosby aimed a loaded handgun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is about race. It's about a gulf of fear and misunderstanding that 
divides some American police departments and the communities they're sworn to 
protect and to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Roy Cosby, at age 32, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who battered down the door of 9950 Longfellow Ave. on Jan. 6 
weren't looking for Roy Cosby. According to court documents, they were looking 
for clothes they believed Cosby's wife, Melinda, had bought with stolen credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve to 15 officers blocked off the quiet East Oakland street and surrounded 
Cosby's gray, one-story bungalow just after 7 a.m. They had a search warrant 
for the house and a car parked outside. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no stolen goods there, just Cosby and his two Rottweilers. 
Melinda Cosby and the couple's 6-year-old daughter, Donita, were sleeping at a 
relative's house. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, Cosby had worked until 10:30 p.m., his regular shift as an 
Oakland Unified School District janitor. His bedroom was in the back of the 
house; neighbors and family say he slept late. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes before 7:30 a.m., as neighbors prepared for work, the entry team 
moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Gill, Cosby's next-door neighbor, got out of bed to investigate a 
strange rumbling when a single gunshot came from the back of the house. As she 
ran to her son's bedroom, she heard men running and shouting. It seemed like 
they were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on both sides of my house. They were in my back yard. It sounded 
like they were on the roof," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A little while later, she heard more shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, more than 30 police officers and federal agents converged on 
the neighborhood, said Leo Bazile, an attorney and former Oakland city 
councilman who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry team members wore blue jumpsuits, bulletproof vests and knit hats. 
Some carried shields. Some had guns strapped to their chests with Velcro 
strips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just like you see them on television or in the newsreels," Bazile 
said. "These guys were dressed for combat." 
</P>
<P>
 What had happened? Oakland police say several officers knocked at the front 
door, identified themselves and announced they were serving a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Officer Eric Belker was in an adjacent back yard when Cosby opened 
the kitchen window 15 to 25 feet away. Cosby held his loaded semiautomatic 
handgun, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at the officer, looked away. That's when he looked back, said 
something and pointed the gun," said Lt. Clyde Sims, whose homicide 
investigation found no evidence a crime occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, the entry team broke down the front door and Belker fired a 
single shot from his semiautomatic pistol, Sims said. The bullet entered the 
back of Cosby's head and lodged in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible when that door went in, he turned to look and that's when 
Belker fired," Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they then were attacked by one of Cosby's dogs. The animal was 
killed with three shotgun blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedics wheeled out Roy Cosby and took him to Highland Hospital. He was 
dead on arrival at 8:04 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Peter Peterson, Oakland Police Department: 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea who Mr. Cosby was when he came to the window. . . . We had no 
idea who he was when he pointed a gun at the officer. . . . If he had just 
opened the door when we asked him to, if he hadn't had a weapon in his hand, 
you wouldn't be asking me all those questions. . . . The bottom line is, we had 
no idea who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy's older brother, Robert Cosby: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are two ways of seeing everything: the police officers' way and 
the victim's way. . . . But there's a bottom line here. An innocent man was 
killed. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Burris, the Cosbys' attorney, believes Roy Cosby slept through the 
warnings and was awakened by his dogs barking and police banging at the door: 
"He hears all this commotion, gets up, gets his gun, goes to the window. He 
can't see anything and he turns his head to go and he gets whacked." 
</P>
<P>
 That Roy Cosby had a gun is beside the point, critics say. The point, they 
say, is that police never should have launched the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris and others say police would have handled matters differently in a 
neighborhood that wasn't overwhelmingly black. 
</P>
<P>
 If it had been elsewhere, Burris said, "Mr. Cosby would be alive and well. . . 
. He would have gotten the benefit of the doubt. There would have been efforts 
to communicate with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the shooting reflects a pattern of "blue-on-black" violence that 
continues, though Oakland's mayor and police chief are black. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disturbing to me that in a city where we have black people in a position 
of power that we have the same problems we had before they got there," Burris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited two recent shootings of young men as examples of police officers' 
"reckless disregard for the lives of black people." 
</P>
<P>
 In one, a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer shot an unarmed 19-year-old in the 
back as he walked away during questioning in the theft of a radio. In the 
other, a 19-year-old who had two guns was shot in the back while fleeing 
Oakland police. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a new issue, of course -- for years, American blacks have 
complained that they are often victims of police. In March, a Boston SWAT team 
raided the wrong apartment and, as a result, a 75-year-old retired minister, a 
black man, died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, FBI figures show 415 suspects killed by officers in 1992, up from 
367 in 1991 and 385 in 1990. But the bureau's reliance on voluntary data makes 
it impossible to say how much higher the actual numbers are, said William 
Geller, co-author of "Deadly Force: What We Know." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller's research shows that police use of deadly force declined from the 
mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, when many departments instituted new guidelines 
under public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, overly broad policies allowed officers to shoot at unarmed 
fleeing felony suspects. Now, officers generally must show they fired to 
protect their lives or the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks are being killed disproportionately -- in 1990, they made up 35% of the 
victims, more than triple their percentage of the overall population -- but 
Geller warns against easy conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, perception is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a substantial proportion of the black community believing the 
police have two standards," Geller said, "then that's a problem the police have 
to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents never mentioned Roy Cosby as a suspect in the fraud 
investigation that brought police to his house -- one of three for which they 
had obtained search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 They also searched an Oakland house where Melinda Cosby's father lived, and a 
third house at which Pleasanton detectives believed she had bought stolen 
credit cards. At that house, they say, lived a man with a lengthy history of 
"theft, violence, and weapons offenses." 
</P>
<P>
 That violent history is why Oakland police used entry teams, Lt. Peterson 
said. Police expected trouble at the third house, he said, but believed the man 
living there possibly could be at the Cosbys'. 
</P>
<P>
 They never encountered him. And they didn't find any contraband at Cosby's or 
at his father-in-law's, though three stolen credit cards turned up at the third 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges have been filed against Melinda Cosby in connection with 
the searches, and she denies involvement in illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The police department placed Belker, the officer who killed Cosby, on 
administrative leave for three days before returning him to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Roy Cosby, the first person shot by the Oakland entry team since 
1976, has prompted continuing investigations by a police shooting board and the 
Alameda County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 4 statement, Mayor Elihu Harris called Roy Cosby's death "tragic." 
But he fell short of heeding calls for an independent investigation, saying he 
was confident the internal review would be "fair, objective, and 
comprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Melinda and Roy Cosby bought the small house on Longfellow Avenue four 
years ago, their relatives pitched in to fix it up. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, the couple stripped and sanded floors, put in new windows, 
redid the bathroom and kitchen and painted until the single-story home looked 
as neat as the other houses on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all helped out to get the house the way he wanted it," Robert Cosby said. 
"I was really proud of him. My whole family was. This is how we were raised. 
Home is everything to us -- taking care of it, protecting it. That's how he was 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after his death, Melinda Cosby said goodby to her house. Earlier 
that day, she discussed the anger she could not put aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a thing where, you know, this whole business is so unexplainable. . 
. . A lot of things go through my head. I have sleepless nights. I cry a lot. I 
think I'm meaner now. I get frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my husband tremendously."  
</P>
<P>
 Arriving with a niece on a sunlit spring day, she seemed reluctant to go into 
the house. She smoked a cigarette, visited briefly with her old neighbor, Karen 
Gill, drove to her daughter's nearby school and returned with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she went inside and put away some protest signs. The house was empty, 
waiting for renters. The floors still sparkled, the walls looked bright and 
freshly painted. 
</P>
<P>
 On her way out, she took down a wreath from the battered front door. Ringed by 
white and gold fabric flowers was a picture of a beaming Roy Cosby and one of 
his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 She put the wreath in the car and drove off.

BLAST AT OHIO SHELL PLANT FORCES EVACUATION; 1 DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An explosion at a chemical plant sent flames shooting hundreds of feet into 
the air Friday and produced a mass of thick, black smoke that forced 1,700 
people to flee. At least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three employees who were in the Shell Chemical Co. plant at the 
time was killed, Shell said. The two others were missing late Friday and 
presumed dead, the company said in a statement. Plant Manager Arnie Dittmar 
would not identify the three, but said their families had been notified. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday afternoon the fire was brought under control and people were 
allowed to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't known whether the smoke and fumes were toxic. The plant produces a 
thermoplastic rubber used in automotive parts, footwear and adhesives. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty to 75 of the factory's 480 employees were working at the time of the 
explosion, spokesman Mike White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, along U.S. 50, is a complex of buildings covering about 15 acres 
about a mile from this Ohio River town of 6,800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began around 6:30 a.m. in one building and spread to at least one 
tank, which collapsed, said Washington County Fire Capt. Chris Forshey. He did 
not know the tank's contents. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire was controlled, it shot flames 300 to 600 feet high, and its 
heat was so intense that firefighters had to back off at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement from its Houston headquarters, Shell said the fire was 
contained to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the burning chemicals were petroleum-based solvents cyclohexane and 
styrene monomers, said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Rob 
Berger. Both are used in the production of plastics and can produce irritating 
or poisonous gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated 15 homes in Porterfield, five miles west of Belpre, and 
later ordered the evacuation of everyone within a one-mile radius of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby portion of U.S. 50 was closed, and schools in the city and some 
surrounding areas canceled classes. The Coast Guard was advising commercial and 
recreational boaters to avoid the Ohio River at Belpre because of the smoke.

TITANS AVOID DISASTER AND STAY UNBEATEN; COLLEGE BASEBALL: TCU SCORES ONLY ONE 
RUN DURING TROUBLESOME FIFTH INNING, AND FULLERTON WINS, 4-1, TO GET LEG UP IN 
REGIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An inning that could have been a nightmare for Cal State Fullerton turned into 
a happy dream Saturday night in the NCAA Midwest I regional baseball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-ranked Titans and pitcher Mike Parisi escaped a potentially 
devastating fifth inning, giving up only one run, and went on to a 4-1 victory 
over Texas Christian. That left Fullerton as the only unbeaten team in the 
regional after Memphis State upended host and top-seeded Oklahoma State, 12-4, 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (43-13) will play at 6 p.m. (PDT) today against the team that 
survives an earlier elimination game between Oklahoma State (47-16) and Texas 
Christian (38-21). Today's other elimination game will send Memphis State 
(51-10) against Northwestern State of Louisiana (45-14). The final round is 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a real key for us when we came out of the fifth the way we did," 
Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said. "That had the makings of a real bad inning 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi gave up a leadoff triple to Jason McClure and walked Brad Wallace. At 
that point, Titan catcher Bret Hemphill tried to pick McClure off third, but 
his throw went over Jason Gill's head into left field. An alert Mark Kotsay 
jumped on the ball, however, and threw out McClure at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Stanek doubled home Wallace, and a throwing error by Parisi loaded the 
bases. But the Titans escaped with a double play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after the pickoff play didn't go our way, we still had a chance to come 
back and break it open, but we didn't do it," TCU Coach Lance Brown said. "It 
was that kind of game. Everything we hit hard went right at them. It was a good 
baseball game, but it was just one we didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido felt Parisi turned in a good effort in some high-pressure situations. 
He gave up six hits over 7 2/3 innings, and Ted Silva came on in relief for his 
13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike's pitching was critical to our success," Garrido said. "And he had some 
good help from our coaches in positioning our defensive players. They were 
where they needed to be on some well-hit balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi got out of some tight situations well before the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Horned Frogs threatened without scoring in the second and third. An error 
by first baseman Adam Millan and a hit by Beto Garza-Gongora gave TCU two base 
runners in the second, but both were stranded when Parisi got the third out on 
a fly ball to center. A walk and a hit by Shannon Coulter gave TCU two more 
runners in the third, but the first of the two timely double plays took Parisi 
out of the inning without a run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, meanwhile, picked up one run in the third. Jeremy Giambi doubled 
down the left-field line to open the inning, and Gill was safe on a well-placed 
bunt. Jack Jones' sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, and 
Giambi came home on Dante Powell's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton added another run in the fourth. Hemphill doubled with one out and 
scored when the TCU third baseman, Kerby Smith, bounced the throw to first on 
Millan's ground ball. That was one of a series of costly errors by the Horned 
Frogs, who had five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans came back for two more runs in the fifth. Jones opened the inning 
with his third home run. Powell followed with a single, stole second, advanced 
on an infield out and came home on Jeff Ferguson's sacrifice fly to make it 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, paired with Oklahoma State's loss, left Fullerton in the driver's 
seat, but Garrido remained cautious. "The only thing you can count on in 
tournament play is that there will be some surprises," he said. "This 
tournament is a long way from being over. I've seen these tournaments won from 
every possible position." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido says he will make the decision on tonight's starting pitcher when the 
opponent is determined and he has discussed it with George Horton, the 
associate head coach who handles the pitchers. The Titans have Big West 
Conference pitcher of the year, right-hander Matt Wagner (12-1) rested and 
ready along with left-hander Chad Rolish (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State continued its tendency to have problems with left-handers 
against Memphis State. The Cowboys are 14-9 against left-handed pitching 
compared to 32-7 against right-handed starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State beat Oklahoma State with left-hander Collins Day (12-0), who 
threw a nine-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, who had lost to Texas Christian on Friday, broke open a 2-2 game 
with nine runs in the seventh. The Tigers had tied it on a two-run homer in the 
sixth by Mark Little, then went into high gear with eight hits in the next 
inning. Greg Dean was chased and fell to 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern State, an 11-3 loser to Fullerton in the first round, kept its 
hopes alive with an 8-2 victory over Illinois State. Northwestern State (45-14) 
had eight hits and capitalized on six Illinois State errors. Illinois State 
ended its season at 30-29. Starter Reggie Gatewood (11-3) pitched a six-hitter.

HORNADAY CRUISES HOME TO CLAIM NASCAR EVENT 
</P>

<P>
 How much did a home-track advantage mean to 35-year-old Ron Hornaday Jr. of 
Palmdale in Saturday night's Valencia Dodge 200 at Saugus Speedway? 
</P>
<P>
 It meant more than a half-second advantage in qualifications for the NASCAR 
Winston West race and, eventually, a check for $5,775. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday led all but six laps of the 200-lap event in his Chevy Lumina, 
yielding the lead to eventual second-place finisher Mike Chase of Charlotte, 
N.C. on lap 94 when he pitted for tires on the sixth of 10 caution periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday, in his first victory, needed little more than a lap to regain the 
lead once racing resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday needed only six trips around the third-of-a-mile oval to lap his 
first two competitors, passing St. James Davis of West Coivina as the cars came 
past the finish line and putting Tom Taylor of Lodi one lap down when the cars 
were coming out of the second turn. "I give a lot of credit to the team," 
Hornaday said. "We had the right car and the right people." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith of El Monte took the 20-lap Pro Four Modified main event over KLOS 
disc jockey Joe Benson of La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson led eight of the first 10 laps and opened up a five-length lead by the 
fifth lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he had in the eight-lap heat race, Smith appeared to get faster as the 
race progressed, although Benson was able to stay within striking distance 
until lap 16 when the cars hit slower traffic. Smith got through, and Benson 
got bumped, allowing Smith to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena's Jeff McCall won the 20-lap Mini Stock main event, leading all but 
four laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Jezulin of Redondo Beach was fourth in the main event and won the 
four-lap trophy dash over Tony Dighera of Thousand Oaks.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; LASSEN BRINGS DOWN 
HIGH-FLYING CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the course of an afternoon, Cypress went from the highest-flying community 
college baseball team in the state to one whose season is over with its next 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassen, behind the impressive pitching of Ryan Sheets, beat Cypress, 7-1, in 
the first round of the State tournament Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (39-11) plays Chabot at 10 a.m. today at Long Beach College. Josh 
Belovsky (10-1) will pitch for Cypress. The winner moves back to Cerritos for 
an afternoon game against the loser of Rancho Santiago-Lassen game. The title 
game is at 11 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the kids to get to bed early," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said, "then 
to plan on a long day, and we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress entered the game as the top-seeded team from Southern California. The 
Chargers had a 13-game winning streak and had outscored opponents, 50-9, in 
five playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress was hitting .307 overall and averaging almost eight runs per game. But 
all those averages took a beating thanks to Sheets, a right-hander with an 8-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets limited Cypress to four singles with a consistent slider. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sheets) did a good job," Pickler said. "He kept us off balance with his 
slider. You've got to tip your hat to him. I'm more concerned that we didn't 
make any adjustments at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the run Cypress scored came with lots of help. Israel Gonzalez reached on 
a bad-hop single that should have been a ground ball to first base. He went to 
third as part of a rundown and scored on a balk when Sheets put his hands 
together, then took them apart without starting his motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress starter Aaron France struggled with his control for all of the 
eight-plus innings he pitched. France (12-4) was coming off one of his best 
performances of the season, a three-hit shutout of Southwestern. But he had 
trouble throwing his changeup and curveball for strikes and had to use his 
fastball more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was seven earned runs and 12 hits, including five doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassen (40-9) got its first run on back-to-back doubles by Chris Webb and Tim 
Howard in the second. Travis Peterson had an RBI groundout and Zack Retallack 
had an RBI double in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress right fielder Mario Opipari caught a fly, then threw out Retallack as 
he tried to reach third, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fritz started the sixth with a double. Scott Flynn, the ninth-place hitter 
who had three hits, drove in Fritz on a double two outs later. 
</P>
<P>
 France gave up a walk and three consecutive singles to start the ninth and was 
replaced by Josh Negro. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fault Aaron France," Pickler said. "He did a great job for us all 
year."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; RANCHO SANTIAGO'S HOALTON 
IMPRESSIVE IN CAREER FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brandon Hoalton, one of the most dominating pitchers in Southern California 
the past two years, finished his career at Rancho Santiago in impressive 
fashion Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton pitched an eight-hitter as the Dons beat Chabot, 8-5, in the first 
round of the State community college baseball tournament at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton was coming off the worst performance of his career in a regional 
playoff game against Riverside last weekend. He left in the third inning after 
failing to hold a seven-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton looked as if he might be in line for another early exit Saturday when 
he was pushed around for five runs in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't hitting my spots and left my curveball hanging," he said. The Dons 
also made two errors in the inning, allowing two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoalton recovered and gave up four hits and no runs in the final seven 
innings. He finished with 10 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton, 12-2, was 12-0 last season and the State co-pitcher of the year. His 
24 victories tie him with Mike Schwabe (1985-86) for Rancho Santiago's all-time 
victory record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I wanted to go out," said Hoalton, a right-hander. "This was 
my last game as a Don, so I went out there and gave it all I had. It was pretty 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the second, Hoalton was in danger of coming out only once -- in the 
eighth. Chabot had two on and one out when Coach Don Sneddon made a trip to the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was a little bit tired but that he wanted to finish," Sneddon 
said. "The key for him was the second inning when he didn't lose his 
composure." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton got a double-play ground ball to escape the eighth, then worked a 
perfect ninth and got the final out on a called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I wanted it to end," Hoalton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (39-11), the defending State champion, advanced to play Lassen 
at 11 a.m. today at Cerritos. Brian Martineau (5-3) is scheduled to pitch for 
the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabot (33-13) will play Cypress at 10 a.m. at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabot's five-run second put the Gladiators ahead, 5-4, but the Dons came back 
to score two more in the third. Jason Minici had an RBI single up the middle, 
and Toby Sanchez added an RBI groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez had a two-run single in the inning before when Rancho Santiago scored 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Cowley had a two-run double in the eighth to put Rancho Santiago ahead, 
8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the key hit for us," Sneddon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowley's double drove in Sanchez, who was hit by a pitch, and pinch-runner 
Paul Horning, who was in for Jamie Estrada, who had walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Rancho Santiago's eight runs, three reached on walks, two were hit and 
another reached first on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Kastelic had three hits, including an RBI bunt single in the second for 
Rancho Santiago. He has 73 hits this season and 154 in his career, tying him 
with Conrad Colby (1989-90) for the most in Rancho Santiago history.

SWIMMER, 13, WINS BACKSTROKE AT IRVINE MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before her race in the 100-meter backstroke at Saturday's Finals International 
Grand Challenge Swimming Invitational at Heritage Aquatic Complex, 13-year-old 
Nicola Jordaan was a tad apprehensive. Next to her was Jessica Tong, 20, a 
nationally ranked swimmer from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the race, Jordaan was all smiles as she beat Tong and the rest of 
the field in 1 minute 8.78 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordaan, an eighth-grader at Irvine Lakeside Middle School who swims with the 
Novaquatics, is from South Africa, where she is one of that country's top 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get the lead and stay there," said Jordaan, whose final 
clocking was more than a second faster than her preliminary time. "It's kind of 
scary to be swimming against these people, but I guess I did all right." 
</P>
<P>
 In Day 2 of the meet, many of the college swimmers participating were just 
trying to hold their own against younger competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Nadadores' Philippe Demers, 15, won the 100 butterfly, swimming 
a personal best 58.29, a junior national qualifying time. He beat Stanford's 
Daniel Bellin. Demers, who was second in the 100-yard butterfly at Southern 
Section Division I championships, also won the 400 freestyle Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been really training hard. But it must have been my shaved legs," he 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadadores' Mark Kwok, 16, of Laguna Hills High, who two weeks ago was named 
swimmer of the meet at the Division III championships at Belmont Plaza, won the 
200 freestyle. He beat Rafael Guijarro, 20, of Golden West Swim Club, and 
Mathew Trasen, 21, of Cal State Bakersfield. Kwok almost won the 400 individual 
medley, but was touched out by Desmond Koh of Rose Bowl Swim Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Angie Wester-Krieg won the 100 butterfly (1:03.99) and the 200 
freestyle, where her time of 2:05.94 in the 200 free was just shy of a senior 
national time. Teammate Lisa Jacob finished second in 2:05.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wester-Krieg, seventh in the 200-meter butterfly at the 1992 
Barcelona Games, was beaten in the 50 freestyle by Irvine sophomore Wendy 
O'Brien on Friday, she said she really hasn't paid that much attention to the 
kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, to tell you the truth, I've been really focusing on where I'm at in the 
season," she said. "I've been training hard and this meet gives me an 
indication of what I need to do."

A STORY OF LOVE AND WAR, DEATH AND PAIN, AND WIDOW'S COURAGE; GULF WAR: LAND 
MINE KILLED ARMY CPL. J. SCOTT LINDSEY. IN HIS POCKET WERE A LETTER FROM HIS 
WIFE AND A POEM HE HAD WRITTEN HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Army Cpl. J. Scott Lindsey died in a final, fatal spasm of the Gulf War, 
he carried in his pockets the two small books of Scripture his father had taken 
to war in Vietnam, two dollar bills, a pocketknife, a letter from his wife, and 
a poem he had written her during desert guard duty. 
</P>
<P>
 This girl of my dreams.  
</P>
<P>
 Her feelings are strong  
</P>
<P>
 They hold me together  
</P>
<P>
 Like notes in a song. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I awake in a spin  
</P>
<P>
 My head's in a swirl  
</P>
<P>
 For this is my love  
</P>
<P>
 My wife, my girl.  
</P>
<P>
 These few cherished things were packed in a small cardboard box. They reached 
Debi Lindsey a month later when America was in a self-congratulatory mood, 
jubilant at the end of a whirlwind war. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so few lost -- hurt and killed -- that it was one big friggin' 
picnic," she said as she knelt before a hope chest filled with the legacy of 
her husband's death -- newspaper articles, medals, books on the Gulf War. "By 
July 4th, I thought, if I have to see another parade, I'll scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Because for Debra Ann Strain Lindsey and her three children -- for the 
surviving spouses and children of the 293 U.S. servicemen and women who 
perished in the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 -- this was no painless engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was it brief. For them, the war goes on, an ongoing struggle to adapt to a 
world without their loved ones -- a world that is suddenly, startlingly 
civilian, outside the military cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi tries. Energetic and lively at 29, a patient mother, her days fold one 
into the next, between laundry baskets and sandwiches, growing her elaborate 
garden, trying to dodge probing questions that bring her pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weekends, she is visited by the young soldier who tried to save her 
husband's life when he was felled by shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three times a month, she drives alone to J.'s grave in nearby 
Fayetteville, never staying. Just to check. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for Memorial Day, she planned a camping trip in the Grand Canyon. 
She used to like the holiday. Before J. died, Memorial Day meant flying the 
flag and welcoming summer on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was young and stupid," she said. "Now, it breaks my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire was declared on Feb. 28, 1991. On the night of March 3, a 
Sunday, Debi Lindsey was at her kitchen table in Germany, happily turning a 
sheet into a welcome home banner, when she heard the knock at her door. 
</P>
<P>
 The military procedure for handling deaths is set down in precise detail and, 
per regulation, Debi's casualty assistance officer arrived Monday morning to 
offer condolences and information. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi would need to learn about benefits and about burial. She was about to be 
sent home -- wherever that was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost everything," she said, her voice breaking. "My friends and my family. 
My house." 
</P>
<P>
 A casualty assistance officer can do many things, but he cannot stop the pain. 
When a soldier dies, family members feel the embrace of the military go slack. 
Fingers that clutched the security of the fenced life, the certainty of 
eventually moving on, the lingo, the purposefulness, the pride, are pried open. 
The family goes skidding away, thrust back into civilian life on a loose tether 
of regular checks and access to the post commissary. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enormity of her losses, she seemed to absorb it only in tiny 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, when Debi flew back to America, the horror of the outside 
world rushed in. A flight attendant asked, in front of her children, whether 
her husband was in the cargo hold. She did not answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This love story's sad and complicated ending seems all wrong. When they were 
teen-agers, living in the lush rural foothills of California's Sierra, J. and 
Debi's future brimmed with adventure and promise. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the youngest of three children in a military family; his parents named 
him simply J. Scott. She was the elder of two children; her father was a letter 
carrier, her mother a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
 J. stopped by one day with his new midnight-blue motorcycle and offered her a 
ride. Debi was 15; he was almost 17. "It was love," she said. "I was the first 
to ride on his bike, and it went on from there." 
</P>
<P>
 They married in 1983, as the tulips were coming up. Then, Debi graduated from 
high school and, in August, J. left for Army basic training in Ft. Benning, Ga. 
When Cole was born that October, his father first saw him in a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Debi had been enchanted with his choice of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who doesn't want to leave Placerville, California?" she said brightly. "It 
was a way to see new and exciting places." 
</P>
<P>
 The road map of their eight-year marriage is dotted with tiny apartments and 
years when they were eligible for food stamps but declined out of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first home, in Hawaii, was a filthy two-bedroom apartment where Debi 
thought she heard termites gnawing at night. J. departed for training in South 
Korea two weeks after she arrived with Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 A second baby, Cassie, was born Jan. 2, 1987. Then came a detour into civilian 
life, an airline job, and more struggles to make ends meet. J. returned to the 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad," Debi said with a sigh. "It's a nice life. This is going to sound 
strange: It's predictable in its unpredictability." 
</P>
<P>
 Military life, among so many different kinds of Americans, had opened her 
mind. She was proud of her husband, her friends, herself. 
</P>
<P>
 J. was accepted back at his old job of mortarman, in charge of a cannon. Given 
a choice, they picked a posting to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1988, he shipped out alone. For a year, they lived apart until 
he could move his family to base housing. She moved with the children to 
Colorado Springs, handy to an Army base, its stores and friends from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 When at last she reached Gelnhausen, an enchanting medieval town, she found 
herself in a spotless three-bedroom apartment with friends grouped around a 
stairwell. After all their hardships, the Lindseys had found happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally had a plan and a family, and knew what we wanted to do," she said. 
"It was one of the best years of my marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, a sliver of worry crept into the 
Lindsey household. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops went, and then more troops. Soon after the birth of April Janine -- now 
called A.J. -- on Sept. 19, 1990, J. said he wanted to stock up on desert gear 
and avoid the rush. He needed sunscreen and a collapsible water canteen. Debi 
chided him, saying he should be thinking of baby clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She began to fret. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders came around Thanksgiving. He would be leaving Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas arrived early around the stairwell. Debi remembers the crumpled 
wrapping paper piled up ahead of schedule in the trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 A night or two before J. left, Debi voiced her doubts. "I didn't think they 
should go. There was so much, 'It's oil, it's oil, it's oil,' and it doesn't 
seem something worth dying for." 
</P>
<P>
 His tart, hurt reply: "Would you be proud if I died doing my duty?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month after J.'s death, Debi Lindsey landed with her children in 
Springdale, in Arkansas' northwest corner. She came here because the cost of 
living was low, because her in-laws live here, and they had bought J. and Debi 
an 80-acre farm, though it eventually was sold. And, of course, because this is 
where she buried her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "And for lack of a better idea," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Springdale, population 33,000, is one of those protean boom towns not yet sure 
what it will become -- strip shopping centers and malls alternate with farms 
and feed and grain lots, and housing developments bump up against millionaire 
spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just feel very isolated, alone," Debi said. "Nobody understands. Nobody's 
in the military. I felt very conspicuous at first." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seemed to know her. A visit to any store in town exposed her to 
curiosity. "Everybody . . . and their mothers, and their mothers-in-law. They 
just asked what happened. A short, curt answer just wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 News reports had thrust Debi into the hot light of unwanted celebrity. Knots 
of reporters greeted her at airports. Then came the deluge of sympathy cards 
and letters from strangers, in nearly every one a check. Thousands of dollars, 
about $8,000 she thinks, paid for a car and two pairs of bunk beds for the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The money astonished her. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I couldn't fathom why they were doing it," she said, "until I 
realized they wanted to do something to help and this is what they could think 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Her family now lives in a four-bedroom, ranch-style house of yellow brick and 
blue-green shutters near the bottom of a cul-de-sac. It was a steal at $69,000. 
Debi is filling it with found furniture and modest antiques. The front and back 
yards bloom with flowers and children's toys, a slide and wading pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In all that space, Debi has not found a good place for the flag she was given 
on March 11, 1991, the day she buried her husband at Fayetteville National 
Cemetery, 10 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't found a home for it where it doesn't leap out at me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she wrapped the flag in a baby blanket and stuffed it deep in a 
closet. Last year, she put it in a triangular wood-and-glass case. First, it 
hung in her bedroom. Then, in the hall. Now, it's on a living room wall, above 
a construction-paper flag her daughter Cassie made in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures of J. are displayed on nearby bookshelves. They show a handsome, 
mustachioed young man with a taut, wiry build. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems self-conscious, almost stern, even when tenderly cradling one of his 
babies. It's only in uniform that he smiles, actually glows. Here, grinning in 
a face smeared with camouflage paint; there, carefree in his battle helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 In death, J. Scott Lindsey was awarded a Bronze Star and promoted to sergeant. 
In the Fayetteville cemetery, he lies alone, the only Gulf War casualty, 
surrounded by veterans of World War II, men who ripened into their 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cole, now 10 and in a fourth-grade class for gifted children, misses Germany, 
misses Hawaii, misses his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Freckles may skip across his nose, but he is no light-hearted boy. 
Soft-spoken, he sits alone plunking on an electronic keyboard, drawing a 
dragon, cocking an ear to adult talk. "When I go to my friends' house and they 
have a dad and they do fun things, I feel kind of left out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7, Cassie is wary and restless, her long blond hair ragged, like raw silk. 
Her mother says Cassie gets angry sometimes. "She'll say 'How come I don't have 
a dad?' and I'll explain, 'He still loves you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. is too young to remember her father. The 3-year-old beams; a natural 
mischief-maker, she interrupts adult conversation by biting her big sister's 
bottom on the stairs of their wading-pool slide. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough rearing kids without their father, but financially at least the 
family is doing better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 J.'s life insurance was a big help, and Debi manages now without working, on 
$22,000 a year assembled from a military widow's pension and Social Security. 
In Germany, J. supported his family on $14,400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi has seven years left to tap military education benefits and is just now 
thinking about taking up Spanish, learning horticulture. 
</P>
<P>
 Her marriage bed remains in the garage with boxes and boxes of J.'s things, 
including his drum set. For three years, she slept on the couch until it broke; 
now, she stays in the master bedroom, on two children's mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
 And now there is Cpl. Jim Starr, who most weekends drives the 487 miles from 
Ft. Hood in Killeen, Tex. He writes poetry, wants to return to silk-screen 
printing when he gets out of the military, and maybe start out as a security 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He first turned up just before Memorial Day, 1992, to tell the story of how J. 
died. "I felt the family needed an explanation of what happened," he said. 
"Things get tangled up in translation." 
</P>
<P>
 His friendship with Debi became a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it was to help me ease the way I felt. I kind of felt guilty. 
Alone," he said. Out of uniform, he began to cry. "I just came to see her 
because I felt that I should. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst day in their lives cements them in a bond they seem not to 
understand, but they accept it. They may even marry. 
</P>
<P>
 "People grow on you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems dumb to be lonely the rest of your life," Debi said, staring at her 
slender gold wedding band. "If someone makes you happy, it can't be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 She calls him Starr. Only 25, his face is still boyish. But a look of constant 
pain pinches his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 J. was his boss in the three-man mortar squad, operating a cannon in an open 
vehicle called a track. They were in northern Iraq. Despite the cease-fire, 
they did not relax. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun was going down when a vehicle to the right of J.'s ran over a mine, a 
killer shaped like a small round cookie tin. Starr said it was left by U.S. 
forces, though the Army could not confirm this. 
</P>
<P>
 The other vehicle was shielded by its armored underside, but shrapnel flew at 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands were bleeding," Starr said. "We looked up to see J. He was laying 
down on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr swallowed, barely able to speak. Seated at a picnic table in the back 
yard of Debi's house, children playing around him, he trembled in the hot 
Arkansas sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looked like maybe he had been knocked out. I'm just holding on to his 
neck, trying to control the bleeding." Starr was shaking. "He passed away 
before the helicopter got there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a videotape taken by a soldier in the desert, J. Scott Lindsey stands in a 
shower stall, a makeshift open-air amenity with a roof and modesty panels. A 
shower head dribbles water in a slow stream. J. is grinning as he reaches up to 
the shower head, rubs his wet head, his smiling wet face. 
</P>
<P>
 He turns his back to the camera and the desert-browned and muscular shoulders 
ripple and shimmer. Back still turned, he raises his left hand, and waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "On your darkest nights, remember it is the same sky above me," Debi Lindsey 
had written her husband on paper trimmed with flowers and lacy loops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will search the heavens until I find your doubts and I will take what I can 
away to comfort you. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lay down to sleep each night, watch for me in the twinkling stars, I 
hear they are beautiful in the desert. My love for you will be up there, 
looking down on you each night. I promise it. 
</P>
<P>
 She signed it: "Your girl."

FLY IN YOUR SOUP? HOW ABOUT A BUG IN YOUR BOOTH?; PRIVACY: SOME FAST-FOOD 
RESTAURANTS AND CONVENIENCE STORES USE CONCEALED RECORDERS, ACCORDING TO FIRM 
THAT SELLS THE SYSTEMS. THAT'S NEWS TO MOST OF THE PUBLIC.

 At some Dunkin' Donuts, the walls have ears. 
</P>
<P>
 So the next time you settle down over coffee and a cruller to trade gossip 
with a friend, keep in mind that hidden microphones may be recording the dirt 
you dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tony Wright insists he's not being nosy. It's just another way to 
increase security and keep employees on their toes, he said. He would never 
listen to customer conversations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think I would waste my time?" said Wright, who manages five Dunkin' 
Donuts in Concord. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of concealed recorders is widespread at fast-food restaurants, convenience 
stores and other businesses, according to one company that sells them. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike anti-shoplifting mirrors and surveillance cameras seen throughout 
retail America these days, hidden microphones are news to most of the public, 
judging from interviews Thursday at two microphone-equipped Dunkin' Donuts in 
New Hampshire's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing this, I would never have a conversation in here," said customer Frank 
Bowser, a private investigator who was discussing a case with a partner. "I 
think the general public would be in an uproar to know that every time they 
come in for a cup of coffee and a doughnut they could be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Other customers, including Nick and Thalia Hondrogen, said they were more 
offended by cigarette smoke than by listening devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they were surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like spying. It sounds like Nazism or the KGB. It's not American," 
Hondrogen said. "Many times you say things to close friends you don't want 
overheard." 
</P>
<P>
 The systems also were news -- unwelcome, at that -- at Dunkin' Donuts 
corporate headquarters in Randolph, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Any system powerful enough to record customers' conversations would be "highly 
inappropriate" and a violation of company policy, spokesman Bill Chiccarelli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, store owners are using them. Jeff Meuse, owner of National Video 
Security Inc. of Manchester, said Friday he has installed 500 systems 
throughout the Northeast in the last five years; of those, about 300 had audio 
monitoring. Dunkin' Donuts is his biggest customer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops that have the monitoring systems display small stickers on their doors 
saying, "Audio monitoring on the premises." 
</P>
<P>
 All but the loudest customers are safe with many systems. At one Dunkin' 
Donuts, Wright demonstrated that a customer standing at the counter below the 
single mike in the ceiling had to speak loudly and distinctly to be heard above 
the din of coffee grinders, staff and general restaurant noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems can be far more sophisticated, however. Lewis Weiss, chief 
executive officer of Louroe Electronics Inc. of Van Nuys, Calif., said his 
company's systems can pick up conversations within 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this is going to be the future until we get to the point where 
there is minimal crime in this country," Weiss said. "Until then, store owners 
are going to have to have these devices to protect their employees and their 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union grudgingly accepts surveillance cameras and 
audio equipment at store and restaurant cash registers, providing customers and 
staff are notified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would prefer not to see them at all, but if and when it does happen, we 
would strongly (want) there to be actual and functional notification," ACLU 
spokesman Milind Shah said in New York. "Often a sign on the door is not 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires stores to post signs informing customers they might be 
monitored, and customers should take notice, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no invasion of privacy in a public store like a Circle K or a 
Dunkin' Donuts because you can't carry on a private conversation there," he 
said.

BEFORE A SLUM CHILD'S BRUTAL DEATH WAS A BRUTAL LIFE; CONNECTICUT: HUNGRY 
10-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAD TO LOOK AFTER YOUNGER SIBLINGS IN AN ABANDONED APARTMENT 
BUILDING RATHER THAN ATTEND SCHOOL. AUTHORITIES ARE BLAMED FOR LETTING HER SLIP 
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

<P>
 Ten-year-old Erica Corbett lived in a one-room apartment in an abandoned 
building, too busy looking after her three little brothers and a sister to go 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes she'd sneak out at night with her 7-year-old brother to play in a 
park infested with hookers and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was death that provided an escape from this brutal world: A 
neighbor found her frail little body on a scrap of blue carpet outside her 
building late on the night of May 14, stab wounds in the neck and under her 
left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounds on her hands showed she fought for her life -- a life plagued by 
too little to eat, too much responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 With the killer still at large, the 200 mourners who attended her funeral 
grappled with the fact that the assault on Erica began long before somebody 
snuffed out her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to find out how this child fell through the cracks -- somebody is 
going to pay for this," said state Sen. Alvin Penn of Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole system totally fell on this child," Penn said. "The quality of life 
here is disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
 Erica's mother, Stacey Ann Corbett, wearing a black-and-white bandanna and 
huddled under a hooded military-style jacket, refused to talk to reporters 
outside the funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
 Larstein Wilson, a cousin, read a statement denouncing suggestions that 
Erica's mother was a drug abuser and prostitute. Wilson also said Erica didn't 
attend school only because her mother wanted to educate her at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erica was born in Bridgeport and was living the life of a normal 10-year-old 
child," the funeral program said. "She was a very bright, yet shy, little girl 
with the dreams and aspirations of any 10-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 After Erica's death, the state placed her brothers and sister in foster homes. 
Authorities had intervened in the children's care three years ago but hadn't 
been involved for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said all the children were dirty and underfed. Erica had a severe case 
of genital warts. The autopsy showed no sign of sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their situation was abysmal," said Capt. John Donovan, commander of police 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica's mother gets $844 a month in welfare, according to Penn. Wilson denied 
her cousin receives public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 A squatter, Corbett moved her family from one abandoned building to another in 
this city of 135,000 on Long Island Sound, the state's murder capital, school 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The stench of cat litter fills the crumbling building of the Corbetts' latest 
home. Kittens mill around the darkened hallway, slipping into holes in the 
walls. An old tattered chair sits on the front porch, and the yard is filled 
with trash, including children's clothes, a crack vial and the blue carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The night Erica died, Carl Nicholson, the mother's boyfriend, was watching the 
children. He told police he left a friend in charge while he went to the store. 
When he got back, Erica and the friend were missing. Corbett told police she'd 
been at her mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson was arrested on narcotics charges last year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica's mother was rarely home, said Gina Cesca, a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little girl was always home taking care of her little brothers and 
sister," said Roberto Rodriguez, principal of Waltersville School, where Erica 
enrolled as a third-grader in the fall but hadn't been back since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mother was always on the street," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Butter, secretary at the school Erica attended last year, remembered 
Erica as a good student despite frequent absences. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he tried to find out what happened to Erica. It wasn't until 
March that he discovered the girl had moved out of his school district. 
Rodriguez said he contacted the state Department of Children and Families, 
which investigates educational neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said the agency wouldn't reopen the case without Erica's having a 
permanent address. Butter said she also tried repeatedly to get help for the 
girl but was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's regional office has no record of receiving any reports that Erica 
was not attending school, said David Dearborn, an agency spokesman. The agency 
is investigating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to do as much as possible for these children, but no matter how hard 
you try, the home -- the builder of people's character -- doesn't do its job," 
Rodriguez said.

CHINA EXPELS SOUTH KOREAN TV CREW

<P>
 The Chinese government expelled a visiting four-member South Korean television 
crew Friday because they had changed their travel itinerary without permission, 
the South Korean Embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew, from a provincial affiliate of MBC television, had arrived in China 
with plans to visit the coastal province of Shandong, but instead went to the 
city of Nanjing, Kim Myung-koo of the embassy's information office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese authorities have closely monitored the activities of foreign 
journalists in the weeks leading to the June 4 anniversary of the army attack 
on pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Last week, police burst into the home of 
one of the former 1989 protest leaders, Wang Dan, as he was being interviewed 
by the U.S. television station NBC and led the NBC crew away for questioning 
and reprimand.

LONER BY NATURE, DOLPHIN SEEKS HUMAN PALS; SEA LIFE: SINCE EARLY GREEK 
CIVILIZATION, THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY ABOUT 30 RECORDED LONERS BEHAVING LIKE JOJO. 
</P>

<P>
 A gray-blue dorsal fin surfaces next to a boatful of pleasure-cruising 
vacationers in the waters of Caicos Passage, in the Atlantic just north of the 
Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any of the excited passengers can snap a picture, though, the dolphin 
takes off underwater, back to the fluid world he has chosen to share with 
people for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as JoJo, this Atlantic bottlenose dolphin is a rarity: a solitary wild 
dolphin that seeks human company. His toys are Jet Skis and sailboats. His 
playmates are scuba divers. 
</P>
<P>
 His home is the 193 miles of turquoise waters that surround this little-known 
archipelago of the British West Indies that lies between the Bahamas and 
Hispaniola. 
</P>
<P>
 "JoJo's a fringe dolphin. He's a dolphin at the end of the curve," said Chuck 
Hesse, a marine biologist whose nonprofit conservation foundation initiated a 
project to protect the acrobatic creature. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dolphins swim in groups, called pods, of varying size. Solitary dolphins 
are far less common, and lone human-lovers are quite rare. Since the days of 
early Greek civilization, there have been only about 30 recorded human-loving 
dolphins like JoJo. Most of them have disappeared into the sea after a few 
years, presumably hooking up with a pod of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably part of a small group, and the other members die, or they're 
driven off by other members if they're on the low end of the totem pole," said 
Karen Pryor of Seattle, a biologist and former dolphin trainer. "They start by 
making do with people." 
</P>
<P>
 JoJo started hanging around the waters off Providenciales, the most developed 
of the eight Turks and Caicos Islands, in 1984. He is estimated to be 17 or 18 
years old. Most wild dolphins live to be at least 40 or 50. 
</P>
<P>
 After complaints from vacationers at Club Med about JoJo's occasional 
irascible behavior -- he has nipped a few people, usually after being provoked 
by their attempts to touch his sensitive blowhole -- resort officials 
considered having him moved to the Bahamas. Groups of as many as 100 dolphins 
have cavorted there with swimmers and scientists for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But island residents, many of them fiercely protective of JoJo, resisted the 
idea. Eventually, experts were brought in to design warning signs. Dean Bernal, 
a young scuba diving instructor from California, was appointed by the Turks and 
Caicos minister of natural resources to protect and study JoJo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, both the dolphin and Bernal are still around. Bernal is now 
employed by the Bellerive Foundation, a Switzerland-based conservation 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,000 island residents are now divided in their attitudes toward JoJo. 
"There are those who say he's a wild dolphin and should be left alone," said 
Jim Henry, owner of a local video-production company. "And there are those who 
say he should be regulated, even if he's exploited as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 Blame for the alleged exploitation is directed at everyone from Bernal, who 
sees JoJo daily, to the Natural Resources Ministry, which charges movie-camera 
crews $500 to photograph the gregarious marine mammal. 
</P>
<P>
 "JoJo is the income-maker. This is any tourist's dream," said Patricia St. 
John of New Milford, Conn., one of the dolphin experts Club Med consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism is the dominant industry of this 37-mile-long island. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with some groups of sociable wild dolphins in other waters, Bernal 
argues, solitary JoJo isn't exploited at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In Corpus Christi, Tex., Erv and Sonja Strong take visitors on cruises around 
Aransas Bay to observe dozens of bottlenoses that began feeding off local 
shrimp boats eight years ago. Similar dolphin-watching cruises operate along 
the coasts of Panama City, Fla., and Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>

 These businesses were the target of a recent feeding ban of all wild marine

 On Providenciales, fresh teeth marks on JoJo's body, after he has been away 
for a few days, indicate that he maintains some contact with other dolphins, 
Bernal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of JoJo's ocean companions may be three former circus dolphins brought 
from Great Britain to Providenciales in 1992. Part of an international 
rehabilitation project called Into the Blue, the animals were weaned off frozen 
fish and human dependency and released last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But some dolphin experts contend that the circus animals were too old to be 
released. Chuck Hesse, whose 60-foot natural lagoon served as the dolphins' 
interim home, say activists from Boston and Los Angeles have expressed interest 
in bringing captive dolphins to Providenciales for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you release dolphins from years of captivity, there's a remote 
possibility that one will stay," he said. "Then there would be two JoJos."

PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF SOARING CRIME SKEWED, EXPERTS SAY; SAFETY: POLLS SHOW THAT 
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS FEAR BECOMING VICTIMS, BUT STATISTICS INDICATE THEIR 
FEARS ARE OFTEN UNFOUNDED. MEDIA, POLITICIANS BLAMED.

 Wanted: the true crime rate. If ever a mystery persisted in the annals of 
American crime, it's the magnitude of crime itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety about crime grips the land but, looking at federal statistics, you 
have to wonder why. The FBI reports crime is merely crawling upward. Victim 
surveys show crime actually falling. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many people, an evening stroll, an unlocked car or going alone to the 
mall hint at lunacy. After tucking in their children, many parents bolt the 
doors, check the alarms and pat the guns under their beds good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Measuring the dimensions of crime in the United States is a statistical 
nightmare: This is a vast, populous country in which crime rates vary sharply, 
even from police precinct to neighboring police precinct. Try to draw a picture 
of crime besetting 250 million people and you lose the detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls indicate people feel more vulnerable, to violent crime especially. This 
fear fuels the "three strikes, you're out" efforts occupying Congress and close 
to 30 states this year, the avid prison building and the pervasive unease. 
</P>
<P>
 Are perceptions wildly out of sync with statistics? 
</P>
<P>
 First, some numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crime reported by police the last 20 years climbed 36%, FBI Uniform Crime 
Reports figures show. The overwhelming majority of reported crime -- 85% -- was 
property crime. But the largest jump in any category came in the area of 
violent crime, which shot up 81%, driven mainly by juveniles with guns settling 
drug scores. 
</P>
<P>
 * The two-decade federal victims survey indicated a 29% drop in crime 
nationwide since 1975. The National Crime Victimization Survey counts one in 
four households visited by crime each year, down from about one in three in 
1975. The survey also found the rate of violent crime basically unchanged, 
except for a sharp increase in teen-age and black victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year, about 24,500 murders were reported in the United States. That's 
much as it has been for the last several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best scientific evidence we have clearly shows there is no increase in 
crime or violent crime in the last 20 years," said William Chambliss, a 
sociologist at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, even if the crime rate was going up, the victims who were the 
victims remain the victims," said Chambliss, who also is a past president of 
the American Society of Criminology. "The most dangerous place you can go is to 
your home with your boyfriend or girlfriend, family members and acquaintances. 
They account for most of the violent crimes that take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the statistics, you might say. Everyone knows crime is America's 
biggest worry nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 National polls show not only that, but that many people think it is increasing 
in their own communities -- and even more think it is increasing nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 An Associated Press poll of 1,004 Americans, taken in April, found 52% of men 
and 68% of women personally worried about becoming crime victims. Even among 
those who said there was nowhere within a mile of their homes they would be 
afraid to walk at night, half still worried about being victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason crime gets the spotlight is that it's moved up on the charts, ahead 
of foreign crises and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime always ranks high on polls evaluating the country's most important 
problems, said Tom W. Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the 
National Opinion Research Center, based at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the Cold War over and the economy brightening, politicians took note 
of Americans' intensified outrage against crime, adding their own spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "For good political reasons, the Congress and the President have found crime 
is something politically attractive to be against," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other influences are at work. Crime stories permeate American life -- witness 
their popularity as a topic of news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, crime news reported on the three major television networks more 
than doubled, and coverage of murders tripled, compared with 1992, according to 
a survey by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent survey indicates this coverage rings familiar alarm bells. In a 
Times Mirror Poll released April 6, 63% of respondents said the media 
accurately depicts the amount of crime in this country, while 29% said it 
exaggerates. Half the people surveyed also said they were very concerned about 
becoming a crime victim, up from 36% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Some criminologists suggest another reason the fear of crime might be greater 
than statistics warrant is the extra attention paid to crimes occurring in 
unusual spots. 
</P>
<P>
 But exceptional bloodshed doesn't even ripple the crime graph line, even 
though it shocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only hear about a very small number (of crimes), and that is the 
impression that everybody carries around," said Malcolm Young, who runs the 
Sentencing Project in Washington. "We've accepted the 19,000 (other killings) 
or whatever threshold we don't hear about."

MICHIGAN 'OUTLAW' HERO TO PROPERTY-RIGHTS MOVEMENT; LAND USE: RICHARD DELENE 
CREATED A WILDLIFE PRESERVE IN THE UPPER PENINSULA, BUT CREATED A TEMPEST AS 
WELL. THE STATE CALLS HIM THE WORST-EVER INDIVIDUAL VIOLATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Richard Delene says when he bought his 2,400 acres 13 years ago, it was dotted 
with scrub brush, stunted trees and gooey peat that even birds and animals 
found inhospitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Today -- thanks to his efforts -- songbirds, ducks, geese, woodcocks and 
sandhill cranes flock to his preserve on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The ponds 
teem with fish and other aquatic life, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the state of Michigan, Delene is no hero. Officials describe him as 
perhaps Michigan's worst-ever individual violator of environmental laws -- 
despoiler of wetlands, flouter of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a hero, however, to the national property-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of his right to do what he wanted with his land, Delene has spent 
thousands of dollars on lawyers, faced down police outside his backwoods cabin, 
hidden for months to avoid arrest and stood in handcuffs as a judge threatened 
him with jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to win this, no matter how long it takes, no matter how much money 
it takes," Delene said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose, the state may as well confiscate all the private land. That's 
what they want -- dictate and confiscate." 
</P>
<P>
 The state said it merely wants to protect wetlands. Department of Natural 
Resources officials say Delene is attracting birds from other places, not 
boosting their population. They've described his ponds as "sterile." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has taken one type of natural area that he didn't think was productive and 
replaced it with one that's more . . . visually spectacular but not nearly as 
valuable ecologically," agency spokesman Ann Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many developer-vs.-regulator squabbles, this doesn't involve a 
moneymaking venture such as a resort or shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene, a 56-year-old construction subcontractor, bought the remote tract in 
1981, hoping to build a wildlife preserve where he and his wife, Nancy, could 
retire to pastoral isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 He obtained U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits to dig several small ponds. 
For several years he drained swamps, cleared land and planted a variety of 
native trees, shrubs and grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene ran into trouble after seeking permits in 1990 for a more ambitious 
project: ponds covering 90 and 18 acres, with surrounding vegetation. By then, 
the federal government had given the Department of Natural Resources authority 
over wetland regulation in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the DNR has 90 days to reject a permit application. Delene 
said he got no answer before the deadline and, on advice of an attorney, began 
digging the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they delayed rejecting Delene's permits because his 
paperwork was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to stop work, and the attorney general's office filed suit in 
November, 1992. Circuit Judge James Giddings ordered Delene to halt 
construction until the case was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene complied, said his attorney, Dominic Andriacchi. But officials said he 
denied them access to his property, refused to answer questions about his 
project and didn't attend court hearings on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, state police and sheriff's deputies went to his house last December 
to serve a warrant. They cut a padlock on his driveway gate as Delene napped 
and his wife wrote Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene said they brandished firearms. Chris DeWitt, spokesman for the attorney 
general, said one trooper "may have had his gun drawn for a brief moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Delene wouldn't leave the house. The standoff lasted several hours until his 
attorney persuaded the officers to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple then slipped into northern Wisconsin, where they hid nearly three 
months in a tiny cabin to "find some peace and quiet," Delene said. 
</P>
<P>
 The siege of his homestead infuriated many property owners in the Upper 
Peninsula, where the land regulator is as unpopular as the tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Delene came out of hiding for a March 8 hearing in Lansing. He was 
booked, cuffed and brought before Giddings, who didn't buy Delene's explanation 
that a previous attorney had advised him against appearing sooner. The judge 
warned him to obey future court orders or "this is just a minimal taste of what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Delene has grudgingly accepted DNR inspections. The two sides 
recently settled a dispute over a sediment trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene defaulted on the suit last year by failing to appear in court and could 
be fined more than $1 million. The state is demanding that he restore his land 
to its previous condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Delene, ever defiant, said he must continue the fight on principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of landowners are calling me up about their problems with the 
government," he said. "The state has got to change its attitude. They think 
they can intimidate people, break them down."

IS PUMA PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE IN EAST?; WILDLIFE: COUGARS WERE THOUGHT TO BE 
VIRTUALLY EXTINCT IN THE NORTHEAST, BUT SIGHTINGS PERSIST. ONE RECENT REPORT 
INVOLVED A MOTHER AND TWO CUBS. EXPERTS TO DEBATE ISSUE.

<P>
 Are those real panthers or ghosts that people are seeing in the Northeast? 
</P>
<P>
 The big cat, renowned for its stealth and reclusiveness, once ranged the 
continent but now lives in abundant numbers only in some Western states and 
Canada. There is a small, barely viable population of about 50 in the Florida 
Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere east of the Mississippi it is treated by federal and state wildlife 
officials as an endangered species on the verge of extinction, if not totally 
vanished. The last authenticated killings of native panthers in the Northeast 
occurred in the 1930s. Since then, there has not even been a confirmed road 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, hundreds of sightings have been reported of animals that 
witnesses swear were panthers. And wildlife biologists give some of the 
sightings serious credence, although they generally say the animal was probably 
an escaped or abandoned pet. People bring in panthers from the West and, with 
permits, keep them as pets. 
</P>
<P>
 The panther, America's largest predator, also goes under the name of puma, 
cougar, catamount and mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 True or false, the sightings will get unprecedented attention at a gathering 
of biologists, ecologists, historians and wildlife enthusiasts at Gannon 
University in Erie, Pa., next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 3-5 conference is billed as "a meeting of those interested in the 
history, mystery, current status and future of the Eastern Puma, the ghost cat 
of North America." A key theme is whether the animal survived in the Canadian 
wilderness and is now returning to former haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 For believers in the return of native panthers, perhaps the most significant 
sighting occurred only a few months ago -- on Feb. 4 -- in the wilds of 
northern Maine near the Quebec border. A man reported seeing, through the 
telescopic lens of his rifle, a large, long-tailed cat with two cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sighting was investigated by two game wardens, who found tracks and 
photographed them. A state wildlife biologist, Ken Elowe, then identified the 
photographs as those of panther tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it (the panther) had some young ones makes it a more 
interesting sighting," Elowe said in a phone interview. The presence of a 
mother and cubs would suggest a breeding population rather than strays. 
</P>
<P>
 A baby panther was shot near Lake Desolation, N.Y., in January by a hunter who 
was quoted as saying he didn't know what the animal was. A state wildlife 
official said he surmised that the animal was an abandoned pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from official investigations, such incidents and sightings are compiled 
and analyzed by wildlife enthusiasts like Theodore B. Reed of Exeter, N.H., a 
retired manufacturer who heads a conservationist group called Friends of the 
Eastern Panther. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed says he became an "instant believer" when he saw what he is certain was a 
panther jump across a wooded road in front of his car in Nova Scotia in 1974. 
In a phone interview, he said that nowadays "there is no doubt in my mind that 
panthers are regularly crossing the Maine-New Brunswick border in both 
directions." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said he is convinced the panther never died out in the Northeast but 
withdrew deep into the Canadian wilderness during the deforestation and bounty 
hunting of earlier times. He says it is re-emerging now as a result of 
reforestation and an abundance of white-tailed deer, its favored prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed says he will address the Gannon University conference on the need to 
establish an international range embracing U.S. and Canadian land that "would 
offer the panther a secure and friendly haven."

POTATO BLIGHT HAS COME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 150 years after a potato fungus brought famine to Ireland, scientists 
and growers are running up against potent new forms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The potato late blight was once easily controlled. The fungicide metalaxyl 
made fast work of Phytophthora infestans whenever it struck. 
</P>
<P>
 But more aggressive and resistant forms of the blight began showing up in the 
United States and Canada in 1990, after plaguing European farmers in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 From Maine down to Florida and across to Washington, growers have had to 
revert to old pesticides that must be sprayed earlier and more often to keep 
the blight spores off plants in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool, wet weather that favors blight let a resistant form take hold in Maine 
last year, causing as much as $25 million in damage. Washington state and 
Florida also have reported serious crop damage since 1990 from the new strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Resistant types have been identified in at least nine states and may be 
present in at least four others. New types have been found in Canada, Egypt, 
Israel, Japan, Korea, Russia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists predict a long, expensive struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disease is going to be more difficult to control than it used to be," 
said William E. Fry, plant pathologist at Cornell University. "How much more, 
we're going to have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 The new types are emerging just as governments want to wean agriculture from 
its environmentally damaging chemical dependency. Farmers don't like the extra 
cost either. 
</P>
<P>
 Galen Flewelling, a grower in Easton, Me., expects he'll be spending $30 an 
acre more to treat each of his 450 acres this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be spraying as soon as the plants come through the ground, rather than 
waiting until they are six or seven inches high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's little choice. The fungus can burn out a field over a weekend. 
"It's like somebody took a flamethrower to it," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
 One blighted potato, brownish purple with a dark, corky rot, can ruin all the 
others stored with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In poorer parts of the world, the costs could hinder efforts to grow more 
potatoes, an increasingly important staple in countries like Bangladesh, India 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say the best hope is to develop new, resistant potatoes. Such work 
is under way in Peru -- which has been unaffected -- the United States and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The same fungus wiped out the Irish potato crop starting in 1845, causing 
750,000 people to die from illness and starvation and leading to massive 
emigration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus never vanished. But only one of two "mating types," A1, was 
involved, and scientists controlled it. 
</P>
<P>
 But around the 1970s, another variant known as A2 made its way to Europe from 
Mexico, where the blight started. 
</P>
<P>
 The A2s turned up in 1990 near Vancouver in British Columbia and in Athens, 
Pa., 10 miles from the New York border. No one knows for sure how they got 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Maine, Florida and Pennsylvania, A2 fungi have appeared in 
California, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas; and the 
Agriculture Department says Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin "very 
likely" have the A2 fungus as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Spores of the fungi have to be attached to the potato to survive, which is one 
reason Maine is getting nearly $3 million in federal money to dispose of 
discarded potatoes and inspect seed potatoes that could spread the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 When A1s and A2s mate in infected plant tissue, they produce a hardy "oospore" 
that can survive in the soil, crop debris or even crates from one year to the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 The breeding leaves open the possibility of new, more virulent types 
developing. It's possible some mating has occurred in the Pacific Northwest and 
in Manatee County, Fla., said Fry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will see the result of that in the next several years," he said.

POLLUTION RESEARCHERS FOLLOW THE COFFEE; ECOLOGY: CAFFEINE, IT TURNS OUT, IS AN 
EXCELLENT TRACER OF WASTE MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a good new way to track the flow of domestic waste into the nation's 
streams and rivers, scientists say: Follow the coffee trail. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out caffeine does more than keep the scientists awake. The ingredient 
found in coffee, tea and cola is an excellent tracer of waste movement. 
</P>
<P>
 And while discovering the new research tool, scientists uncovered both good 
news and a surprise, said Larry B. Barber II, a U.S. Geological Survey 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: Water quality in the Mississippi River is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise: Pollution is more concentrated in the upper part of the river 
than the lower reaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said the team of scientists was trying to track the movement of 
chemicals along the river and needed a way to sort the domestic waste from 
industrial, farm and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 When they tested water near cities, caffeine kept turning up, and "that turned 
the light bulb on that here is an important chemical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since caffeine moves through people and water treatment systems relatively 
unchanged, the chemical compound became the scientists' tracer for urban waste. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparing how much caffeine is present with the amounts of particular 
chemicals that occur both in domestic and industrial waste, they were able to 
calculate what share of the pollution in an area came from domestic sources and 
what share was industrial or farm-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that will allow researchers to see if there are changes in these 
ratios in the future, which would indicate if anti-pollution projects are 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 Caffeine showed up in high concentrations near the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
in Minnesota, around the confluence of the Illinois River carrying the flow 
from Chicago, and near cities such as St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The water experts analyzed 450 samples of Mississippi River water collected in 
1991 and 1992, seeking to measure the amounts of pollution in the river and its 
patterns of change over the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said the team is going back this summer to take samples of river bed 
sediments. They want to compare the chemicals in the sediments now with those 
they found in 1992, to see what effect last summer's floods had. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier river water studies, they found 32 different organic compounds 
in the river, with at least some of the pollutants turning up in about 
one-quarter of the water samples. 
</P>
<P>
 But significant concentrations were found in only three areas: below the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area; below the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi at 
Cairo, Ill.; and between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said none of the chemicals detected was concentrated enough to be 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the chemicals found in the river are byproducts of waste water 
discharge by cities, urban runoff, power plant cooling water discharge, pulp 
mill waste, feed lot runoff, river traffic, refueling spills and industrial 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently, it's thought that water quality decreases as you move down river, 
and there is some truth to that, but there is so much more water that chemical 
concentrations are very low," Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think New Orleans' water quality is low because of all the waste from 
up above, but the most susceptible part of river seemed to be above St. Louis, 
where it's a relatively small river," Barber said. "It's no cliche that 
dilution is the solution." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to natural processes, improved waste water treatment and 
reductions in discharges into the river are helping improve water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we look back to records of the 1800s and even 1920s and 1950s, our general 
conclusion is that the water quality of the Mississippi is much better today 
than it was 20 or 50 years ago," Barber said.

ATTACKER SUES MAN WHO AIDED POLICE; JURY DISAGREES

 Lee Lively thought he was doing the right thing when he shot a drunken driving 
suspect who had beaten up a policeman and was running away. 
</P>
<P>
 His faith was shaken when Jesus Puentes demanded $1.7 million for his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But a jury said Puentes is the one who must pay -- $1.75 million in punitive 
damages and $1,000 for Cpl. Randy Whisenhunt's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to make a statement. We're tired of the frivolous lawsuits 
that are plaguing our court system," juror Elsie Bowles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lively's journey from Samaritan to defendant began Feb. 17, 1990, when he saw 
Puentes grabbing for Whisenhunt's gun. The officer managed to knock it away, 
but ended up with Puentes sitting on his chest, beating his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Lively said he leaped out of his truck and beat Puentes to the gun. As Puentes 
began to run, Lively said he shouted for him to stop, then shot him twice in 
the legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Puentes, who is serving a life sentence for Whisenhunt's beating, said he 
never heard any order to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Puentes' lawyer, Barry Johnson, said Lively was negligent and used excessive 
force, since Puentes was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whisenhunt countersued. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases were heard by the same jury, which ruled against Puentes.

PURPLE SKY ALERTS 'TORNADO ALLEY'; TEXAS: THE STATE AVERAGES 118 TORNADOES 
YEARLY, SOME MINOR, OTHERS DEVASTATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE ANNE PRESSLEY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a strange stillness before a tornado hits, as if all the creatures 
know to lie low and wait. In this stretch of north and central Texas called 
Tornado Alley, everyone knows this basic fact and a few others as well. 
</P>
<P>
 They know it is best to hide in rooms without windows, better to lie in a 
ditch than remain in a car. Even nursery-school students have regular tornado 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
 When the threat of tornadoes is a way of life, each spring brings the most 
terrible possibilities. In certain communities and towns, there are 
storm-scarred neighborhoods with telltale newer homes nestled among the 
surviving older models, unexpected vacant lots, patches of young, comeback 
trees. In Lancaster, a Dallas County town swept up in a deadly April 25 funnel 
cloud, signs still stand directing visitors to a historic town square that, 
except for the twisted ruins, no longer really exists. 
</P>
<P>
 During any year, Texas endures an average of 118 tornadoes, some so minor that 
they only disturb a few cows, others historic in their devastation and loss. In 
some places, nearly everyone has a tornado story, tales of 
"will-I-live-or-die?" terror and unforgettable violence. Never again will a 
tornado survivor look at the gathering clouds as an innocent thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you, I prayed, I definitely did -- 'Lord, please, please help 
me,' " said Van Smith, 55, who cowered in a bathroom May 13 when a tornado 
heaved the roof off the Marble Falls car dealership where he works as service 
manager. "It was the most helpless feeling. I wanted to get out of the 
building, but I sure didn't want to go outside either." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas weather can be tricky. Conditions can change with an amazing swiftness 
-- the sky taking on a dark opalescence, its mountainous purple clouds 
illuminated with an eerie glow. The willowy mesquite trees and the spring 
wildflowers -- primrose and paintbrush and the last of the bluebonnets -- seem 
to quiver in the hastening wind. And in the tornado towns, the sirens warn: 
Take shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The turbulent region known as Tornado Alley extends along the eastern edge of 
the Great Plains from Iowa to Texas, and although Nebraska and Kansas 
experience more tornadoes per square mile, the vast expanses of Texas record a 
greater total of twisters each year than any other state. In a single memorable 
day in September, 1967, Hurricane Beulah spawned a record-breaking 67 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last Thursday, a flurry of twisters tore through central Texas, cutting a 
broad swath between Waco and Austin. At least five touched down, authorities 
said, doing the most damage in Lometa. At least 15 people were injured and the 
town's only fire station was severely damaged. Other buildings were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Geography dictates these storms -- the powerful flow of moisture from the Gulf 
of Mexico combining with colder air from the eastern Rockies. "You get a very 
strong temperature contrast between north of the front and south. Amarillo can 
be 30 degrees while central Texas is 80 -- which typically causes severe 
weather," explained Wayne Tschirhart, a meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service in Austin. "In the springtime, we get these fronts that will stall in 
West Texas, and the storms form along the front -- form and move, form and 
move." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas springtimes are filled with deadly tornado days: In Goliad on May 18, 
1902, 114 people were killed in a four-minute twister, buried by their 
survivors in one long deep trench. In Waco on May 11, 1953, another 114 people 
perished as buildings were lifted by their foundations and flung back to earth 
in masses of brick and timber and glass; downtown Waco has never fully 
recovered. On May 11, 1970, 26 people died in the Lubbock tornado; on April 10, 
1979, 46 died in Wichita Falls. Fifteen years later in this North Texas city of 
100,000, each menacing evening cloud, each new report of a twister elsewhere, 
triggers the most painful flashbacks and the special empathy of one tornado 
victim for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always feel what they're going through, because you know just how awful 
it is," said Shirley Lipscomb, a motel clerk in Wichita Falls, where the five 
tornadoes in that single evening demolished one-third of the city, left 20,000 
people homeless and produced $300 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 During the May 13 twister in Marble Falls, a town of 4,000 about 40 miles west 
of Austin, observers reported that the black cloud racing toward them from the 
southwest was streaked with a strange shade of green. Sobbing shoppers huddled 
in the dark center of the local Wal-Mart as their cars tumbled about in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the car dealership across the highway, Van Smith heard a low moan after he 
reluctantly emerged from his hiding place. One of his mechanics was buried 
under a pile of ceiling debris and fluorescent lighting. "I saw something 
wiggle and pulled him out," Smith said. "He was still about half-silly. He 
didn't know where he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside lay an eerie landscape of overturned vehicles, strewn trees and pink 
insulation material scattered about like giant wads of cotton candy. 
Remarkably, no one was killed. "There was a real strange kind of whitish-glow 
all around," Smith recalled. "There was little pea-sized hail. It was little, 
but there was so much of it, it was stacked up 18 inches around the building. 
And it was real quiet. You couldn't even hear a bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Living through springtime in Tornado Alley has given residents a certain 
pluckiness. Roofers are busy in Lancaster, a city of 22,000, and plans are 
under way to re-create the town square. Most of the businesses in Marble Falls 
reopened the next day, with large sheets of plastic patching blown-away walls. 
In Wichita Falls, an interfaith ministry was born of the tragedy that is active 
in helping the homeless to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Van Smith says he knows he is different now -- he will never again gaze 
cavalierly at the sky as if it holds no grave dangers. "I'll watch it like a 
hawk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will watch it as Texas enters its next big engagement on the weather 
calendar: Coming June 1 through Nov. 1, the hurricane season.

SUPERCOMPUTER'S FORECASTS ARE A BREEZE; TECHNOLOGY: WEATHER SERVICE'S CRAY C90 
DOES 15 BILLION CALCULATIONS PER SECOND. IT PREDICTS CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It analyzes upper air wind two weeks ahead. It can calculate and compare 42 
different weather forecasts at once. It can do 15 billion math operations per 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 But to someone standing in front of the National Weather Service's new Cray 
C90 computer, the machine seems disarmingly simple. A screen that says it's 
running, and a few buttons, the main ones labeled "start" and "stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't it be a little more complicated than that, Cray President John 
Carlson was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you push start, it knows what to do," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 It lets National Weather Service meteorologists flex their numerical muscles 
with blinding speed. The C90 can slice the country into bits, analyze the 
weather and calculate how it will change. It's the fastest such computer in 
service anywhere, Carlson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have, in effect, stepped into a new era," said Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown after snipping a ribbon in front of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day in this country there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, 
of decisions made based on the weather forecast," explained Ronald D. 
McPherson, director of the National Meteorological Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Those decisions range from whether to send a child to school with a raincoat 
to planting rot-resistant seed to permitting barge traffic on the Mississippi 
River, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information on which those decisions are based comes from the Cray C90," 
McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $45-million machine joins a Cray Y-MP8 computer, purchased in 1990, which 
could only do 2.5 billion calculations a second. The older model will 
concentrate on research now, with the new one handling the daily forecasts for 
the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The national weather forecasts, which local offices use as the basis of city 
and area forecasts, are based on complex sets of calculations that use 
mathematical formulas to mimic the behavior of the atmosphere. These are called 
numerical models. 
</P>
<P>
 Some models look at the atmosphere as a series of waves -- waves of wind, 
waves of heat, waves of pressure. Others use grids to divide the world into 
squares. They measure the weather and try to predict what it will do next. 
</P>
<P>
 The faster computer lets the work be done more quickly and also permits the 
computer to look at the nation more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the old computer was able to look at the country in squares about 
50 miles across. The new one reduces the squares to less than 25 miles, and 
officials hope to reduce them even more. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer is already calculating changes in upper air winds -- at about 
30,000 feet where airliners fly -- out to 16 days in the future. The old one 
looked 10 days ahead. Besides hurrying or slowing planes, those winds help 
steer weather movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Another forecasting technique is to run the models several times, with 
slightly different conditions at each start, to see how the results differ and 
how they are similar. It's a method that helps meteorologists decide which 
models are more accurate for a given situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The old computer provided 14 model runs; the new one will do 42, said Anthony 
J. Mostek of the Weather Service. The more that results cluster together, the 
more likely the outcome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service Director Elbert W. Friday noted that the new computer 
is but one part of the agency's $4-billion modernization. The program also 
includes new satellites, measuring equipment, radars and other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in operational meteorology for 34 years and this is the most 
exciting time I can remember," Friday said.

BIGGER BREASTS? IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND, HYPNOTIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 Forget silicone, says a hypnotist who ran newspaper ads saying he could help 
women enlarge their breasts through the power of suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky's attorney general doesn't believe it and accused Steve Marek of 
deceptive business practices in a lawsuit filed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertisements claimed women could increase their breasts "one full cup 
size without surgery or implants, safely, through hypnosis with a program 
developed by a medical doctor," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory is that some women, during puberty, may suppress their growth for 
some reason or other," a state investigator said in an affidavit filed with the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When hypnotized, he took them back to puberty and asked them to release the 
suppression. He indicated the client had to be very motivated to do this," the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim is made "in the absence of any medically recognized evidence that 
such treatments are successful," Atty. Gen. Chris Gorman said in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Marek operates a counseling service in Lexington and is not a medical doctor, 
although he does have a doctorate from the American Institute for Hypnotherapy 
in Santa Ana, Calif., the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very eager to tell my side of the story, but my attorney won't let me 
because I haven't received the papers yet," Marek told the Lexington 
Herald-Leader.

THERAPY HELPS CHILDREN MEET FEAR; ANXIETY: PSYCHOLOGISTS NOW RECOGNIZE THAT 
SHYNESS AND NORMAL CHILDHOOD APPREHENSION MAY DEVELOP INTO SERIOUS MENTAL 
DISORDERS THAT CAN LAST A LIFETIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ben Lazarus spent most of his adolescence hiding. He never dated, seldom spoke 
in class, and ate alone in the library, shunning the social clamor of the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept a low profile," Lazarus said. "I didn't really see myself as having a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until his mother took him to Albany's Phobia and Anxiety Disorders 
Clinic in 1990 that Lazarus was diagnosed with social phobia. A pioneering 
15-week group therapy helped him shed his cocoon and go on to college with 
hopes of a career in police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned my life around," said Lazarus, now 20 and a sophomore at the State 
University of New York at Geneseo. "I never would have gone to college if it 
weren't for group. No way. I couldn't bear to leave home." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Lazarus may have been considered simply shy, bookish, or a 
loner. Psychologists now recognize that in some children, shyness and normal 
childhood fears may develop into full-blown mental disorders which, if not 
treated, may last into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anxiety disorders are the No. 1 mental health problem in this country," 
afflicting more than 23 million people, said David Barlow, founder and director 
of the State University at Albany clinic that treated Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about normal fears or shyness," he said. "We're talking 
about incapacitating, debilitating anxiety problems that keep people from 
pursuing daily life, making relationships, working, functioning in society." 
</P>
<P>
 With about $1 million a year in grants from the National Institute of Mental 
Health and pharmaceutical companies, Barlow has been researching and treating 
adult anxiety disorders at the clinic since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood anxiety disorders weren't officially recognized by psychiatrists 
until 1987, said Anne Marie Albano, who developed group and individual 
therapies at the Albany clinic for children age 7 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on recent studies, it is estimated that between 5% and 10% of children 
have anxiety disorders," said Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders 
Assn. of America and director of the Ross Center, a clinic in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 She said anxiety disorders in children are about half as common as disruptive 
disorders such as attention deficit and hyperactivity. About 25% to 40% of 
children with disruptive disorders also have anxiety disorders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barlow said the five types of anxiety disorders -- phobias, panic disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized 
anxiety disorder -- once were lumped under the heading of neuroses and treated 
with years of talk on the psychoanalyst's couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, the disorders are recognized as distinctive, and controllable 
through cognitive-behavioral therapy, which seeks to identify and change 
harmful thought patterns and the behavior and physical symptoms they cause. The 
therapy is brief, averaging 12 sessions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medications, such as the antidepressants Toffrinal and Prozac, are also 
effective in treating anxiety disorders, Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said only one in four people with serious anxiety disorders is 
diagnosed and treated. "These things can masquerade as physical complaints: 
malaise, stomach upset, chest tightness, headaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Children with social anxiety are often overlooked until the problem is severe 
because the nature of their ailment is to avoid attention, Albano said. When an 
anxiety disorder prompts frequent trips to the nurse's office or a refusal to 
go to school, a child may be seen as a malingerer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case with Steven Marks, 13, of Bethesda, Md. "My parents had to 
drive me to school and carry me in," the teen-ager said. "I'd yell, scream, 
kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven started having panic attacks two years ago, after he swooned during 
soccer practice. The faintness was attributed to overexertion in the heat, but 
the boy subsequently developed a terror of school and other public places that 
would bring on nausea and heart-pounding panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven said medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy at Ross's clinic 
helped him conquer his fears. His therapist taught him to recognize his panic 
symptoms and subdue them with diversions, like deep breathing, counting squares 
on the sidewalk or adding numbers on a hand-held counter. 
</P>
<P>
 She accompanied him to school for a while and persuaded the teacher to excuse 
him to a computer room when he felt panicky, so he wouldn't feel trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I like school a lot," he said. "I'm totally back into sports, soccer, 
baseball, basketball, tennis, lacrosse, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety disorders are most common in children between 10 and 13, Albano said. 
"That's a transitional age, when a lot is going on: puberty, academic pressures 
. . . there's a lot of overanxiousness and social phobia." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Ben Lazarus' troubles started. "Ben started withdrawing in sixth 
grade," said his mother, Marty Lazarus of suburban Delmar. "He dropped out of 
Little League, then Cub Scouts. He couldn't go into a store alone." 
</P>
<P>
 A school psychologist and psychiatrist were of little help. But when he was a 
junior in high school, Lazarus joined a group of four other teen-age social 
phobics in Albano's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of those kids in group ever ate in the cafeteria," he said. "One girl 
was so nervous, she kept her hair over her face to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 The teens role-played the situations they found most stressful, such as asking 
someone out or giving a report in class. They even held a mock prom, which 
helped Lazarus psyche himself up for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find out in group that you will probably never get rid of the anxiety," 
Lazarus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you learn to deal with it instead of avoiding it. That's the key. My 
heart still pounds, my hands still get sweaty. But I learned to take a deep 
breath, think about the situation logically, and just do it."

BLOOD BANKS' TEST REJECTION CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross and other blood-bank groups refused to adopt a 
screening test in January, 1983, publicly contending there was no hard evidence 
people could get AIDS from transfusions. But internal documents show Red Cross 
officials acknowledged that the disease could be transmitted through blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's three major blood collectors -- the Red Cross, the American Assn. 
of Blood Banks and the Council of Community Blood Centers -- said in a joint 
public statement on Jan. 13, 1983: 
</P>
<P>
 "The presently available medical and scientific evidence that AIDS can be 
spread by blood components remains incomplete. . . . We do not advise routine 
implementation of any laboratory screening program for AIDS by blood banks at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups refused to adopt the test for hepatitis B, a surrogate test that 
Centers for Disease Control officials said could have been in place by March, 
1983. The current AIDS or HIV test hadn't been developed yet, but nearly all 
AIDS patients -- homosexual men, hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users -- 
also had suffered from hepatitis B at some time and produced antibodies to 
fight it that stayed in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood groups maintained that the test was too expensive, that it would 
produce a million false positives, and that there was no hard evidence that 
people could get AIDS from transfusions, despite CDC officials' assertions that 
the disease posed a serious threat to the blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, officials at the Red Cross believed that AIDS could be 
transmitted through blood, according to internal documents obtained by the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Cumming, the Red Cross planning and marketing manager, wrote in an 
internal memo: "The available evidence strongly suggests that AIDS is 
transmissible" through blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time goes on we are liable to get more and more pressure to utilize" blood 
tests and donor screening. "CDC increasingly needs a major epidemic to justify 
its existence," Cumming wrote a colleague on Feb. 5, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent the (blood) industry . . . sticks together against CDC, it will 
appear to some segments of the public, at least, that we have a self-interest 
which is in conflict with the public interest, unless we can clearly 
demonstrate that CDC is wrong," Cumming wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short run, our position has all the earmarks of a lose-lose one. The 
question would seem to be, how do we minimize the short-run loss and hopefully 
gain in the long run?" 
</P>
<P>
 In one document, Cumming did a cost-benefit analysis and assigned a $500,000 
value to each transfusion recipient who would be protected from AIDS by the 
blood test. 
</P>
<P>
 The memos are among thousands of pages of documents that, at the Red Cross's 
request, were placed under protective orders by judges in various transfusion 
cases. The orders prohibit public disclosure of the documents, but the AP 
obtained them privately from sources familiar with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC estimates that 6,567 Americans have developed AIDS from transfusions 
since 1981. Only 29 of those cases were caused by transfusions received after 
March, 1985, when blood banks nationwide voluntarily began using a new HIV 
test. HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, was discovered as the cause of AIDS 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC said it doesn't know how many of the 6,567 have died of AIDS or how 
many other people are HIV-positive as a result of transfusions but haven't yet 
developed AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Cumming, in a recent telephone interview, rejected any second-guessing of his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the same information, the same environment at that time, I don't see 
that we made any mistakes. . . . There was no scientific evidence," said 
Cumming, a statistician who now does consulting work for the Red Cross and 
federal agencies. "We made the best decisions it was possible to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Cumming said the hepatitis B blood test "was not a good test, by any criteria 
I know for a test" because it would have produced 1 million false positives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross, which takes donations through its 45 blood services regions, is 
custodian of half the nation's blood supply and sells blood and its components 
to about 3,000 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned recently, the Red Cross said the effectiveness of the hepatitis B 
blood test was "an open question" in 1983. "Had there been evidence indicating 
the efficacy of any surrogate test, the Red Cross would have implemented it," 
the organization said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross noted that its blood banks began in 1983 asking homosexual men 
with multiple partners not to donate blood. It started using direct questioning 
of potential donors in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Because AIDS takes an average of seven years to develop, many victims have 
only recently discovered their illness from infected transfusions or clotting 
factor they received between March, 1983 and March, 1985. Clotting factor is a 
concentrate of blood from hundreds of donors which hemophiliacs inject to stem 
uncontrolled bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims and their families have filed an estimated 500 lawsuits around the 
nation against hospitals, the Red Cross and other blood banks, according to 
Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Nearly all 
the cases have been settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The misery that was promulgated by this benign inaction killed thousands of 
people," said Dr. Donald Francis, who was an expert on epidemics and AIDS at 
the federal Centers for Disease Control in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a research official at Genentech Inc. in San Francisco, Francis sometimes 
testifies as an expert witness for plaintiffs in AIDS transfusion suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a group of certainly not evil people, who thought they were doing 
the right thing . . . who got caught up in a force that was anti-CDC, 
anti-action," Francis said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gerald Sandler, a Red Cross official, publicly criticized a CDC study in 
early 1984 that warned of the risks of AIDS-tainted transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an internal memo, Sandler told a colleague in January, 1984: "Problems 
related to transfusion-associated AIDS are increasing and require resolution. . 
. . No clear plan has been developed by the national blood-collection 
organizations to counter the increasingly apparent risk of (AIDS from 
transfusions) which, potentially, threatens all persons." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the memo, Sandler, now director of blood donor services at 
Georgetown University Medical Center, said it was "an internal attempt to look 
as open-mindedly as possible on an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also show that one of the Red Cross's blood services regions, 
based in San Jose, Calif., rejected the national organization's official policy 
against the hepatitis B test. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Pearl Toy, then director of regional blood services for the San Jose 
region, wrote in March, 1984, to Sandler, who was associate director for 
medical and laboratory services at the Washington headquarters: 
</P>
<P>
 "A clear consensus was developed at our medical advisory committee meeting on 
March 24, 1984, to perform (hepatitis B antibody) testing in our region." 
</P>
<P>
 A later memo shows that testing began in June, 1984.

THE COLUMBO OF APPLIANCES; ZEFFERINO LOPEZ HAS SPENT 23 YEARS BUSTING CROOKED 
REPAIR SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a lonely beat that Zefferino Lopez pounds, a singular life that other 
cops might regard as . . . well . . . funny. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you repair appliances or electronic gizmos, you're not laughing when 
Lopez walks through the door of your shop. You give him the grudging respect 
you would a Columbo or a Kojak. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Lopez is a policeman of sorts. He's a gray-suited investigator for the 
tiny state Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, a Joe Friday-like gumshoe 
on the lookout for screwdriver-packing tricksters who each year rip off 
thousands of unsuspecting Californians through fraudulent appliance repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of eight such investigators statewide, Lopez uses tactics right out of the 
police book: He conducts undercover stings of suspect repair shops, planting 
bogus TVs that have been previously dismantled in a state lab, each part marked 
as evidence for a possible court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a hound on the trail of the Repairmen From Hell -- unscrupulous operators 
who do business from post office boxes, slipshod workers who bungle jobs so 
badly they turn refrigerators into steamy saunas where soda cans explode like 
blasting caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez even talks in cop jargon, using phrases like video cameras or stereos 
"coming up dirty" and saying that if good repairmen go bad, he's going to have 
to "take them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Because when it comes to phony fix-it jobs, this detective trusts no one, not 
even the Maytag repairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get around," he says of a patrol territory stretching from West Hollywood 
north to Santa Barbara. "And I tell these electronic and appliance repair guys 
that they had better watch their backs. Because the next television they repair 
might be one of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, he plays the sucker, the suburban homeowner who doesn't know a picture 
tube from a volume control, rigging TV sets and appliances with simple defects 
that should be spotted and fixed in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble follows if he gets a bill for an elaborate repair the appliance didn't 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a former TV repairman, is retiring this month after 23 years of looking 
over the shoulders of technicians paid to make gadgets work right again -- a 
career in which he returned to his former industry to play double agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This industry has a bad reputation, right there above auto mechanics in the 
professions people mistrust," he said. "There's a small percentage of 
fly-by-nighters willing to rip anybody off. They keep me in business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, electronics is big business. American consumers last year spent an 
estimated $30 billion on new home electronic equipment -- including 
televisions, VCRs and video cameras. In California alone, according to 
electronic industry statistics, consumers spend about another $1 billion a year 
on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And when their equipment fails, owners look for quick solutions: They scan the 
telephone book for an easy reference to a neighborhood repair technician -- not 
all of whom are Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Lopez comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the public -- known as laymen in the electronic and appliance repair 
industry -- Lopez does not hear some difficult foreign language when 
technicians start talking about circuit breakers and display monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My background in the business puts the shop owner at ease, he knows that I 
know what I'm talking about," says the 60-year-old Arizona native. "On the 
other hand, he can't pull any fast ones. I've caught so many repairman in 
misstatements, where their eyes get real wide and they say 'Oh, so you know 
about repairs.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on a shoestring $1.6-million annual budget, the appliance repair 
bureau employs no taxpayer dollars -- instead using funds from the $130 annual 
registration assessed the state's 8,260 repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investigators like Lopez -- all of whom have a background in electronic 
repair -- get results. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting largely on complaints, the bureau last year claimed $113,000 in refunds 
for overcharged consumers. Misdemeanor criminal charges were brought against 15 
people. Three of them went to jail, with sentences ranging up to three years. 
An additional nine had their operating licenses revoked due to incompetence or 
negligence.  
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1964 in response to pressure from electronic and appliance repair 
specialists looking for government help in policing themselves, the bureau has 
the backing of an industry that applauds the arrests of crooked operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should realize these types are a minority who give the rest of us a 
bad name," said Eloy Fierro, president of the California State Electronics 
Assn. and owner of Consumer Video Service in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys should be hung, no doubt about it. . . . We want them closed down 
as badly as consumers do." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes operators such as Joseph Jacob Arnold, whose "A Speedy Major 
Appliance Repair" of Studio City was the object of at least 37 complaints from 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the bureau revoked Arnold's license for allegedly collecting 
"non-refundable" down payments for repair work that was never completed. He has 
since fled the state, officials say. Complaints became so commonplace that 
investigators nicknamed Arnold's business "A Seedy Major Appliance Repair." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is on the trail of other alleged electronic ne'er-do-wells, including 
several Valley repair businesses who solicit money up front for work never 
done, leaving behind only a post office box and scores of duped customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be some ethics involved, some standards," he says. "If not, 
who can blame the public for not trusting anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decades after he dismantled and rebuilt his own transistor radio at age 10, 
Lopez is full of consumer tips on how to avoid becoming a repair victim. 
</P>
<P>
 First, avoid appealing to the first technician you find. "TVs and 
refrigerators, these are emotional products," he says. "People want them fixed 
right away. And so they open up the Yellow Pages and scan to the first 
good-looking ad they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of this advertising is misleading. More often than not, you're making a 
mistake by relying on these ads. Because you're bound to meet the Repairman 
From Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, consult product manufacturers for a referral to an approved repair 
technician -- most of whom are better trained than workers at mom-and-pop 
businesses. While there are many reputable small repair shops throughout Los 
Angeles, larger businesses who pay technicians an hourly salary have less 
incentive for dishonesty than smaller owner-operated concerns, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing you don't want to fall prey to is the mentality that the thing has 
to be fixed today, the repairman at your home who says 'Ma'am, I got the part 
right out there in my truck. All you have to do is say the word.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A call to the Better Business Bureau -- or to friends who have frequented the 
repair shop -- can also steer a would-be victim away from trouble. Better yet, 
Lopez says, a visit to the shop without the broken item is a good way to get 
the feel of a technician's knowledge of a particular problem, by asking 
questions about the problem and looking over the operation for signs of 
slipshod habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point," he says, "is to do your homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers should budget funds ahead of time for such repairs: "Repairs are not 
cheap, even for work done by honest businessmen," he said. "A television 
picture tube that might have cost $200 a decade ago can run as much as $1,300 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 With many television repairs, however, there are two sides to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than one-third of the 30 complaints he investigates each month, Lopez 
says, he finds that the consumer has been unreasonable -- like the woman who 
badgered both a manufacturer and the repairman for so many months over a faulty 
TV that they gave her cash and a new TV set just to get her off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Consumers From Hell, too," he says. "Much of the time I am caught 
in the middle of unresolvable problems where I can't make either party happy. 
There are threats of consumer lawsuits, repairmen who are offended because I 
questioned their ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being a mediator. It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and fellow investigator Larry Moore -- who operates out of Orange County 
-- follow a simple principal: Most repair workers are honest Joes. Some make 
stupid mistakes. And a small minority are thieves waiting for the victim to 
walk through their door. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lopez, the most satisfying aspect of the job is conducting sting 
operations to catch the real lawbreakers, playing the rube who doesn't know the 
first thing about electronic repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Or cases like the Woodland Hills caper in which the bureau used its own 
employees to play the role of a couple with a hopelessly broken television, a 
sting that eventually led to criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Fierro says the public has a critical role in keeping his industry 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people are quick to respond to these flyers and come-ons that 
guarantee some rock-bottom price, the ones that literally promise to do the job 
for free as long as you let them inside the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of that is just plain fraud. But if you're a consumer just out to save a 
buck, you become prey to these guys. And you're gonna get zapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is handing over the investigator's baton to another 
former-repairman-turned-detective, teaching him the ropes, the lessons he 
learned in two decades of ferreting out soldering-iron bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some things I've tried to get across to him," Lopez says with a 
smile. "For one, not everything is as it seems. And another is not to jump the 
gun. Listen to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 And how about the oldest adage of all: There's a sucker born every minute? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," he says. "And that includes myself. Nobody is immune."

A MATTER OF OPINIONS ON LAGUNA BEACH; * WITH THE LANDSLIDE QUESTION STILL 
UNRESOLVED, THE CITY IS WISE NOT TO RUSH ANYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news that Laguna Beach would seek yet another geological opinion on the 
fire-damaged neighborhood of Mystic Hills provides an irresistible opportunity 
for comparison with getting a second or third medical opinion from a doctor. 
The patient has been found to suffer the affliction of an ancient landslide, in 
addition to all the chronic problems associated with last year's wildfire 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners understandably are eager to rebuild, and some have questioned 
whether an old landslide could pose much of a hazard nowadays. But the city 
continues to take the prudent course by insisting that rebuilding will require 
stabilization, and it has taken steps to establish an assessment district to 
raise money for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent gesture of goodwill to those who have suffered much in the 
neighborhood and want to move forward, the city agreed last week to get yet 
another outside opinion on whether the landslide exists at all. That followed a 
long meeting the previous Saturday between residents, geologists and city staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The last couple of weeks haven't done much to ease the anguish of the 
beleaguered homeowners of the battered neighborhood. But the city is right to 
stand firm. It is refusing to issue building permits until a decision is made 
on who will pay for hillside stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
 That is expected to cost from $25,000 to $50,000 per homeowner, depending on 
the number of properties included in the zone, and the figure could drop once 
the city's part of the project is figured in. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners' eagerness to go forward is understandable. But Laguna Beach does 
not need any more surprise disasters. The city is doing what it should in 
telling people what their options are so that they can make their own best 
informed financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's stake, which it cannot abandon, is in a safe future for its 
neighborhoods.

WALK OF FAME VS. HOMELESS ON STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was interesting to read on the same page (May 7) that Huntington Beach is 
installing a special Surfing Walk of Fame, while the adjoining city of 
Westminster elected to invest $10,000 in 16 homeless people to reintroduce them 
to productive lives, hopefully with jobs, all within the three months that they 
will be sheltered. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no estimate given to the cost of the 4-foot-square personalized 
granite stones honoring the inductees to Huntington Beach's Walk of Fame nor 
how many will be so honored, but I am hoping that some of that city's largess 
will be allocated to its own growing population of street people. 
</P>
<P>
 One call to Orange County's nonprofit organization Shelter for the Homeless 
could help to pave the way for a new "walk," a Walk of Hope. The mayor's 
ensuing proclamation would be an equally "nice touch" to the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
 This might spark a new awareness within cities that invariably seem to have 
enough "budget" left for this item of self-aggrandizement or that of 
self-promotion. See what only $10,000 can do: 16 people, three months of food, 
clothing, shelter, dignity and, hopefully, ultimate self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tale of two cities, the city of Westminster, in the true spirit of a good 
neighbor, has earned a star on my Walk of Hope.

SCHULLER PHOTO UNWARRANTED, INSULTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Royal Deed Crowned" (May 23): Does Pastor Robert Schuller own stock in 
the L.A. Times? I am not Jewish, but I was really impressed by the informative 
story on Bulgaria's King Boris III's saving the Jews and how Rabbi Haim Asa, 
who was so indebted to the man, finally was able to put together the posthumous 
tribute to him. The fact that part of the ceremony was held at the Crystal 
Cathedral should not have entered into the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The first picture was great, but imagine my surprise when I turned the page 
expecting to see Rabbi Asa and King Simeon II and found Schuller! What a 
disappointment! And what an affront to the rabbi, intended or not. The rabbi 
had a very personal involvement in this tribute and spent 50 years trying to 
acknowledge his thanks. I am appalled at your egregious lack of sensitivity!

BREWER A BREATH OF FRESH AIR FOR ASSEMBLY; SHE OFFERS MODERATE VOICE AS RIVALS 
BATTLE OVER 70TH DISTRICT'S CONSERVATIVE LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 70th Assembly District is some of the most solidly Republican territory to 
be found anywhere. When Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) decided not 
to run again in the hopes of replacing Marian Bergeson in the state Senate, the 
question of succession inevitably focused on what kind of Republican 
representation the district would get. 
</P>
<P>
 But that question, at least for those who are looking for the ultimate 
conservative, has not proven so easily decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-core conservatives have found themselves divided between Thomas G. 
Reinecke, a general practice attorney and vice chairman of the county 
Republican Party, and Barry J. Hammond, an Irvine city councilman who wears his 
city's political rejection of former liberal mayor Larry Agran as a badge of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these two, Reinecke is by far the weaker candidate. Though active in state 
and local party politics, he is ideologically rigid and, at this point at 
least, seemingly short on real-life experience. Hammond has pushed the 
hot-button of an immigration "invasion" during his campaign but is well 
informed on local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the battle for the conservative mantle is that: 1) the people 
of the 70th district are not as a group necessarily so politically extreme in 
1994, and 2) the district ought to be represented by somebody who is willing to 
work with people across the aisle, since it is a fact of life that the 
Democrats control the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Ferguson has been a card-carrying member of the Legislature's 
"cavemen," opposed to almost everything and accomplishing very little. The 
district needs a breath of fresh air and moderation, someone who is reasonable. 
By almost any standard, Marilyn C. Brewer, an aide to outgoing Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, passes muster. She is a solid candidate and someone very much 
in step with the concerns of her district. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer has a close knowledge of district issues because of her position. At a 
time of mounting public concern about crime, she has been Riley's criminal 
justice adviser, working with law enforcement agencies and on the first 
anti-gang effort in South County. She also has extensive business experience as 
founder and co-owner of a manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer will not appeal to all the conservatives in the 70th, but she certainly 
is someone with whom many of them can be comfortable. Republicans in the 
district who do not customarily vote in primaries should make the effort to get 
out this time and cast a vote for Brewer.

FOUR CANDIDATES WE JUDGE BEST FOR BENCH; NOMOTO, ILES, DUTCHER, O'CONNELL 
DESERVE TO BE ELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite all the public interest in crime and punishment, this year's election 
is in one respect no different from others in the past. Most voters still will 
know little, if anything, about the judicial candidates on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet people know what they want in their judges. They want them to be 
independent, patient, have a proven record of ability and integrity, know the 
law, work hard, be fair, tough when necessary, and able to see the issues and 
make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine candidates seeking four judicial posts in Orange County on June 7, 
we recommend the following four: 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court (countywide), Office 9: B. Tam Nomoto. Two highly qualified 
municipal judges are seeking this open Superior Court seat. Judge Nomoto's 
stellar background gives her an edge. When first named to the bench in 1979, 
she was the youngest judge ever appointed in the state. She has the experience 
in civil and criminal law that is needed on the Superior Court level and has 
been described as "brilliant" by many of her colleagues. Judge Nomoto teaches 
law, has served on the state Judges' Ethics Committee and the state Judicial 
Council, and helped create Orange County's first victim-witness program. She is 
eminently qualified for the Orange County Superior Court, where cases are more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 South Orange County Municipal Court, Office 1: Pamela L. Iles. Iles, the 
incumbent, is a no-nonsense judge who in her 12 years on the bench has been 
honored for her work in victims rights and the prevention of child abuse, 
domestic violence and drunk driving. She knows the law and how to apply it -- 
and should be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 West Orange County Municipal Court (Westminster-Huntington Beach area), Office 
2: Dan C. Dutcher. Dutcher can be outspoken at times, especially when he thinks 
attorneys are not doing their jobs as well as they should. But in his 12 years 
on the bench, he has demonstrated fairness to go along with his candor. He is 
considered the best of the three candidates by his peers and has the support of 
most of the judges of the West Municipal Court. In the Orange County Bar Assn. 
Judicial Evaluation Poll of members, Judge Dutcher received a much higher 
"qualified" rating than his two opponents. He unquestionably deserves another 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Orange County Municipal Court (Santa Ana-Orange area), Office 3: 
Dennis Patrick O'Connell. Unlike the other incumbent judges we have 
recommended, Judge Claude E. Whitney faces voters with a serious cloud over his 
candidacy -- and a bright challenger, O'Connell, who deserves election. Whitney 
has been accused of refusing defendants some of their basic constitutional 
rights by denying them bail hearings and court-appointed attorneys. Whitney, a 
judge since 1989, denies the allegations. But in an unprecedented action, the 
County Bar Assn. censured him for "systematic denial of due process." And the 
state Commission on Judicial Performance this month filed misconduct charges 
against Whitney, a rare action it takes in only about 1% of the cases brought 
before it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it took the commission more than a year to act and order a 
hearing, so the matter won't be resolved before the June 7 election. That's 
unfair to Judge Whitney -- and the public. But even if Judge Whitney is found 
innocent of those charges, he has shown poor judgment and judicial demeanor. 
O'Connell is a private practice attorney with extensive trial experience. A 
large percentage of his peers in the Bar Assn. poll found O'Connell far more 
qualified. We agree, and urge his election.

 My letter is in regard to the little boy who was hit by a pickup truck when 
crossing the street after getting off the bus. I am a bus driver and I feel 
that a lot of people do not use safety precautions when they see a school 
bus.Any time you pass a school bus, please use caution and please try to slow 
down and also stop when you see the red lights flash. I can't count how many 
times people have run my red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a mother and I really feel sorry for this parent who lost her child, but 
I am also a bus driver who cares about my children who ride on my bus. So, 
please, at all times use extreme caution when passing a school bus.

 * Re: Conroy's cane ("Conroy Proposes Paddling Graffiti Vandals," May 13): 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) doesn't want to cane juvenile graffiti 
vandals, but wants a public paddling. This to provide a needed "humbling."Maybe 
he's right. Can we paddle legislators who also may need "humbling?" One whack 
for each percentage salary increase they take.

 * Hooray to Conroy for having the guts to propose paddling graffiti vandals. 
It is a humane and just act of punishment for those bent on destroying other 
people's property. Paddling should not be considered cruel and unusual 
punishment in this country, but an effective deterrent to such criminal acts as 
graffiti. And, a lot less expensive than having the vandals serve time in jail. 
Let's do it (paddling). Let's give it a chance. Parents have known for many 
generations that controlled (but not abusive) spanking (of their young 
offspring) brings about desired behavioral changes. Vandals will continue to 
destroy other people's property, until they began feeling the pain for their 
undesired acts.

THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION; ISSUES IN WESTMINSTER RECALL ARE CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Westminster's militant Firefighters' Union is intimidating this city's 
40,000 registered voters, deluging it with misleading mailings, including 
outright lies, violating even the sworn testimony of Westminster's fire chief, 
in a way that would make professional propagandists proud. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the union has tried to blame budget cuts in their outrageous 
overtime for the death in a late-night fire of someone who was "mentally 
disadvantaged" and smoked in bed. Now the 80,000 taxpayers of Westminster are 
being asked to assume higher taxes, partly because of this one death. The new 
council will be forced to pay millions more for firefighters' fraudulent 
"overtime," if the June 7 recall election passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The present Westminster City Council is the most honest one to serve in a city 
that years ago became famous for corruption. Recently it tried to keep 
Westminster financially solvent, partly by reducing the fraudulent claims of 
overtime on the part of several firemen. The state and national branches of the 
firemen's union decided to adopt Westminster as a trial case. If by spending 
$200,000 to finance lies in misleading handouts, they could gain control of 
this city of 80,000, they could gain control of other cities to knuckle under 
to union demands.  
</P>
<P>
 Voters who vote for recall will further encourage corrupt unions to force 
cities to exceed normal budgets and thus make higher taxes inevitable. Vote No 
on Recall June 7.  
</P>
<P>
 JON COVELL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I am a property owner in Westminster. I was called upon today by no less 
than Fire Chief and Mrs. John T. DeMonaco Jr. I had never met these nice people 
before, but we had a pleasant chat. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not descended upon by the hordes of no-good, out-of-town, AFL-CIO, 
carpetbagging firefighters that his honor the mayor warned me about. If I had 
been, I would have told them of my all-out support. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that every time career politicians spend too much of our tax dollars, 
they try to make up for it by getting rid of the very people we need most, 
i.e., firefighters, police and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current scandal, the city of Westminster laid off five firefighters and 
parked a firetruck, and the Westminster firefighters did not roll over and play 
dead. Since then, anyone trying to promote or speak out for the firefighters' 
union has been fired. I don't blame the firefighters for bringing in the big 
guns. They are lucky to have brothers and sisters from their union who will 
stand with them. As a striking pilot at Eastern Air Lines, I was left standing 
in the cold by my national union, and I know how lonely it can get out there. 
As a former mayor, I know how important it is to communicate with and support 
your firefighters and police. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's position is that the response time of the Fire Department has not 
decreased, and we have lost no firefighting capability. 
</P>
<P>
 God forbid we have a big fire in Westminster with current capabilities. We may 
just find out -- tragically -- how misguided Mayor Chuck Smith is.

 * The Westminster mayor and council are not being recalled because of simple 
dislike.

 Many people are against them for several reasons. Water, favoritism toward 
special groups, money spent on unneeded projects. Please research. 
</P>
<P>
 LOLA O'CONNELL

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * If I understand the Westminster Fire Department controversy correctly, the 
City Council is now attempting to bring criminal actions against city employees 
for following official policies that the City Council originally wrote and 
approved of. This kind of blatant hypocrisy is found in far too many of our 
city governments today and I applaud the citizens of Westminster for their 
recall efforts. Maybe this will be a lesson to all councils in the county.

THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION; REVIEWING RECALL ISSUES IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On June 7, we strongly recommend a "no" vote on the recall of our City 
Council members Don Bankhead, Buck Catlin and Molly McClanahan, and City Clerk 
Anne York. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations are being thrown at them by a small group who are inexperienced 
and lack knowledge of city government and the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall people advocate amending the City Charter in various ways. 
Fullerton does not have a charter to amend since it operates as a General Law 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The above council members are accused of being "big spenders." According to 
"Governments in California," Fullerton ranks in the top 10% in the state in 
effectively using its financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is also being circulated that excessive salaries are being paid to 
the Fullerton staff. Fullerton city staff salaries are actually very comparable 
to salaries of cities of like size in this area and in many cases are lower. 
Don't be misled by the recall leaders who have not had leadership roles in our 
city. Let's keep the quality of life and the services we need with a "no" vote 
on the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 DR. AND MRS. FRANCIS MACKEY 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * Regarding your recent editorial "Simple Dislike Not Reason for Recall," City 
Clerk Anne York was targeted because she (1) mixed up important recall papers 
that were personally processed by her, and she never explained or apologized to 
the recall committee for her errors, which cost us in time and extra money, and 
(2) she misapplied a subsection of the Elections Code to some words to which 
that subsection did not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not take my word for it; look at the language of the actual Recall Petition 
against her. The Times editorial staff should try to get its facts straight 
before it opines on political matters. These recalls in Fullerton and 
surrounding cities are not "simple dislike," and in the case of Fullerton, not 
just single-item issues. 
</P>
<P>
 LINDA WHITAKER 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * The rampant recall ongoing in many Southern California cities threatens to 
do more harm than good for the citizens of these communities. This is 
especially true in my city, Fullerton, where four hard-working, honest and 
longtime officials are facing recall. 
</P>
<P>
 One should expect a city council to run a clean, lean operation when there is 
a recession, and to downsize its operation. Our Fullerton City Council has done 
just that. They have given no raises to the upper echelon executives for three 
years. This current fiscal year they cut the budget another $1.9 million and 
eliminated 90 budgeted positions. The bind for the city came when the state 
took another $1.6 million in local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall group is, of course, aware of these facts. Should the recall 
operation succeed, what are the specific plans of the new council members? If 
they don't raid the city reserves, what will they specifically cut and what 
impact will this have on the quality of life in Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNIE SCHMIDT 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudence, says Webster, is "managing carefully, exercising sound judgment in 
practical matters." I applaud the Fullerton Recalls Committee for fitting into 
that definition. Not every organization has shown such prudence in its 
financial responsibility as was revealed in their recent financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to that statement, only $920 were contributions in amounts of $100 
or more. That is amazing! The rest of the monies were contributions under $100, 
indicating a broad base of givers! The expenses were minimal and reasonable. 
Thanks, Fullerton Recalls Committee, for showing that prudence and financial 
responsibility still exists! If only Mayor A.B. Catlin and council members Don 
Bankhead and Molly McClanahan had been that prudent with taxpayers' money, 
Fullerton would not have a utility tax nor would we have the need of a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The "innocent" 2% utility tax implemented by Catlin, Bankhead and McClanahan 
last October is scheduled to increase to 3% in just a few months. And don't be 
fooled, folks, they won't stop at 3%! Citizens in surrounding cities where a 
utility tax began with 2%-5% now lament they are paying 10%-12% utility taxes! 
It is clear a changing of the council must happen soon or we, too, will be 
harnessed with a heavier tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
 The next source of money these three politicians expect to extract from 
Fullerton taxpayers is a 6% increase on our water bills this year, 6% in 1995 
and 7% in 1996. However, with the recall election on June 7, they chose the 
slick political maneuver to postpone their vote until July 1. Again, don't let 
them fool you. Come July 1, if we allow them to remain in office, our summer 
water bills will skyrocket.

<P>
 * I'm still incredulous over your support of Delaine Eastin for state 
superintendent of public instruction, especially after you acknowledged one of 
her major flaws -- her obligations to the California Teachers Assn.! You have 
high praise for Maureen DiMarco, yet you did not recommend her. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly request that the editorial board reconsider its endorsement.DiMarco 
has been an advocate for students and quality education long before her public 
service began. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago she started working at the state level first as the special 
consultant to the California Department of Education, then as executive 
consultant to the superintendent of public schools, and finally as the 
governor's cabinet secretary for child development and education. She has 
steadfastly promoted what was best for education and children. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also worked successfully with both Democrats and Republicans to help 
keep our school budgets from drastic cuts during hard financial times. I 
strongly believe she has enough political savvy to do the job. She has the 
integrity and intelligence to to make the reforms in education that will most 
benefit the students.

 * As an elementary school teacher, I'm concerned about the inefficiency of 
bilingual education. I applaud the "ending bilingual education now" platform of 
Gloria Matta Tuchman, candidate for state superintendent of public instruction. 
I've found the general public is unaware bilingual education means numerous 
students are taught to read and write in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 This is happening in the classroom at the expense of all English learners who 
must wait for the teacher's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman will end the state's bilingual program and implement an inexpensive 
and effective English immersion program. It's time we elect an 
elementary-school teacher who has been in the classroom and knows what does and 
doesn't work.

THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION; JUDGE SHOULD BE JUDGED IMPARTIALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm responding to your article on Judge Claude E. Whitney ("O.C. Municipal 
Judge Facing State Charges," May 18). 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office is a notoriously liberal, tax-supported entity 
whose sole job is to see that indigent individuals accused of a crime are 
defended in court in a manner resulting in a not-guilty verdict or freeing them 
through plea-bargaining, diversionary programs or clouding the facts to the 
extent that juries are confused and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, this group is the last one to sit in judgment on a judge whose 
decisions may have gone against them. 
</P>
<P>
 I would pay more attention to defense lawyers who are not from the public 
defender's office and determine if they feel that the judge was over-harsh and 
his rulings "faulty," as well as to his peers in Municipal Court, who are well 
aware of what goes on in other courtrooms.

THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION; CITRON'S POLICY DEFENDED, QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Tustin City Councilman Jeffrey Thomas is playing politics with taxpayer 
money ("Tustin Pulls Its Money Out of County Portfolio," April 14), and the 
citizens of Tustin deserve to understand why Thomas is acting so fast and loose 
with their city's financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a member of the campaign fund-raising committee for John Moorlach -- a 
political candidate who has decided to run against our well-respected County 
Treasurer, Robert L. Citron, in the upcoming June election -- recently went 
behind the backs of other Tustin council members to persuade the city finance 
director to interfere with the city's long-term financial planning and withdraw 
Tustin's $4 million in funds from Orange County's investment pool. Thomas and 
Moorlach hoped that this political stunt would get them some much needed press 
for their fledging political campaign. But unfortunately, their stunt will cost 
the hard working taxpayers of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the first eight months of their most recent investment, the 
city of Tustin had already earned about $100,000 in interest on the money 
Citron invested for them in the county pool -- an amount that Tustin Treasurer 
Ronald A. Nault acknowledged was a respectable return on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise that Thomas' allies on the Tustin City Council were 
soundly defeated for reelection by two candidates who campaigned on reforming 
Tustin's City Hall politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Citron has successfully managed the county's taxpayer dollars for over 24 
years. He has repeatedly been honored for returning more earnings on Orange 
County's investment dollars than any other local government treasurer in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason he has been endorsed for reelection by numerous Republican and 
Democratic elected officials within the county. I am confident that the voters 
of Orange County will overwhelmingly reelect Bob Citron to his seventh 
successful term. The investment of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is too 
important to trust to "partisan political hacks" like Jeffrey Thomas and John 
Moorlach. 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLYMAN TOM UMBERG

<P>
 * Your article "O.C. Treasury Turmoil Puts Officials on Alert" (May 5) should 
put the residents of Orange County on alert. Apparently people in the financial 
world agree with candidate John Moorlach regarding potential problems 
associated with the present county treasurer making high-risk investments at a 
questionable time. Isn't that the problem which caused the downfall of so many 
savings and loans? This could be very dangerous and I appreciate Mr. Moorlach 
calling it to our attention. No matter who wins the election, let's hope this 
situation will be addressed in a responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
 BONNIE O'NEIL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial supporting Robert L. Citron for reelection (May 24) missed an 
important point: that Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas Fuentes has 
confirmed that Citron is being targeted for defeat, even though the job is 
supposed to be nonpartisan, because he is a "liberal, partisan Democrat." Even 
Republicans should be offended by that kind of reasoning. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I am a Republican. I am a conservative Republican. As a Republican I have 
watched the campaign by John Moorlach for county treasurer against Bob Citron 
with shame. It appears that we have "partisan politics" at its worst and my 
party is the guilty one. It exemplifies why too many voters -- and non-voters 
-- have such disdain for both major parties. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a county treasurer, Bob Citron, who has a proven skill level, a proven 
track record and is extraordinarily qualified for the post. In contrast, we 
have candidate whose qualifications for the post are very arguable, creating a 
torrent of misinformed press releases that, while intended to discredit Citron 
with voters, also discredit our county treasurer's office with the money 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't engage here in a debate of the arbitrage techniques that Mr. Moorlach 
has attacked, except to say the rating services have not felt that the 
portfolio represents unusual risk. However, it is established fact that Mr. 
Citron has made well above average returns in good markets and bad markets, 
with high interest rates, and low interest rates. It is inexcusable to create 
the kind of misinformation Mr. Moorlach and Mr. Chriss Street are creating and 
then casually dismiss it as a normal campaign tactics.

THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION; 'YES' ON PROP. 1C IS VOTE TO IMPROVE HIGHER 
EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * California's reputation as a leader in public higher education is in 
jeopardy unless we in Orange County and others around the state pull together 
to make a difference. We can start on June 7 by voting "yes" on Proposition 1C, 
the Higher Education Facilities Bond Act, which will restore the greatness of 
California public education and improve the state's respected place in the 
education community. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C will provide $900 million in new investment bonds for 
improvements in classrooms, libraries, research centers and other facilities at 
our community colleges and public universities. Orange County's four community 
college districts -- Coast, North Orange, Rancho Santiago and Saddleback -- 
along with UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach, Long Beach 
City College and Cal Poly Pomona, will receive more than $85 million if 
Proposition 1C passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C will also create 10,000 new jobs and $2 billion in increased 
economic activity for California, fund long overdue earthquake and safety 
improvements, and establish new facilities to provide adult Californians of all 
educational levels with career training and job retraining opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part about Proposition 1C is that every penny will work to make these 
things happen for Orange County and elsewhere around the state. None of the 
funds will go to administrative salaries or overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A vote for Proposition 1C on June 7 is a vote for public higher education, for 
jobs and for economic security. It's a vote all of us can live with but few of 
us can live without. I urge you to vote "yes" on Proposition 1C.

 * UCI is coping with permanent state budget cuts of more than $24 million 
since 1990. By next year, the University of California will have cut its budget 
by $433 million in four years. Although there is little hope that the state 
dollars of yesteryear ever will be restored, there are ways that California's 
voters can support higher education.  
</P>
<P>
 One such way is a "yes" vote on Proposition 1C. If passed, the measure will 
fund earthquake safety projects and building upgrades long overdue throughout 
Orange County's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, the $900-million measure will mean more than $23 million in additional 
classroom space as well as renovations and seismic improvements to campus 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C would provide $16.3 million for construction of a humanities 
building that will increase classroom space, add computer stations and house 
the Campuswide Honors Program, the Center for International Education and 
Instructional Development Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Also part of the measure: $6.6 million for seismic renovations and other 
upgrades to the central plant building, improvements that will provide 
additional cooling capacity to the campus and $467,000 for seismic and other 
renovations to the social sciences buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure -- in addition to providing campus buildings -- will 
strengthen California's economy as well. It is estimated that the projects 
funded will create more than 10,000 jobs and improve job training through 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 All Californians benefit from a strong higher education system. Proposition 1C 
is essential for California's economic strength today and tomorrow. Vote yes.

<P>
 * I am a student at California State University, Fullerton, and I have 
recently become aware of a new proposition that will better the community 
colleges and public universities of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C will not provide funds for administrative salaries and 
expenses. It will, among other things, upgrade colleges and universities with 
new computers, science labs and other high-tech improvements so that our work 
force can compete with the best in the world. In recent years, as the education 
budget withers away and classes are continuously cut, my fees continue to rise. 
However, the university keeps admitting new students when the students that are 
already there aren't able to get classes. When students inquire about the 
diminishing quality of programs, faculty or resources, budget cuts are always 
the scapegoat. All we hear is how there isn't enough money. How can there not 
be enough money to maintain quality? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 1C may not create more classes, it will improve the 
quality of these institutions. At CSUF alone it will: invest in seismic 
upgrades, strengthening the campus to prevent injuries and costly damage in an 
earthquake; upgrade fire and safety standards; fund an addition to the 
University Library; construct an addition to the physical education building; 
construct a 1,200-seat auditorium/fine arts instructional facility, and develop 
plans and working drawings for the renovation of McCarthy Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states pride themselves on the quality of education they offer -- what 
happened to California?

GIVING STUDENTS A STRONG FOUNDATION; PALMDALE HOME-BUILDING PROGRAM GIVES A 
BOOST TO CAREER ASPIRATIONS OF PARTICIPANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The knock on high school vocational education courses here and around the 
nation is that far too many involve outdated offerings that have little to do 
with the modern workplace. At their worst, these programs are also misused as 
dumping grounds for students who have displayed limited academic promise. The 
consequence is a steady stream of young adults whose skills are too 
unsophisticated for a job market that demands high technology expertise or 
effective training in specialized tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a couple of years ago, educators in the Carolinas, Oregon, Wisconsin and 
Rhode Island came up with a better way. They had begun to re-examine the old 
concept of apprenticeships in which high school students were taught core 
academic subjects while also working and training with businesses. Their 
program was designed to give students basic and up-to-date training under the 
watchful eye of skilled adult workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Howard County, Maryland, program drew students from every high school there 
to build houses from the ground up, under the watchful eye of professionals and 
county inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we are pleased to note at least one California school district that is 
matching the progress found in other parts of the nation. It can be found in a 
partnership between the city of Palmdale, the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District and a developer called Centex Homes. Under its auspices, students have 
built two three-bedroom, two-bath homes with lots of amenities in east 
Palmdale. Before, students there had mastered nothing more ambitious than the 
occasional shed or gazebo. 
</P>
<P>
 In disaster-ravaged Southern California, we can't think of a better trade to 
master than home construction. And that's exactly what some students, like Ben 
Balagtas, are now considering. Balagtas had no post-high school plans before 
the home-building project. Now, he's eyeing a career in carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of program that ought to be duplicated by other school 
districts in the region, and with other types of professions and businesses as 
well.

DISTRICT SHOULD ASK: WHAT WENT RIGHT HERE?; IT NEEDS TO TAKE A LESSON FROM 
PACOIMA CHARTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are times when the Los Angeles Unified School District seems to resemble 
the firm that wishes former partners well as they set out to work on their own. 
Sure, they hope that their old stablemates are successful. . .just maybe not 
too successful. After all, if the folks who left wind up putting out a better 
product, it's going to reflect a bit poorly on some of those business-as-usual 
bureaucrats at the old firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the worst-case scenario for the programs that shift more authority from 
the central bureaucracy to individual schools is that some of those bureaucrats 
might be more concerned with protecting their own jobs than anything else. The 
best-case scenario is one in which the school system simply decides to learn 
what it can from the local control efforts, and acts accordingly. Where the 
LAUSD stands at this point is open to debate, but it is not yet as close to the 
latter as we would like. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the somewhat begrudging praise the district had for one of 
its charter schools, the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center, in Pacoima. 
Charter schools are free from state and district regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Vaughn's energetic principal, Yvonne Chan, was claiming an 
end-of-the-year savings of $1.2 million, a stupendous accomplishment in a 
school system with so much red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the district sent its auditors out to see what was what at Vaughn. We 
then heard about the special treatment and financial breaks the district gave 
Vaughn, breaks that cannot be extended to other schools. Then, we were told 
that Vaughn officials had miscalculated by about $200,000. Both of these facts, 
the district said, reduced Vaughn's end-of-year surplus to about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it seems to us that coming in just $3,000 under budget in your first 
year of relative independence would be grounds for a pat on the school's 
collective back and a hearty "well done." Coming in $30,000 under projected 
expenditures would be grounds for a rousing cheer and a public relations 
campaign about how Vaughn and similar efforts are helping to turn the troubled 
LAUSD around. Hitting the finish line with $300,000 worth of gas left in your 
tank? We're talking ticker tape parade here, from an accounting standpoint. The 
district should have been far more enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other things that the district said about Vaughn were more on target. Chan, 
for example, was praised for being innovative and for serving as the catalyst 
for reforms that other schools are now trying to copy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the auditors who were so thorough in pointing out that Vaughn 
really hadn't done as well as it had claimed seem to be needed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the cash-strapped district so badly bungled its application for 
a National Science Foundation grant that it was one of only two urban school 
districts around the nation that were rejected. The cost to students was $15 
million -- money that could have been used to revamp the way math and science 
is taught. It gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less Foundation officials, who last year pledged $10 million to help 
upgrade the LAUSD's deteriorating athletic facilities, are so miffed at the 
district that they have withheld payment on the second installment of the 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the LAUSD let $260,000 of the money already obtained from Food 4 
Less sit unused for months. Some LAUSD officials contend that Food 4 Less might 
be trying to renege on its promise, but the foundation denies that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another example of what happens when things are assigned 
bureaucratically," rather than as "red alert" priority issues, said Mike Roos, 
president of the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now school 
reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 We have another way of putting it: score one for Vaughn, subtract two for the 
LAUSD bureaucracy.

A CASE OF ENLIGHTENED PHILANTHROPY; DONATIONS OF CASH, EQUIPMENT TO THE LAPD 
MAY HELP MAKE THE VALLEY A SAFER PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hardly reassuring to hear about the many equipment-related woes of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. There were aging patrol cars that stalled 
frequently, even in parades. There were handcuffs that would not work properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, perhaps, there was the story of an attempt by the LAPD to keep 
track of the many thousands of convicted sexual offenders who live here. This 
came during the height of the fears generated by a serial child molester in the 
San Fernando Valley last year. Well, the police effort stalled because they had 
neither the computer equipment nor the money to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is heartening to note that many businesses and individuals have been paying 
attention. And charitable donations to the needy LAPD so far this year have 
already surpassed the total for all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks in the West Valley are to be commended for being particularly generous. 
Police stationed there have received thousands of dollars worth of computers, 
bicycles and even automobiles and high-tech cameras used to produce extra-sharp 
photographs of evidence. The largess here includes 13 computers from Great 
Western Bank that are being used to help officers write crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a hint for those who are still interested in donating computer-related 
materials. The police badly need networking hardware and software, so that 
these computers can be used to transmit data back and forth. For the most part, 
the computers are still being used for basic word processing. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Sgt. Walt Kainz credits City Council member Laura Chick for 
inspiring the new generosity. She set the tone by turning over $80,000 from her 
office budget to the West Valley Division and three of the seven city cars 
assigned to her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more is needed, however, and those interested in helping out can do so by 
calling the following numbers for nonprofit police support organizations. 
Donations made through such groups are tax-deductible. You can call 756-8406 or 
342-5725 for donations to police in the West Valley; 756-8308 for Van Nuys; 
756-8838 for North Hollywood; 756-8866 for Foothill, and 756-8270 for 
Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Money donated to the West Valley police was used to buy $1,500 in 
sophisticated cameras for use in court and criminal investigations. That's 
exactly the kind of help that the police need and that the city may be unable 
to provide.

CLAS TEST IS PART OF STATE EDUCATIONAL MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Sue Stokka, Billy Pricer and Tony Welch object to the California Learning 
Assessment System because it violates that part of the education code requiring 
parental consent. Yet by their vote, these trustees of the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District were unable to come to that consensus, to take the 
tenable position of parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
 As nobly stated by Bill Olenick and supported by Wilda Andrejcik, "We have to 
respect parents' rights on both sides of this question." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokka, Pricer and Welch have encouraged and invited, have given aid, comfort 
and credibility to attacks from without while illegally destroying the 
district's integrity and viability from within. They have knowingly abused the 
power of their elected offices and let their own myopic views dictate their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's this I see on the horizon? The CLAS test has become a political 
issue. Now Pete Knight and the state Legislature and the candidates for 
governor are going to kick CLAS around. They'll fix the CLAS test I'm sure. 
After all, they've helped make education in California 50th of the 50 states in 
funding -- the lowest -- and 50th of the 50 states in student-to-teacher ratio 
-- the highest. 
</P>
<P>
 I can hardly wait.

BETTER WAY NEEDED TO GAUGE POLICE EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "Thin Blue Line Being Stretched Ever Thinner" (May 8) 
compared the number of police officers per square mile in various cities. This 
may be one method of comparing the effectiveness or the need for police, but it 
is perhaps one of the weakest.Population density in those square miles would be 
the big factor. Since Los Angeles is so spread out geographically, it is 
probably not a very good comparison when it stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest that a more comprehensive set of statistics could shed more 
light on the level of our police needs. We seem to get these statistics 
piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison by city is important, but why not give us the whole picture: the 
number of police officers, perhaps broken down by categories like patrol, 
administrative, management, detectives and so on.

SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS NEED BETTER SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a retired Los Angeles Unified School District contract teacher and I am 
currently a substitute teacher for the same district. I've experienced many 
teaching problems mentioned in the article "Teachers' Absenteeism Troubles L.A. 
District" (May 9), as well as the exhilarating rewards of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quotes facts and figures about the effect of teachers' absences on 
learning in the classroom. It made valid points about salary cuts, work and 
contract conditions, education studies and the well-known difficulties and 
stress of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spin of the article also indicated that substitute teachers, better 
known as "subs," play a major part in contributing to the lack of learning in 
the classroom. "They," the article goes on to say, "often do not have the same 
training or experience as regular teachers and can face different behavior 
problems." The head of the district's substitute teachers division adds to the 
picture of ineptness when he is quoted as saying, "It's not an uncommon 
complaint that substitutes are not as competent." 
</P>
<P>
 Substitutes are seldom referred to as teachers. They are frequently introduced 
to the class as, "your sub for today is . . . ." Yet these itinerant teachers 
are faced with teaching challenges unlike contract teachers. They are faced 
with an array of different grade levels, different students, different or 
nonexistent lesson plans and an indifferent administration. The conditions 
under which they work are difficult. They are seldom given the professional 
credit and courtesy they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are quick to seize on this situation and test the limits of the 
replacement's tolerance.  
</P>
<P>
 The substitute-teaching pool is composed of educated, certified, hard-working 
teachers who should be treated with professionalism and concern. They need 
backing from the school. Too many times, teacher assistants are not sent to the 
classrooms of absent teachers, which also hinders the replacement teacher and 
further disrupts continuity of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Students' time with a substitute or replacement teacher could be a rewarding 
experience if the administration helped them instead of just saying, "Here's 
the key to the classroom. Have a good day."

ANOTHER OPTION FOR EAST-WEST RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There is a better, more cost-effective way to make east-west Valley rail a 
reality than either of the two plans currently under consideration ("Valley 
Rail Plans Called Feasible," May 10). 
</P>
<P>
 How about an elevated line along the Chandler/Burbank route? 
</P>
<P>
 This would eliminate the tremendous expense of either tunneling across the 
Valley or widening the Ventura Freeway to make room for the line there. Also, 
commuters could park in lots laid on the existing rail bed, saving the cost of 
acquiring land for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains themselves are not particularly loud, and they would not have to 
use their horns. They would have to blow the horns only when crossing a street 
at the grade. An elevated line would be a minimal noise nuisance. Up north, 
much of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in the East Bay is elevated, and for 
years trains have been running unobtrusively through residential and commercial 
districts alike. That is a good model for the San Fernando Valley.

GUARDIAN ANGELS COULD BE SOLUTION TO CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was greatly impressed with G.C. (Brodie) Broderson's recommendation that 
the Guardian Angels be used to patrol the crime-infested areas of Sepulveda 
Boulevard (May 5). 
</P>
<P>
 God knows everything else has been tried, with only temporary success at 
best.Broderson's proposal could bring greater and more constant pressure on the 
prostitutes, johns, pimps and other criminals who frequent the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional police sweeps and sting operations just don't do the job. It's 
incredible how quickly these people are right back on the street doing the same 
thing for which they were just arrested. Broderson's proposal comes at a time 
when too many people have the attitude of "what's the use." 
</P>
<P>
 Just this past week, my daughter was in one of the stores along Sepulveda 
Boulevard when two gang members walked in, calmly stole some merchandise and 
jumped into a waiting car. The owner didn't even bother to call the police. It 
had happened several times before, and another time-consuming police report, 
with little chance of favorable results, wasn't going to make it any better. 
</P>
<P>
 Hats off to Broderson. He obviously hasn't given up and keeps moving ahead for 
a better community.

GUIDELINES FOR TOURISTS VISITING DISASTER SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Good riddance to the Northridge Meadows Apartments! 
</P>
<P>
 For two months I have driven down Reseda Boulevard hoping and praying for the 
day residents and relatives of the victims could retrieve personal items and go 
forth to make the best of what they have. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I came upon tourists who would drive 2 m.p.h. trying to see the 
apartments. These people failed to realize that when they were rolling past the 
apartments, it backed up traffic as far back as the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is one rule I would like to add to the "Morons Are Us" guidebook, tourist 
section, for the next earthquake or large aftershock: 
</P>
<P>
 Do not drive extremely slowly down a main street knowing that at least half 
the major freeways are closed and that this will cause unnecessary traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense scenario: "Hmmm, maybe I should park my car, get out and take a 
look!" 
</P>
<P>
 Please practice five to 10 times a day because you never know when the next 
big one will hit.

MINISKIRT DESCRIPTION WAS OUT OF BOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Drug dealing, prostitution, theft, assault, murder and rape are important 
issues. Unfortunately, a May 8 story addressing these subjects digresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The description of the prostitute whose "fuchsia miniskirt was stretched tight 
across plump thighs and buttocks" was a jaunt into an area of the writer's 
perspective that, frankly, I'd prefer to stay away from.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; A FORMAL INTRODUCTION TO A SHY, GRAY, ENDANGERED BIRD; 
SELDOM SEEN, THE MIGRATING SONGBIRD HAS TWO STRIKES AGAINST IT: IT PREFERS TO 
NEST CLOSE TO RIVERS AND STREAMS AND IT BUILDS ITS NEST NEAR THE GROUND, CLOSE 
TO PREDATORS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When there's news of endangered species, the chances are that the least Bell's 
vireo will pop up in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a small gray, unobtrusive bird that flits nervously through the trees 
as it searches for insects. It has a charming song: a questioning rise, a 
pause, then an answering fall: Cheedle cheedle chee? Cheedle cheedle chew! 
Aside from that, there's little about the bird's appearance to distinguish it.  
</P>
<P>
 What does distinguish it is its precarious status in nature and the fact that 
it makes its summer home along the Santa Clara River in Ventura County, among 
other places. As an endangered species, the little bird is the subject of 
government protection plans in much of Southern California and a restoration 
program in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The intention here is to introduce people to the bird, which is often written 
about but, like many once-common migrating songbirds, seldom seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The least Bell's vireo (least because it's the smallest of several subspecies) 
may be in worse shape than others. It has two strikes against it. It prefers to 
nest close to rivers and streams bordered by a thick growth of willow trees 
with lush vegetation, exactly the kind of riverside habitat in demand for 
housing and agriculture. As the human population increases, nesting 
opportunities decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The vireo's other serious problem is predation. It builds its cup-shaped nest 
close to the ground, so the eggs and the nestlings are vulnerable to cats, dogs 
and other small animals. 
</P>
<P>
 An even greater threat is the brown-headed cowbird, a native bird that lays 
its eggs in nests of small birds. Cowbirds do not build their own nests but 
have developed the labor-saving method of conning other birds into raising 
young cowbirds. The female cowbird spots a bird building its nest, and when a 
finished nest is unattended, she slips in and lays her own egg. 
</P>
<P>
 This brood parasitism, as it's known, has several interesting features. The 
cowbird egg usually hatches before the vireo eggs, and the young cowbirds 
frequently push the vireo chicks out of the nest. Even if they let the "host" 
chicks stay, baby cowbirds are almost always larger and noisier, so they get 
fed more frequently. And they grow very fast. It is a strange and pitiful sight 
to observe a small adult bird feeding a demanding interloper twice its size 
while its own young are neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't the vireo recognize the strange egg and evict it from the nest or 
even abandon the nest and build another? On rare occasion it does, building a 
new floor to the nest on top of the unwanted egg and thus killing it. The 
normal vireo response, however, is to raise the cowbird as its own. 
</P>
<P>
 One scientific explanation is that the least Bell's vireo did not always have 
two strikes against it. Its inability to outfox the cowbird is thought to 
result from historical inexperience with cowbirds. Before the pioneers moved 
West, the usual range of the cowbird was the Great Plains, where it foraged in 
the grass for the insects that the great buffalo herds kicked up. (Today, 
cowbirds follow cows.) The settlers cut down the forests, planted crops and 
laid out their pastures. Eventually the cowbirds moved in to share territory 
with the vireo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Species of birds that have shared their range with cowbirds for thousands of 
years have, through evolution, learned to cope. They recognize the parasitic 
eggs and destroy them. Both parents vigorously attack cowbird females and drive 
them off. 
</P>
<P>
 The least Bell's vireo was declared an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service in 1986, and the service's mandate is to take all possible 
measures to rescue it from extinction. The vireo is also listed as endangered 
by the state of California. Once abundant and widespread throughout the Central 
Valley, the vireo had a range that extended from northern California to 
northern Baja. Today, the range has shrunk to four counties in southwestern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 With habitat restoration along rivers and streams, cowbird control and 
protection of unspoiled riverside areas in places such as the Prado Basin and 
the Santa Margarita River, perhaps the decline of the vireo has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, there were 300 breeding pairs of least Bell's vireos in the United 
States. This year, there are 550. Fish and Wildlife people have done a great 
job, but despite the increase, it will be many years before the vireo may be 
safely removed from the list of endangered species.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; BIG TUJUNGA WASH WORTH PRESERVING AS CITY'S LAST UNTAMED

THEY SHOULD ALSO BE TRYING TO SAVE THIS RIVER, ONE SURROUNDED BY GRASS AND 
ROCKS INSTEAD OF CONCRETE.

<P>
 For many people in Los Angeles, Big Tujunga Wash has become a symbol, a 
reminder of what our area looked like hundreds of years ago, before developers 
bulldozed and before people settled. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cosmo World announced it was going to build a private 18-hole golf course 
on the land, local residents and environmentalists throughout the state were 
outraged, myself included. 
</P>
<P>
 The wash is the latest in a long line of L.A.'s natural areas to be threatened 
by developers. But it is more than just another flood plain. The Big Tujunga is 
the last untamed river in the city of Los Angeles. People have been talking 
about saving the Los Angeles River for years. They should also be trying to 
save the Big Tujunga, a river surrounded by rocks and grasslands instead of 
paved concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Many developers care little about natural beauty. For them, it all comes down 
to dollars. Cosmo World's golf course is being designed exclusively for 
corporate membership -- unaffordable for most of us. The company claims its 
golf course will create jobs, but the developer's own documents show only 50 
full-time jobs would be created by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 As a legislator, member of the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee 
and former chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Small Business, I have 
always tried to balance environmental and economic needs and believe that 
preservation does not mean the loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserved in its natural state, the wash can be incorporated into an 800-acre 
nature preserve linking the nearby Hansen Dam Recreation Area to Angeles 
National Forest. A public park would provide the foundation for hundreds of 
jobs at small businesses, as the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be the birth of a new community. With careful planning, the area 
could serve as a model for harmonizing environmental and economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, I authored legislation creating the Rim of the Valley Trail for 
public recreation and wildlife corridors. Big Tujunga Wash is a top priority 
acquisition in the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor Master Plan. The plan helps 
guide the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the Legislature in preserving 
important resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy began negotiations with Cosmo 
World in hopes of purchasing the land and keeping it as public open space. The 
deal fell through a month later when Cosmo World indicated it was not willing 
to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 But things have changed in the past year. I think it's time for Cosmo World 
and the conservancy to sit down and talk again. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a long-awaited opinion on 
the area and determined that any development in Big Tujunga Wash will 
jeopardize the viability of the slenderhorned spineflower, which is on the 
federal Endangered Species List. This little flower could end up being the 
savior of Big Tujunga Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The "jeopardy opinion" issued by the Interior Department will make it 
difficult for anyone to build on that land. If Big Tujunga Wash is destroyed, 
all chances of the spineflower's surviving could go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo World has tried different strategies to address the spineflower 
"problem." It pledged to set aside 78 acres within the golf course as a 
spineflower preserve or replant them away from the golf course. But neither of 
these were acceptable alternatives to the Department of Interior, especially 
since it is extremely doubtful that the spineflower would survive replanting. 
Cosmo World also threatened to bulldoze the spineflowers, a plan shot down by 
the California Department of Fish and Game that only served to galvanize the 
environmental community further. 
</P>
<P>
 I have written to Cosmo World's attorney and the conservancy, asking them once 
again to negotiate a deal. While the Army Corps of Engineers, which has 
jurisdiction over the wash, has not yet determined if it will issue a permit to 
Cosmo World, I think any further development in the area will be denied, 
especially since the Department of the Interior's position was stated so 
strongly. Cosmo World's best chance for selling the property may now be to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that a small spineflower could stop development on the land. Now 
we need to take the next step -- have the area preserved permanently for public 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of the Interior has made it clear there should be no 
development on the land; environmentalists and neighbors have made it clear 
they don't want Big Tujunga Wash destroyed. Now it is time for Cosmo World and 
the conservancy to do the right thing. This is Cosmo World's best shot at 
getting a fair price for the land and the public's best chance for preserving a 
piece of our heritage and keeping L.A.'s last untamed river free.

 "Are you in The Industry?" I was asked at a party one night soon after I moved 
to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industry?" I repeated, blankly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Aren't you in The Business?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What business?" I asked innocently. The hostess interrupted almost 
apologetically. "John's a writer . . . for magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 There was an awkward pause as my companions looked into their drinks before 
moving toward a group discussing the character development pertinent to the 
thematic structure of Martin Scorsese's latest film. 
</P>
<P>
 When I moved to the Valley from the South Bay beach area, I knew there would 
be a lot of changes. Hotter summers, bigger traffic jams, better bagels. What I 
didn't expect was a language barrier. I don't speak Filmeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, they treat you fine here at first, until they find out you're not "at" one 
of the studios. (Proper declension: "I'm at Fox, you're at Universal, he, she, 
it's at Disney.") If the initials MCI, DGA or at the very least SAG do not 
follow your name, you may as well move to Pomona. Ph.D. or DDS doesn't cut it 
in this part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the major studios located in the Valley, everyone is in the know 
and all discussions are centered on show business. Just eavesdrop at any 
watering hole in town. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's not studio executive wanna-bes discussing the points in Sly's latest 
three-picture play-or-pay mega-deal, it's screenwriters whose high conceptual 
imagery spec script is just this far from Spielberg's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the waitress how she is and she'll tell you she is up for something, as in 
"I am up for a 'Family Matters.' " This is actor's lingo for auditioning. To 
further translate, it means they're unemployed at the time. And I thought high 
school Latin was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone not associated with the film business (although I was a movie usher 
in high school), I felt like an outsider from the moment I passed LAX and 
mounted Sepulveda Pass. While looking at houses, the real estate agent (who was 
up for a "Murder She Wrote") would swear the house once belonged to a celebrity 
-- as if living in a house that Norma Desmond once owned could make up for 
hideous bathroom tile. 
</P>
<P>
 I soon learned there are five seasons in the Valley -- winter, spring, summer, 
fall and pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was truly a one-industry town. Almost every store I walked into had walls 
bedecked with autographed celebrity photos, all but promising that Cher would 
be wandering back to the carwash that very afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At newsstands, Time magazine is buried beneath Dramaloge, the Hollywood 
Reporter and Daily Variety, and everyone is always discussing a meeting they 
took about their production company's syndication package which has just been 
given the green light if everyone involved can agree to something called "the 
points." Doesn't anyone talk about football here? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that we weren't show biz savvy in the South Bay. After all, the lady 
who played Marlo's mother on "That Girl" lives in Palos Verdes. And didn't 
Chuck Norris once have a Karate Studio in Torrance? But down south, you could 
talk to someone without the phrase "studio shake-up" occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 People actually spoke of politics and world situations and family concerns 
that were not fodder for a movie of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, my neighbors all go to work at the high-walled studios, and although 
they tell me they are gaffers or best boys or grips, I've decided not to ask 
exactly what that entails. 
</P>
<P>
 They all wear those trendy studio jackets and baseball caps emblazoned with 
the logos of popular television or films (available only to cast and crews of 
shows, they will point out proudly) and are always ending stories with "Well, 
you know how Eisner is . . ." while everyone nods in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a secret handshake as well? I haven't felt this left out since I 
didn't letter in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But one adapts. After a few weeks of living here, I listened and learned (I've 
always had an ear for languages). Now, at parties when introduced to strangers, 
I find myself smiling and saying "I'm a free-lance writer. . . . But what I 
really want to do is direct."

 BABY-SITTING FEES: Huntington Beach wants to strike back at parents who let 
their youngsters hang around downtown past the city's 10 p.m. juvenile curfew. 
The Police Department is researching a possible "baby-sitting fee" for parents 
whose children are detained during curfew sweeps. . . . Says Councilman Ralph 
Bauer: "It appears (the city) is being asked to do baby-sitting, so we should 
charge a fee for that service." 
</P>
<P>
 GROWING PAINLESS: You've got until June 16 to browse at Newport Beach's Center 
Library. After that, it becomes a part of the Newport Harbor Art Museum 
complex. Then it's almost a month of moving time before the new Central Library 
opens at 1000 Avocado Ave. . . . Some comparisons: The old library was 14,000 
square feet; the new one 54,000. The old library has 135,000 books and other 
items -- the new one will have room for 260,000. "We won't have that many for a 
long time," says spokesman Tom Johnson. "But at least we'll have room to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW TURF: His campaign to legalize drugs has made Superior Court Judge James 
P. Gray unpopular with some colleagues. But it's spurred community interest in 
him. . . . He's commencement speaker today for the law class graduation at 
Western State University in Fullerton. . . . But Gray has already said he won't 
make his drug campaign his subject. Instead, he plans to advise graduates to 
get involved in social issues as they pursue their legal careers. 
</P>

 POST-PARTRIDGE: Nickleodeon is still showing reruns with singer-actress 
Shirley Jones as the "Partridge Family" mom. Since those days, she's spent much 
of her time on the concert stage. But it's not the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center that's bringing her here today. . . . . It's a truck show. Jones is 
top celebrity at the "Keep on Trucking" working truck show at Anaheim Stadium 
today. Her props: Nearly one thousand big rigs will be on display.

 POPULAR GAME: Only 19 days left till the World Cup, and soccer fans can't 
wait. The game is a big deal in the Valley, and getting bigger. Lolly Keys, a 
national spokeswoman for the American Youth Soccer Organization, says about 
41,000 Valley kids take part in league play, up 10% from last year. . . . "They 
have an aggressive campaign to sign kids up," Keys said, "and you can play all 
year round." 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT RUN: Well, you can't win all the time. But the Chatsworth High girls 
soccer team certainly tried to prove that adage wrong. Since City girls soccer 
began in 1988, the team won every championship until this year. . . . But they 
finally lost in the semifinals to San Pedro. "It was a nice run," said Co-Coach 
Jack Sidwell, "but all good things must come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 NATIVE SONS: Former Westlake High School teammates Eric Wynalda and Cobi Jones 
(above) are back together again, and this time, a little more than school pride 
is at stake. They are valuable members of the U.S. team. Both are fast, bold 
midfielders who love a shot at the net. A year older than Jones, Wynalda also 
has a leg up on Jones in experience, having played two seasons as a pro in 
Germany. 
</P>

 FAMILY TIES: There are no superstars on the U.S. team, says Cobi Jones, which 
means everyone must fit together exactly right. Otherwise, they could be booted 
out of competition pretty fast. "Most of us have been playing together for a 
few years," Jones said, "so we've become like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 SLIM AND NONE: Unity or not, the U.S. team isn't likely to win the World Cup. 
In fact, according to Harrah's in Reno, the odds are 40-1 against such a 
miracle. Actually, the odds would be even slimmer, said John Levy, Harrah's 
sports book supervisor, if the competition weren't being staged in this 
country. . . . Germany is favored at 3-1, with Brazil and Italy next at 4-1.

STRIDENT MESSAGE HITS A NERVE; RACE: CRENSHAW CROWD FERVENTLY APPLAUDS 
EX-NATION OF ISLAM AIDE KHALLID MUHAMMAD, REVILED BY MANY AS A HATEMONGER. 
BACKERS SAY HE PREACHES SELF-SUFFICIENCY, NOT RACISM.

<P>
 Khallid Abdul Muhammad, condemned nationally by most black and white leaders 
as a racist hatemonger, was greeted with fervent applause Saturday night by a 
mostly black audience of more than 1,000 in a Crenshaw district theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad -- fired last year from his job as a senior aide to Louis Farrakhan, 
head of the Nation of Islam -- displayed once again his strident brand of black 
nationalism that is routinely laced with condemnation of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that blacks have suffered more than Jews at the hands of oppressors 
("the black holocaust is one hundred times worse than any other holocaust," he 
said at one point), Muhammad quickly launched into the kind of name-calling and 
racial mockery that has earned him national enmity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let those bagel-eating, hooked-nosed . . . wanna-be Jews make you 
think" that Jews have been persecuted more than blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He also read a list of prominent Jewish entertainment and news media 
executives, denouncing most of them for promoting negative images of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing long, royal-blue robes over a crisp white shirt, Muhammad theatrically 
listed some of the most tragic episodes in the history of black people in 
America, starting with the horrors of the slave ship crossings. As his voice 
rose in indignation, insisting that recognition of black suffering had been 
repressed, the crowd applauded and shouted words of agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he came to one of his most emotional statements -- "the worst 
crime that can be committed is to be robbed of self-knowledge" -- the audience 
erupted in frenzied applause and screams of agreement that nearly drowned out 
Muhammad's voice.  
</P>
<P>
 There were also moments of dark humor. Arguing that Jesus was black, Muhammad 
said: "The Bible said Jesus would have hair like lamb's wool, that nappy hair . 
. . I'm talking about a black lord, a black Jesus, a black savior. Take that 
cracker down off your wall and throw him in the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience screamed in delight.  
</P>
<P>
 The crowd that came to see Muhammad did so out of a mixture of curiosity and 
almost-religious support. 
</P>
<P>
 The believers said Muhammad had touched a strong chord among American blacks 
and that his strength was his appeal to black self-sufficiency, not racism -- 
and that some of his outrageousness should be taken figuratively.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's telling black people to rise and take care of ourselves," said UCLA 
student Susan Leach, 21. "I believe in everything he says. I think it's white 
people who make the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not anti-Semitic or racist," said Patrick Pritchett, 41. "How could he 
be? How can the first people on earth be racist or anti-Semitic?" 
</P>
<P>
 There were a smattering of white faces in the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm curious to hear him in person," said Farley Ziegler, 31, as she waited in 
line outside the Vision Complex Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old black woman standing behind Ziegler patted her arm. "Good 
answer," said Michelle Clary of San Diego. "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with a lot of the things he says," Clary added, "but like her 
(Ziegler), I want to see for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the theater, the Crenshaw neighborhood took on the air of a street 
festival, intensified by a rally held in adjacent Leimert Park by a group 
called the All-African People's Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the hall, all members of the crowd and the press were frisked for 
weapons. Women's handbags were searched, and all objects, including pens and 
makeup containers, were scrutinized. When the speeches began, the crowd was 
treated to what seemed like a cross between the impassioned spirit of a rally 
and the fervor of a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad was preceded onstage by actor Wesley Snipes, who was sitting in the 
front row, and rapper Ice-T gave a rousing speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Also onstage were such guests as Georgiana Williams, the mother of Los Angeles 
riot defendant Damian Monroe Williams, and Celes King, a well-known bail 
bondsman and former president of the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission and 
the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. At one point, speakers asked for money to reimburse the sponsoring 
organization, the Crenshaw Improvement Assn., for the cost of renting the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Muhammad has no problem filling lecture halls at $10,000 a speech, he 
rarely finds vocal public support, and last week in Los Angeles was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 One local community activist who supports Muhammad refused to speak about him 
for attribution, for fear that financial benefactors, local and national, would 
be outraged by his connection to someone perceived as "anti-Semitic, racist or 
violent in overtone." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Vision Complex, actress Marla Gibbs, said she leased it 
because "it's a rental. I'd rent it to you if you wanted to speak. I'm not 
connected to it."  
</P>
<P>
 Most established scholars say that in their bitter analysis of oppression and 
racism against blacks, Muhammad and the Nation of Islam have many of their 
statistics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The academics Muhammad admires and quotes are members of established 
universities, but are coming increasingly under fire for their own anti-Semitic 
views. Muhammad also uses as a source the Nation of Islam's "The Secret 
Relationship Between Blacks and Jews" -- a book Henry Louis Gates Jr., a 
Harvard professor and chairman of the school's Afro-American studies 
department, has called "the bible of the new anti-Semitism."

GHOST CAMP; NATURE: FOREST SERVICE BUDGET CUTBACKS FORCE CLOSURE OF 
ONCE-CROWDED CRYSTAL LAKE GROUNDS, AND MANY OTHER SUCH FACILITIES, TO OVERNIGHT 
VISITORS.

<P>
 It looked like a camper's fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Eichler stood under a cobalt blue mountain sky and surveyed the Crystal 
Lake campground in Angeles National Forest on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first day of the long Memorial Day weekend, but Eichler had his 
pick of any campsite that caught his fancy. And he could have chosen any one of 
a couple dozen empty tables to use for a picnic with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no holiday crush, no jockeying for parking places, no blaring 
radios, no idling cars to churn smog into the glorious air. And all this a mere 
hour and a half drive from Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then was Eichler upset? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a happy camper," he proclaimed as his year-old daughter, Chelsea, 
snoozed on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The fantasy, it turns out, was a bad dream. Crystal Lake is a virtual ghost 
camp, a victim of U.S. Forest Service budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eichler and his wife, Gina, traveled to Crystal Lake with their three young 
children Friday night. The Huntington Beach family planned to spend the long 
weekend camping with another couple and their four children. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they arrived at Crystal Lake, they learned the grounds are now open 
to day use only and closed to overnight camping. 
</P>
<P>
 The families, who had traveled in a recreational vehicle and a minivan, pulled 
their vehicles onto a cement slab at the end of a road, and all 11 people 
squeezed into the RV for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'National Lampoon's Vacation' all over again," Eichler said. "It was 
not a nice adventure because we couldn't even have a campfire and roast 
wienies." (At this time of year, open fires are not allowed outside the 
campground.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he admitted, the children enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically the parents who had to deal with the kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing another night in the RV, the parents were seriously considering a 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can take the kids to the park," Eichler said. "It'll be the city life 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eichlers and their friends were among several dozen families turned away 
Friday. A roadside sign at the entrance to Angeles National Forest notes that 
the campground is closed to overnight stays, but the sign is easy to miss from 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor and Domitila Flores missed the sign and were turned away. The couple, 
with their two young children, slept in the family car next to the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, the Floreses had set up their new blue tent at a campsite in 
the Crystal Lake grounds, knowing full well it would have to come down and they 
would have to leave by 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to set up the tent," said Victor Flores, "but the children 
said, 'Papa, that's why you bought it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The cost-saving rules, which went into effect at Crystal Lake last Labor Day, 
prohibit more than just overnight camping. Under the new regulations, only 
hikers may use the area on weekdays because the grounds are closed to vehicles 
except on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 National forests nationwide are facing similar budget-driven cutbacks. In the 
Mt. Baldy Ranger District, which includes Crystal Lake, 90% of the overnight 
campsites have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules are also threatening the livelihood of the people who run the 
Crystal Lake Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Denis, 66, and her brother-in-law Armand Denis, 67, have operated the 
rustic little store for the past dozen years. On previous holiday weekends 
their establishment would have been jammed with campers, hikers and fishing 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday the store was nearly empty. On a weekend that would ordinarily 
pack Crystal Lake with about 1,500 campers, there were only about 200 people in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're senior citizens trying to make a living and we're not doing too well 
with it," Annette Denis said. "I don't know how long we can stay." 
</P>
<P>
 "What aggravates me more is the people can't come up and enjoy this," Armand 
Davis said, gesturing toward the towering, pine-studded mountains. "It's their 
campground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why the U.S. Forest Service can't get money to open this campground, I don't 
understand."

BILL BOYARSKY: SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW; DECISION '94 / A VOTER'S 
GUIDE TO STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS; TAKING MORE WORRIES THAN DREAMS INTO THE 
VOTING BOOTH 
</P>

 The Southland, a term coined by early 20th-Century boosters and perpetuated by 
history lovers, stretches from Ventura County to the Mexican border and east to 
San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The latter two, by the way, are known as 
the Inland Empire, another great old boosters' phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland and Inland Empire. I've loved those phrases since I moved here in 
1970, a transplanted Northern Californian who got a better job in Los Angeles. 
The words resonate with dreams of the good and affluent life, the goal that has 
drawn millions here and fueled the economic growth envisioned by the pioneer 
boosters. Today, of course, we have more worries than dreams, and to comprehend 
the June 7 primary election, you've got to look at it through the eyes of 
concerned Southland residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Think how it looks to a 52-year-old Redondo Beach aerospace engineer, out of 
work with two kids in college, engaged in a fruitless job search. Or an Orange 
County teacher concerned about violence and racial tension in a once-peaceful 
suburban public school. Or an avocado farmer in Ventura County who is 
threatened with a water shortage. Or a young man in Watts, contemplating taking 
his second-rate public school education to a community college or state 
university where, even if he gets financial aid, he will have to compete for 
space in a dwindling number of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 When viewed in these terms, the candidates' solutions often are too general. 
More than most, this is an election for specifics that needs to be examined in 
light of the Southland's pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The governor -- whether it's Republican Pete Wilson or a Democratic successor 
-- will have the main responsibility for guiding California from a recession 
that has done its worst in Southern California. The governor can't do it 
without the Legislature, and all 80 Assembly seats and 20 of the 40 Senate 
posts will be decided this year. And the governor will need the help of 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein or her Republican successor, who are on the 
ballot, along with every House member. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing a role will be the winners of the other statewide offices -- 
lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, controller, secretary of 
state, superintendent of public instruction and insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, the governor will be the key, the official responsible for 
guiding California through the economic recovery in a manner that leaves the 
state permanently strong, with long-term businesses, industries and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Ron Unz, a computer software entrepreneur who is using 
his wealth to finance a Republican primary campaign against Wilson, the 
gubernatorial candidates' ideas on the Southland's economic recovery are 
remarkably similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz sees government's role as minuscule. He would start by abolishing workers' 
compensation and requiring all workers to buy injury protection insurance. The 
cost to the workers, he says, "will be minimal." He'd slash the income tax and 
roll back welfare. All this, he says, would revive the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The others say that with giant corporations cutting back and the economy going 
through massive restructuring, government must step in. The threat of layoffs, 
they agree, touches huge numbers of people, including their friends and 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son-in-law is with AT&T," said state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, one of the 
Democratic candidates for governor. "They're waiting, everybody's waiting for 
the other shoe to drop. Let me tell you, we are in the midst of the biggest 
economic revolution since when we moved from the Agrarian Age to the Steam 
Age." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, Brown and Democratic candidates John Garamendi, the insurance 
commissioner, and Tom Hayden, a state senator, want the state to assist in the 
development of a major Southland transportation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They see the high-tech and computer companies of Orange County, the aerospace 
manufacturing belt of Los Angeles County, the small industrial plants of the 
San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys, and the idled defense bases of the Inland 
Empire harnessed for the construction of buses, commuter train cars and 
electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the studies say there would be 50,000 to 70,000 jobs in this," Hayden 
said. "These are good jobs. They're not McJobs. You need a governor who will 
actively shape it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other projects you hear about on the campaign trail, such as the 
Alameda Corridor, a proposed high-speed train-and-truck throughway connecting 
the Long Beach and San Pedro harbors with freight yards in Downtown Los 
Angeles. It would dramatically boost the capacity of the ports, opening up 
foreign trade opportunities for new business and industry throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, the candidates are better at defining problems than coming up 
with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, violence in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi defined the problem dramatically, relating an incident from when he 
was touring the state, working various jobs. He had been teaching in Orange 
County when a teacher said to him: "I'm scared, I'm frightened in this 
classroom. When I go out to my car in the evening, I'm scared. You've got to do 
something about the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 His solution, proposed in a speech in San Francisco, was for boot-camp-style 
prison camps for young offenders -- a plan that may have merit but doesn't deal 
with the verbal violence and the pushing and shoving that add to the fright 
factor in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same for the Southland's need for water, a fact of life here since 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 I've written about these issues since the first time I boarded a California 
politician's campaign bus almost 30 years ago, always fascinated with their 
challenge and complexity. But never have they seemed as important as this time, 
when the state is emerging from its worst economic times since the Great 
Depression.  
</P>
<P>
 And it is emerging into an uncertain new world. The candidates may talk glibly 
about a fascinating era of the information superhighway and multimedia 
classrooms. But we're not sure just how it will all work, or how many jobs it 
will produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the uncertainty, this election is comparable to one that goes way back 
before my time, and before the time of most of the people reading this -- 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation had emerged from the Depression and World War II, and California 
was ready to rebuild. It reelected a canny politician with great vision, Earl 
Warren, who charted a path that led to decades of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the job confronting not only this year's candidates, but the voters who 
will choose among them. 
</P>
<P>
 So study your voter pamphlets. Pore over the paper. Try to find some political 
news on television. Go hear a speech. You've got a big job ahead. About This

 On June 7 California's voters will choose candidates for governor, for the 
U.S. Senate and for seven other statewide offices. They will decide on a 
variety of ballot propositions, including whether to borrow money to finance 
earthquake recovery. Today, The Times offers this special guide to the primary 
elections, with reports on the candidates and issues in all statewide and 
countywide contests. Congressional and state legislative races are being

MOST REWARDS FOR CRIMES GO UNCLAIMED; INVESTIGATIONS: ABOUT 80% EXPIRE WITHOUT 
BEING PAID OUT. DESPITE THE LOW SUCCESS RATE, MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
STILL BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE A VALUABLE INCENTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 The brutal slayings of Hee Wan Yoo, his wife and two children in their Granada 
Hills home more than two years ago left investigators struggling to solve a 
crime without suspects, witnesses or motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to generate leads, the Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 
reward for information that would help solve the slayings. Although the reward 
was doubled by Yoo family relatives and renewed last month after it expired, it 
has remained unclaimed. Concrete leads have yet to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 But unclaimed rewards are not unique. About 80% of the rewards offered by Los 
Angeles city and county officials over the past two years expired without being 
claimed, according to city and county records, begging the question: Why don't 
rewards work more often? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low success rate, most law enforcement officials still believe in 
the concept, saying rewards provide a valuable incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often have someone who is wavering about whether they want to share their 
information, and (rewards) are just an added incentive," said Los Angeles 
Police Lt. Al Moen, head of the department's major crimes division.  
</P>
<P>
 But some police and government officials say privately that rewards are not a 
reliable crime-fighting tool. Instead, they are seen as a tool of the 
politicians and a way for the grieving families to feel they are helping to 
solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times it means something to the family," said one homicide investigator. 
"They feel more is being done if a reward is being offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards have been a staple of the American justice system as far back as the 
1800s, when posters pinned to saloon doors offered rewards for the capture of 
train robbers and cattle rustlers -- dead or alive.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, most rewards are offered by government agencies or relatives of the 
victims for particularly heinous crimes. Television has gotten into the act 
with a slew of programs that re-enact crimes and offer rewards for callers with 
information.  
</P>
<P>
 Some reward programs, such as the city of Los Angeles' graffiti reward 
program, are highly successful. Since 1991, the city's program has paid out 
$85,500 in rewards to more than 100 people who have helped capture graffiti 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 But because such rewards are offered on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to 
compare their success rate with programs that offer rewards for a particular 
crime and for a limited time.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past 24 months, the Los Angeles City Council paid out 10 rewards, 
totaling $190,000, according to city records. But during the same period, 63 
rewards, totaling $1.5 million, expired without being claimed, records show.  
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the County Board of Supervisors do not fare much better. 
Five rewards, totaling $55,000, have been paid out in the past two years, while 
20 rewards, totaling about $206,000, expired without being collected, according 
to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, they are never claimed," said Georgette Dame, a supervisor 
of the county reward program.  
</P>
<P>
 Rewards offered by the city usually expire 60 days after they are offered; 
county rewards expire after 90 days. But the rewards can be extended or renewed 
at the request of a county supervisor or City Council member.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say there are many explanations for the low 
collection rate of such rewards. The main reason, they say, may be that 
witnesses or other sources of information are afraid of reprisals if they call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the best sources of information are often accomplices in a crime or 
friends and family of the criminals -- people who have much to lose by 
providing police with information. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Frank Merriman said rewards often do not work 
because "you are trying to entice the shady person, the associate of the 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason may be that rewards are often only offered for the crimes that 
are the most difficult to solve, such as murders. According to the most recent 
FBI statistics, the percentage of homicides solved nationwide dropped from 90% 
in 1960 to 65% in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, head of the FBI's office in Ventura County, said no amount of 
reward will help if no one has information about the crime except for the 
criminals themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "It can be that a crime is committed by one or two people and they have kept 
their mouths shut," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Most often, Auer said, law-abiding citizens with information do call police, 
regardless of whether a reward is offered. He said the FBI gets dozens of tips 
daily on bank robberies, but "not more than one in 20 asks if there is a 
reward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, we have not seen that rewards have been a significant motivating 
concern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the low success rate, law enforcement officials say, is 
that the news of the rewards may never get to the people most likely to have 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the people with information on crimes seldom read newspapers or watch 
television news to learn about the rewards, said Hubert Williams, president of 
the Police Foundation, a research and support agency for law enforcement 
officials based in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to go from bar to bar, for example, and passed around 
information, you would get better results," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Board of Supervisors or the City Council offers a reward, a small, 
standardized ad is placed in at least one local newspaper, but usually for only 
one day. One county official described the ads as "tiny . . . very small." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, an elected official will issue a news release about a reward or 
will hold a news conference to generate more interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent rewards that were successful include $10,000 given last month by the 
Board of Supervisors to a teen-age boy who helped authorities identify a woman 
who set a blaze during the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, the supervisors paid out $12,500 each to two men who helped police 
identify the man who shot and killed Deputy Sheriff Nelson Yamamoto during a 
gun battle in Walnut Park.  
</P>
<P>
 And in recent weeks police cracked a 2-year-old murder case of a Woodland 
Hills high school student who was attacked by a group of youths as he waited 
for a bus. A suspect was arrested after he began bragging that he committed the 
crime and that he had a $25,000 price on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25,000 was a reward posted by the Los Angeles City Council shortly after 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Los Angeles City Council handed out a $25,000 reward to a person 
who provided information that resulted in a successful prosecution in the 
murder of 7-year-old Kanita Haily, who was gunned down in a drive-by shooting 
while playing baseball in the Imperial Courts housing project in Watts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, rewards go unclaimed. The list of crimes for which 
rewards are offered reads like an obituary listing for mothers, fathers, 
children, police officers and civic leaders whose lives ended in violence and 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors voted three times to renew a $10,000 reward for information 
on the slaying of Sheriff's Sgt. George Arthur, who was shot and killed in 1985 
as he left work at the Men's Central Jail. The crime is still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, City Councilman Hal Bernson asked the council to renew a $25,000 
reward for information to help identify the killer of Laurie Myles, who was 
slain in September, 1993, as she headed to a Bible study class in Northridge to 
pick up her teen-age daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite extensive publicity and an additional $7,500 in private contributions 
to the reward offer, Myles' killer has yet to be found.  
</P>
<P>
 The murders of the Yoo family -- Hee Wan Yoo, his wife, Gyung Jin, and their 
children Pauline, 6, and Kenneth, 4 -- generated fear and puzzlement in the 
residential community of Granada Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 As recently as this month, investigators held a news conference to urge the 
public for information to help solve the crime.

WORLD CUP '94: 19 DAYS AND COUNTING; FUTURE IS NOW; AT 20, U.S. MIDFIELDER 
REYNA ISN'T LOOKING BEYOND JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Headlines on magazine covers don't even bother to hedge, flatly calling him 
the future of American soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates say he has the opportunity to become the best U.S. player -- ever. 
Even his taciturn coach -- at least when it comes to praise -- offers a muted 
opinion on the topic of his potential greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he wonders if his name has grown longer. Is he Claudio Reyna, 
futureofAmericansoccer? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the difference between the United States and other countries. If Reyna 
were playing in Argentina or Brazil, he would have lost his last name by now. 
He would be known simply as Claudio. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reyna, a dazzling playmaking midfielder, it seems everyone wants to talk 
about the past and the future, not the present. But it is the 20-year-old's 
impeccable credentials that have observers making that leap. 
</P>
<P>
 He led Virginia to three consecutive NCAA titles, departing after his junior 
year. Reyna twice won college soccer's highest individual honor, the Hermann 
Trophy. He had 21 goals and 22 assists in three seasons with the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Barcelona in 1992, he was the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic soccer 
team, playing every minute and getting two assists in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid has more skill in his pinky than I have in my entire body," teammate 
Alexi Lalas said. "It's very, very depressing. But at least he's on my team." 
U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic says: "He's mature, mature for his age." 
</P>
<P>
 The American coaches have been cautious when it comes to Reyna, the team's 
youngest player. There is no need to weigh him down with grandiose predictions 
about his future or to create an egotistical presence in a locker room 
sprinkled with veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make a big deal about his young age, but a lot of people make a big 
deal about old age, too," assistant coach Timo Liekoski said. "How you fit into 
the program is what matters." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Reyna would prefer not to dwell on the topic of his potential 
greatness. The World Cup competition starting June 17 is about as far into the 
future as he wants to venture for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets old when people always say the future of the sport," Reyna said. 
"It's kind of annoying. It doesn't bother me, but it's annoying when people say 
the future and I'm here now in the present and doing well. I wish people would 
get off that subject. Hopefully, I'll do well in the future, but now is very 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna grew up in New Jersey, the son of Miguel Reyna, who used to play in the 
Argentine first division before coming to the United States in the late 1960s. 
Miguel was Claudio's first coach, from his first tentative steps with a soccer 
ball when he was 2 until he started playing for national age-group teams as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most American kids, Reyna dreamed of playing in the World Cup. But even 
he didn't anticipate being ready for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure if the World Cup was something I could reach now," Reyna said. 
"Now that I have a chance, I was fortunate. Three years ago, people were doing 
articles and wondering if I could be on the '94 team, whether it would be too 
early for me. Now that I'm here, I'm trying to follow people's guesses and 
predictions." 
</P>
<P>
 The unveiling of Reyna was achieved with deliberate precision. He joined the 
national team in January and served a brief apprenticeship on the bench, 
receiving limited playing time. His first game was against Norway in January, 
when he assisted on a last-minute goal by Cobi Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, it became apparent that Reyna was appropriately humble and the time had 
come to see what he could do from the opening moments. His first start came on 
April 20 against Moldova at Davidson College's Richardson Field, where Reyna 
had helped Virginia win two of its three titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna responded with his trademark flair and scored his first goal, showing 
that he could apply his creative playmaking to the international game. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Steve Sampson said Reyna "explodes into space at the same time 
he collects the ball." All of the American coaches were in agreement that the 
team possessed a different look with Reyna in the lineup as the key link from 
the midfield to the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Milutinovic: "The impression is that he is not fast, but the first (five 
meters) he runs with no effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna said the time on the bench -- nine games as a reserve -- helped him 
before his international debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every phase, I've gotten better just because of the experience I'm getting," 
he said. "Playing each game helps. I'm learning more and more playing at this 
level. Even when watching from the bench, I learn how to play quicker and think 
quicker. I'm learning a lot -- sometimes I don't realize it. It's definitely a 
stage where I'm learning in strides." 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. team's most recent appearance in Southern California, a 1-0 
victory over Armenia, the combination of Reyna and midfielder Hugo Perez 
started to connect, particularly in the second half after a sluggish beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are innovative midfielders, relying more on their creative instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get along well on the field," Reyna said. "We have to play well off each 
other. I'm there to combine with him. We have to find each other and we're the 
main part of attack, so we have to get things going through us and the forwards 
and the other midfielders."  
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster during soccer's first boom in the United States, Reyna attended 
several of the Cosmos' games. He is realistic enough to realize that even if 
the World Cup succeeds far beyond everyone's wildest expectations, his future 
lies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid fan of the New Jersey Devils, he thinks that soccer should take a page 
out of the NHL's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer should aim for being the fifth- or sixth-most popular sport and not 
shoot for the top," he said. "Baseball, basketball, football . . . those sports 
will always be there. I think soccer can learn from hockey in the United 
States, how it's gotten more popular in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like soccer's second wind. There's a wave of excitement and a lot of 
talent, a lot of guys coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't include himself in that group. Once again, Reyna was thinking about 
himself in terms of present tense, not future or past. Player Profile

INDIANAPOLIS 500; START IS FINISH FOR SOME; AUTO RACING: FIRST LAP BRINGS 
TOGETHER FEAR, FUMES, TIGHT QUARTERS AND TURBULENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every driver in today's Indianapolis 500 would like to be on the front row 
with Al Unser Jr., Raul Boesel and defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi, but 
there is room for only three. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three will lead the field through the first turn of the first lap 
-- the single most exciting moment in all of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers up front will have a clean racing line, running in clean air on a 
clean track, but back in the field, back around the seventh through the 11th 
rows, there will be such turbulence, such buffeting, such burning of eyes from 
methanol fumes that the drivers will wonder how they got into such a 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the scariest thing I've ever been through," is the common assessment of 
any driver who has started in the middle or rear of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you head into that first turn, it's such a bottleneck, it's like trying 
to put a cork in a thimble," said car owner Dick Simon, who started 17 Indy 
500s and who has six drivers in today's field. "You see all those cars in front 
of you, and you don't know whether to get on the gas or let off. The truth is, 
you can't do either. You just have to keep going and hope you get to the short 
chute in one piece." 
</P>
<P>
 First-lap accidents are not uncommon. Four times in the last seven years, 
first-lap accidents have sent drivers to an early shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of drivers tend to get pumped up when the green (flag) drops, and they 
act like it's a sprint race, not 500 miles," three-time winner Johnny 
Rutherford said. "They try to get to the front immediately. Sometimes they make 
it, more often they don't, but whatever happens, it disrupts the field and 
causes confusion. And confusion causes accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Turbulence from having so many cars running close to 200 m.p.h. in tight 
quarters is a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first lap, if you're in mid-pack, all you can do is hold on for dear 
life," said Dominic Dobson, who will be in the fourth row today, his highest 
start in seven races. "The turbulence, the buffeting is unlike anything you've 
encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffeting is a funny phenomenon. It can move the car sideways, to the left or 
the right, without warning. It's very unnerving." 
</P>
<P>
 Former driver Derek Daly, a six-time starter in the 500 and now a television 
commentator, said methanol fumes from cars ahead make it almost impossible to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be so much methanol in the air when everyone gets on the throttle 
at the start that it actually comes into the cockpit and just hangs there," he 
said. "Your eyes sting so much, it is difficult to keep them open. It gets 
downright scary, and you haven't even reached the back straightaway yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, if the pack stays together, you don't have any clean air for 
several laps. If you're behind 25 or 30 cars, you drive more on instinct than 
on observation. You can't see more than two rows in front of you. You just hope 
and pray nothing happens up front because if it does, you're into it before you 
know what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Vasser, one of the most promising of a young crop of American drivers, 
will be starting his third 500 today from the sixth row. His first start two 
years ago was in the 10th row. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not careful, you can get sucked along into the first turn like 
you're in a vacuum," Vasser said. "You lose all feeling of how fast you're 
going. You feel like you have no control over your car, and it's easy to be 
going faster than you think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your head is moving around, the fumes are getting in your eyes, the dust is 
coming up from cars in front, it's like you're in a brown cloud. Or like being 
in the fog in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasser is from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time winner Fittipaldi started in the eighth row in his first year at 
Indy, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so scared, I couldn't see, I couldn't think," he said. "That is why I 
drive so fast now when we qualify. I do not want to be back there again." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's start will be Fittipaldi's third from the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 An added worry at Indianapolis is the imbalance of its starting grid. Because 
faster cars that do not qualify on the first day must start behind all 
first-day qualifiers, it can place fast car-driver combinations behind slower 
cars with less-experienced drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, having a slow car up front is a bigger worry than a fast car in 
the rear," Simon said. "Sometimes one driver can get a break in the weather, 
have the car set up perfectly and drive four great laps -- something they are 
not likely to repeat lap after lap in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't say so, but he could have been speaking of one of his own drivers, 
Lyn St. James, who is in the second row -- ahead of Nigel Mansell, Arie 
Luyendyk and Mario Andretti. She has not driven in a race since last Aug. 1 and 
had not been among the fast cars in practice before driving what she called 
"four perfect laps" in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the second row is Jacques Villeneuve of Canada, the fastest rookie in 
Indy history who is in only his fourth Indy car race -- and he has either 
crashed or clipped the wall in his first three. At Indy, the penalty for 
crashing or hitting a wall is much more severe than at Surfers Paradise, 
Phoenix or Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the chargers -- fast drivers with fast cars -- way back in the 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Rahal, the 1986 winner, is in Row 10 with the seventh-fastest qualified 
car. Paul Tracy, in one of the Mercedes Benz-powered Penskes identical to those 
driven by Unser and Fittipaldi on the front row, is in Row 9 with a car that 
ran 230 m.p.h. in practice two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal is back there because he switched cars, moving from a Honda so slow it 
faced being bumped to a quick Ilmor-powered Penske. Tracy is back there because 
he crashed and missed the first day of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when the field of 33 heads into the first turn, don't worry abut whether 
Boesel will get the jump on Unser, as he did last year on pole-sitter Luyendyk, 
but look up the track and see what's happening back in the brown cloud. Indy

LOGAN: SCHOOL KNEW OF PROBLEM LAST YEAR; BASKETBALL: PLAYER SAYS CAL STATE SAN 
BERNARDINO OFFICIALS TOLD HER SHE HAD NOT VIOLATED NCAA RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball player Felice Logan, expected to be the subject of an NCAA 
investigation at Cal State San Bernardino, said that school athletic officials 
knew of her possible ineligibility before the first of the year and still 
allowed her to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan, a sophomore, averaged 10 points a game for the San Bernardino women's 
basketball team that lost to North Dakota State in the NCAA Division II 
championship game last March. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino officials held a news conference on May 17, in the midst of The 
Times' investigation of Logan's eligibility, and said they first learned of the 
potential problem from an anonymous phone call in late February. They said they 
initiated an investigation that same day and found no evidence of rules 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Logan, in an interview at her home Friday, said she told Luvina Beckley, 
San Bernardino's basketball coach, about her eligibility situation "sometime 
before the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Beckley) told me she would look into it," Logan said. "She also told me she 
spoke to the assistant athletic director about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Logan maintained that San Bernardino Athletic Director David Suenram and 
assistant athletic director Nancy Simpson were also aware of the matter before 
Feb. 22, the date they claimed to have received the anonymous call. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan's eligibility problem stems from her tryout with ADFB, a women's 
professional team in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1991. Both Logan and ADFB officials 
have told The Times that the team bought her a round-trip plane ticket and paid 
her expenses while she was in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules prohibit athletes from accepting such compensation after enrolling 
in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan previously attended Central Arizona College and played on that school's 
conference championship team in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions have also been raised about her eligibility under the NCAA's 4-2-4 
transfer rule, based on her possibly having attended Cal State Dominguez Hills 
in 1986. If she had, she would have been required to sit out a year at San 
Bernardino or receive a degree from a junior college before being eligible to 
play at San Bernardino.  
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills athletic officials said they have an eligibility form filled 
out and signed by Logan a month after the fall semester started in '86. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan, however, said: "I enrolled in Dominguez but I never attended any 
classes. I never went to any practice with any of the team and I never played 
in any games with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The possible violations by Logan -- and the school's apparent lack of 
thoroughness in its investigation -- could lead to sanctions by the NCAA, 
including the forfeiture of games. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beckley has reversed the position she took at the May 17 news 
conference, and the coach now says Logan spoke to her about the issues in 
question soon after their first meeting last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Felice told me she purchased her own ticket to Spain," Beckley said. "As for 
her attending Dominguez Hills, she told me she once had intentions of going 
there but that she didn't. From the information she gave me, there was no 
violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she had told anyone else in the athletic department that Logan had 
tried out in Spain, Beckley used as her answer the eligibility form Logan filed 
with San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are required to fill out an eligibility form at the beginning of 
every year, and these are designed to confirm their eligibility status. 
</P>
<P>
 According to San Bernardino officials, Logan never indicated that she had 
enrolled at Dominguez Hills or had played in Spain on her 1993 eligibility 
form.  
</P>
<P>
 Beckley says now that she left it to Logan to disclose the information and 
believed it wasn't necessary to mention it to her superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no reason to," Beckley said. "Every athlete is responsible for what 
they put on their eligibility form. I felt there was no need to tell them 
because Felice told me she didn't commit any violations." 
</P>
<P>
 Logan said that a meeting on the matter was held "before the first of the 
year," involving herself, Beckley, Suenram and Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all got together to talk about it," Logan said. "(Simpson) had the rule 
book sitting right in front of her and she looked up everything I did. (She 
said) they were clearly defined in the rules as not being violations. They told 
me I was fine to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Suenram and Simpson have denied that they held any such meeting before 
Feb. 22, and denied any knowledge of Logan's possible violations before that 
date. When asked about the meeting cited by Logan, Simpson said: "(Logan) has 
said that that has transpired, and I don't want to contradict her. Yeah, if I 
have to answer, the meeting took place according to the press handout we 
distributed (on May 17)."  
</P>
<P>
 At that news conference, Suenram -- saying that his action had nothing to do 
with the Logan case -- resigned as San Bernardino's athletic director effective 
in March of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "My planning for retirement goes back before any of this," Suenram said. 
"Nobody pressured me, but this led me to believe this is a good time to do it."

MORNING BRIEFING: WASHINGTON SOCCER FANS WILL HAVE TO DANCE IN THE AISLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soccer purists are unhappy about a Washington, D.C., Police plan to build a 
six-foot metal fence around the field at RFK Stadium for five World Cup games. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup organizing officials have protested, but Deputy Police Chief Melvin 
Clark said that despite objections, his department still plans to build the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Jensen, Washington venue executive director, said soccer enthusiasm 
shouldn't be confused with crowd control problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling Brazilian fans' samba displays on the field during a U.S. Cup '93 
match at RFK last summer, Jensen said: "That's what you want. That is soccer at 
its best. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I think you have to do here in America is not to confuse an 
expression of enthusiasm and a visceral soccer reaction with a movement toward 
hooliganism. There's a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expressions of excitement and of following the game are natural 
expressions to these people and not to be confused with insurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What country has the best won-lost record in the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 Just a start?Kendra Hanes, softball coach and outfielder who didn't make the 
cut with the touring Silver Bullets, the women's baseball team, did make it 
with the Kentucky Rifles, a Class A minor league team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rifles play in Pikeville, Ky., and begin their season on June 17. Rifle 
General Manager Mike Weisbart didn't deny that the signing of Hanes -- who has 
never played baseball -- was a publicity gimmick but also said his team might 
play a historic baseball role. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team and I believe strongly that someday there will be a woman in 
baseball, and the best way for that to happen is to start in the minors," 
Weisbart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very disturbing attitudes in baseball about women, and we 
think they need to be attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle: From Ed Schuyler of the Associated Press: What has more ads than the 
yellow pages and goes faster? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An Indy car. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Brazil, 44-11-11 since 1930. 
</P>
<P>

talk about players coming on the scene too early, but (Gabriela) Sabatini is 
someone who has been playing too long." EARL GUSTKEY

MILLER LOVES TO BE HARD TO LIKE; PACER STAR GUARD BECOMES POPULAR WITH FANS THE 
HARD WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of course, he has an image problem. He gets ragged on in about two dozen 
cities across America for having a sister, Cheryl, who is more decorated in 
basketball, a sport he is making $3.2 million this season to play, and talks 
more trash than any three sanitation departments combined. 
</P>
<P>
 This has all stayed with Reggie Miller for so long, since his days at UCLA and 
into his NBA career with the Indiana Pacers, that it has become more like a 
tattoo than a reputation. It has become a part of him. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes the go-ahead shot with 0.8 seconds left at Chicago and gives an 
exaggerated bow to the crowd, in true hotdog style. It gets shoved back in his 
face when the Bulls win at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 He wraps a bandanna around his shaved head -- he has blue and red ones -- and 
dons shaded rectangular glasses for a national-television interview. Team 
officials and even the NBC people suggest that he lose the garb. He wears it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 He would be a unanimous first-team choice every year if peers voted on players 
they would most like to see tied down in Death Valley. In July. On an ant hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I used to play against him, we used to always mess with each other 
because we had known each other for so many years," says Pacer guard Byron 
Scott, a Miller teammate this season. "Everybody hated him." 
</P>
<P>
 This would all be troubling if not for one thing -- Miller loves it so. He not 
only enjoys the reputation, he encourages the notion that one of the best 
shooting guards in the world could also be the same person who hung out with 
the Hell's Angels, Eastern Seaboard Chapter, after Game 1 of the first-round 
playoff series at Orlando. He does not volunteer that, in fact, he took a 
couple of Pacer ballboys out to dinner instead. 
</P>
<P>
 His image has more spin than his jump shots. During a quiet moment in the home 
locker room at Market Square Arena, when all his teammates have cleared out 
after a practice, he allows that "I never thought I would come this far" and 
that he is very honored at being chosen to play for the United States in the 
world basketball championships this summer, but "I don't know if I belong." The 
modesty seems sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 So the rest is an act? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he says. "Don't get me wrong. I'm not out there to win a 
popularity contest. I'm out there to win basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be the most popular guy, like in high school. The best thing 
is to go into an opposing arena and 15,000 people are focusing on you. That's 
the best feeling. Being the most popular, I don't know, I don't get into people 
patting you on the back. I'm into hard work. I never had the best talent or the 
best jumper. I've always been about dirt and sweat. Nothing was ever given to 
me, so I'm not the nice kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 So the rest is an act. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to show that image, like he can be a villain, but he's far from 
that," Indiana Coach Larry Brown says. "He's not anything like you see. It 
bothers me a little bit because I love the game and I think these guys have 
such an effect on people and kids, but he's a great example. Maybe some of the 
things he does on the court are a little crazy and out of whack, but I don't 
think that's him." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says that it is not, that much of what he does is because it makes good 
theater and basketball is, after all, a form of entertainment. He blames the 
biggest of all stages, television, for the bad-guy image getting blown out of 
proportion, obviously ignoring the person who promotes it. Nice bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggest that the taunting on-court personality is born of the need to 
appear tough to compensate for a body that is anything but imposing, with only 
180 pounds on a 6-foot-7 frame. Or that even after starring at Riverside Poly 
High and then UCLA, after proving his worth at every previous level, he truly 
is insecure with the notion of being considered by many the best shooting guard 
in the NBA's Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 What goes on during a game is far more simple. Give him the ball and get out 
of the way. Forget that bow in Chicago or the mouthing off -- this is what 
really accelerates the pulse rate of opponents: Miller cutting up another 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they think about Reggie," says Haywoode Workman, the 
Pacers' point guard. "I just know they don't want to leave him open." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably hasn't helped Miller that complete acceptance has come slowly, 
even as he has become the franchise's all-time leading scorer and averaged at 
least 20 points in four of the last five seasons. The acceptance problem 
started when the Pacers made him the 11th pick in the 1987 draft -- not because 
he was Reggie Miller from UCLA, but because he was not Steve Alford from 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Alford epitomized Indiana basketball, having gone from high school star in New 
Castle, about an hour east of here, to a career with the Hoosiers that included 
a national championship and a spot on the 1984 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his place came the brash Miller, who arrived with everything to prove 
and then was unable to beat out John Long for playing time. Miller averaged 10 
points as a rookie. It was a rough time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought a lot of L.A. here," he said. "They had to adjust. I wasn't going 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 He blossomed from 10 points per game that first season and 16 the second to 
24.6 in 1989-90 while shooting 51.4%, the first time he had broken 50%. That 
was followed by 22.6 and 51.2%, 20.7 and 50.1% and 21.2 and 47.9% before going 
19.9 and 50.3% this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has become the most popular Pacer, if fan mail is an accurate gauge. He is 
the leading scorer on the first team in their 18-year history to reach the 
Eastern Conference finals. He likes almost everything about Indianapolis except 
the weather and loves the people, who he says are much nicer than in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They love him, too. Most of them. Others still want someone else: Alford. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Hoosier went nowhere fast in the NBA and was out of the league 
after five seasons as a reserve with the Dallas Mavericks and the Golden State 
Warriors. Now, while Miller has finished third in the league in three-point 
shooting and is averaging 20.8 points in the playoffs, Alford is coaching tiny 
Manchester College near the Indiana-Michigan border. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best," Larry Brown says of Miller. "I've never seen a guy shoot the 
ball better, with (as much) range, as easily. If I was going to have somebody 
play H-O-R-S-E or take the last shot, I think it would be Reggie." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about that comment from Scott on how everybody hated Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I'm playing with him," the former Laker says, "I love him to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Better late than never.

BLOODIED BUT UNBOWED; BOBBY BOWDEN'S VICTORY TOUR TURNS INTO A SERIES OF 
APOLOGIES, BUT HE HAS NO INTENTION OF FORFEITING THE NATIONAL TITLE OR 
RESIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The raffle tickets were drawn hours ago. Sterno flames hiss against the 
bottoms of now empty silver buffet serving trays. The blue-hair from the Class 
of '36 has been introduced, along with most everyone else in the Sweetwater 
Country Club ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time for him yet ? 
</P>
<P>
 A branding iron is presented. A babbling infant is shooed from the room. A 
heckler interrupts the longest introduction speech since Jimmy Stewart's 
filibuster in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't pay to listen to you," says the heckler, who has the look of 
someone who didn't miss a minute of Thursday night's cocktail hour. "Let's hear 
the coach!" 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Barnes, executive director of the national Florida State booster club, 
steps back from the microphone, sips from a glass of water, stares at the 
heckler and then nervously straightens out his notes. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this wasn't how the 1994 Bobby Bowden Championship Tour was supposed to go 
at all. Not one bit. 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments later, Barnes says, "Uh, before I bring up the coach. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 And then he is back on script, waxing poetic about the joys of being a Florida 
State booster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on top of the collegiate world right now," Barnes tells the audience of 
150 or so Seminole supporters. "We have become what so many of you have dreamed 
we could become." 
</P>
<P>
 But with an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five months after being named national champions by both polls, the 
Florida State football program is chinstrap-deep in trouble, beginning with 
recently published allegations that at least seven Seminole players accepted 
illicit payoffs last November from would-be agents. 
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by news that freshman kicker Scott Bentley, who made the 
national title-winning field goal against Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, had 
pleaded no contest to charges of illegally tape-recording a February sexual 
encounter with a female student from Florida A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, tight end Kamari Charlton was charged with felony rape and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, former Seminole tailback Sean Jackson, one of the players who 
had admitted accepting gifts from agents, was arrested for an alleged incident 
of indecent exposure, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 And just this weekend, it was disclosed that former Florida State cornerback 
Corey Sawyer, another of the players who had admitted his involvement with 
agents, apparently paid $29,000 in cash for a sport utility vehicle three days 
before the Orange Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it is a month Bowden could have done without. Rather than 
celebrate a championship, he has had to explain it, sometimes even apologize 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was at West Virginia and when I was first at Florida State," he tells 
the local Seminole Club here on the outskirts of Houston, "I was wanting to be 
like Alabama, Notre Dame . . . you know, the big programs. I'd say, 'I'd like 
to be good enough to get investigated.' The ideal scenario is to be good enough 
to be investigated and not be guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which brings me to the subject that we might be fixing to try that (scenario) 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, drafted in April by the Houston Oilers, presumably will have his day 
in court. The same goes for Charlton, who is free on $10,500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley was sentenced to 40 hours on a county road crew, fined $500, placed on 
six months' probation and ordered to pay $150 in court costs. Like Charlton, he 
was suspended indefinitely from the Florida State program by Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the alleged payoffs by agents, Bowden said the school is cooperating 
fully with a high-powered Kansas City firm retained by Florida State to conduct 
its internal investigation. Other than that, there isn't anything else he can 
do, except wonder what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach," one of the boosters says during the banquet's question-and-answer 
session, "what do you think the NCAA will do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Back when the tour started, before the inevitable Crimi-noles jokes began 
making the rounds, Bowden answered questions about the Florida State depth 
chart. Now this: police records and possible NCAA inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be shocked if the NCAA investigates it," he says. "I would be totally 
shocked if that happens. We should be totally free." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the sobering disclaimer: "But you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether Bowden, his assistants or Seminole staff members were 
aware or should have been aware of the illicit payoffs, which included cash and 
clothing to players. Such a distinction could mean the difference between a 
sigh of relief or the deadly lack of institutional control and the full-fledged 
NCAA investigation that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the revelation about his vehicle purchase, Sawyer had suggested in a 
Sports Illustrated interview that Seminole assistant Jim Gladden might have 
known about an agent-bankrolled shopping spree at a Tallahassee sporting goods 
store. Gladden denied any such knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bowden, he and his assistants are guilty of nothing more than 
perhaps trusting their players too much. If anything, he said, the Florida 
State program is a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only proves to me that everybody is vulnerable," he said. "Everybody and 
anybody is vulnerable. I don't care how clean you think you are, how clean you 
try to be, you're still vulnerable to this type of activity. . . . If we had 
not been the No. 1 football team in the nation, I don't think this would have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 But it did occur, leaving Bowden to explain how a handful of his players 
allegedly received $6,000 worth of team jackets, basketball shoes, baseball 
caps and sweatsuits -- and yet, no one in the Florida State football program 
had a clue about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell our kids over and over and over, 'You can't do this, you can't do 
that,' " Bowden said. "So it eventually gets down to somebody's integrity, the 
integrity of an individual. I don't think you can stay on top of somebody. I 
don't want to follow them around like the FBI. I'd hate to recruit boys and 
tell them I'm going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even had he not been reluctant to pry, Bowden said, it was doubtful that 
players who took part in the alleged shopping spree would have worn their new 
clothes for the coaches to see. And if a player did happen to stop by the 
football offices with a new pair of Air Jordans, what was Bowden supposed to 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee whiz, it's insulting to tell a young minority kid, 'Hey, son, how come 
you got those good-looking shoes? You ain't like me,' " said Bowden. "They're 
pretty sensitive to that. You don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden said he hasn't spoken to any of the players involved in the 
investigation. He said to do so might give the appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he has addressed the audio-recording incident involving Bentley, the 
heavily recruited freshman who claimed he taped the encounter to protect 
himself against possible allegations of date rape. Bentley later played the 
tape for three friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation with Bentley's father, Bowden said he was told the son was 
merely following instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Bowden: "When I talked to his dad, his dad said, 'I'm the one who 
ought to be charged.' I said, 'Why?' He said, 'Because I told him to do it. I 
told him if he had any dates down there, tape it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incidents involving Bentley and Charlton, Bowden has received 
letters from angry Florida State alumni, mainly women. In most cases, the 
letters call for their permanent dismissal from the Seminole team. 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, Bowden has said, "I'm not in the business of ruining a young man's 
life," which is why, at least in Bentley's case, a one-game suspension appears 
likely. Asked if he could understand why women might find the Bentley case and 
the alleged actions of Charlton reprehensible, Bowden said, "I have to be 
sensitive to that, too. I'm not as sensitive to that as I ought to be because 
I'm more chauvinistic. If I was the other sex, I'm sure I would be more 
(upset). But I don't condone it. I don't condone it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bowden said he called a team meeting at the end of spring practice to 
lecture his players on sex. "(I said), 'Boys, you can't do this. You're not 
supposed to do this.' Because I'm a little old-timey on that thing, I gave them 
a real good talking. I read Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't two weeks later that these other things popped up. So it makes me 
think I've done everything I can do, but somewhere down the line it gets down 
to them having to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of some trouble in 1980, Bowden's 18 seasons at Florida 
State have been relatively blemish-free. "St. Bobby" is what they call him, 
partly in honor of his won-lost record, partly because his homespun ways have 
endeared him to fans and foes alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But the illicit and sometimes illegal events of the last seven months have 
tested Bowden's patience, as well as drawn negative attention to a program 
accustomed to constant success. No matter what happens, Bowden said he has no 
intention of forfeiting the Seminoles' national championship or resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, no," he said of possible retirement. "I'd be running away from a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, the alleged payoffs and the charges against Bentley, 
Charlton and Jackson have "put a shadow" on the national championship season. A 
program's reputation must be rebuilt. Philosophies -- perhaps Bowden's 
hands-off policy -- might be reassessed. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing, Bowden said, reminded him of the story of the wife who found 
her husband and the maid together in a closet: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I'm shocked," said the wife. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No,' said the husband, 'you're embarrassed. We're shocked.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Bowden flinches at every late-night phone call. He gingerly reads the days' 
sports section. "I just keep living in fear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His 30-city national championship tour completed, Bowden has done his best to 
reassure the faithful, and vice versa. At the banquet, a booster says she 
doesn't have a question. Instead, she wants to thank Bowden for conducting 
himself "with honor, with grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden thanks her and later issues another apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure am sorry about what has happened," he tells the Texans. "I hope we can 
learn from this thing. But hey, folks, we'll survive. Don't you worry about 
that, we'll survive."

MIKE DOWNEY: THOMAS NOW BECOMES A JURASSIC BOSS OF HIS DREAM TEAM

 His brothers became pimps. Two of them. They also dealt drugs. His family 
lived on a very mean street. When some gang members came toward him with 
join-or-else in their eyes, his mother stepped out onto the porch with a 
shotgun. They scattered.  
</P>
<P>
 Another day, when he was 12, he was playing basketball. One guy claimed: "I 
got next game." A second guy came along and said no, he had the winners next. 
The first guy went home and got his gun. He came back and began shooting. The 
12-year-old boy hid under a car. He saw the body of the second guy drop. 
</P>
<P>
 On special occasions, his mother came home from Our Lady of Sorrows church 
with baskets of food. The minister had passed them out. His mother had nine 
mouths to feed. He still remembers, "Turkey and all the trimmings. Two days a 
year, Christmas and Thanksgiving, we always ate good." 
</P>
<P>
 Other days, he had little to eat. He went into a corner grocery and stole some 
plums. Stuffed them into his pockets. Two of the plums slipped through a hole 
in his pants, fell to the floor. A cop came and dragged him off to the station 
house, acting tough, talking raw, terrifying the kid, saying: "Goin' to Cook 
County (jail), boy. Gonna throw you inside till you're old. Gonna be somebody's 
girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 He cried and cried until his mother came.  
</P>
<P>
 Then he cried harder, because he was more afraid of her than of jail.  
</P>
<P>
 His could have been a less-than-wonderful life. Last month, however, upon 
turning 33, he took early retirement from his job. He went into a business 
partnership with another firm. A multi-millionaire now, a solid citizen, a 
local legend, a civic-minded individual who once proposed something called "No 
Crime Day" once a year, he has gone from being captain of a basketball team to 
a captain of industry. Isiah Thomas is no longer a player. He's an owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon investing in Toronto's new NBA franchise and beating out his longtime 
friend Magic Johnson in the process, Thomas understands how far he has come. In 
celebration of his new status, he recalls, chuckling, "It wasn't that long ago 
when I didn't have a nickel in my pocket. When I didn't have a pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago and far away. He was this chipmunk-cheeked, precocious pee-wee who 
led the older boys out onto the creaky floor at Our Lady of Sorrows and then at 
halftime put on fancy-dribbling exhibitions, so deft at it that he even got 
featured in Reader's Digest. In his teens, to stay away from the temptations 
and turmoil of the neighborhood, he rose before dawn and took public 
transportation to a far Chicago suburb, to play basketball at a parochial 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 Both he and his childhood buddy Mark Aguirre dropped out of college and went 
for the money. At a dinner for three, December 1981, atop a Dallas hotel before 
their first professional game against one another, Thomas, already thinking 
big, asked: "So, what should we do next?" 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, thinking bigger, said: "Co-MVPs in the NBA?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, laughing, slapping the table, said: "Maybe we could just buy a team." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 20.  
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from the Detroit Pistons with two diamond rings, more than 
19,000 points, a five-bedroom home with an indoor basketball court in 
Bloomfield Hills and a promise of a company position for life, Thomas connected 
with an investment group that was bidding for the NBA's first expansion venture 
to Canada. Putting opportunity before old loyalties, he says, "I always 
imagined that I'd be a Detroit Piston for life. But this was too good a chance 
to pass up. How many times in a man's life does something like this come 
along?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when a tin-and-tissue hoop with the Toronto Raptors' comical 
dinosaur logo was unveiled, it was Isiah Thomas who came crashing through it. 
It was Raptor rapture. He did everything but yell, "Yabba-dabba-doo!" 
</P>
<P>
 Reports say he owns a nice piece, maybe 10%. Doesn't matter. Thomas is doing 
what so many others -- Magic, Walter Payton, Reggie Jackson -- have dreamed 
about. He is labor becoming management. He is not only busting through hoops; 
he is breaking down barriers that have limited ownership opportunities to his 
people and to his colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
 Shooting hoops wasn't indentured servitude, obviously, yet it had occurred to 
Thomas early on, "You always wonder if anybody's going to be willing to treat 
you with respect, treat you as a businessman, same way they would someone else. 
Even if you've got the money and you come knocking on the door, you wonder, are 
they going to let you in?" 
</P>
<P>
 With self-made wealth, he learned how rich people lived. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, early in his pro career, Thomas swears that teammate Bill Laimbeer on 
an airport runway pointed to a smaller craft and said, "There, that's just like 
the one my father just got." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, right. Mine, too," Isiah remembers saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas fought for everything he got. Sometimes literally. He got caught 
showing an interest in someone's girlfriend at Indiana University and got 
punched in the face. He once slapped Rick Mahorn, a foot taller, in the face. 
Scuffled with Laimbeer, too. Even got into it once with Johnson, who tried to 
slap Thomas' face. Of course, before their one NBA championship series 
together, Isiah also kissed Magic's face.  
</P>
<P>
 After retiring, he said: "It's hard to believe all that's over. Him and me, 
both out of the game. Larry Bird, Laimbeer, (Kevin) McHale. Maybe Charles 
(Barkley), too. We're all young men." 
</P>
<P>
 What does he do now? 
</P>
<P>
 Find new young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere some other kid is out there, surviving the rough stuff, dreaming the 
dream. He will never play with Isiah Thomas. But maybe he can play for Isiah 
Thomas.

ANDRETTI HAS CAR TO GO OUT ON TOP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Mario Andretti has announced that this is his final racing season, he 
is not leaving the way A.J. Foyt, Richard Petty and some others left -- as 
noncompetitive drivers hanging on and embarrassing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti figures to be competitive in today's Indy 500.He qualified ninth in a 
Lola-Ford Cosworth and has been running well. On Thursday, he had the quickest 
car on Carburetion Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'm as quick as I used to be, but I'm quick enough to be 
involved," Andretti said. "I feel that I'm still a factor, and I can be part of 
the boys who are playing up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Andretti led 72 of the 200 laps and was still in front after 435 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have won it except for a bad set of tires we put on during my last 
pit stop," he said. "They unbalanced the car, and I dropped back and finished 
fifth. But I had been in the hunt." SHAV GLICK

MIKE PENNER: TIME TO SELL KINGDOM FOR LION'S SHARE OF NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 N ews item: The NBA Minnesota Timberwolves announce they are moving to New 
Orleans, pending league approval, and will begin play there in the 1994-95 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 So what's New Orleans got that Anaheim doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, besides Commander's Palace . . . and Brennan's . . . and Antoine's . . . 
and the barbecued shrimp at Pascal's Manale . . . and the jambalaya at Mother's 
. . . and the beignets at Cafe Du Monde . . . and the hurricanes at Pat 
O'Brien's . . . and Bryan Lee at the Old Absinthe House Bar . . . and Sunday 
steamboat rides on the Mississippi . . . and Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras . 
. . and Bourbon Street before and after Mardi Gras . . . and a basketball 
tradition that dates back from Shaquille O'Neal to Chris Jackson to Pete 
Maravich to Bob Pettit? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a punch-drunk sports group called Top Rank of Louisiana -- headed by 
boxing promoter Bob Arum -- that considers it darn fine business to fork over 
$152.5 million for the second-worst team in professional basketball, a team 
that has averaged 21 victories in the five seasons since it was originally 
purchased for $32.5 million? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Anaheim had the muscle to go toe to toe with New Orleans on that one. 
Anaheim had Disney, the heaviest hitter on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Disney would never spend $152.5 million on a basketball team. Never in a 
thousand years. The Seven Dwarfs worked for scale; 12 tall guys who can't make 
a layup are suddenly going to dynamite the bank vault and line the gutters of 
Main Street with pictures of dead presidents? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, that just isn't Disney's idea of high concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, though, because Disney is missing out on the marketing bonanza of the 
century. You saw what the cross-promotion of a bad hockey movie and a 
better-than-advertised real-life hockey team did for the Disney coffers during 
the last fiscal year. It created the First Church of the Mighty Duck. All bow 
now before the souvenir stand at your neighborhood hockey arena -- and that'll 
be $24.95, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 With the T-Wolves, Disney had the chance to double that again. Buy the team, 
change the name, tie it in with this summer's sure-fire animated box-office 
blockbuster, leave the kiddies weak in the knees, tugging at Daddy's pant leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, I give you . . . the Lion Kings of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't you just picture it? 
</P>
<P>
 Lion King pump-up, flashing-red-light-in-the-heel, high-top basketball 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lion King pint-sized backboard and hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 (Fur-tone Nerf basketball sold separately.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cute stuffed lion-cub dolls in even cuter tiny basketball jerseys and 
headbands. 
</P>
<P>
 James Earl Jones narrating the 1994-95 Lion King highlight video. 
</P>
<P>
 Isiah Rider and Elton John on CD, doing the "Lion King Rap." 
</P>
<P>
 And, the once-in-a-lifetime season-ticket promotional come-on: 
</P>
<P>
 "Christian and the Lion Kings -- They're On The Same Side, Now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the trailer now being shown for "The Lion King," a wise old baboon 
instructs the lion who would be king to look for the image of his dead father's 
face, which he finds reflecting on the surface of a pond. 
</P>
<P>
 A pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 How many more mallet blows to the temple is it going to take? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a marriage made in mass-marketing heaven or what? 
</P>
<P>
 And when you get right down to it, what's $152.5 million to Michael Eisner, 
anyway? Last year, the Disney CEO's salary was $203 million. Eisner could buy 
the T-Wolves and pay Paul Kariya whatever he wants and stash the remaining $48 
million in a pickle jar above the refrigerator. Save it for a few thousand 
rainy days. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deal stands today, the Minnesota T-Wolves are headed for New Orleans, 
which has nothing to offer except great food, great music, the Superdome and a 
half-million basketball-looped natives who have been drowning their sorrows 
over the loss of the Jazz for so long that it has become a round-the-clock 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the new nicknames for New Orleans' new basketball team are pouring 
in. Nominees include the Sinners (giving the city, yes, the Saints and the 
Sinners); the Rhythm (lending itself to such future headlines as, "Rhythm 
Method Fails Again"); the Blues; the Spice; the Crawfish, and the current 
frontrunner, the Cajuns. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Anaheim simply going to sit on the sidelines and chew on its seven measly 
Clipper games per season, watching the New Orleans Cajuns tear up the French 
Quarter? These professional basketball franchises don't pop free every day. The 
most recent NBA franchise shift happened 10 years ago, when the Kings abandoned 
Kansas City for Sacramento. Expansion just took care of Toronto and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be Anaheim's last chance for a full-time NBA tenant this century -- 
and it's about to float down the river. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, there isn't much time, and there isn't much hope, but there is 
this: The league still must approve the T-Wolves' move to New Orleans. Consumer 
groups in Minnesota are organizing, lobbying for the sale to be voided. Should 
that happen, Anaheim has to be poised to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
 So get Michael Eisner on the horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell him to think big. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell him to think Mighty Ducks and Lion Kings. Tell him to imagine The Pond as 
his very own glass menagerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow it could be Jungleland.

TRACK AND FIELD / NAIA CHAMPIONSHIP; AZUSA PACIFIC MEN WIN THEIR 10TH TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Azusa Pacific men's track and field team won the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics outdoor championship Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And most of it didn't happen on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific, which won its 10th title in 12 years, scored 82 points to beat 
Central State of Ohio by 16 points, and 79 of the points came from field events 
or competitions that included field events. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Bustamante's surprising third-place performance in the discus gave Azusa 
Pacific an insurmountable lead with three events remaining in the meet. "His 
performance was huge," Franson said. "He won the shotput, was third in the 
discus and scored in the hammer throw." 
</P>
<P>
 That added up to 17 points. Tage Peterson's victory in the long jump and third 
place in the decathlon added another 16 for Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's competition, Central State won easily with 96 points. Asuza 
Pacific was sixth with 40 1/2 points. ARA NAJARIAN

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; OVERCOMING ADVERSITY WHAT ROCKETS DO BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have the MVP. They have a fine power forward, guards with great range and 
occasional accuracy. They have a wild card in rookie Sam Cassell, who helped 
punch the Phoenix Suns' ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other remaining teams matches up to them. What could go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you kidding? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Houston Rockets. Vern Maxwell could wave a gun at a motorist or 
attack a TV camera crew. Hakeem Olajuwon could become a Tibetan monk. The 
ground could open up and swallow the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys have survived more adventures than Indiana Jones to get this far. 
Their logo should be a picture of a space ship over the words: "Anything that 
can go wrong already has." 
</P>
<P>
 How about blowing 18- and 20-point leads in consecutive playoff games? 
</P>
<P>
 That happened against the Suns two weeks ago, whereupon both local papers ran 
"Choke City" headlines. The Rockets rallied from their 0-2 deficit and 
re-christened themselves "Clutch City." 
</P>
<P>
 How about letting the Dallas Mavericks, who were en route to an 11-71 record, 
ruin your season? 
</P>
<P>
 That happened in the last week of the 1992-93 season. The Rockets fell to the 
Mavericks, lost the home-court advantage in the second round and were 
eliminated, 4-3, by the SuperSonics, losing Game 7 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 How about losing twice in the last week of the 1991-92 season to the 
Mavericks, who were en route to a 22-60 record, to miss the playoffs 
altogether? The Rockets then had four of their present five starters. 
</P>
<P>
 How about accusing Olajuwon of faking an injury, suspending him and trying to 
trade him? 
</P>
<P>
 That happened two years ago when then-owner Charlie Thomas decided that 
Olajuwon was jerking him around to get a contract extension. The Rockets 
reportedly came close to a deal with the Lakers for Vlade Divac and James 
Worthy but couldn't get around salary-cap restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets have since regrouped under a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich, and a 
new owner, Les Alexander. Tomjanovich has turned the Wild Bunch into a tough 
defensive team but at the cost of their old explosiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, they run the same play, dumping the ball into Olajuwon, who 
either beats several defenders or throws it out to a guard. Mad Max is sure to 
get his 12 shots or more, but power forward Otis Thorpe, a former all-star and 
a career 16-point scorer, has few plays run for him. Kenny Smith and Robert 
Horry have fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rockets lost a fourth-quarter 20-point lead to the Suns while running 
the same play over and over, Tomjanovich was widely criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "By whom?" he said after pounding it into Olajuwon another 10 times down the 
stretch of the Game 2 victory over Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 By several of his players, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon," Tomjanovich said. "Ask a question based on something." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. One play should be good enough to finish off the Jazz, but will it work 
against an ace like Pat Riley or Larry Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it won't come down to coaching. If overcoming adversity means anything, 
here's your new NBA champion. THE DREAM AND THE NIGHTMARE 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon arrived in the NBA as an MVP-in-waiting but he had a long way to go 
to get there, farther even than the 10,000 miles or so from Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a refreshing young man, an athletic prodigy, an incredible worker, a 
relentless player but an impetuous one. 
</P>
<P>
 If he absorbed the game like a sponge -- he didn't start playing until he was 
15 -- he had to grow up the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest game we lost was against Utah (in Game 5 of the 1985 
mini-series), right here in Houston," former teammate Robert Reid said. "I told 
Dream, 'Whopper (Jazz center Billy Paultz) is going to come in, he's going to 
hit you, he's going to hit you, the officials are going to let it go. Don't 
worry about it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But what happened? Dream cold-cocked Billy right on the free-throw line and 
we lose him!  
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't see that with Hakeem now. Right now the Dream is, 'Hit me, I'm 
happy, I'll just go right on scoring.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon wore the Rockets out with requests to renegotiate. A former 
girlfriend, Lita Spencer, filed a paternity suit against him. Olajuwon said one 
reason he couldn't marry her was because she was too short to produce tall 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Now happily married, he has a daughter who isn't tall but whom he loves 
fiercely. He's a devout Muslim. He says he has achieved inner peace and, by all 
indications, actually has. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one NBA story with a truly happy ending. To a man who remains as nice 
as he was deserving: Congratulations, you earned it. DA BULLS: DA END? 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter, during the second round: "Michael Jordan says he still thinks the 
Bulls can beat the Knicks." Phil Jackson: "That's sweet of him. I predict he'll 
hit .300."  
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance either of them had. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bulls overachieved during the regular season, if they went down 
gallantly and departed graciously, they were still overmatched. With a 
physically sound John Starks, the Knicks would have won in six or five. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Jackson, lamenting that Chicago outplayed New York for the first 
six games, mewed: "The best team didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor may it last long. Bill Cartwright and John Paxson are expected to retire. 
Free agents Horace Grant and Scott Williams can leave. By fall, only Scottie 
Pippen and B.J. Armstrong may remain from the three-time champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's what bummed Pippen out. When he took himself out, the Bulls were 
down, 2-0, and the Knicks had just wiped out their 20-point fourth-quarter lead 
in Game 3. The Bulls were looking at a sweep followed by the final breakup of 
the dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I ever think about it?" Pippen asked late in the regular season. "I think 
about it every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, the whole championship squad could be done, the whole thing over. 
. . . With guys going on the market or retiring, we could have seven, eight new 
faces next year, and it's upsetting to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope (management) realizes it's the players, not the uniforms, that 
win championships." 
</P>
<P>
 An imperious outfit, Bull management is instead paving its own road to 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jerry Reinsdorf hard-balled Grant last summer when he might have signed 
for $4 million a year. Now the Bulls are offering the $4 million, but Grant is 
upset at them -- and worth about $5 million to $6 million on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls had only one good long-range alternative, keeping the nucleus 
together in case Jordan reconsidered so he'd have something to come back to. If 
he didn't, their championship days were over anyway, so what did they have 
better to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jordan said last week, for the first time: "I miss it, I must admit." 
</P>
<P>
 His baseball adventure is going downhill. The night the Bulls were eliminated, 
he went 0 for 5, dropping his average to .221. He still doesn't have a home run 
and is now at .209. 
</P>
<P>
 His Bulls, however, may be going, going, gone. BUILD IT AND WE MAY STAY 
</P>
<P>
 Only once in the carpetbagging, money-gouging annals of American sport has an 
owner pulled what the Minnesota Timberwolves' Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner 
are trying. 
</P>
<P>
 The pioneer was Al Davis, who yanked the Raiders out of Oakland, where they'd 
sold out for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Davis is again considering returning. How can the East Bay stay mad 
if he took a little 12-year vacation, as long as he comes back? 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves played to 97% of capacity for five years while averaging 21 
victories and 61 losses. However, Marv'n'Harv had overbuilt a $50-million arena 
into a $104-million white elephant, couldn't pay their loan, then 
double-crossed NBA Commissioner David Stern, who was trying to find a local 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Minneapolis man offered $90 million. Magic Johnson was trying to put a group 
together with Minneapolis record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. But Top 
Rank, Bob Arum's boxing promotion company, blew them out of the water with a 
mind-boggling $152.5-million bid to buy the team and move it to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Marn'n'Harv said they told everyone they had a May 20 deadline. No one else 
knew anything about it. An NBA spokesman said Stern hadn't been told.

 Stern, bristling, issued a statement that said Marv'n'Harv had acted 
"regrettably." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days later, Stern said he would make no further comment since it 
was being studied by various NBA committees, etc. He did, however, suggest a 
city could "protect itself" by building its own arena and locking up the team 
with a long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true enough in these days when a city needs protection from the owners 
of the local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are philosophical considerations, such as: Why subsidize a 
bunch of pirates? Even the original buccaneers weren't state-supported. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayers build a brand-new, luxury-boxed arena. The NBA owner makes a 
fortune in it. Corporate America entertains in style, with tax write-offs. The 
middle class watches on TV -- assuming it can afford the $20 pay-per-view tab 
now charged for each playoff game by teams like the Rockets, Trail Blazers and 
Suns. The community caps other projects -- such as schools -- to keep the total 
tax bill from going up. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the league that gave us the "Stay in School" program? 
</P>
<P>
 The matter will now disappear behind closed doors, where the reactions of 
other NBA owners can be guessed: 
</P>
<P>
 Owner A: "Too bad, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Owner B: "Yeah, but what can we do about it? If we block it, they may sue us." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner C: "And how about that Arum! Paying 152 mill for a terrible team with no 
tradition, few players and no building? What a guy! Our clubs just appreciated 
another $10 million! We're rich!" 
</P>
<P>
 Owner D: "I just booked Brennan's for breakfast and K-Paul's for dinner for 
our game next season!" 
</P>
<P>
 Owner A: "Let's vote. All in favor say 'aye.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Owners B, C, D: "AYE!" 
</P>
<P>
 Owner A: "Motion carried. Let's go announce it. Remember, look serious. This 
is a sad day."

 Scoring to Win 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage higher-scoring games, teams will be awarded three points for a 
victory and one for a tie in the first round of World Cup play. In the past, 
teams received two points for a victory and one for a tie. With the old system, 
many teams stacked their defense and played for a tie. The revision of the 
point system, World Cup organizers hope, will encourage attacking play. A. 
TACTICAL STRATEGY Numerous attack patterns will be executed during the World 
Cup. A common one involves the two strikers criss-crossing to confuse defenders 
and one wing overlapping the play while the other wing stays back. In this 
attack, the midfielder with the ball has at least four passing options or can 
dribble in and shoot. B. CORNER KICK Three basic approaches are used. 
</P>
<P>
 1. A very short pass followed by a return pass to the kicker can be used for 
an attack along the end line. 2. The ball can be passed to the middle of the 
box, where attacking players try to head the ball into the net. The goalkeeper 
often will charge out and attempt to punch or catch the ball. 3. The ball can 
be passed to the top of the box for a shot through a maze of players in hopes 
that the goalie will be shielded. C. FREE KICK Direct kicks near an opposing 
goal are executed in various ways. 1. Shots on goal must go around, through or 
over a wall of defenders 10 yards from the ball. 2. Because of the difficulty 
of a direct shot on goal, a pass to a nearby teammate with a clear shooting 
angle is often tried. * Indirect free kicks -- Awarded for lesser fouls, must 
be touched by two players before going into the goal. * Free kicks -- Far away 
from the goal, they usually result in a short pass that merely re-starts play. 
BICYCLE KICK The signature play of Brazilian superstar Pele, the bicycle kick 
is a volley in which a player strikes the ball while it is over his head. Both 
of his feet are off the ground at the time of contact. 1. A player approaching 
a bicycle kick must be certain there are no other players nearby or he will be 
called for a dangerous play. 2. A player begins his leap by raising his 
non-kicking leg to achieve balance. 3. Using a pedaling motion, the player 
drives his other leg into the air to make contact with the ball. 4. A player 
lands with his back to the play. KICKING THE BALL 
</P>
<P>
 * Chip shot -- A high-arching shot made by hitting the bottom half of the ball 
without following through on the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banana kick -- A kick that bends or curves, its action determined by how and 
where the ball is struck. A. Inswinger -- a corner kick that curves towards the 
net, is made by hitting the bottom outside quadrant of the ball with the inside 
part of the foot. B. Outswinger -- a corner kick that curves away from the net, 
is made by hitting the bottom inside quadrant of the ball with the outside part 
of the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Power kick--A low-flying high-velocity kick made by hitting the center of 
the ball with the top part of the foot. GLOSSARY * Far post; near post -- The 
areas near the goalposts that are, respectively, further from and closest to 
where the ball is being played. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heel pass -- A backward pass struck with a player's heel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Own goal -- A goal scored by a player against his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overlap -- The action by a defensive player moving into the attack, usually 
leaving another player to temporarily assume his defensive duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Square ball -- A lateral pass; also referred to as "playing the ball 
square." 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall pass -- The traditional give-and-go pass found in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assist -- A pass that leads to a goal. The statistic, used primarily in 
basketball and hockey, is gaining acceptance in soccer and is expected to be 
used during the World Cup for the first time.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PHOENIX GROUP IS CONFIDENT OF GAINING AN NL FRANCHISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the ongoing dilution of major league pitching, another expansion 
remains likely in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 An expansion committee chaired by John Harrington, CEO of the Boston Red Sox, 
is scheduled to make a preliminary report at an owners' meeting in Cincinnati 
on June 8-9 and recommend that the process continue. Selection of the cities is 
tentatively scheduled for December or January, but that's a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Long romanced Tampa-St. Petersburg will finally walk down the aisle with an 
American League franchise, and Phoenix will join the Dodgers, San Francisco 
Giants, San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proceeding as if it's going to happen," said Jerry Colangelo, president 
of the Phoenix Suns and chairman of the group seeking the baseball franchise. 
"We're primed and ready for the final stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about speculation that the Angels might move to Arizona if they are 
unable to work out a lease extension in Anaheim, Colangelo laughed and said: 
"That's pie-in-the-sky leverage. Our interest is in expansion and expansion 
only. We can't move ahead on a stadium unless we get expansion approval. 
There's no interim facility, and can you imagine the losses the Angels or any 
other existing club would incur playing three years or more (as a lame duck) in 
their current market while a stadium was being built here? Plus, we don't want 
anyone else's baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo said he will be surprised if Phoenix fails to get an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was encouraged by people I knew in baseball to organize a group and put the 
funding together," he said. "We have the group and we have the funding. I 
wouldn't have gone this far without baseball's encouragement. The ball is in 
baseball's lap." 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo wouldn't say where that encouragement came from, but it is believed 
that two friends and part-time Phoenix area residents -- Jerry Reinsdorf, 
co-owner of the Chicago White Sox, and interim commissioner Bud Selig, owner of 
the Milwaukee Brewers -- provided the shove. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Selig nor Reinsdorf would comment on that matter, but speaking 
generally of expansion, Selig said: "If we didn't think the process had merit, 
we wouldn't be examining it." 
</P>
<P>
 By expanding each league to three divisions of five teams each, baseball will 
either have to test interleague play or have one club in each league idle every 
night. The ultimate blueprint calls for 32 teams and another significant 
realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is not without opposition. Many in baseball believe that the 
talent is too thin to absorb two more teams only five years after the 
introduction of the Rockies and the Florida Marlins. Selig acknowledged that 
"with all the talk of juiced-up baseballs, people are more concerned about the 
level of pitching. Do two more markets outweigh further dilution? That's a 
serious question." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also those who believe troubled clubs such as the Montreal Expos 
should be moved before any further expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 However, proponents cite improved scheduling and geographic considerations, 
the remarkable bonanza generated by the Rockies and Marlins, the windfall entry 
fee -- likely to be significantly more than the $95 million paid by Colorado 
and Florida. They also cite possible use of expansion as a bargaining chip in 
the labor negotiations with the players union, as a response to government 
threats to eliminate the antitrust exemption and as a wedge against the federal 
suit filed by St. Petersburg after being jilted again when the owners voted to 
keep the Giants in San Francisco, voiding the move to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides in that suit have agreed to a year's delay in further court 
proceedings, underscoring the belief that expansion is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo, meanwhile, said Phoenix will need three years to prepare because of 
the absence of an interim facility. The plan is to build a $278-million, 
45,000-seat, retractable-roof stadium with a grass field in the vicinity of the 
America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Maricopa County supervisors have approved a quarter-cent sales tax increase to 
fund $238 million of the project, with Colangelo's group providing the rest. 
The tax will be implemented only if Phoenix is awarded a franchise. However, 
the county's approval of the tax expires next April, meaning baseball must act 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're well aware of that," Selig said. REMEMBERING STRAW 
</P>
<P>
 Davey Johnson, who managed Darryl Strawberry with the New York Mets, said of 
Strawberry's departure from the Dodgers: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody who has been associated with Darryl feels that maybe we 
have failed in some way. I know I was pretty hard on him at times. I felt like 
he needed a strong hand. I used to bench him, fine him, play him nine innings 
in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl would come to me and say, 'I need you to tell me when I'm wrong.' He 
could be very . . . I don't want to say nice, but he could be very well-spoken, 
making a lot of sense. The things he said a lot of times were good things, 
constructive things. He wanted the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, now the Reds' manager, recalled that in the spring of 1989, 
Strawberry seemed despondent, burdened by financial and personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to jump the club. That was the only way he could deal with the 
pressure. I told him that would be a mistake, the worst thing he could do. He 
said he appreciated the advice. Everything seemed cool. The next day he didn't 
show up for a workout. I should have known right then. He talked himself into 
it that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, we're responsible for our own actions, but I've always wondered 
if there were things I could have done differently, handled him in a better 
way. I don't know. So many people have always expected so much of him that 
there has always been pressure no matter what he does or what anyone else 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 How good could Strawberry have been? 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlimited," Johnson said. "He had so many good years in the late '80s that I 
really thought he was on the right track, that he was growing up. I was hoping 
I could be there to see him hit 60 home runs (in a season). There were times I 
was so sure he'd do it." LEADERSHIP VOID 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers rewarded Juan Gonzalez for his consecutive home run titles 
with a seven-year, $45-million-plus contract, hoping it would help the 
24-year-old slugger recognize his priorities and responsibilities as a young 
leader. The club might be wondering if Gonzalez would recognize those 
responsibilities at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rangers about to lose their fourth straight game last Sunday in 
Seattle, Gonzalez took himself out of the lineup in the fourth inning because 
of what was said to be a bruised left shin suffered in a first-inning collision 
with third baseman Dean Palmer. Palmer, who took the worst of it, played the 
entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel good," Gonzalez said. "I was sore." 
</P>
<P>
 He was apparently too sore to run out an inning-ending popup in the fourth, 
angrily flinging his bat instead, after which he left the game, a departure 
that might have had more to do with a sick bat than a bruised body. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has six hits in his last 44 at-bats. He has not driven in a run in 
that span and has not homered in his last 74 at-bats. BAY BLUES 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to keep the Dodgers in sight, the problems and frustrations continue to 
mount for the Giants, forced to put rotation ace Bill Swift (inflamed shoulder 
muscle) and reliever Rich Monteleone (stress fracture in a foot) on the 
disabled list, joining second baseman Robby Thompson (partially torn rotator) 
and reliever Kevin Rogers (circulatory problem). 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego on Monday, Mark Portugal screamed at a reporter, and Dave 
Martinez was ejected when he argued a called third strike. The next night, Matt 
Williams set a helmet-throw record when he flied out to the warning track with 
two out and the tying run at third base in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Dusty Baker, operating now with two rookies in his rotation and 
something of a patchwork lineup that includes a .256 hitter, Todd Benzinger, at 
first base while Will Clark bats .363 for the Rangers, had already lit into his 
team during a 20-minute clubhouse meeting in Chicago last weekend. That was 
followed by three consecutive losses, then Wednesday and Thursday victories in 
San Diego, where Baker said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to panic, but it's not too early to not like what I see. We 
play good for three, bad for two, good for two, bad for three. That's why we're 
at .500." 
</P>
<P>
 A question of attitude? 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't worried about the attitude," he said. "As long as I'm the manager, 
the attitude is going to be good, I guarantee that. We've just got to fight 
through it, and we will."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; INJURED FINGER PUTS DESHIELDS ON DL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since spring training Delino DeShields has suffered a broken cheekbone, had a 
concussion, had a 15-year old injury act up and and was hit in the face when a 
ball ricocheted off the plate while batting, but was still able to avoid the 
disabled list -- until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With his left-middle finger still severely sprained and cut from a head-first 
slide into home plate Wednesday night, DeShields was put on the 15-day list, 
retroactive to May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes at a bad time for DeShields, who had snapped out of a slow offensive 
start and was batting .345 with 10 runs in his last 16 games. "It was just like 
before I got hit with the bat (in spring training) I said, 'Reggie (Smith), I'm 
starting to feel good,' then, bam,' " DeShields said. "(Jeff) Treadway is 
banged up too, so they need one guy playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hansen was activated and second baseman Garey Ingram remained with the 
team. Treadway sprained his right wrist Wednesday night on a double-play 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is improved, Mike Piazza sat out his second consecutive game because 
of a sore neck and bruised left rib suffered in Wednesday night's collision at 
home plate with Glenallen Hill, and remains day to day. Piazza has sat out two 
consecutive games only once before, April 8-9 of last season. . . . Darren 
Dreifort, whose pinch-hit in the 10th inning drove in the winning run Friday 
night, said that his first game-winning ball is more treasured than his first 
save. "Pitchers are supposed to get saves, they aren't supposed to get 
game-winning hits," Dreifort said. Dreifort said he was in the bullpen talking 
with the other relievers about who was going to pitch and hit when he got the 
call to get his gear and get to the on-deck circle. He ran all the way from the 
bullpen and straight on the field. "I can't remember calling the bullpen for a 
hitter before, " Manager Tom Lasorda said. "The last time I called in a pitcher 
to hit was Tim Leary in 1988 against the Giants, and he won the game for us."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * BIRDLAND: Having spent $173 million for the franchise and another $43 
million for free agents, new Baltimore owner Peter Angelos can be excused for 
having high expectations and limited patience. Insiders say he has been on the 
verge of firing Manager John Oates despite having given Oates a two-year 
extension when he bought the club last year. Vice President Frank Robinson 
would apparently replace Oates, who replaced Robinson when Robinson was kicked 
upstairs with the Orioles 13-24 in 1991. The Orioles don't seem to need a 
managerial change as much as an offensive awakening. Mark McLemore, Chris Sabo, 
Brady Anderson, Mike Devereaux and Chris Hoiles are batting .235 or worse, and 
Jeff Hammond is on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 * OFF THE BLOCK: Despite a 2-9 record and 17 losses in his last 21 decisions, 
Andy Benes remains baseball's most pursued pitcher. But with owner Tom Werner 
negotiating the sale of the San Diego Padres, another payroll-reducing move 
involving Benes might be delayed. Benes, amid his own frustration and 
discouragement, put in a word for Manager Jim Riggleman. "There's no manager in 
the history of baseball who could do better (with this team)," Benes said. 
</P>
<P>
 * TURNING IT AROUND: Doug Drabek's 7-1 record is not only a reversal of his 
9-18 debut with the Houston Astros last season, it reverses his career pattern. 
Drabek is 45-49 before the All-Star break and 63-39 after it. 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD ASTROS: Erratic Mitch Williams is certain to be released or traded, if 
anyone will have him. A shouting match with Manager Terry Collins over Collins' 
employment of John Hudek in the closer role is thought to be the last straw. 
The Astros would like to make room for Phil Nevin at third base and acquire 
outfielder Milt Thompson or Jim Eisenreich from the Philadelphia Phillies by 
trading Ken Caminiti. The Phillies, with Dave Hollins on the disabled list for 
six weeks because of a broken hand, are interested, but only if the Astros pick 
up some of the $7.5 million Caminiti is guaranteed through 1995, which 
conflicts with one of the reasons Houston wants to trade him. General managers 
Bob Watson and Lee Thomas have been talking about it in Philadelphia this 
weekend.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SNOW EXPECTED TO REPLACE PEREZ

 The Angels, privately deciding that first baseman Eduardo Perez would benefit 
by playing every day at triple-A Vancouver, are expected to replace him on 
their next home stand with J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who opened the season as the Angels' everyday first baseman, has been 
relegated to part-time duty with the emergence of Jim Edmonds, who's batting 
.354.Perez is playing only against left-handed starters, and Lachemann said 
that it's possible Edmonds could win the everyday job. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez has started only two games since Marcel Lachemann became manager May 19, 
and only five games since May 4. Sidelined for nine days earlier in the month 
because of a strained ligament in his left wrist, Perez is batting .220 with 
five homers and 16 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who has been on the trading block since spring training, has proven to 
the Angels that there's nothing left for him to accomplish in Vancouver. They 
Angels have tried unsuccessfully to trade him. The Florida Marlins expressed 
mild interest this week, but the Marlins decided that they don't have the 
pitching prospects to trade away. 
</P>

 Angel starter Brian Anderson is scheduled to throw seven innings or 85 to 90 
pitches in his next rehabilitative start Wednesday before rejoining the Angel 
rotation. . . . Vancouver starter Russ Springer, who's expected to join the 
Angel bullpen on their upcoming home stand, gave up 11 hits and six runs (four 
earned) in 6 2/3 innings Friday. BOB NIGHTENGALE

HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS / SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; OCEAN VIEW'S PIETROWSKI 
BREEZES TO TITLE

 Jakub Pietrowski of Huntington Beach Ocean View High wasted little time 
Saturday in defeating Sandy Gentile of Temple City to win the Southern Section 
boys' singles championship at the Seacliff tennis club in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, the top-ranked player in Southern California Tennis Assn. junior 
competition, took 1 hour 5 minutes to defeat Gentile, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski broke Gentile's serve to take a 4-2 lead in the first set and then 
was nearly flawless, giving up only three points over the next two games, to 
win it. 
</P>
<P>
 The second set was slightly more difficult for Pietrowski because Gentile 
jumped to a 3-2 lead. Pietrowski broke Gentile's serve on a backhand shot down 
the line, however, to tie the score. He gave up one more game to Gentile before 
winning the match after Gentile double faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling," Pietrowski said. "I was hungry for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, a senior, missed the Ojai Valley tournament last month because of 
a twisted ankle and school obligations. Because of his absence at Ojai, 
Pietrowski was seeded second in the Southern Section singles tournament behind 
Nathan Jackmon of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, who was seeded fourth, upset Jackmon in the semifinals, 0-6, 7-5, 
6-1, to advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, who defeated third-seeded Geoff Abrams of Newport Harbor, 6-1, 
6-3, in the semifinals, was not entirely relieved at the prospect of playing 
Gentile rather than Jackmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew whoever I played, I would have to play well," Pietrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, a senior who will attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the fall, is 
ranked 11th in the SCTA and is 0-3 against Pietrowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, who will attend Notre Dame, was born in Gdansk, Poland, and moved 
to Huntington Beach in 1982. He speaks fluent Polish with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubles final was a bit unusual because both teams were unseeded. Darren 
Auld and David Robles of Corona defeated Dan Roditi and Jeff Shoemaker of San 
Clemente, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, to win Corona's first individual title in tennis.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION III VOLLEYBALL; EAGLES END THE SEASON PERFECTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Calvary Chapel made it look easy all season long, and the Eagles didn't stop 
when they played Santa Ynez for the Southern Section Division III boys' 
volleyball championship Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind senior Philip Schildts, who had 20 kills and three blocks, top-seeded 
Calvary Chapel capped its undefeated season with a convincing 15-8, 15-3, 15-8 
victory. It is the first section boys' volleyball title for Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good after coming away empty-handed the last two times we were 
here," Calvary Chapel Coach Chuck Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and '92, the Eagles lost in the Division 2-A final to Olympic 
League-rival Whittier Christian. The Heralds, who had won three consecutive 
section championships heading into this season, lost to second-seeded Santa 
Ynez (21-3) in the semifinals Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this day, it probably didn't matter who was on the other side of the 
net for Calvary Chapel (18-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, who didn't lose a game during the playoffs, took control early and 
had a 6-1 lead. After Santa Ynez sophomore Andy Witt spiked for a point to 
close the Pirates to 7-4, Calvary Chapel responded by scoring the next six 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Schildts had nine kills in the first game, and his brother Robert, a 6-foot-7 
junior, kept Santa Ynez honest in the middle with three of his five kills in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' offense was clicking. In addition to the Schildts brothers, setter 
Matt Wright, who had 31 assists, also went to Aaron Fountain (10 kills) on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel complemented its attack with solid defense. Junior middle 
blocker John Glover, who had three blocks, helped the Eagles out-block Santa 
Ynez, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Witt finished with 15 kills, Calvary Chapel forced him into 12 
hitting errors and blocked him five times. Philip Schildts and Steve Lefevre 
blocked Witt at game point to give the Eagles a 15-8 victory in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone turned it up today," Robert Schildts said. "We were all fired up, 
and we didn't give them a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored the first six points in Game 2 and closed it out by winning 
seven consecutive points for a 15-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of Calvary Chapel's 15 points in Game 2, 10 came on our errors," Santa Ynez 
Coach Chip Fenenga said. "Their serving kept us off the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 3, an ace by Fountain gave Calvary Chapel a 5-4 lead, and four Santa 
Ynez errors pushed it to 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Schildts blocked Witt to make it 10-5. Then Wright, a 5-7 junior, 
spiked off a block attempt by Witt, who is 6-4, for an 11-5 lead, and the rout 
was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "All year we've been trying to set Matt on a play like that," Philip Schildts 
said, "and he steps up to do it in the biggest match of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of day it was for Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the playoffs, we've had a different intensity," Robert Schildts said. 
"This is great. It's what you work for the whole season."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I BOYS' VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP; UNSEEDED HUNTINGTON 
BEACH MAKES IT TWO IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saturday's volleyball championship match was about survival, and Huntington 
Beach left Cerritos College alive with its second consecutive Southern Section 
Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Oilers outlasted second-seeded Laguna Beach to post a 15-13, 
11-15, 15-8, 15-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach defeated Capistrano Valley in five games to win the Division 
I boys' volleyball championship last season. Laguna Beach was the last team to 
win consecutive major division championships, winning the 4-A title from 1981 
to '83. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Styles had a match-high 23 kills and Szilard Kovacs added 16 kills and 
four blocks for Laguna Beach (19-2), which defeated Huntington Beach in a 
nonleague match earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nick Ziegler had 16 kills and Jeremy Bart had 15 to lead the Oilers, and 
Mike Grave's defense also played a key role in the Oiler victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave finished with only 11 kills, but Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli 
said he positioned Grave to receive most of Styles' spike attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dug that guy all night long," Grave said. "He was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Grave's coach was a little more composed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they would go to Styles so we put Mike back there because he plays 
great defense," Ciarelli said. "We were fortunate that he got a few up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli's nephew, Ziegler, dyed his hair purple for the playoffs but made the 
Artists feel blue. The 6-foot-5 senior finished with two blocks, including a 
solo stuff of Kovacs, who has signed a letter of intent with USC, to give the 
Oilers a 12-7 lead in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mike and Nick stepped up in the fourth game," Ciarelli said, "and 
said that they wanted to end it right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler spiked to give Huntington Beach a 13-7 lead, then Styles fired a spike 
long to make it 14-7. The Artists drew within 14-9, but after Ziegler spiked 
from the right side for a side out, Jody Cook-Fisher spiked off the block for 
match point. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was great to be a part of because no one has won back-to-back titles for 
a while," Grave said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler also grinned after the victory. He has signed to play football for 
Colorado and had a championship slip through his fingers earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing defensive line for the Oiler football team, Ziegler helped Huntington 
Beach win 13 consecutive games to reach the Division II championship game. But 
Los Alamitos dashed the Oilers' title hopes with a 39-21 victory, also at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler wasn't going to let it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 He started strong in Game 1, and his spike from the middle for a side out set 
up the Oilers for game point. Styles was called for going under the net, giving 
Huntington Beach a 15-13 victory in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach rebounded in the second game and sprinted to a 9-1 lead behind 
Styles, who had eight kills in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach closed to within 14-10 when Brad Simon blocked Styles, and a 
Laguna Beach error put Huntington Beach within 14-11. But Ziegler, who had six 
kills in the game, hit a spike wide from the middle and the Artists drew even 
with a 15-11 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Beach took a 2-1 lead in the third game, rallying from a 6-1 
deficit to win 14 of the last 16 points to win, 15-8. Although Styles had 10 
kills in Game 3, the Oilers took some of his steam away by digging his spikes 
numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, Grave seemed to find his rhythm in Game 3 and combined with 
Ziegler to block Kovacs for game point. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach setter Josh Moss finished with 59 assists. Laguna Beach 
setter Kurt Nelson finished with 57.

ROYAL FAMILY CROWNED AFTER HIGHLAND DEFEAT; BOYS' VOLLEYBALL: MATT OLSEN LEADS 
HIGHLANDERS TO FOUR-GAME VICTORY IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II 
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are family, the Royal High boys' volleyball players repeated like a mantra, 
after they defeated Highland to win the Southern Section Division II 
championship on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're beyond best friends," Danny Rizzo said. "We love each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Syrupy sweetness spilled from the Highlander players in a makeshift pressroom 
after Royal's 15-10, 15-12, 11-15, 17-15 victory at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was bawling my eyes out after the match," setter Josh White said. "We are a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 But Royal's Matt Olsen, who seemingly had the most immediate cause for an 
emotional meltdown, sat silently behind a table, staring at the floor and 
fiddling with his championship patch while his teammates gushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six weeks ago, Olsen's mother, Lorraine, died of cancer. At the time, he 
had just recovered from torn ligaments in his left ankle, an injury that 
sidelined him for 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 6-foot-6 senior endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me want to play harder," he said. "I just wanted to play for her. I 
dedicate it all to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen has much to dedicate. Two days after signing to play for Brigham Young, 
he ended his high school career with a burst. 
</P>
<P>
 He pounded down 38 kills with no more than a handful of hitting errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was he awesome or what?" Royal Coach Bob Ferguson said. "He called on 
something extra." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he called on the support of his teammates, who attended his 
mother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team got really close then," he said. "They all supported me and my 
little brother Joe (a sophomore on the team) at the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Olsen returned the favor, boosting the Highlanders (18-3) to their 
fourth section title in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not easy. Highland (18-1) had a magical season of its own. The 
Bulldogs surprised even themselves with their sudden success, and they played 
well Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyed by the play of middle hitters Ryan Millar (26 kills) and Mac Wilson (19 
kills and 12 blocks), the Bulldogs led late in every game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Royal, though it had lost five starters from last year's team, continually 
rallied from behind. The Highlanders closed the first game with a 9-0 run, and 
took the second with steady play down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland regrouped to win Game 3, and took a 13-9 lead in the fourth game. But 
the Bulldogs could not force a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times the Bulldogs served on game point, but twice Olsen registered 
kills to give Royal a sideout, and Highland setter Toby Sides had the ball slip 
through his hands while attempting to set on the other game point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Royal was a little more experienced and had a little bit more ball 
control," Highland Coach Mike Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also had Olsen. He served the final point of the match, and when Millar 
hit it off the net out of bounds, the season was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past couple of months I've been dedicating my life to volleyball," Olsen 
said. "Wanting to win this last game."

PARKER PROVES A GOOD CATCH FOR MATADORS; FRESHMAN WALK-ON EXCELS BEHIND PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by a talented group of veterans on the Cal State Northridge 
softball team, freshman catcher Jennifer Parker has proved she's no rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 And keeping up with the third-ranked Matadors (51-8) -- who will face Oklahoma 
State at 12:30 p.m. PDT today in a semifinal of the College Softball World 
Series -- is no small feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a redshirt freshman who has split playing time at catcher with 
sophomore Scia Maumausolo this season, has maintained a .400 average through 31 
starts this year. She started 16 of Northridge's 24 Western Athletic Conference 
games and batted a team-high .511. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Matadors' regional-clinching 4-0 victory over Cal State Fullerton last 
week, Parker had two hits and drove in Northridge's first two runs on a 
bases-loaded double. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Parker's recent accomplishments, it's no surprise that Coach Gary 
Torgeson started her at catcher in the Matadors' first two games in Oklahoma 
City. Or, is it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a surprise to everyone," center fielder Jen Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, even Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surprised about the first one because I almost always catch Amy 
(Windmiller)," Parker said. "But the second one surprised me because I thought 
(Maumausolo) would catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a walk-on from Glendora High who is batting .409 with nine runs batted 
in, never expected to start this season, period. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo was a backup catcher and a full-time designated player who earned 
first-team All-American honors at utility player last year. She was Torgeson's 
top returnee behind the plate. Parker was little more than an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Parker) had a lot more to prove to me than Scia did, because I was going 
with Scia," Torgeson said. "I didn't give (Parker) a chance in heck to be the 
starting catcher. I thought she would spot Scia and give her a rest 
occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps at some point during Windmiller's 14-game win streak in which 
Parker caught every game, Torgeson's view changed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move wasn't based solely on Parker's performance behind the plate. It 
had as much to do with Maumausolo's performance at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scia's (throwing) release is better than JP's, but JP gets the job done," 
Torgeson said. "I have in no way given up on (Maumausolo). The fact of the 
matter is she's hitting the ball better as a DP and I can't afford not to have 
her bat in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo, who might get the start at catcher today, is batting .302, but 
.338 as a designated player. She has seven home runs and her 44 RBIs are second 
best on the team. She is two for five with two RBIs as a DP in the tournament. 
Parker is two for six with no RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates, including the team's three pitchers, say they have no preference 
who plays behind the plate. "I don't and I don't think any other pitcher does 
either," said junior right-hander Kathy Blake (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (25-2), who leads the nation with an 0.30 earned-run average and 
threw five no-hitters with Parker as her battery mate, echoes Blake's 
sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll throw to anyone," said Windmiller, one of Maumausolo's five roommates in 
an off-campus apartment. "They are both great catchers." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Parker doesn't catch another pitch in the series and Torgeson goes back 
to Maumausolo, will Parker be offended? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because I caught the first two games and we won the first two games," 
Parker said. "If we go on and Scia catches the rest of the games and we win the

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JEFF FLETCHER: YOU CAN TELL HE'S A SNYDER; CHECK THE ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You might not recognize Chad Snyder as the younger brother of Dodger utility 
man Cory Snyder right away, because Chad lacks the long, flowing blond hair 
that is his older brother's most recognizable feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad had his hair sheared with the rest of the team for the Southern Section 
Division II baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you watch Chad patrol right field for Rio Mesa High, he's 
unmistakably Cory's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I throw just like him," Snyder said. "Everybody says that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a first-year varsity player, Snyder has been among the leading hitters and 
best defensive players for the Spartans, who will face J.W. North on Tuesday at 
Ventura College in a section semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad has been as consistent as anybody we have," Coach Richard Duran said. 
"Early on, it seemed like every ball he hit was hard. His ability to put the 
ball in play with authority was reminiscent of few players I've had in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 A junior batting in the No. 3 spot, Snyder finished the regular season batting 
.440 with 23 runs batted in. He is also an exceptional outfielder with a strong 
arm, Duran said. Snyder made a diving catch near the right-field line for the 
final out in Rio Mesa's victory over Santa Barbara that clinched the Channel 
League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Chad takes a lot of pride in doing the fundamental things that 
prepare you to make a play like that," Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder has worked hard on his swing too. He heads to Dodger Stadium some 
afternoons and works out on the field with his brother before games. He even 
has his own Dodger uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, who said he plans to work out at Dodger Stadium virtually every day 
the team is home this summer, shrugs off what would be a dream for most high 
school baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing for me," he said. "I've been there a lot so it's just another 
place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Snyders moved to Camarillo in 1984 from the Santa Clarita Valley, where 
Cory was a high school star for Canyon High. Cory, 30, also played at Brigham 
Young and was a member of the 1984 Olympic baseball team. He was a first-round 
draft pick of the Cleveland Indians in '84. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who also coached 1991 first-round pick Dmitri Young, has high hopes for 
Chad Snyder too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no telling how good he can be because I think he's still filling 
out," Duran said of the 5-foot-10, 170-pound Snyder. "And I don't think he 
lacks confidence, so you put those two things together and we're looking for 
big things from him next year." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Knight again: The Notre Dame baseball team took no one by surprise when it 
made the Southern Section Division I semifinals last year. The team included 
three Division I college-bound players and was highly ranked all year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1994 team, with largely unheralded players, is in the semifinals 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a better team this year than people give us credit," Coach 
Tom Dill said. "I think we had a lot of depth on last year's team and they are 
coming through." 
</P>
<P>
 One who has answered the call is pitcher Rich Igou, who didn't see much action 
last year because of pitchers Chris Leveque and Chris Garza. Igou has won two 
playoff games and saved another. He threw a three-hit shutout against Nogales 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dill said he probably won't start Igou (11-2) in the semifinals against 
Lakewood on Tuesday at Blair Field in Long Beach. Dill said he probably will 
start Andy Lutz (7-1). "I learned my lesson about that last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Dill brought Leveque back on three days' rest in the semifinals and 
Notre Dame lost, 10-0, to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tough loss: The Simi Valley softball team's 2-0 defeat at Lompoc in the 
Southern Section Division I quarterfinals on Tuesday was difficult for Coach 
Suzanne Manlet to handle because she couldn't be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Manlet was home sick. It was the first playoff game she had missed in 13 
seasons as the Pioneers' coach. When she heard the news that her team would not 
defend its section title, she was disappointed, but not totally surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked because we haven't had a whole lot of runs scored against us," 
she said, "but I realized having to travel takes a little out of you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Off the hook: Taft and Poly baseball players combined to ease Toreador Coach 
Rich McKeon's guilt Friday in the first round of the City Section 4-A Division 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Taft trailing, 2-1, and with runners at first and third and none out in 
the fifth inning, McKeon called a bunt play that his team hadn't practiced 
much. The play, intended to drive in the runner from third, didn't work. It 
went only as a sacrifice, moving the runner to second while the other held at 
third. Taft didn't score in the inning and later fell behind, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But four Taft hits -- and four Poly errors -- in the seventh helped the 
Toreadors to five runs and a 7-3 upset of Poly, the third-seeded team in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling that I had taken us out of perhaps an opportunity to score some 
runs," McKeon said. "I was eating myself up, praying I didn't have to live all 
summer with that." 
</P>
<P>

 The cycle: Hart junior golfer Steve Farris accomplished an unusual feat in his 
round Monday in the Southern Section Individual Golf Championships at La Cumbra 
Country Club in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 He was four-over on the front nine, then the "roller coaster started on 10," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farris' back nine included an eagle, birdie, par, bogey, double-bogey, 
triple-bogey and a quadruple-bogey. Farris finished with an 11-over-par 82.

THE NEW BIG FISH; HERNANDEZ BOUNCES FROM OBSCURITY TO CENTER STAGE AS EMERGENCY 
BULLPEN ACE FOR FLORIDA MARLINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody would have blamed Jeremy Hernandez for feeling like a Marlin out of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-throwing right-hander, a long reliever and setup man during his 
four-year major league career, was accustomed to pitching in tight spots. But 
taking over for Bryan Harvey, Florida's bullpen ace and one of the premier 
closers in the game, was another thing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most seasoned professional might sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous and I was also a little worried about Bryan," said 
Hernandez, recalling the game in which he replaced Harvey. "I just took a 
couple of deep breaths and went right at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a 6-foot-4 former Poly High and Cal State Northridge standout, has 
parlayed that approach into nine saves -- third-best in the National League. 
Harvey left a game against Atlanta on April 26 with a strained muscle in his 
right elbow and later was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Hernandez's first 
save came that same night and he hasn't vacated the role since, although he 
said he is not sure of Manager Rene Lachemann's future plans. "They had the 
potential to go to a lot of people," said Hernandez, 27. "They didn't tell me I 
was going to be a stopper. I didn't know if it was going to be a permanent 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 If not permanent, Hernandez is at least on extended assignment. Harvey, fresh 
off the disabled list, was warming up in the bullpen on Saturday when he 
experienced tightness in his injured elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harvey didn't feel good warming up, so we shut him down," Lachemann said. 
"There's talk about him (going on the DL), but we'll re-evaluate him tomorrow 
before making that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer was not the role the Marlins expected Hernandez to fill when they 
acquired him from Cleveland for pitcher Matt Turner the day before the season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We traded for him to set up Harvey," Lachemann said. "We also wanted someone 
to give Harvey a rest once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Indians last season, Hernandez had a record of 6-5 with a 3.14 
earned-run average in 49 relief appearances. He converted eight of 13 save 
opportunities. Starting the season with San Diego, he was 0-2 with a 4.72 ERA 
and no saves in 21 games, primarily setting up Gene Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal that sent Hernandez to Florida apparently was fueled by former Marlin 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, who recently was hired to manage the Angels. 
Lachemann saw Hernandez pitch in Cactus League spring training games. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and Doug Rader (Florida's batting coach) had always liked him a 
lot," Rene Lachemann said. "They were really high on him. They thought he was 
very capable of doing a good job, and he has done a very good job for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In 19 games, Hernandez has blown only three of 12 save opportunities and has a 
record of 3-3 with a 2.74 ERA. His only real poor outing came last Sunday, when 
he yielded four earned runs in the ninth inning and blew a 9-6 lead in a 10-9 
loss against St. Louis. It was a slip, but not one that worried his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's fine with him," catcher Benito Santiago said. "He has done very 
well and I expect it to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez credits Marcel Lachemann for much of his success with the Marlins. 
It wasn't a happy day, Hernandez said, when the Angels hired Lachemann to 
replace the fired Buck Rodgers earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big disappointment," Hernandez said. "When I got here, I was 
designated as his project, but he didn't want to make any changes in me 
(mechanically). He worked with what I had. The biggest problem with me was 
mentally, and with his help I learned to go out there a lot more sure of 
myself. . . . He was primarily the reason I am here." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hernandez, the road to Miami was a circuitous route. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stellar three-year stint at Northridge, where he won 21 games and 
still holds the school's career record for games started with 43, Hernandez was 
drafted by St. Louis in the second round of the 1987 draft. He was traded to 
the Padres two years later and played for their minor league teams in Wichita, 
Kan., and Las Vegas, where he was converted into a reliever, before sticking 
with the big club in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 His career never flourished with the Padres and after going to Cleveland for 
what Hernandez thought would be a better opportunity, he finds himself in his 
third major league city in three years. But Hernandez prefers to accentuate the 
good things about his recent switch of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have to look at things in a positive way," Hernandez said. "Like 
(Marlin team psychologist) Harvey Dorfman says, 'You take what happened to you 
the day before, learn from it and get rid of it. You take what you need from 
it.' There's no sense in dwelling on that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez says he likes playing with the Marlins but prefers to make his 
permanent home elsewhere, where there is less commotion. He lives in the 
off-season with his wife, Sandra, and three children -- 5-year-old son Finlan, 
13-month-old daughter Dallas and newborn son Dakota -- in Yuma, Ariz., but is 
anticipating a move to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like smaller towns," said the soft-spoken Hernandez, who was born in 
Burbank. "I like to spend time with my family and I like quiet places. We 
haven't decided where to live. We are looking for a place where the pressures 
of life are not so big." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure of close ballgames can't be avoided, however -- not even after 
Harvey is healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan is not going to come back 100% right away, so there will be other times 
when I'll go to Jeremy in a save situation," Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility appeals to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll bring (Harvey) in slowly, but they'll have people warming up behind 
him," Hernandez said. "It means that we could have a one-two punch."

DIGEST: KLEIN CAPTURES NCAA GOLF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emilee Klein survived an early string of bogeys to shoot a final-round 
one-over-par 74 to win the NCAA women's golf championship Saturday by two 
strokes over Arizona State teammate Wendy Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, a former Notre Dame High standout, completed four trips around a hilly, 
wet and windy West Linn, Ore., course at six-under-par 286. Arizona State won 
the team title with a score of 1,189 -- 16 shots ahead of second-place USC. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Heidi Voorhees, another former Notre Dame High player, shot a 
nine-over-par 82 to finish in a tie for 16th place at 306. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, a 19-year-old sophomore, started the day with a two-stroke lead over 
Ward and Furman junior Caroline Peek. It evaporated quickly. She had a bogey on 
the first hole, a double bogey on the third and a bogey on the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to pump myself back up," Klein said. "If you have a one-hole 
turnaround, it makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The early trouble temporarily dropped her two shots behind Ward, but she 
recovered fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein had birdies on five and six. She had pars the rest of the way, except 
for the 131-yard 12th, where she hit a 6-iron three feet from the cup and made 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, a junior, was only one shot back heading to 17, but she three-putted for 
a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein expects to play in several tournaments this summer, including the U.S. 
Women's Amateur, before turning pro. Baseball

 Montclair Prep baseball Coach Walt Steele, who led the Mounties to Southern 
Section championships in 1990 and 1991, said he would like to resign so he 
could pursue a master's degree, but it's not official yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like this to be the last year," Steele said, "but I have to sit down with 
(Athletic Director) Greg Reece and (Principal) (Vernon) Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties were eliminated from the Division IV playoffs Friday with a 6-5 
loss to San Marino. Steele, 37, has coached Montclair Prep since 1988.

 Harvard-Westlake High catcher Jon Schaeffer has been selected as one of 64 
baseball players to participate in the U.S. Olympic Festival, July 1-10 in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer, who has signed to play college baseball at Stanford, finished his 
senior season with a .474 average, six home runs and 29 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth shortstop Bryan LaCour, also a Stanford signee, will be one of 
Schaeffer's teammates for the West team at the Festival. JEFF FLETCHER

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; UCLA WORKS WAY BACK TO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The power pitching of DeeDee Weiman and 22 hits in two games made the long 
road back easy for UCLA Saturday, as the Bruins scored blowout victories over 
Illinois Chicago and Utah to advance to today's semifinal round of the Women's 
College World Series at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a first-round loss to Fresno State on Thursday, UCLA had to work 
its way back through the losers' bracket for the first time in 12 national 
championship appearances.The Bruins, however, did not find that a problem, 
beating Illinois Chicago, 9-0, in five innings, and then Utah, 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've been waiting for this day all year," said UCLA shortstop Nicole 
Odom, who went three for six with three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (43-13) will face Arizona (62-3) today at 10 a.m. PDT in a semifinal 
game. The Bruins need to beat top-ranked Arizona twice to advance to Monday's 
championship game. In the other semifinal, unbeaten Cal State Northridge (51-8) 
faces Oklahoma State (45-11) at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Chicago (56-19-1) didn't put up much of a fight in the Bruins' first 
game of the day. Weiman and B'Ann Burns combined on a no-hitter that was called 
after five innings because of a mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Utah (51-13), the Bruins got 12 hits in support of starter Weiman 
(21-8). Burns faced four batters in relief in the sixth and gave up three hits, 
a walk and an earned run before Weiman returned to strike out the side on 11 
pitches. Weiman gave up two hits and struck out 14.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; WORK THE CROWD BREAKS RECORD IN HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Successful in seven of her first 12 starts while based in northern California, 
Work The Crowd showed she belongs in this part of the state at Hollywood Park 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lead every step of the way in the $109,700 Honeymoon Handicap, the 
3-year-old Political Ambition filly won by eight lengths in stakes-record time 
of 1:39 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. Hot Option set the old record of 1:40 1/5 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden for the first time by Chris McCarron, Work The Crowd paid $18 and is 
now perfect in two starts on the grass. Her task was made easier when 
Rabiadella, the only other front-runner in the race, was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of options with her up north," trainer Greg Gilchrist said. "I 
told Chris not to take a whole lot of hold of her, that she was really a 
free-running filly. She bounced away from there running and at the half-mile 
pole, I knew we were in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 A length in front after a 1:10 2/5 six furlongs, Work The Crowd pulled away 
when asked by McCarron and covered the last sixteenth of a mile in 6 1/5 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a real good turn of foot, too, when I asked her to run," McCarron 
said. "She didn't surprise me in that she won, but it did surprise me how 
easily she won. She got tested for a little more class today, but she passed 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Runner-up Malli Star, making her first start in California after winning four 
of six on the turf in Florida, finished a length ahead of Fancy 'N Fabulous. 
Dancing Mirage, unbeaten in two tries and making her stakes and turf debut, was 
fifth as the 9-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the reason, but today she kind of got off the bridle down the 
backside," jockey Chris Antley said of Dancing Mirage. "So, I had to nudge on 
her earlier than I should have. I guess we'll have to regroup and come again." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board issued complaints against three more 
trainers Saturday for positive tests for the prohibited drug scopolamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mandella, who had an earlier positive for Water Prospector, had 
another with Wildly Joyous, who broke his maiden at first asking on April 8 at 
Santa Anita. The original positive was reported by Truesdail Laboratories and 
it was confirmed in a split sample at Ohio State. A hearing is scheduled before 
the Hollywood Park stewards on June 18-19. 
</P>
<P>
 The other trainers who were issued complaints were Lewis Cenicola and Bill 
Shoemaker. Unprectible Gal, trained by Cenicola, tested positive after 
finishing second in the fourth race on April 6 and his hearing is scheduled for 
June 25.

DORNAN PUSHES TO DISCHARGE SERVICE MEMBERS WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A battle is shaping up in the House of Representatives over a provision that 
would immediately discharge from the military anyone infected with the AIDS 
virus or whose duties are restricted by other medical ailments such as heart 
disease, cancer, asthma or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement, included as an amendment to the annual defense appropriations 
bill, was introduced by Orange County Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
and approved by the House Armed Services Committee this month in what was 
described as a hurried vote preceded by little discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed by the House and Senate, the provision could lead to the immediate 
discharge of more than 3,500 members of the military -- a small fraction of the 
nation's 1.7-million force -- who are classified as "non-worldwide assignable," 
meaning their medical conditions restrict where and how they can be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we afford to retain those who cannot perform all military duties?" 
said Dornan, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a staunch 
conservative. He contended that in these times of military downsizing, every 
soldier and sailor must be fully useful. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment is a long way from becoming law, and formidable opposition to it 
is already taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon itself is against it, contending that the number of chronically 
ill service members with restricted assignments is so small that it poses no 
threat to military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on record opposing Dornan's plan are the AIDS Action Council, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Assn. and the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) is prepared to introduce after the 
Memorial Day recess language that would undercut the Dornan amendment, although 
it would stop short of killing it outright. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have served ably and may still be fit to serve, and putting them in 
a desk job where they can use their training seems more appropriate than 
forcing them out," said Harman, also an Armed Services Committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 The current practice of finding appropriate jobs for the military's 
chronically ill was instituted under President Ronald Reagan, when the advent 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome forced the military to forge a policy on 
what to do with infected service members. It evolved to include other 
chronically ill members as well, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan's amendment would require discharge of those service members, unless 
the condition was sustained in the line of duty or the service member possesses 
a skill considered of value to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan contends that restricted assignments are unwise in an era of dwindling 
defense resources in which every member of the ranks should be militarily 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan estimates that immediate discharge would save the military about $3.5 
million a year in hospital costs. He also said it would relieve healthy service 
members of the burden of taking assignments that cannot be filled by those with 
medical ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 "By sticking a dirty needle in his arm, he has broken the law," Dornan said, 
arguing that most service members who have tested positive for the AIDS virus 
are drug users. "It's unfair to keep a person in who can't go into a combat 
unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the amendment is an attempt to discriminate against the 
chronically ill, particularly those infected with the AIDS virus, and note that 
it was brought by a congressman who for years has been harshly critical of 
gays. About 40% of service members restricted by medical conditions are 
HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly pure Dornan, someone so obsessed with hatred of gay people he 
will run roughshod over every principle of fairness . . . even when it means 
attacking people who are serving their country and who the military itself 
regards as perfectly fit to serve," said Evan Wolfson, senior staff lawyer at 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York-based gay-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general policy set forth in the Americans With Disabilities Act is that 
people who can do the job should not be penalized. . . . That's a better 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman expressed surprise that the idea progressed this far, saying the House 
Armed Services Committee passed it on a harried May 5 vote. Committee members 
were being summoned to the House floor for roll call votes that day and were 
distracted when they approved Dornan's plan by a voice vote that Harman, also a 
committee member, said she believes to have been ill-considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was very little conversation," Harman said. "I think they did not know 
what they were voting on." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman is preparing to introduce a counter amendment that would undercut 
Dornan's; the Harman language would give the Pentagon leeway to do what it does 
now -- avoid discharge entirely by concluding that restricted service members 
pose no threat to the military's ability to carry out its mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Some civil rights groups expressed worry that Harman's amendment does not go 
far enough and say that they would like to see any reference to discharge 
stricken. But House observers said the odds of killing the language outright 
are slim.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PERRY'S STEADY HAND STANDS OUT ON FOREIGN POLICY TEAM; PENTAGON: 
ONCE DISMISSED AS A TECHNOCRAT, THE DEFENSE SECRETARY NOW COMMANDS RESPECT FOR 
HIS QUIET EFFECTIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's foreign policy difficulties may be igniting wide criticism 
of his national security team, but at least one top official is escaping most 
of the heat: Defense Secretary William J. Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four months, the soft-spoken former mathematics professor has 
emerged as one of the Administration's few pleasant surprises in the foreign 
policy arena. Besides getting a grip on the Pentagon's sprawling bureaucracy -- 
and gaining the respect of the military -- Perry, 66, has become a quiet but 
important player in the Administration's foreign policy apparatus, gradually 
winning plaudits from the Administration and its critics alike. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Perry, for example, who helped hone the Administration's proposal to 
launch air strikes in Bosnia -- limiting the enforcement to a small exclusion 
zone that NATO forces could handle easily. He was the Administration's point 
man in engineering a nuclear weapons disarmament treaty between Russia and 
Ukraine. More recently, he has become its chief spokesman in the stalemate with 
North Korea over nuclear weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 With few glitches along the way, Perry "is dealing with the problems he's got 
as well as anyone can be expected to," said Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon 
military strategist who has been a frequent critic of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing that opinion is Harold Brown, who served as defense secretary during 
the Jimmy Carter Administration. "Is he going to solve all of their problems? I 
think the answer is no," Brown said. "But he has done very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, at least part of Perry's overnight rise may have come by default. 
By some outside assessments, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has proved a 
capable negotiator but not a strategic thinker, and National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake has been so low-key that he has failed to enunciate the 
Administration's policies clearly. Perry is known as a problem-solver, and he 
explains issues articulately and directly. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also benefited from the inevitable comparisons to his predecessor, Les 
Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin's plans to inject the Pentagon into formulating broad foreign policy 
brought him into conflict with the State Department and the National Security 
Council. His frequent public ruminating about policy options, and his 
accompanying gaffes, heightened the perception that the Administration was in 
disarray. And his manipulative style alienated many in Congress and the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Perry is demonstrating himself to be a no-nonsense pragmatist who 
is quick to make decisions and has an impressive command of detail. Invariably 
straightforward, he has restored good relations with military leaders and 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the complete confidence of the military -- he's frank," said Rep. John 
P. Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on 
defense. "I think he's doing a commendable job." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say he has quietly brought order out of the previous managerial chaos. 
"Perry is nothing that Aspin was, and everything that Aspin wasn't," one 
Pentagon-watcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has confined himself to the defense secretary's traditional role of 
running the nation's military Establishment and finding ways to make it serve 
the President's foreign policy objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes that means squelching a proposal that seems unrealistically 
ambitious. For instance, Administration officials say he recently nipped a 
campaign to mount an invasion of Haiti by publicly questioning what the United 
States would do once its troops took over the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is less active in debates on foreign policy issues where the military 
isn't likely to play a major role, the officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, insiders say, if Perry sees problems with a particular Administration 
proposal, he counters with an alternative crafted to meet the same goal, as was 
true with the Bosnia exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary has used his influence in other ways as well. Acting on a 
conviction that the public must be prepared for a possible outbreak of 
hostilities by North Korea, Perry took it on himself to warn about the risks 
that a possible military confrontation would bring. Washington and Pyongyang 
both got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Perry's four months as secretary have not been entirely 
error-free. In an appearance on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" program in early 
April, he set off a major brouhaha by inadvertently leaving the impression that 
the United States would sit by and let the Bosnian Serbs storm the Muslim city 
of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 While Perry was technically correct in his explanation of the Administration's 
policy, he said he did not anticipate how it sounded or would be interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 And a few weeks ago, he provoked a similar flurry over Haiti when he suggested 
there were preliminary indications that its military strongman, Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, was about to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The political and diplomatic ripples from that incident caused some 
consternation in the State Department, but so far Perry seems to have recovered 
successfully, vowing to become more careful in his statements to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in a recent interview about his comments on NBC, Perry said: "I have to 
take a certain part of the responsibility, first of all for not understanding 
that (the) statement standing by itself could be misinterpreted, and (for) not 
catching it quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lessons I've drawn from that," he said wryly, "is when I make a direct, 
flat statement of that sort, to put the qualifiers in the same statement, not 
in the next paragraph." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is anything but shy about reshuffling things. Within days after taking 
the helm at the Pentagon, Perry jettisoned three of Aspin's most contentious 
appointees and dismantled his predecessor's controversial in-house think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, he has little time for small talk. Pentagon aides say Perry-led 
meetings typically are over in 30 minutes. The really big sessions last no more 
than an hour, and decisions almost invariably come soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is a certain aloofness about Perry that unsettles some who remember 
Aspin's more informal style. There is little evidence of a Perry sense of 
humor, and he can be so poker-faced in discussions that some insiders find him 
almost inscrutable. 
</P>
<P>
 With a long career in the defense industry -- he is known as the godfather of 
the Stealth bomber -- and a background in U.S.-Soviet strategy, high-tech 
weapons and defense-industry problems, Perry said he has already set a firm 
agenda: to keep the world from drifting back into a Cold War, to develop a new 
approach for using U.S. military power in the post-Cold War world and to manage 
the reduction in the size of the nation's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will measure myself" by these goals "when I leave the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics concede he has made a good start on the first of these, forging and 
cementing ties with former Soviet Bloc military leaders, helping achieve an 
accord with Russia and Ukraine to dismantle their nuclear weapons, and pressing 
the Administration's new Partnership for Peace program in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 He has begun work on his second objective by creating half a dozen new task 
forces within the Pentagon to study proposals for altering the way the United 
States uses military power. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third, he has begun efforts to streamline the way the Pentagon buys 
equipment and weapons systems. He has also sought to ease the impact of 
military downsizing on the nation's defense industries base by eliminating 
excess regulations and preserving some programs in order to keep production 
lines open. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Krepinevich, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan 
research firm in Washington, predicts that Perry's most serious test may come 
when the rapidly shrinking defense budget begins to force the Administration 
into making some major choices about what kind of military it really wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If present trends hold, the seams are going to come apart," Krepinevich said. 
"We'll see what Perry is made of then." 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Perry's long ties with the defense Establishment, aides say he is 
thoroughly comfortable with Clinton's current foreign policies. Although 
frustrated at times because he cannot move things along more rapidly, he agrees 
with Clinton on most major issues. A liberal on social issues, he also backs 
Clinton's decisions to crack down on sexual harassment and discrimination 
against gays in the military -- although he has kept a low profile on both 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's success is somewhat surprising given that he was hardly Clinton's 
favorite for the job. Dismissed earlier as a technocrat, he initially was 
passed up for Aspin, who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aspin resigned in December of last year, Clinton picked Adm. Bobby Ray 
Inman, who embarrassingly removed himself from contention after a short time. 
It was then that Perry's name came up seriously -- as a safe, if unspectacular, 
choice. Clinton went along, but with little evident enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, there are few in the Administration who believe that Clinton 
has settled for a second-rater in the office. If anything, even Perry has been 
amazed at the pace of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a damn exciting (four) months." he said. "It seems like there's 
been a crisis a week ever since I got into the job."

ROSTENKOWSKI SIGNALS HE WILL FIGHT; CONGRESS: BARRING A LAST-MINUTE SHIFT, 
PROSECUTORS COULD SEEK GRAND JURY INDICTMENT THIS WEEK ON CORRUPTION CHARGES. 
ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT COULD GET TRIAL DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) has signaled that he intends to reject any plea 
bargain and vigorously contest anticipated charges that he abused his office by 
diverting public money for personal use, associates of the powerful lawmaker 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Rostenkowski should have a last-minute change of mind, federal 
prosecutors are expected to seek a grand jury indictment early this week, 
possibly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not giving up, he's going to fight it," one associate said of the 
18-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources said Rostenkowski is reluctant to resign from Congress, which 
acceptance of a plea agreement would involve, and admit to a series of felonies 
that would permanently scar a Capitol Hill career of more than 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one tough, determined guy," another friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Rostenkowski said Saturday that he had no immediate comment on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal sources, an indictment is likely to allege that 
Rostenkowski defrauded taxpayers of thousands of dollars through both his 
Washington and Chicago offices. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum would include cash he allegedly received improperly from the House 
post office in transactions disguised as stamp purchases, and government funds 
misused to buy furniture and gifts for friends and constituents, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once indicted, Rostenkowski, 66, would have to step down as chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee under House Democratic rules, but he still could 
remain as a member of the tax-writing panel, which has been considering 
President Clinton's health care plan. If he were acquitted of the charges, he 
could then regain his chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's lawyers have advised him that a plea agreement would enable him 
to avoid the humiliation of a public trial and the prospect of conviction and a 
prison sentence longer than the one-year term understood to be part of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rostenkowski, who is represented chiefly by Robert S. Bennett, one of 
Washington's most skilled defense attorneys, probably could force a delay of 
any trial until after the congressional elections in November, legal sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision to contest the anticipated charges, pending a change of heart, 
scuttles three weeks of intensive negotiations between Bennett and U.S. Atty. 
Eric H. Holder Jr., a Clinton Administration appointee who inherited the 
two-year investigation last fall from his Republican predecessor, Jay B. 
Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said Rostenkowski, while rejecting various proposals offered by 
Holder in recent weeks to settle the case with a guilty plea, has not yet 
authorized Bennett to abandon the talks totally. "But this undoubtedly will 
happen by Tuesday," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal official close to the prosecution said Holder, in fact, is ruling 
out an eleventh-hour change of mind by Rostenkowski and is putting the 
finishing touches on an indictment to present to a grand jury after the 
Memorial Day holiday. The official said negotiations "are at a standstill." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Holder has been given full authority to proceed with the case as 
he sees fit without intervention by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno or high-ranking 
Justice Department aides. Holder sent an outline of the proposed charges to the 
Justice Department late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 An indictment of Rostenkowski likely would include allegations that he: 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegally converted stamps to cash for his personal use through the House 
post office between 1985 and 1991. Former House Postmaster Robert V. Rota, who 
pleaded guilty to charges last July and would be a key trial witness for the 
prosecution, has alleged that he improperly transferred $21,000 to 
Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 * Misused official funds to buy expensive gifts for friends from the House 
office-supply service. In an admission of wrongdoing, Rostenkowski has already 
reimbursed Congress about $82,000 for office supplies purchased by his office 
over a period of six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Converted government-leased autos to his personal ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improperly used government funds to pay a number of so-called ghost 
employees who performed no official work. 
</P>
<P>
 Removal of Rostenkowski from the Ways and Means chairmanship, which he has 
held since 1981, would harm efforts to approve Clinton's health care reform 
plan. The massive proposal is running into difficulty in other House 
committees, and Rostenkowski's legendary power was expected to boost its 
prospects in the Ways and Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Democrat could, however, still exert a measure of influence on 
the legislation by remaining on the committee. Such an arrangement might seem 
odd, but there is precedent: Wilbur Mills yielded the chairmanship of the Ways 
and Means Committee in the mid-1970s after publicity about his antics with a 
stripper, but he remained on the panel as a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Rostenkowski's replacement as chairman has centered on Rep. 
Sam Gibbons of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the panel. But with Gibbons 
considered more informed on trade matters than health care reform, Rep. Robert 
T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), another senior committee member and a Rostenkowski 
loyalist, may challenge Gibbons for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 If that should happen, Reps. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) and Charles B. Rangel 
(D-N.Y.), both of whom are senior to Matsui, also might seek the job, according 
to congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In contesting an indictment in court, Rostenkowski would be playing a 
high-stakes game that automatically could result in a lengthy prison term if he 
were convicted, regardless of the sympathies of a sentencing judge. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a fraud conviction involving a loss of more than $200,000, 
federal sentencing guidelines call for a term of 15 months to 21 months for a 
defendant with no prior criminal history, as would be the case with 
Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loss is judged to be smaller -- for example, between $70,000 and 
$120,000 -- the sentence would range from 10 months to 16 months. However, in a 
fraud conviction involving abuse of a position of public or private trust, as 
would apply to a member of Congress, the guidelines call for automatically 
increasing the period of incarceration by five months.

THE TIMES POLL; VOTERS BACK SERVICE CUTS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California voters have little knowledge of the array of ballot measures 
awaiting them on primary day, but they broadly support the controversial 
anti-immigration initiative that will likely be on the November ballot, the Los 
Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "Save Our State" initiative -- which would bar illegal immigrant 
children from public schools, exclude illegal immigrants from all but emergency 
medical care and require state agencies to report them to the attorney general 
-- was leading by a substantial 59%-32% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking down reaction along ethnic lines, the poll found that almost 
three-fifths of Latinos opposed the measure and blacks also opposed it by a 
narrow margin. But whites overwhelmingly favored it, 64% to 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Along ideological lines, support for the initiative was broad. All voter 
groups except liberals favored it, and even among liberals the verdict was 
split. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reaches out from a conservative Republican core to the more moderate and 
independent parts of the electorate," said Times Poll director John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 In other prospective November measures, voters disapproved of a statewide 
single-payer medical plan and were divided over whether to set a statewide 
smoking standard that would overrule tougher local anti-smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll was based on interviews with a total of 1,471 registered 
voters, questioned May 21-25. Because of the length of the poll -- which also 
surveyed opinions on the state political races and other issues -- half were 
asked about the propositions on the June ballot and half were queried about the 
likely November measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The sampling error for the June propositions, which focused on likely voters, 
was 6 points in either direction. The sampling error for November issues, which 
focused on all registered voters, was 4 points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking finding about the June propositions -- which voters will 
decide on in nine days -- is how little they know about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that most of the likely June voters could not say how they felt 
about each of the proposals without having them explained. When the measures 
were explained, three large bond issues were winning -- a $2-billion earthquake 
retrofitting act, a $1-billion measure to improve safety and construction at 
public schools, and a $900,000 act to upgrade colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake retrofitting measure was passing by a 53%-27% margin, the 
school safety issue was more popular, with a 59%-30% margin, and the college 
upgrading effort was winning 53% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Two were losing. Proposition 175, which would re-establish a renter's income 
tax credit, was failing by a 48%-41% margin among likely voters, and 
Proposition 180, which would approve $2 billion in bonds to buy parklands and 
wildlife areas, was losing 49% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, the cost of the losing issues was listed on the ballot 
description; the costs of the winning issues were not. The state estimates that 
the renter's credit would cost about $100 million in 1995 and 1996. The 
parklands statute could cost $3.6 billion over the life of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake bonds have no fiscal estimates listed on the ballot because the 
Legislature ordered specific wording. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Poll director Brennan said that voters, aware of the financial troubles 
facing the state, are clearly concerned about the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being asked to put out billions and billions in bonds," Brennan 
said. "There's a possibility that people are going to set priorities. . . . 
These bond issues are competing with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 While those issues were foundering anonymously, voters were far more 
opinionated about the hot-button measures likely to be on the November ballot. 
State officials have until June 30 to determine which of the initiatives 
qualify for the ballot -- a distinction that requires 424,000 valid voter 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-immigration measure is being spearheaded by Alan Nelson, the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service chief under President Ronald Reagan, and 
Harold Ezell, head of the INS' western region from 1983-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters argue that the initiative would stem the flow of illegal 
immigration by denying social services to those without the proper papers. 
Opponents counter that immigrants are drawn by jobs, not social programs, and 
that the initiative would divide an already fractious state. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson last week indicated that he favored the initiative, while all 
three of the Democratic challengers for governor -- state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden -- 
oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that Wilson could extract some political benefit from his 
support of the measure. It is favored by majorities of independents, moderates, 
whites, the elderly and women -- all groups Wilson must court aggressively in 
the fall if he is to win. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the governor has been making an issue of illegal immigration for a 
year now, and may have already gained as many votes as he is capable of 
attracting on this issue, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographically, the initiative was strongly supported by registered voters in 
Southern California -- 55% in Los Angeles County -- and was opposed only by 
those living in the more liberal San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to place a smoking initiative on November's ballot is being 
shepherded by forces who oppose the 270 local smoking restrictions that have 
popped up in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Times Poll, voters were divided about whether to create a 
statewide standard that would supersede local laws. Forty-five percent backed 
the idea, 49% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment was running 54% to 34% against imposing a statewide, single-payer 
health plan that would replace Medicare, Medi-Cal and the network of private 
insurers. The plan would be administered by the state, and financed by a 
$1-a-pack cigarette tax and increases in income taxes and payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said the proposal won the support of younger voters, ages 18-29, who 
generally fall into the category of those who do not use -- and in many cases 
do not have -- health insurance. But older voters, who tend to have insurance, 
did not want to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you get into middle-class people, it turns around and they are 
against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times survey showed that Californians remain greatly concerned about the 
state's economy, and that only one in four believes the state is headed in the 
right direction. Wilson took the brunt of that discontent, with only 38% 
approving of the way he is handling his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in contrast, won the approval of 47%, and President 
Clinton -- now the state's most popular politician -- was approved of by 55%, 
virtually the same as in a March poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was not quite at the bottom of the barrel, however. The California 
Legislature retains that position, with only 27% of registered voters approving 
its performance. The figure was about the same the last time it was measured, 
in October. In the same time span, the percentage of people who disapprove of 
the Legislature has risen, from 43% to 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Californians overwhelmingly condemned the salary increase -- 
recently approved by a state compensation commission -- that would boost a 
legislator's pay from $52,500 to $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost four of every five registered voters -- 78% -- opposed the raise, while 
11% supported it. More than two-thirds of the foes characterized their views as 
"strongly" in opposition. 
</P>

offices. Today, The Times offers a ballot guide. Part B 
</P>
<P>
 (Orange County Edition, A1) Voters will soon choose candidates for governor, 
U.S. Senate, statewide and Orange County offices. Today, in Section V, The 
Times offers a balloting guide. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,984 California adults including 1,471 registered 
voters, by telephone, from May 21 through Wednesday. Telephone numbers were 
chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing 
techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. 
Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. The sample is weighted 
slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age and education. The 
margin of sampling error for the total adult and registered voter samples is 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. About 735 of the registered voters were 
asked about the November ballot propositions, and 374 likely voters were asked 
about the June 7 initiatives. The error margins for those samples are 4 points 
and 6 points respectively. For certain other subgroups the error margin will 
vary. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question 
wording and the order in which questions are presented. THE TIMES POLL /

MARCHERS ASSAIL BIAS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Latinos marched through Downtown Los Angeles on Saturday in a 
tightly organized counterattack on what participants called a growing sentiment 
in California and the nation against immigrants -- both legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many legislators in California and elsewhere say illegal 
immigration is draining government treasuries, the marchers -- estimated at 
8,000 to 25,000 -- voiced the hope that their effort would galvanize a movement 
to defend the new immigrants who have altered the nation's demographic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters in the march, one of Los Angeles' largest demonstrations in recent 
years, emphasized the contributions of legal and unlawful newcomers in paying 
taxes, performing low-wage jobs, launching businesses and revitalizing 
inner-city communities from Los Angeles to New York. They pledged to reverse 
what they acknowledged is a legislative tide against immigration and to avert 
further defeats in the political and legislative arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to put an end to the big lie propagated by all those who use 
immigrants for political expediency," said Roberto Lovato, executive director 
of the Central American Resource Center in the city's Pico-Union district, a 
densely populated immigrant enclave west of Downtown. "This is a civil rights 
movement for the 1990s," Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to show support for my people," said Maria Rodriguez, 40, a 
Mexican citizen who was accompanied by her 2- and 5-year-old sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police estimated that 8,000 made the well-coordinated, two-mile trek 
up Broadway, which culminated in a rally on the west steps of City Hall, 
organizers said 25,000 took part. Latino groups, immigrant advocates and 
Spanish-language media had promoted the march in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no arrests and no major disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 A bulging line of marchers, many waving Mexican and Salvadoran flags and led 
by a red-lettered banner reading "Stop Racist Attacks Against Immigrants," 
filled 10 blocks along Broadway, where ground-level stores cater to Latino 
shoppers. Festive participants hoisted colorful placards and banners, their 
rhythmic chants echoing off the grimy facades of once-elegant office buildings 
lining the boulevard. A few men donned broad-brimmed Mexican sombreros. A band 
from Tijuana, its members outfitted in green fatigues, provided a steady 
drumbeat of marching music. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal target of the march was Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made illegal 
immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, using ominous television 
advertisements showing people rushing across the U.S.-Mexico border. Banners 
and slogans excoriated the governor, whose stuffed figure was burned in effigy 
in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson and others seeking to limit immigrants have attempted to 
distinguish between their opposition to unlawful immigration and their support 
of regulated legal immigration, marchers contended that the governor and his 
allies are fomenting antipathy against all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The backlash against immigrants becomes anti-Latino sentiment," said Susan 
Alva, staff attorney with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many banners said: "No Human Being Is Illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The politicians are happy to have my people here working, but they don't want 
us to have any rights," said Jasmin Aguilar, a U.S.-born college student and 
daughter of immigrants who held up an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the 
revered Roman Catholic patroness of Mexico and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants included immigrants and U.S. natives, the documented and 
undocumented, the elderly and young. Activists, politicians, clerics and 
ordinary working people were part of the mix. The prevalent mood was one of 
ethnic pride spiced with outrage at what many view as a racially motivated 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church cannot remain silent while its people are made victims," said 
Father Vicente Lopez of St. Rafael's Roman Catholic Church in South-Central Los 
Angeles, one of four Carmelite priests in flowing brown cassocks who marched at 
the head of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The orderly marchers took their cues from several dozen organizers with 
bullhorns who guided the entourage. It took nearly an hour for the throng to 
fill City Hall's park and adjoining 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was largely a Latino event -- reflecting Latinos' position as 
the largest immigrant population in California -- speakers also voiced support 
for Haitian refugees who have been denied entry to U.S. territory. And Asian 
Americans also joined in assailing what many characterized as making immigrants 
the scapegoat for the nation's many woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We people of color are being blamed for a socioeconomic crisis in this 
country," said Fernando Fernando, a representative of Los Angeles' large 
Filipino American community, who was among the many speakers addressing the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Many urged immigrants to sign up for citizenship, a step strongly 
nationalistic Mexican immigrants have traditionally been hesitant to take. U.S. 
authorities have vowed to bolster citizenship programs in an effort to ease an 
expected crush of applications. More than 3 million foreigners -- more than 
half living in California -- obtained legal residency via the federal amnesty 
initiative of 1987-88; most are only now becoming eligible for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must become citizens and vote so that our voices can be heard," said 
Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the anti-Wilson sentiment, vendors hawked T-shirts that featured 
the governor with his neck in a noose. One person carried a figure of a 
skeleton hung, crucifix-style, from crossing M-16 rifles. It bore a banner 
stating: "Made by Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's march, while garnering media attention, is unlikely to alter the 
increasingly heated public debate about immigration, according to those seeking 
reductions on immigration. Washington and Sacramento are awash in proposed 
bills that would cut legal entries and exclude benefits for those who are in 
the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite clear that the American people feel there is too much 
immigration," said Ira Mehlman, Los Angeles representative for the Federation 
for American Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest comes as a citizens group is pushing an initiative -- probably for 
the November ballot -- that would deny public education and most health care to 
California's large undocumented population. An initiative strategist said the 
march would paradoxically boost the cause, publicizing efforts to reduce 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would advise 'em to have a march every month," said Harold Ezell, a former 
Immigration and Naturalization Service official who is one of the initiative's 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, organizers say they plan to schedule similar demonstrations, 
including at least one more before the November election, which some political 
observers see as a referendum of sorts on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event was sponsored by a statewide network of civil rights and 
immigrant advocacy groups including the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, and the 
Central American Refugee Center and One Stop Immigration. Among the 
participants were Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneous protests were held in Sacramento, San Diego, Fresno, San Jose and 
Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the loudest applause in the Los Angeles rally erupted as speakers 
called for a 1996 march on Washington as a national demonstration of support 
for Latino rights. Organizers of Saturday's event compared the idea to the 1963 
march on Washington, and said such a demonstration could illuminate the plight 
of immigrants, particularly those from Latin America.

RWANDAN DEAD GLUT THE WATERS OF LAKE VICTORIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is where their journey ends, far from home, their bodies carried by the 
Kagera River out of Rwanda and into Africa's greatest lake, Victoria, to be 
caught like perch by peasant fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 They have traveled more than 100 miles, over thundering falls and along 
fertile savannas, by the time the Kagera rages into Lake Victoria at Kasensero. 
It is near that little town that Jamil Kakora waits each morning, his boat 
loaded with plastic bags instead of fishing tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he and his five-man crew returned to shore about noon Saturday, a 
ghastly collection of limbs and torsos filled the boat. The fishermen, donning 
masks and gloves, worked quickly to wrap and tie the bodies, never sure what 
parts belonged together, and to load them into the trailer of a red tractor 
parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard about the war on the radio," Kakora said, "so we knew the bodies 
were coming. We had a meeting in the village and agreed: You cannot leave these 
people to just float in the lake. Even if they died like dogs in Rwanda, they 
deserve to be buried like humans. We all said yes, this is something we must 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 40,000 bodies, relief specialists say, have washed into this giant 
lake that provides an abundance of Nile perch and tilapia for fish markets from 
Kampala, Uganda, to London, as well as drinking water for scores of primitive 
villages scattered along its shores. Some corpses are washed by the currents 
onto the coast; others float just below the surface hundreds of yards offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the victims of the most extensive massacre in modern Africa's 
post-independence history appear to be women and children. Some who reach Lake 
Victoria apparently were beheaded. Others' arms were tied behind their backs. 
One cluster of infants washed downstream in a tied sack. Three others were 
joined by a single pointed stick thrust through their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
 International aid workers estimate that between 200,000 and 500,000 people 
have been killed in Rwanda since the country's president died in a mysterious 
plane crash April 6, and Hutu-dominated government troops and militiamen began 
an orgy of murder, primarily against members of the minority Tutsi tribe. Two 
million Rwandans have fled across the border to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kenya has dismissed any threat from the decomposing bodies to its 
portion of Lake Victoria, Uganda has told its people not to drink the lake's 
water until further tests are made and to boil all fish taken from Victoria for 
at least 30 minutes. Health officials also are concerned that cholera could be 
spread by the flies that descend in thick swarms on the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bodies the villagers pulled from the lake were buried in shallow 
graves a few yards from the shore. They were dug up by dogs and pigs and lay 
uncovered for several days, along with the rubbish and human waste that the 
people of Malembo routinely deposit at the water's edge. Health officials 
feared an outbreak of disease could result. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision, a U.S. relief and development agency, was already active in the 
region when the bodies began pouring into Lake Victoria. Its work dealt 
primarily with 160,000 children orphaned in the region by AIDS -- the leading 
cause of death in rural Uganda. With the new crisis, its staff, in coordination 
with government officials, put together an emergency plan to clear Lake 
Victoria of bodies and bury the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Malembo is tucked away on the shoreline swamps of the Nassara Plain, 20 miles 
from any road other than a footpath. The village has no running water or 
electricity, and most of the 800 inhabitants have concerns other than examining 
the daily cargo of the body-hunting fishermen who are paid $6 a day by World 
Vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful were on the shore Saturday as the tractor's trailer began to 
fill with bodies. John Marembo, who is the local defense secretary and also the 
village's record-keeper, stood by the tractor, dutifully recording in his 
notebook the number of bodies retrieved for the day: 18, 19, 20. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Each victim was marked on his pad under a column labeled "Arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is awful enough that Rwanda should have a war like this," Marembo said. 
"It is also very bad they should give us their litter from the war." 
</P>
<P>
 When the trailer was full, a barefoot man climbed onto the tractor and headed 
back into the thick bush, chickens and goats fleeing his approach. He drove to 
a dusty clearing a mile away, a mass grave site bought from a local farmer for 
$80. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Kasozi and John Kastunga waited there, shirtless and sweating in the 
fierce sun. Along with five others, they had dug a huge grave, as long and high 
as a bus. They were eating sugar cane stalks. Six other large graves shoveled 
out earlier in the week were already filled, covered with earth and marked by a 
cross of twigs lashed together by twine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasozi said he hopes he can soon return to his normal life as a fisherman. But 
that, he said, is up to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were thrown into the pit and covered with a liquid chemical, to 
become nameless wartime victims whose families will never be able to fully 
explain their fate. As the workers shoveled in earth, up the path toward the 
clearing came the village's lay priest, John Lubega. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore a cross carved from a bone around his neck and had no shoes. He was 
reciting: "Oh, Lord in heaven, help the souls of these people. They are the 
accidents of war. We ask you, please intervene and stop the war so people may 
stop dying."

COLUMN ONE; IN BOSNIA, ISLAM HAS MANY FACES; THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC'S 
TIES TO THE MUSLIM WORLD WERE ONCE TENUOUS. NOW MOSQUES ARE CROWDED, AND 
FOREIGN HELP COMES IN ALLAH'S NAME -- ALTHOUGH FOR SOME, RELIGION MAY SIMPLY BE

 Black nylon stockings and patent-leather shoes peeking out from beneath Ajla 
Nuhbegovic's tunic clash flirtatiously with her head scarf and neck-to-ankle 
garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Between licks of a dripping ice-cream cone, the enshrouded 12-year-old says 
she has every intention of wearing lipstick, eye makeup and jewelry when she's 
old enough. 
</P>
<P>
 She shrugs off what some might see as an incongruous melding of religious 
modesty and a young girl's interest in being attractive to boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have drifted too far from our religion. I think girls should dress in this 
manner, at least until they are 18," Ajla insists, contradicting her father's 
aside that she can more often be found in form-fitting leggings and sweat 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fleeting earnestness provokes a look of amused tolerance from her father, 
Hajrudin, a wry smile that suggests he thinks she is just going through a 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajla may be unevenly absorbing the religious instruction offered at the Muslim 
parochial school she has been attending for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the hardships of war and the Christian world's growing indifference 
to the plight of Bosnian Muslims, the desire to express a faith that was 
repressed here for most of this century is becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slavs whose ancestors embraced Islam during Ottoman Turkey's 500-year rule 
are increasingly searching for solace where they can find it as they continue 
to be targeted by a deadly Serbian nationalist campaign of "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 And as Western nations turn their backs on Bosnia because its conflict seems 
too complex to resolve, moderates warn that they have no choice but to grasp 
the hand of Islam as long as it remains the only one offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's streets, even in cosmopolitan Sarajevo, are traversed by growing 
numbers of women who dress with at least partial deference to Islamic 
tradition. Mosques that were mostly tourist attractions in the Communist era 
are crowded with the faithful. Muslim feasts and celebrations are now official 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Most obvious, and most worrisome for the non-Muslim majority of Bosnia, is the 
strengthening bond between this secular country in the heart of Europe and 
fundamentalist Islamic nations that have come to its aid out of sympathy for a 
people endangered because of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran has smuggled weaponry to the Bosnian government, defying a U.N. embargo 
that most Western countries concede has tied the hands of this nation's defense 
forces throughout 26 months of assault by heavily armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Libya has supplied oil when there was no money for imports. Saudi Arabia has 
bankrolled pilgrimages to Mecca for 350 invalids and war casualties. And 
Islamic warriors from Afghanistan to Algeria have flocked to Bosnia's battle 
zones to fight for Allah, perverting an already beleaguered defense effort into 
a holy war no one in Bosnia wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been waiting for two years for the West to help us defeat fascism, 
for its own interest if not for our benefit," says Osman Brka, a leader of the 
Muslim-dominated Party of Democratic Action. "We still hope against hope that 
America will see it must help us defend the democratic values we share. But we 
will look to anyone willing to help us, and no one in the West will have the 
right to blame us if they turned away." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Serbian rebellion that began in April, 1992, threw this former 
Yugoslav republic into social and economic chaos, Bosnian ties to Islam were 
tenuous at best.

<P>
 Today's 2 million Bosnian Muslims are descended from Serbs, Croats and a 
schismatic Christian sect known as the Bogomils who were repressed by both 
Catholic and Orthodox Slavs. Their forebears acquiesced to the Turkish 
conquerors' religion and mores, creating a culture through half a millennium 
distinct from that of the Serbs and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims -- or Bosnjaks, as most preferred to be called, identifying 
themselves with the territory rather than religion -- were ruled by the Turks 
until the Serbs threw off the Ottoman yoke late in the 19th Century. While 
Serbia retained its independence, Bosnia was swallowed by the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, providing the friction that led to World War I and eventual creation of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The years between the two world wars subjected the Muslims to crude 
assimilation attempts by both Serbs and Croats until Communist partisan leader 
Marshal Tito led the country to victory over Nazi Germany. During his 35-year 
rule -- arguably Eastern Europe's most benevolent dictatorship -- Tito imposed 
peace among the fractious Balkan ethnic groups through a delicate balance of 
force and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of their divergent lifestyle, Tito conferred the status of a 
nationality on Bosnian Muslims in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In the twisted rationale of propagandized Serbian nationalists, the Muslims 
have "stolen" Serbian land by taking on a separate identity. The current war in 
Bosnia is, in the eyes of the rebels, a campaign to recover territory lost when 
Serbian and other Slavic owners converted from Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 To justify their rebellion to the outside world, Bosnian Serb rebel leader 
Radovan Karadzic has repeatedly warned that the presence of Muslims here poses 
a risk of fundamentalist Islam establishing a foothold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government that gained power after 1990 elections has always 
rejected that claim as a cynical scare tactic aimed at defusing Western concern 
over the civilian slaughter and expulsion of Muslims by Serbs as they take 
territory for a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian accusations that other Balkan ethnic groups threaten them have been a 
cornerstone of the expansion plan drafted and executed by strongman Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 Exaggerated claims that Serbian lives were at risk if Croatia seceded became 
fact after Milosevic sent the Yugoslav army to seize land coveted by the Serbs 
and to expel Croats, creating a climate of hostility and a desire for revenge 
against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian propaganda has for seven years accused the Albanian majority in Kosovo 
province of plotting secession and annexation to neighboring Albania. The claim 
was ludicrous when Albania endured the most brutal Stalinist regime in Europe. 
But two years of democratic reform in Albania has coincided with intensifying 
repression of Kosovo Albanians by Serbian security forces, making union with 
Albania genuinely attractive for the Kosovo majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government and social leaders insist that theirs could never become an 
officially Islamic state. But some concede that the stronger ties to Islamic 
countries emerging as a consequence of abandonment by the West play into the 
hands of propagandists in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Muslims have never sought to live separately, and we still believe the 
best solution for Bosnia is a country that unites all three nations," said 
Husajn Smajic, the mufti of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Smajic describes Bosnia's Islamic community as unique and more heavily 
influenced by Europe than other countries with which it shares the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 War horrors and disappointment in Western indifference to the human rights 
violations committed against them have driven more Muslims to turn to their 
religion in this time of crisis, Smajic said, accounting for the visible signs 
that religious expression is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Muslim conservatives have ascended to positions of authority recently, 
stirring fears that they could become aligned with outside fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritual leader of Muslims in Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric, used the recent 
Bajram feast celebration to send the bellicose message that Muslims should be 
prepared to die to defend their country, lifestyle and religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The impression that Bosnia risks being sucked into the vortex of 
fundamentalism is enhanced by the presence of Muslim warriors who came here to 
defend the faithful only to find a secular population protective of its 
European lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Islamic fighters protected the central cities of Travnik and 
Zenica from Serbian and Croatian sieges. But the foreigners also banned the 
sale of alcoholic beverages and posted signs reminding women to cover their 
heads and limbs in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts stirred resentment among moderate Muslims and poisoned relations 
with those Croats and Serbs who had refused to join in the nationalist sieges. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a Croat-Muslim agreement in March to rebuild their alliance and create a 
new federation, bars have reopened, the signs have been taken down, and U.N. 
officials patrolling the area say the foreign warriors have mostly gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Believers were always more numerous in the rural regions of Bosnia, where even 
during the Communist era women tended to cloak their hair in brightly printed 
scarves and wear Ottoman-style floral pantaloons known as dimja . The migration 
of "ethnic cleansing" victims from the countryside to the cities has increased 
the numbers of more traditionally clad women. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the outward signs of rising Islam, few living in the 30% of Bosnia 
still under government control fear that fundamentalism seriously threatens to 
engulf them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no chance of an Islamic state being established here, partly because 
the Muslims don't want that, but mostly because everyone knows such a state 
would have no chance to survive," said Mirko Sagolj, political editor of the 
respected Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje. "Such a state would be squeezed from 
both sides by extremists who would kill the Muslims, forcibly convert them or 
force them to leave, so that what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina could be divided 
between Serbia and Croatia." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagolj, an atheist Croat, attributes the recent strengthening of ties between 
Bosnia and Islamic countries to the West's retreat from the crisis. He argues 
that the vast majority of Bosnians remain hopeful that their future lies with 
Europe, and many are wary of accepting aid that may be given for ulterior 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing dependence on Islamic countries had made many Bosnians quick to 
assume that foreign interference is behind any shift in government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the City Council forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages in coffee shops 
last month, the move sparked suspicion that the government was being influenced 
by its fundamentalist backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no religious reason involved," Sarajevo Mayor Tarik 
Kupusovic insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the measure is intended to prevent incidents involving drunken 
soldiers recently returned from the front and to protect the morale of those 
currently mobilized. 
</P>
<P>
 The front lines encircling Sarajevo are so close to the city center in some 
places that government troops dug into hillside trenches can hear their 
draft-dodging countrymen drinking and reveling only a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Kupusovic said the ban on public consumption of hard liquor is a temporary 
wartime measure and will be rescinded as soon as tensions subside. 
</P>
<P>
 The main influence of a more visible Islam has been to instill confusion among 
those who have long described themselves as Muslims but had little means of 
expressing that identity during the last century when they were ruled by 
Catholic Austrians, Orthodox Serbs and atheistic Communists by turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajla is one of many young Bosnian Muslims who seem to be following Islamic 
doctrine more out of fashion than conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual to see young women on the streets with gauzy white scarves 
draped far enough back on their lacquered hairdos to expose dangling earrings 
and a colorful facial palette of cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laid in a big stock of beer for Bajram," cafe waitress Dina Hasanagic 
said. "We are aware of the irony, but this is our way of doing things. Whether 
it's Bajram or Easter, it's a holiday, and we just want to drink and have a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hasanagic, who has a law degree but has never found work in her field because 
of the war, estimates the chances of fundamentalist Islam making inroads in 
Bosnia as "zero." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Muslim and that means something to me," Hasanagic said. "It means I 
don't steal or kill or harm other people. But no one is ever going to tell me I 
can't wear my skirts short or have a drink with my friends or smoke in public." 
</P>
<P>
 Claims that Bosnia is at the beck and call of fundamentalists is propaganda, 
she said, aimed at driving a wedge between Muslims and those of other ethnic 
groups who have remained loyal to the multicultural cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main goal of Karadzic is for the Muslims not to exist anymore," said 
Mirko Pejanovic, a Serb who serves on the seven-member collective presidency. 
"What excuse does he use to justify genocide? He claims there is a threat of 
Islamic fundamentalism here, the threat of a jihad (holy war). But is just 
trying to exist a jihad by the Muslims? If so, I am in favor of this jihad." 
</P>
<P>
 Pejanovic warns that there is a message for Europe in the continuing conflict 
in Bosnia, where 200,000 have been killed and 2 million made homeless by the 
nationalist quest to create ethnically pure territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the West abandons Bosnia and refuses to defend the idea of a multicultural 
country, this curse of ethnic extremism will spread to threaten the West as 
well," Pejanovic said. "The civilized world is gambling its own destiny if it 
doesn't solve the problem here, if it continues to let force be the determining 
factor. As we say here, the bear will soon be dancing at your door."

SOLZHENITSYN OPENS A NEW CHAPTER OF HIS LIFE: CELEBRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of a cross-country tour to rediscover his Russian homeland, 
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn visited a hospital Saturday. As the famous author 
stepped into an elevator, a small crowd of doctors and a television film crew 
jammed in with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going up to the director's office on the sixth floor, the 
overloaded elevator sank part way between the lobby and the basement and stuck 
there for 15 minutes before a mechanic came to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the hazards of everyday life here, the mishap reflected the 
quandary of Solzhenitsyn's identity as he returns from two decades of exile to 
help post-Soviet Russia find itself. Is he an intellectual or a celebrity? 
Can't he have peace to search for new truths, or must he put up with media 
stardom and intrusive fans? 
</P>
<P>
 And how long can the 75-year-old Nobel laureate depend on special protection 
from a government he criticizes so fiercely? 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn spelled out his controversial views on Russia's ills at a 
wide-ranging news conference, insisting that there is no real democracy or 
economic reform here, no cleansing of the Communist legacy and too much 
imitation of the West. He was equally passionate about his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer not to have 200 photographers crowding around me all the time 
and shooting me day after day," he said. "I need to talk to the common people . 
. . to learn in detail about life in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 To be more specific, he said he resents the fact that somebody in the crowd 
stepped on his wife's foot after their triumphant landing here Friday on a 
flight from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's enough for each photographer to take two shots, why take 250?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking with doctors and surgery patients at the Territorial Clinical 
Hospital, Solzhenitsyn rode to the city's Pacific port, where he was greeted by 
a navy band playing a lively classical medley, well-wishers pressing for 
autographs and more cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling down a waterfront aisle of merchants selling food from truck-sized 
freight containers, the writer acted the part of a modern Rip van Winkle just 
awakened from a 20-year nap. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much is that?" he asked a man selling sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 "10,000 rubles," the merchant replied. About $5 a kilogram. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get it," Solzhenitsyn said, touching his long beard and appearing 
amazed. "When I left the country many years ago, prices were very different." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come again soon, sir," the merchant said with a laugh, "and I'll sell it to 
you for an even higher price!" 
</P>
<P>
 Plainclothes police officers locked arms in a protective ring around 
Solzhenitsyn and his wife as they walked, while uniformed officers stopped 
people at random to inspect purses and shopping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "While he's here, we will keep him under guard whether he likes it or not," 
said Igor P. Lebedinets, the acting territorial governor. "We're mobilizing 
hundreds of men." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Solzhenitsyn was driven in a black government Volga sedan to have lunch 
aboard one of the two luxury rail cars sent from Moscow by the Railway Ministry 
for his trans-Siberian journey to the Russian capital. The cars, equipped with 
a kitchen and Oriental carpets, will carry his entourage of family, friends, 
chefs, attendants, security police and a British Broadcasting Corp. documentary 
film crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn said the 5,700-mile rail journey, which will take several weeks, 
will allow him to make many stops and to "see things through the window." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he last saw Siberia from a prison van, on the way to an eight-year 
term in Stalin's gulag after World War II -- the seminal experience for his 
powerful writings against the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavish official hospitality by the current authorities prompted one 
Russian journalist to ask Solzhenitsyn about comparisons to Maxim Gorky, the 
writer brought back from Italian exile under Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gorky came back to serve the regime," Solzhenitsyn replied. "I will never 
serve the regime, whatever government is in power." 
</P>
<P>
 But he refrained from criticizing Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who sent 
a congratulatory telegram saying, "Your talent and your experience as a 
historian and thinker will help us all in reorganizing Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 The writer did, however, repeat many criticisms he had made abroad about the 
Yeltsin government's attempts at reform. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he described the 1992 decisions to free up prices and sell off 
state property without breaking up monopolies as "brainless" steps that had 
made a country already wrecked by the Communists even poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Russia a "pseudo-democracy" that still lacks local self-rule, has 
failed to punish the crimes of Soviet repression and blindly imitates Western 
ways unsuited to its culture. 
</P>
<P>
 He sneered at the seepage of such foreign terms as "voucher" and "futures" 
into Russian usage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not simply the sickness of our language," he declared, "it's the 
sickness of our soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that outsiders must "give Russia a chance to pull together as 
Russia," he implicitly called for joining the Russian-speaking parts of 
neighboring Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine with Russia proper. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he dismissed Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist 
politician who played up nationalist themes in last year's parliamentary 
election, as a "caricature of a Russian patriot." 
</P>
<P>
 While Solzhenitsyn denied any political ambitions, his more measured 
Russia-first views are likely to strike a powerful chord as he travels and 
speaks across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere in the hospital changed in one minute after he came," said 
Yelizaveta B. Pyatina, 58, a patient there. "Everybody began smiling and 
talking about books, politics, history. We all forgot about our ailments." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russian politicians and intellectuals have criticized Solzhenitsyn for 
coming home too late to shape Russia's development. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Moscow Komsomolets reflected that view with a headline: "The old 
man missed the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 The "old man" was not amused. When that newspaper's correspondent rose to ask 
a question at his news conference, Solzhenitsyn chided him for the headline and 
ordered him to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to wait for the next plane," Solzhenitsyn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei L. Loiko, a reporter in The Times' Moscow Bureau, contributed to this 
story.

CUTTING-EDGE SWAT FORCE ADAPTS TO CHANGING LAPD; POLICE: NEGOTIATIONS REPLACE 
DEADLY FORCE WHEN POSSIBLE, AS TEAM HANDLES RECORD NUMBER OF STANDOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 67 men of the Los Angeles Police Department's Special Weapons and Tactics 
unit are members of the department's most exclusive club. Handpicked for the 
duty after passing rigorous entrance requirements, they train using live 
ammunition and confront armed and barricaded suspects at the rate of more than 
one a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For a quarter-century, SWAT has occupied a unique place in the Police 
Department and the public imagination -- a group of virtual soldiers embedded 
in a police agency, their missions among the most demanding in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The original SWAT team was pioneered by the LAPD, and it has grown up there, 
evolving from a ragtag group of eager volunteers into a tightly disciplined 
cadre of professionals whose officers train side by side with Navy SEALS and 
Green Berets. 
</P>
<P>
 Insular and intensely proud, SWAT was battered and shaped by early criticism 
and a pair of nationally renowned shootouts, one of which occurred 20 years ago 
this month. It battled a reputation for militarism, redoubled its emphasis on 
negotiation and emerged as one of the nation's most widely emulated hostage 
rescue organizations. Most recently, when a highly regarded female officer was 
denied entry into the unit, it raised the question of when, if ever, SWAT will 
open its doors to women; her case is in court and its outcome could again 
reshape SWAT as it continues to define its place within the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 As SWAT has changed, so has the Police Department, which is trying to adopt a 
more community-oriented style that bears little resemblance to the work SWAT 
officers perform. That leaves SWAT at a telling juncture in its history, caught 
between the LAPD that gave birth to it and the one that houses it today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the paramilitary arm of the Police Department remains fully staffed and in 
robust health -- despite the vogue for a kinder, gentler force, despite money 
problems in municipal government, despite the departure of its godfather and 
founder, former Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 His successor, Willie L. Williams -- a police chief better known for his 
devotion to community policing than his belief in special weapons and tactics 
-- has expressed his confidence in the unit. More important, he has kept it at 
full strength despite cutbacks in other areas of the Police Department and 
pressure to put more officers on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, SWAT will stand guard against terrorism during the World Cup 
games, the same function it performed a decade ago during the Summer Olympics. 
Less trumpeted are the missions its officers perform every day. For no matter 
how thoroughly the LAPD transforms itself, there are times when only SWAT will 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On patrol in a tough stretch of Newton Division on a recent Saturday, a couple 
of police officers run across a glassy-eyed young man toting a 9-millimeter 
pistol and ranting incoherently. When he refuses to drop the gun and instead 
holes up in his house, the patrol officers surround the place and call for 
SWAT.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to scout it, contain it, try to bullhorn it and see if we get a 
response," says Sgt. Charles J. Duke, a burly SWAT supervisor who has broken 
off dinner with his wife to take charge of this situation. "If we don't, we'll 
tear-gas it. And if that doesn't get him out, we'll go in after him."  
</P>
<P>
 Moving with the precision of a military drill team, most of the SWAT officers 
check their weapons while a small group peels off to scout out the location. 
The scouting team returns with good news: There are no hostages visible in the 
house, and no toys, bicycles or anything to suggest that there may be children 
in danger.  
</P>
<P>
 Repeated attempts to bullhorn the man to the door fail. At 9:46 p.m., the 
officers fire off the tear gas. One whiff of it is enough to knock most people 
to their knees, but this suspect stays in the chair, oblivious to the acrid 
smoke billowing around him. After several more rounds are fired, he begins to 
pace and yell -- what sounds like gibberish in a Jamaican accent -- but he 
still will not come out.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, the gas seems to get the upper hand. At 10:21 p.m., four 
hours and a dozen tear-gas canisters later, the man appears on his front porch. 
He's unarmed and does not resist. The officers put him in plastic handcuffs and 
load him into a police car.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors, some of whom have been behind the police tape for hours, straggle 
home. A few residents jeer at the LAPD, a familiar foe. Others applaud as the 
officers pack up.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of scary," says Vena Simpson, as she loads her sleeping baby out of 
the car and prepares to put her to bed. "These guys are like the Army or 
something. But I thank the Lord that we have them. That man could have hurt my 
children."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1965 Watts riots made a deep impression on the city and its police -- and 
no one reacted more strongly than a young commander named Daryl Gates. 
Convinced that the riots proved the need for the LAPD to better counteract 
sniper fire, Gates pioneered SWAT, making the LAPD the nation's first police 
department to develop such an organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, SWAT was informal. Officers continued to work their 
regular jobs, they got no bonus pay, and they kept a decidedly low profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would send out these Teletypes to tell guys we had a training day coming 
up, and it used to end with, 'Bring your lunch,' " said Pat McKinley, now the 
chief of police in Fullerton. "That meant bring your rifle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps provided some training, and McKinley recalls spending hour 
after hour marching through the storm drains of Los Angeles, practicing ways to 
move through the city undetected. "The idea was that if we lost a part of the 
city, we could come at it through the storm drains." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who staffed SWAT in the early years -- veterans now refer to the 
team during that period as "Old SWAT" -- were dedicated to the mission but 
sometimes ill-equipped to carry it out. And on Dec. 8, 1969, Old SWAT came face 
to face with the Black Panthers. When the officers arrived at a Central Avenue 
stronghold to serve arrest and search warrants, they were greeted with shotgun 
blasts and submachine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five hours, more than 200 Los Angeles police officers and a 
handful of Black Panthers exchanged thousands of rounds of gunfire. When it was 
over, three officers and six Black Panthers were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one died, the Black Panther shootout raised deep concerns. To do 
its job correctly, LAPD leaders decided, SWAT needed to be a formal unit whose 
officers trained and worked together full time. In 1971, Old SWAT became New 
SWAT, a full-fledged unit under the wing of the department's Metropolitan 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on May 17, 1974, the LAPD engaged in the most notorious gunfight in the 
history of the organization. That afternoon, police officers and FBI agents 
descended on a 54th Street home where they expected to find members of the 
Symbionese Liberation Army, the group that had kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst 
a few months before. 
</P>
<P>
 Three SWAT squads and hundreds of other officers closed in on the residence, 
surrounding it. The SLA members did not respond to the bullhorn, but when SWAT 
fired a single tear-gas canister inside, the residents opened fire with machine 
guns. For about two hours, police and suspects traded shots while news crews 
broadcast the shootout nationwide. Eventually, the house burned to the ground. 
Six SLA members died, three from gunshots, three from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Panther battle had in 1969, this major shootout forced the LAPD once 
again to review the way its SWAT officers went about their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took over Metro (a few months after the SLA incident), there was a lot 
of sensitivity about SWAT," said Jesse A. Brewer, who went on to become an 
assistant chief and then president of the Police Commission. "There was a 
feeling that we were using military tactics against citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer tightened SWAT's admission standards, clamped down on discipline and 
insisted that SWAT officers treat members of the community with respect. Under 
him, the unit replaced its old tear-gas canisters, which were implicated in 
starting the fire that destroyed the SLA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that helped calm the waters, but the evolution of SWAT reflects a 
constant balancing between the unit's use of military tactics and the 
department's desire to project a friendly public image. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, that tension flared up again when SWAT began using a pair of 
battering ram-equipped small tanks, known as V-100s, in some confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sent a terrible signal," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a prominent Los 
Angeles attorney and frequent police critic. "It reinforced that whole argument 
about the LAPD as an occupying army." 
</P>
<P>
 Without ever admitting a mistake, the LAPD scaled back the use of the tanks. 
Today, they sit mostly idle, and criticism of the unit is mostly muted. Cochran 
and Stephen Yagman, two of the city's most prominent civil rights lawyers, say 
they have not handled any SWAT cases in years. Cochran says his impression is 
that the unit has improved from its rougher origins. 
</P>
<P>
 In large measure that is because negotiations or other, less subtle, forms of 
persuasion resolve almost all SWAT situations without gunshots. Still, there 
are times when SWAT officers make the hardest of all decisions in police work: 
When its officers believe they have exhausted all other remedies and feel lives 
are in danger, SWAT will shoot to kill. 
</P>

 Everything seems to go wrong at once for Tan Khuat. He and his wife are 
fighting, he has troubles at work , and neither the cocaine he has spent all 
night smoking nor the beers he's downing are making things any better.  
</P>

 On the morning of Oct. 20, 1992, Khuat sets out to end it all. He storms into 
his wife's apartment, fires several shots and grabs his 3-year-old daughter. 
Over the next several hours, Khuat shoots at police officers and reporters and 
dares police to take action as he threatens again and again to murder "the 
baby." He never mentions her name.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get this thing over quick, give you something exciting," Khuat 
tells the SWAT team negotiator. "I want her and me together, her heart against 
my heart. That's what it is right now, my baby, my blood. . . . Our hearts beat 
together right now."  
</P>
<P>
 About 1 p.m., SWAT officers conclude that Khuat is going to kill his daughter 
if someone doesn't kill him first. They recommend shooting him at the first 
opportunity. Cmdr. David J. Gascon, head of the LAPD's Metropolitan Division, 
gives his go-ahead. The area captain approves it.  
</P>
<P>
 Police officers deliver some food that Khuat has requested while a sniper 
posted on the roof of an adjacent building takes aim.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, everything goes according to plan. Khuat opens the door and steps 
over the threshold. But just as Officer Charles Buttitta squeezes the trigger, 
Khuat looks down and to the right, at the food. The bullet misses the center of 
his head and pierces his left ear. Khuat shrieks that he's been hit and dives 
back into the apartment. He has the little girl.  
</P>
<P>
 Khuat runs to the back of the apartment, but SWAT officers storm in behind 
him. They find him in a bathtub, where he's holding the girl in front of his 
face and screaming: "I kill baby! I kill baby!"  
</P>
<P>
 They beg him to pause for a moment, pleading with him to put the girl down. 
Khuat hesitates and peers around his daughter, exposing his right eye as he 
shifts the little girl's body.  
</P>
<P>
 From seven feet away, SWAT Officer Joe Cordova fires one shot. His bullet is 
on target, striking Khuat just beneath the eye, killing him instantly. As the 
bullet strikes, Khuat loses his grip on the baby. An officer reaches out and 
grabs her before she hits the floor.

 If SWAT was born in the aftermath of the Watts riots, it came of age in the 
buildup for the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Confident as ever, Gates announced that SWAT would handle any outbreak of 
terrorism inside the city limits. Lt. Jeff Rogers, who headed the unit at the 
time, remembers being pleased at his chief's confidence, but a little surprised 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Gee, that's flattering,' " recalled Rogers, who retired in 1991. " 
'But guess what, chief? We're a SWAT team, not a counterterrorism team.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Gates authorized SWAT to become the organization he had advertised it to 
be. He sent three of his most trusted officers -- Rogers, Sgt. Al Preciado and 
Capt. John Higgins -- to Europe, where they studied counterterrorism units in 
Israel, Italy, France, West Germany, West Berlin and England. "We came back 
with a whole head full of ideas and a shopping list of what we needed," Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They got it. Some new equipment was purchased by the Olympic Organizing 
Committee. Other pieces -- special poles with mirrors that allow officers to 
look around corners without being seen, flashlights that attach to the barrels 
of rifles -- were invented by officers in the Metro armory. 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT also revolutionized its training. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1984 Olympics, SWAT trained with blanks. Today, SWAT, unlike any 
other unit in the LAPD, trains using live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 They use abandoned buildings to simulate hostage rescue missions, shooting 
dummies while trying to avoid the cross-fire of their colleagues. Just to make 
it more realistic, those drills sometimes include smoke-filled rooms, tear gas, 
dim lighting and concussion grenades -- extremely loud devices used to 
disorient suspects when officers break into a room. 
</P>
<P>
 When they are out to impress a guest, SWAT will sit the visitor in a chair 
with dummies of hostage-takers on either side. The cops will storm the 
building, throw the grenades and shoot the dummies while the guest sits frozen 
to the chair a few feet from the flying bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT officers spend 240 hours a year shooting, climbing, rappelling and 
practicing other tactics. They fire out of helicopters, rappel off the sides of 
some buildings and scale the walls of others. They drop from helicopters onto 
rooftops. It is grueling, dangerous work, but it underscores a message: Things 
sometimes go wrong; SWAT needs to be ready when they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You perform like you practice," one SWAT cop said. "For real." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Judith Hering, a young medical assistant, is early for work one summer day in 
1983. She opens the doors to an exam room and finds James Hugh Bomar inside . 
</P>
<P>
 Bomar is carrying a gun, and he wants money and drugs. Hering is convinced he 
will kill her and a second hostage if he doesn't get his way. As other 
employees show up for work, they realize something is wrong inside. They call 
the police. SWAT responds, and a negotiator strikes up a conversation with 
Bomar over the phone.  
</P>
<P>
 SWAT holds its ground all day, the officers nervously counting on Bomar to 
keep talking and not start killing. Meanwhile, they craft a plan to resolve the 
situation if Bomar refuses to surrender. When he comes out to get the car he 
has demanded, a sniper across the parking lot will shoot him.  
</P>
<P>
 What they do not know is that Bomar has a plan of his own. He has dressed 
himself and his hostages in hospital gowns and surgical masks. And just before 
they bolt from the building to the waiting car, he fires off two fire 
extinguishers, producing a thick cloud that makes it impossible for the sniper 
to get a clear view of who's who. SWAT's carefully laid plan is useless. So the 
officers shift gears.  
</P>
<P>
 Bomar and his hostages pile into the vehicle, with Hering behind the wheel. As 
she attempts to pull away, a SWAT cop hits a remote switch, killing the engine. 
The car stops, and Bomar, who's been hiding his head below the seat, pops up to 
try to restart the engine. He is holding a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 Without hesitation, a SWAT officer kneeling beside the car fires into the back 
of Bomar's head. As Bomar dies, he slumps onto Hering's shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes hostages feel affinity for their captors -- not this time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved and happy that they had shot and killed him," Hering said. "I 
thought: 'Oh, thank goodness. It's over.' "  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Today's SWAT is a far different unit than the one that ran into the Black 
Panthers in 1969 or the SLA in 1974. It is busier, better trained and better 
equipped. As a result, according to its officers, it is better able to resolve 
the growing number of standoffs that it is called to handle without resorting 
to deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, SWAT confronted a record 67 barricaded suspects, almost all armed, 
some holding hostages. SWAT also served 60 high-risk warrants, those in which 
officers had strong indications that violence might greet them at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, SWAT officers did not fire a shot last year. They have had two 
shootings in 1994, ending an 18-month stretch in which they did not resort to 
deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, of course, has tended to portray SWAT as a killing machine, an 
image that officers dispute even as they sometimes cultivate it. Their calling 
cards picture three heavily armed cops in full paramilitary regalia, but one 
veteran SWAT officer says he is sick of seeing himself portrayed by Hollywood 
as a "paramilitary, beady-eyed killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, SWAT has toned down some of its military rhetoric: It still 
defines its operations as "missions," but no longer describes breaking into a 
house to save a hostage as an "assault." In today's image-conscious LAPD, the 
preferred term is "rescue." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a lifesaving organization," said Sgt. Mike Albanese, a veteran SWAT 
supervisor and experienced negotiator. "Our mission is the absolute 
preservation of human life." 
</P>
<P>
 Others echo that sentiment and emphasize that SWAT talks more than it shoots; 
negotiations or less-than-lethal force solve nearly every SWAT scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 The team makes a dramatic entrance. They arrive at a standoff dressed in 
bulletproof vests and helmets, radios and guns slung across their backs, their 
faces sometimes obscured by gas masks. As they huddle around their forbidding, 
jet-black equipment truck, just about everybody smokes or chews tobacco. A 
crowd invariably gathers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one recent incident, the residents pulled up beach chairs and binoculars to 
watch the SWAT crews in action. Others opened their doors to the SWAT officers, 
inviting them to take up position on their rooftops and in their carports. "It 
made us feel better to have them here," said Adela Saldana, an elderly woman in 
a wheelchair whose home is a few doors from the scene of a recent SWAT 
call-out. "I was afraid. I cannot walk, and this man was out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers trade off-color jokes and bash liberals while they wait for their 
full contingent to arrive. But once everyone's in place, the banter quickly 
stops. They may have nicknames like "Freaker," but they are chillingly serious 
about their work. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, after all, serious business. SWAT sometimes kills people. And though it 
has generally avoided the excessive-force complaints that have devastated other 
parts of the LAPD, there have been some. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, SWAT officers shot and killed Ruben Medrano, a 38-year-old Vietnam 
veteran who had taken an overdose of heroin and was threatening to shoot 
himself. In an effort to end the standoff, SWAT officers burst into Medrano's 
apartment. What happened next remains a hotly contested legal issue, but 
Medrano ended up being shot twice in the chest and once between the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Medrano's family charged that SWAT had been too quick to pressure him and had 
effectively murdered a disturbed man in need of counseling, not confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not commenting on that case in particular, SWAT officers insist that 
they do not rush standoffs. The average incident takes around four hours to 
resolve, and some last 10 or 12 hours, even longer. In general, negotiators try 
to keep a suspect talking as long as there seems to be some hope of progress 
and as long as the hostages do not appear to be in imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask any SWAT cop today about the unit's record, and he will cite the group's 
proudest statistic: In 23 years of service, SWAT has never lost a hostage as a 
result of its actions. Experts say that is the result of SWAT's practice of 
combining negotiation and weaponry under one command -- an approach that is 
intended to diminish any sense of competition between shooters and negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a good SWAT day, the hostages go free, the officers go home and 
the suspect goes to jail. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "The (high-rise) caper, now that was a slick deal," recalls retired Lt. 
Rogers, who served a record 13 years as head of the unit.  
</P>
<P>
 It's about 10:30 a.m. on May 4, 1988. Reynard Jones of Compton strides into a 
Westside high-rise. Jones grabs a temp filling in for the day and forces her 
into a conference room. He claims to have a bomb . He threatens to detonate it 
if his demands are not met.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones wants a car, and he wants $5,000 cash. That poses both tactical and 
practical problems for the SWAT officers: They do not generally let suspects 
leave a scene because it threatens to strip them of control over the situation. 
Plus, none of them have any money.  
</P>
<P>
 One SWAT officer goes into a bank and asks whether the folks there would lend 
the LAPD $5,000 so that it could pass it on to a hostage-taker who has already 
threatened to blow himself -- and, presumably, any cash that's given to him -- 
to kingdom come. The bank declines, so the officer pulls out his credit card 
and gets a cash advance for $5,000. He then retires to a corner to chain-smoke 
and hope that his colleagues can resolve the situation without bankrupting him. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Albanese spends the better part of the day on the phone with Jones, 
talking through one issue at a time. Once he gets his money, Jones focuses on 
food and a car. He is desperately afraid of getting shot -- at one point, he 
offers $100 to every police officer at the scene if they will promise not to 
shoot him on the way to the car.  
</P>
<P>
 As it begins to get dark outside, police deliver the car. Jones wants to see 
that it's put in place correctly, so Albanese suggests that the hostage walk 
over to the window of the high-rise and direct it to just the right place while 
Jones relays instructions over the phone.  
</P>
<P>
 While they're in mid-sentence, SWAT officers detonate an explosive device on 
the door to the conference room. It blasts the door from its hinges and SWAT 
cops pour in through the opening. They grab Jones. He has arrested unhurt , and 
later goes to prison. The hostage goes free.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were very good," said one person who was in the office that day and saw 
SWAT at work. "They canvassed the suite, they had a medical backup, they 
communicated with this guy. They resolved that situation when it looked very, 
very bad." LOS ANGELES P

DISPUTE DIVIDES THE OWNERS OF DAMAGED RESEDA CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the owners of the earthquake-ravaged Sherman Court condominium complex, 
the question was simple and agonizing: Should they try to rebuild their 
132-unit complex -- abandoned since the quake -- or sell the cracked, 
pink-stucco building? 
</P>
<P>
 But as they met in the Sherman Court clubhouse to discuss the issue last week, 
angry shouting erupted when owners who had stopped paying their condo 
association dues were barred from voting. "You're taking away my rights!" one 
man yelled, shaking his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Condominium association President Douglas Scott pleaded for peace. "Look, 
we're all married to each other here, whether we like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a marriage of extreme inconvenience. And there are dozens like it 
throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,500 condominiums were condemned or yellow-tagged after the quake. 
Four months later, their owners are at war on several fronts over what will 
happen to homes that some of them put their life's savings into. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles are pitting neighbor against neighbor, condo owners against 
insurance companies and developers -- and lenders against anyone threatening 
their financial interest in these properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing terrible problems with condominiums," said Bill Rake, president 
of Greenspan Co., a Los Angeles firm that represents homeowners against 
insurance companies in exchange for part of the settlement they get. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cooperation from insurance companies has been abysmal," Rake said. "A lot 
of people are being forced to live in some of these units that are in shambles. 
It's taking forever to get anything fixed. The whole thing is going to blow up 
and become a major story." 
</P>
<P>
 In Encino, Arthur Rosenberg, president of the Encino Oaks Condominium Assn., 
said he and most other residents of the 509-unit complex will probably have to 
put up with the mess months longer while they sue their insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten some money, but not enough," to cover all the needed repairs, 
said the 47-year-old actor. "There are only two ways to do it -- mediation or 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, I'm living in little Beirut here, or maybe Sarajevo, with all the 
walls split open," Rosenberg said. "My son's room has a hole in the wall that 
goes clear through to the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other condominium owners are running out of patience, money and time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of deadlines we're facing," said Donna Goodwin, a 30-year-old 
administrative assistant and Sherman Court's treasurer. "The moratoriums people 
have on their mortgage payments are expiring. The association has bills to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost everything," she added. "This was my first home. All my furniture 
was brand-new. It's all gone. My clothes have been in storage for four months, 
including my summer clothes. We have to make some decisions. We have no more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Time is Anne Siegman's enemy too. The 30-year-old pediatric nurse has been 
living in a rented apartment with her 3-year-old son since the Northridge 
earthquake destroyed her federally subsidized condo at Sherman Court. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, she went without other things to keep paying her monthly dues to 
the condo association and rent on the two-bedroom apartment. "But when I found 
out a lot of people who make a lot more than I do weren't paying, I quit too," 
Siegman said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the owners have joined Siegman in not paying their dues, leaving 
the rest bitter about having to shoulder the burden of ongoing expenses, such 
as $9,000 a month for 24-hour security at the vacant complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The angst Sherman Court owners are suffering is typical of the financial, 
legal and personal troubles condo owners and lenders are experiencing 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of condo owners awakened at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17 were 
first-time home buyers. While a two-bedroom house was out of their reach, they 
could get into a condo the same size or bigger in a nice complex with a pool 
and clubhouse for less than $150,000 and as little as 3.5% down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cheaper than renting if you could come up with the down payment," said 
Lisa Leonard, 28, a Glendale attorney who was one of the first to move into 
Sherman Court when the complex opened in 1991. "That's how they advertised this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, condo prices have fallen below what many buyers paid for 
them, wiping out their equity. In the past four years, the average price of 
condos in the Valley has dropped 15%, to $129,000 in April from $151,983 in 
April of 1990, according to the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those who initially invested less than that to buy their condos don't 
want to rebuild. They view it as throwing good money after bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Court did not have earthquake insurance. The owners have received 
estimates from several contractors that they will have to pay anywhere from 
$700,000 to $1.5 million themselves to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say it costs $1.5 million plus interest, even if it's low interest on an SBA 
loan," Leonard said. "Who's going to borrow that much on property they have no 
value in? The assessment on each of the owners would be more than $11,000. A 
lot of people can't afford that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could probably afford it," she added. "But for me, this is an investment. 
Since I got married, I've been renting my condo. If we rebuild, not only do we 
all have to come up with the extra money, but (real estate) values have to go 
up at least 10% a year for unit holders just to break even." 
</P>
<P>
 With Southern California's depressed real estate market, many quake victims 
who own single-family homes are in the same quandary. But condo owners have 
some unique and particularly thorny problems, noted Richard Close, a real 
estate attorney and president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Number 1, every decision has to be voted on by a group," he said. "Number 2, 
lenders also usually have rights" that are spelled out in the association's 
governing covenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "if you own a condo, unlike owning a house, your neighbors can vote 
to walk away with your entire investment." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two condominium associations have walked away from their 
quake-damaged buildings, one in Sherman Oaks and the second in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda resident Lorraine Hernandez said her mother, a bilingual teachers' 
aide, felt like she had no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen or so residents of her mother's Victory I complex in Reseda 
voted to abandon the red-tagged building at Victory Boulevard and Tampa Avenue. 
It is one of several condemned buildings in the block that remain vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said the Victory I residents "could have gotten a loan from the 
Small Business Administration. But they couldn't afford to pay the loan and pay 
rent while the building was being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had meetings, trying to make decisions on what to do. They finally just 
gave up and wrote a letter to the lenders saying: 'We're walking away, do 
whatever you want to do.' So far, my mother hasn't had credit problems, but 
she's waiting for it to show up on her TRW report." 
</P>
<P>
 Other condo owners, including most of those in Sherman Court, aren't that 
desperate. But they are fed up enough to sell their units for whatever they can 
get -- if only to get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So last week the association met in the clubhouse to take an advisory vote on 
what they should do with their building. A motion to not rebuild failed by just 
two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older residents were glad. "I put 50% down on my unit in 1991, so my 
payments were small," said one 60-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the vote was advisory, and not final, is another indication of how 
complex and touchy rebuilding issues have become. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Mortgage Co., Sherman Court's biggest lender and one of the 
largest in the country, went to court last week to keep the owners from doing 
anything that might hurt their financial interest in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing a distress sale of the building in its present condition could cost 
the Santa Rosa-based company millions, North American obtained a court order 
that, in essence, ties the owners' hands for now. That's why last week's vote 
was merely to gauge which way residents were leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, two lawyers in a Costa Mesa-based firm representing North 
American also said the company would only negotiate individually with the 
owners of the 87 Sherman Court condos it holds mortgages on -- not with the 
owners as a group. One of the lawyers even suggested each owner might want to 
retain an attorney, rather than using the condo association's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bought this property, we agreed to work together as a group," one 
woman exclaimed. "Now you're suggesting we all go out and retain counsel? Many 
people here don't have the advantage of being able to hire high-priced 
attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David Hershorin said North American might work out a payment plan for 
some of its mortgagees. Another option those owners would have is to turn over 
the deed to their unit to North American in lieu of foreclosure, perhaps in 
exchange for some money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to stall," said Daniel Perwich, a lawyer whose San Diego-based 
firm represents the Sherman Court owners and several other condo associations. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reads the legal documents governing both Sherman Court's owners and its 
lenders, 75% of the individual unit holders with voting power must vote before 
July 17 whether to rebuild, Perwich said. Otherwise, the condo owners can sell 
the quake-scarred complex just as it is, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, North American's lawyers disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 They took a lot of abuse from the 80 or so Sherman Court residents at last 
week's meeting. Several residents booed and hissed at what they said, or tried 
to shout them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're trying to force us into rebuilding whether we want to or not and we 
don't have the money," one condo owner charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying we're going into court to see what our rights are," Hershorin's 
associate Lori Carver Praed said, though she could barely be heard for the 
catcalls. 
</P>
<P>
 As if headaches with their biggest lender weren't enough, the condo owners 
already had another legal fight on their hands before the quake. In December, 
they filed suit against their developer and the investment partnership that put 
up the money to build the complex. The complaint: shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Many condo owners now believe those alleged defects contributed to the quake 
damage at Sherman Court, a charge the defendants deny. It's unclear how or when 
this legal battle, or the one pitting the owners against North American, will 
be resolved.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BROWN'S SILENCE ON DEATH PENALTY CREATES MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three straight days, in high-pressure debates among the Democratic 
candidates for governor, Kathleen Brown repeatedly refused to answer one 
compelling question: Why do you personally oppose the death penalty? Each and 
every time, the state treasurer turned the question around, saying that the 
only meaningful fact was that as governor she would enforce the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's refusal to discuss the matter apparently stems from her feeling that 
if she elaborates, reporters and opponents will continue to press her for more 
details about her position -- and remind voters that she disagrees with the 
majority of Californians on a traditionally important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In her quest to change the subject, however, she has created an aura of 
mystery -- or at least curiosity -- that could be deflated simply by explaining 
her views. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has refused to elaborate publicly, Brown has told The Times that 
part of her opposition is because of her religious beliefs and part stems from 
her view that capital punishment does not deter violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, in a series of extensive interviews, Brown illuminated some of 
her sentiments about capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate over it, in my judgment, is over," she said. "During the debate, 
if my voice, my opinion had been solicited, I personally don't think capital 
punishment works. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the people of the state and the courts of this land have upheld it and I 
think that is what the law is and we should move forward and move beyond 
capital punishment to figure out how in the world we can make the people of 
this city and the people of this state safer in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Thursday whether she still believes that the death penalty is not a 
deterrent to crime -- and if that belief alone had led to her personal 
opposition -- Brown said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it factors into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed further about why she felt compelled to keep silent on her personal 
position, Brown put her opposition into a religious context. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not been in the habit of discussing my personal religious beliefs or 
personal beliefs in the public arena, particularly when they are on matters 
that are settled, that are not matters for public debate," said Brown, who was 
raised as a Catholic. "There are a lot of other issues that are unsettled that 
I think the debate should center around." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in Brown's interest to keep the focus of the crime-fixated public away 
from the death penalty -- where her stance could hurt her -- and toward a 
broader discussion of personal security and fear. It is unlikely, however, that 
she can simply will capital punishment away. An opponent in the June 7 primary, 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, and her potential November opponent, 
Gov. Pete Wilson, plan to make her beliefs an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the death penalty may be prominent in Garamendi's last-ditch run of 
campaign ads, which are expected to begin airing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that her opposition to the death penalty is an important issue in 
this campaign and we certainly haven't finished talking about it," said 
Garamendi campaign manager Darry Sragow, who would not discuss the content of 
the upcoming commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting in the wings is Wilson, who has made toughness on crime a substantial 
component of all of his campaigns. His spokesman, Dan Schnur, called Brown's 
refusal to discuss her personal beliefs "cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two points that need to be made here," he said. "First, the 
overwhelming majority of Californians flat out disagree with Kathleen Brown's 
position on the death penalty, so there is an ideological difference. Secondly, 
there is the spectacle of a candidate for governor being unwilling to discuss 
her personal feelings on an issue of such importance -- and that speaks to that 
person's capabilities as a candidate, her courage and her ability to lead as 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Support for capital punishment has not been a tried-and-true litmus test for 
politicians; some -- among them New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and former California 
Sen. Alan Cranston -- have managed to win election after election while 
strongly opposing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers suggest that Brown's strategy is odd. They say that 
Brown has already paid whatever political price she will pay by confirming her 
personal opposition to capital punishment. It could hardly be more damaging if 
she explained herself, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is particularly mystifying for Brown, who has been criticized for 
having few core beliefs and for waffling on the issues. This is one issue on 
which she has stuck to her guns -- but she will have a hard time reminding 
voters of that if she refuses to explain her position. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls suggest the parameters of the political fallout about capital 
punishment -- among both Democrats and the broader electorate. A Los Angeles 
Times poll conducted two years ago found that Democrats favored the death 
penalty, 66% to 28%. Among all voters, the ratio was 77% to 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll taken last week indicated that Brown's position on the death 
penalty does indeed pose a political problem for her. In that survey, 14% of 
the Democrats who said they were unfavorably disposed to Brown cited the death 
penalty as the reason. Overall, counting all voters, 7% of those who did not 
like Brown cited the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has not asked voters this year about Brown's personal opposition to 
capital punishment and her concurrent pledge to enforce the law. But four years 
ago, when John K. Van de Kamp ran for governor with the same views, 24% of 
voters said they would be less likely to vote for Van de Kamp because of his 
personal opposition to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked hypothetically if they would switch their vote from a candidate less 
committed to the death penalty to one who was more committed, 16% said they 
would probably switch and 10% said they would certainly switch. The percentages 
were the same for Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conventional wisdom by some is that the death penalty doesn't work as 
well in a Democratic primary, and to those people I will simply say 'Dianne 
Feinstein at the Democratic convention in 1990' and rest my case," said 
Garamendi's campaign manager Sragow, who was also a chief aide to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Feinstein's appearance at a Democratic convention in Los 
Angeles, during which she advocated the death penalty and was booed by 
delegates. Her campaign, delirious that the delegates gave Feinstein a dramatic 
tool, ran footage from the incident in a campaign commercial shortly before she 
won the party's 1990 nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is certainly no stranger to the political or personal implications of 
capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., commuted 23 death sentences 
during his two terms, and sent another 36 men to the San Quentin death chamber. 
Like his daughter, he personally opposed capital punishment -- so much so that 
he twice tried to have it banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., ardently opposed the 
death penalty. He appointed as Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, 
whose opposition to capital punishment led voters to throw her out of office in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer, however, has in her campaign emphasized other crime-fighting 
tools -- her support for "three strikes" and truth-in-sentencing laws and for 
revoking the inmate bill of rights. She favors expanded sentences for violent 
criminals and says that nonviolent offenders should be placed in boot camps or 
drug treatment centers to keep pressure off the state's overloaded prison 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 In surveys taken throughout the gubernatorial campaign, Wilson has 
consistently been ranked better by voters than Brown on the issue of crime. But 
Brown continues to contend that he has allowed the state to become 
frighteningly unsafe. She made that point Thursday in Santa Fe Springs, when 
she accepted the endorsement of some law enforcement groups in a ceremony in 
front of a memorial to slain officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say to the people of California who have heard four years of tough 
talk from Pete Wilson and 12 years of tough talk from Republican governors -- 
I'd ask you the question whether you feel safer today than you did four years 
ago. Do you feel safer today than you did 12 years ago?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is no. No, because our communities are experiencing an increase in 
random violence and more violence among juveniles."

GRIFFITH PARK SOUTH; 6,600 LONG-CLOSED ACRES, CALLED ORANGE COUNTY CENTERPIECE, 
TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-year-old promise to open a vast swath of land that has been closed to the 
public -- the 6,600-acre southern portion of the Irvine Co. Open Space Reserve 
-- is about to be fulfilled, company officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., said the land, which will open next 
month, will rival the greatest urban parks in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the centerpiece of the county, like Central Park is the 
centerpiece of New York," Bren said of the open space, which is being created 
in exchange for development rights on adjacent land. "It will be to Orange 
County what Griffith Park is to Los Angeles; a place bringing relaxation and 
relief from our busy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible asset that has been blocked by barbed wire for more than a 
century," Bren said of the parcel, which stretches from Coast Highway near 
Laguna Beach inland through Emerald Canyon and from Laguna Canyon Road to 
Crystal Cove State Park. "We think it is socially and botanically important to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Irvine Co., the county's largest developer, announced in 1990 that 
it intended to eventually make the property accessible to the public via 
docent-led tours. However, the opening of the reserve's southern Emerald Canyon 
portion, which was scheduled for last October, had to be postponed because of 
the Laguna Beach fire, which destroyed about 80% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven months since then, the area has experienced a dramatic recovery, 
experts say. So on Saturday, it was announced Thursday, the public will be able 
to hike through the area for the first time, accompanied by docents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to witness firsthand the recovery from the fire," said Trish 
Smith, a Nature Conservancy biologist overseeing the project. "It really is 
quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the company signed an agreement with the Nature Conservancy -- a 
nonprofit conservation organization -- to preserve and protect the natural 
resources of the land while developing a program to provide public access to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covered three pieces of Irvine Co. land totaling 11,000 acres. 
The pieces are not contiguous, but all are along Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the program began with the opening of Limestone Canyon to 
docent-led tours. The program is expected to be completed this fall with the 
opening of 2,800 acres in Weir/Gypsum Canyon farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the southern 6,600 acres in Emerald Canyon are getting the attention, 
especially after the land's impressive recovery from the devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
 An advance tour by van of the reserve Thursday revealed the bustling of 
natural life resuming. Where six months ago the landscape looked black and 
barren, it now provides nourishment for fields of purple wild hyacinths, red 
Indian paintbrushes and yellow California sunflowers. And a land not too long 
ago seemingly devoid of life now supports red-tailed hawks, meadowlarks, 
bobcats and mule deer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith, strenuous five-hour hiking tours led by Nature Conservancy 
volunteers will be available on the first and third Saturday mornings and 
afternoons of each month beginning Saturday. Also, 13-mile mountain cycling 
tours and 10-mile equestrian tours will be offered twice monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 To make reservations for tours, call (714) 832-7478. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be here and think that you're the only person in the world," said 
Monica Floria, one of the firm's senior vice presidents, gazing wistfully at 
the green and brown hills during the recent tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great experience coming out here," Smith said. "People are always 
amazed at the vastness of the open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I come here I experience something totally different. That's what 
keeps me excited; there's a surprise around every corner."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS; 12-WAY CONTEST FOR KEY POST 
MAY COME DOWN TO LAST-MINUTE PITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With three-fourths of the voters undecided about who should lead California's 
much-debated system of public education, the June 7 primary race for schools 
chief is about to come down to a costly battle waged via mailbox and airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 With even the major contenders in the 12-way contest conserving their limited 
resources until the final stretch, the campaign for superintendent of public 
instruction is only now beginning in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the candidates has been able to raise a lot of money, and though they 
represent a huge range of expertise, ideology and ability to move the schools 
forward, they have not been able to get the word out," said Sherry Loofbourrow, 
president of the California School Boards Assn., which recently hosted a 
Sacramento candidates forum attended by most of the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about all that is at stake here, when you think about the 
impact that (the three previous state superintendents) each had on a whole 
decade of education in California, it's a major concern if people don't pay 
attention to this race," Loofbourrow added. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong evidence that voters want improvements in the schools and 
despite the fact that there has not been such a wide-open race for the post in 
more than three decades, the contest's visibility is strikingly low. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll conducted statewide recently found that 75% of 
registered voters -- and 70% of those likely to go to the polls -- had not made 
up their minds. None of the five major candidates were favored by any more than 
9% of the likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a single candidate wins a majority on Election Day -- which seems all 
but impossible -- this officially nonpartisan race will not be decided until 
November, when the top two vote-getters meet in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who gets a message out to the public can win" a runoff spot, said a 
campaign consultant for one of the major candidates. He was referring to the 
last-minute flurry of fund-raising appeals for television or radio commercials 
and the scramble to get on paid "slate cards" that have begun arriving in 
voters' mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Democrats are the candidates best known and widely supported among the 
state's education Establishment, including many business leaders who have 
worked to improve schools. They are Maureen DiMarco, who is Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson's education adviser, and Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin of Fremont, 
head of the Assembly Education Committee and the choice of the politically 
influential California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Three conservatives are mounting substantial campaigns. One is Wilbert Smith, 
a Republican who campaigned hard for last November's unsuccessful initiative to 
provide state tax vouchers for private school tuitions. Another Republican is 
Joseph D. Carrabino, a retired business management professor from UCLA and a 
former member of the governor-appointed State Board of Education. Teacher and 
local school board member Gloria Matta Tuchman is an independent who has been 
running for two years on a platform to end the state's bilingual education 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, a former school board member from Garden Grove and onetime president 
of the statewide school boards organization, calls for a coordinated, 
comprehensive approach to school reform instead of the "piecemeal" efforts to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, author of several education reform bills, wants to see more technology 
in instruction and calls for more partnerships with the business community to 
help fund school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino, who criticizes DiMarco and Eastin as too much a part of the 
education Establishment, wants to cut school administrative costs and reduce 
the state Education Department budget in order to send more money to the 
classrooms without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a former bank executive with a degree in education, has offered a plan 
to reduce campus violence and proposed eliminating "categorical" programs, such 
as special education and bilingual education, to raise the amount of money 
available to spend on all students. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin and Smith have raised the most money, according to campaign finance 
reports filed last week. By May 21, the end of the latest reporting period, 
Eastin had raised $662,000 and spent $507,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin is getting two additional visibility boosts beyond what her campaign 
coffers afford her. She is included on an endorsements list that the CTA, the 
state's biggest teachers union, sends to its 230,000 members. She is also named 
in a controversial slate card sent out by the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Because superintendent is a nonpartisan office and state law bars parties from 
endorsing in such races, the state Republican Party last week won a court order 
to halt the mailing. However, three-fourths of the 1 million cards had been 
mailed by the time the judge acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith reported raising $372,000 and spending $289,000. His biggest 
contribution, $131,000, came from Arkansas businessman John Walton of the 
Wal-Mart discount chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will be on several paid slate mailers that will be sent to Republicans 
and at least two that are going to Democrats, including one aimed at black 
voters. Smith is the only African American in the contest. His campaign plans 
to begin airing radio commercials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino had raised $80,600, including $60,000 in loans, and spent $11,740. 
He said he expects to send out at least one targeted mailing and to be on one 
slate card. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco had received $67,500 and spent $75,000. She expects to be on at least 
two slates and to have raised enough money to buy television commercials in 
several areas around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Matta Tuchman reported raising $71,000, including $24,000 in loans, and 
spending $69,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were certainly different in 1982, when a then-unknown Bill Honig forced 
three-term incumbent Wilson C. Riles into a runoff and then took the post in 
November. Honig did it by raising enough money -- $1.2 million in the primary 
-- to blast his reform message through television sets up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the state's economy is sour, and the campaigns for governor and 
Senate are siphoning off most of the available contributions. Nor is there an 
incumbent for challengers to campaign against because Honig had to resign last 
year when he was convicted on felony conflict-of-interest charges.

RUSSIAN KIDNAPER, REPORTEDLY KILLED IN SHOOTOUT, ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of four gunmen who kidnaped a busload of people was not killed in a 
shootout as previously reported and is apparently still at large in southern 
Russia, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian commandos captured three of the four kidnapers and freed their 
hostages unharmed Friday. Interior Ministry officials had said the fourth 
kidnaper was killed trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, ministry spokesman Yuri Reshetnikov said the fourth man was 
not killed. He escaped into the woods after the kidnapers' helicopter landed in 
Chechnya, a mountainous region of southern Russia that has declared its 
independence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the man was being sought by Chechen militia and "volunteers." All four 
kidnapers were identified as Chechens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian commandos' decision not to pursue the man in Chechnya underscores 
the region's reputation for ferocity and as a breeding ground for ruthless 
criminal gangs. Most men in Chechnya carry weapons, and strangers -- especially 
Russians -- are unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to find out anything from Chechnya," Reshetnikov acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other kidnapers, the ransom and the four hostages have all been 
returned to the southern Russian city of Mineralniye Vody, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostage drama began Thursday when the gunmen hijacked a passenger bus. 
They traded all but four hostages for a military helicopter and crew, several 
million dollars in cash, drugs and guns. They flew to Chechnya on Friday, with 
several army helicopters loaded with Russian commandos in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the interior minister of Chechnya and his police chief were killed 
in a car blast in which the territory's president narrowly escaped 
assassination, the Interfax news agency said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It quoted a senior official as saying a car, packed with explosives, blew up 
when a motorcade passed by late Friday carrying Chechen President Dzhokar 
Dudayev and some of his top ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast hurled Dudayev's car 30 feet off course, but the president was not 
hurt. Interior Minister Magomed Eldiyev, Police Chief Said Ali Batayev and 
their driver were killed.

JUDGE ACCUSES S. AFRICA OF 1985 KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South African security agents murdered four anti-apartheid activists in 1985, 
a judge said Saturday. But the judge said he could not identify the killers and 
left it to the attorney general to determine whether anyone should be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 The case will test the ability of South Africa's new black government to 
balance cries for retribution and calls for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, there is . . . proof that it was members of the security 
forces that in fact carried out the murders" of Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, 
Sparrow Mkonto and Sicelo Mhlauli, Judge Neville Zietsman said in an 84-page 
opinion read out in his Port Elizabeth courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zietsman, a provincial judge who has investigated the case for the past 
year, was unable to identify who killed the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the victims called on the guilty to identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't forgive and forget, or go on with my life, until I know the actual 
killers," Goniwe's widow, Nyameka, said after hearing Zietsman's findings. "We 
cannot close this chapter yet. I am appealing to people to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Goniwe, Calata, Mkonto and Mhlauli were stabbed, then doused with gasoline and 
set alight. Their bodies were found scattered in bushes on the outskirts of 
Port Elizabeth, 600 miles south of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 inquest was inconclusive. But former President Frederik W. de Klerk 
ordered the case reopened last March after a South African newspaper leaked a 
secret military document that had called for the "permanent removal from 
society" of Goniwe and Calata.

ROCKET DEBRIS KILLS 1, INJURES 6 IN YEMEN 
</P>

<P>
 Antiaircraft gunners blew up two incoming north Yemeni missiles over Aden on 
Saturday, and the debris killed one person and wounded six others, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and hospital sources at Sheik Othman, six miles from the center of 
Aden, said debris from the destroyed missiles killed a 20-year-old man and 
injured six others, including a man in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern officials have vowed vengeance for two Scud missile attacks on the 
capital, Sana, that killed 36 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, antiaircraft fire and flares lit up the night sky over Aden, which 
has been declared the capital of the southern breakaway state that southern 
leader Ali Salim Bidh said earlier this month was seceding after four years of 
unity with the north. The civil war between Bidh's forces and troops loyal to 
his rival, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, erupted May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stepped out of the car to watch the antiaircraft fire. Suddenly a black 
object was coming toward me and I did not know where to go," Salah al Youssefi, 
21, said from his hospital bed, where he was being treated for shrapnel wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said one missile appeared to be heading toward Aden's main power 
station while the other was targeting Aden's airport.

 President Clinton chose to back away from a human rights confrontation with 
China to avoid a damaging rift with one of the world's great economic and 
military powers. But what is likely to ensue now, many experts in and out of 
government acknowledge, is far from a period of tranquil relations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, now that the dispute over China's most-favored-nation trading status 
is finally being resolved, a number of other conflicts are likely to boil to 
the surface. Many of these have been suppressed or delayed by the Clinton 
Administration's preoccupation with the trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 It may well turn out, some say, that the trade issue was not really the 
problem between the United States and China but merely a symbol of broader 
underlying problems -- that is, conflicts over ideals, over economics and over 
the future geopolitical map of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, relations between the United States and China are shaky enough 
that all the efforts expended on the trade dispute may produce only very 
fragile, short-term gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the President were to say, 'I'm giving MFN to China for five years,' 
it's Pollyannish to think everything else will be taken care of," one U.S. 
official observed recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will stop focusing on one debate and start focusing on others," the 
official said. "It's just going to go on. There are still a lot of other issues 
that need to be worked out, and they're not even going to be addressed until 
MFN gets out of the headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, the Clinton Administration is likely to challenge 
China by moving ahead with other trade sanctions that it has threatened as 
retaliation for China's pirating of U.S. tapes, compact discs, movies and 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next year or two, the United States and China are also expected to 
clash over China's continuing nuclear tests, which are likely to resume soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the United States could well find itself complaining again about 
China's arms exports. And China will haggle with the United States over the 
future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the terms for its membership 
in the new World Trade Organization, the successor to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 That list of disputes does not even include other, possibly more contentious 
controversies, such as those over North Korea's nuclear program and the future 
of Cambodia, still torn by civil war despite a 1991 peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the trade and human rights linkage is behind them, however, Clinton 
Administration officials are likely to try hard to upgrade ties with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that after MFN, they are going to go into a full-court press to 
improve relations with China," said former U.S. Ambassador to China James R. 
Lilley. "They're going to move fast and hard. We've got important interests in 
North Korea and Cambodia, and we could use China's help." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that effort, Washington sources said, the Administration is 
expected to announce the appointment of a new envoy to China soon. The likely 
candidate is a veteran China specialist: Charles W. Freeman Jr., now assistant 
defense secretary, who served during the early 1980s as deputy chief of mission 
at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some precedents that may give U.S. officials hope that the 
Administration will succeed in upgrading ties with Beijing -- although they are 
not necessarily comparisons the Administration would advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton, one other President had come to the White House promising a 
tougher U.S. policy toward China after a campaign in which he accused his 
predecessor of being too weak and too conciliatory to the Beijing regime. 
</P>
<P>
 That President was Ronald Reagan, who complained in the 1980 campaign that the 
Jimmy Carter Administration had gone too far in abandoning Taiwan when it 
established diplomatic ties with China. Reagan suggested that as President he 
would give greater support to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just like Clinton, Reagan was greeted with about 18 months of the silent 
treatment from China. Finally, in August, 1982, he negotiated a deal with 
Beijing. That deal -- a communique in which the United States promised to limit 
arms sales to Taiwan -- opened the way to more than six years of generally 
harmonious ties between Washington and Beijing. All other disputes suddenly 
became relatively easy to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was during the Cold War, when the United States and China shared the 
same fundamental strategic objective of trying to counteract the military power 
of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration does not have the glue of the Cold War to bring the 
United States and China back together again. And some U.S. China experts point 
to other, much more recent trends that suggest that separating the trade and 
human rights issues may not ease frictions between Washington and Beijing for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a year ago, with much less fanfare than last week, Clinton "de-linked" 
the issues of arms proliferation and China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton took office, President George Bush had repeatedly vetoed 
legislation that would have required China, before winning a renewal of its 
trade privileges, to make progress not only on human rights but also on curbing 
its arms exports and reducing its trade imbalance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton enshrined the linkage between most-favored trade benefits and human 
rights in an executive order a year ago. But at the same time, he dropped the 
conditions on arms exports and the trade imbalance, saying that these problems 
could be dealt with through other means. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? The Administration felt obliged to prove that, even without 
most-favored trade linkage, it could take tough action against the 
proliferation of weapons and missiles. Last August, as punishment for China's 
sale of missile technology to Pakistan, the United States imposed sanctions 
barring the sale of U.S.-made satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Administration officials) de-linked trade and arms control last year, 
but the result afterward was a downward trend in the relationship," one U.S. 
official said. "And I'm afraid that, to prove that they still care about human 
rights, they'll do things now on human rights that will ring off even more 
bells in Beijing than MFN linkage, such as actions to upgrade ties with Taiwan 
and Tibet." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the first 24 hours after Clinton announced that China's trade 
benefits would be renewed, top Administration officials began to suggest that 
the President might take other actions on human rights that could produce new 
frictions between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, in the future, we'll be keeping steady pressure on, through 
other instruments, in a way that may cause (Chinese officials) to make more 
progress in the future," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. "We're 
certainly not giving up on improvement in human rights in China."

U.N. INSPECTORS, CITING EVASION, LEAVE N. KOREA

<P>
 A U.N. team left North Korea on Saturday after the Communist state rejected 
proposals for monitoring the refueling of a nuclear reactor, heightening 
prospects that the U.N. Security Council will take up punitive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's official news agency said, however, that there were no plans to 
stop unloading spent fuel from the reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is utterly nonsensical to tell us to suspend the refueling of the 
reactor," the Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted a North 
Korean analyst as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency told the Security Council in a 
letter Friday that North Korea was removing fuel rods so fast that the agency 
could "within days" lose its ability to measure the plutonium produced there. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has been suspected of converting plutonium from the research 
reactor into weapons-grade materials for nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The North claims its nuclear program is peaceful, but for more than a year it 
has evaded demands for full inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Saturday from its headquarters in Vienna, the IAEA said team 
members had left Pyongyang after failing to win an agreement. Two inspectors 
will remain in North Korea to monitor any further developments, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, President Kim Young Sam was quoted as saying it is highly likely 
that the Security Council will now consider imposing sanctions and that even 
China, North Korea's closest ally, would probably support such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the situation on the Korean Peninsula will grow extremely tense," the 
opposition party quoted him as telling an opposition leader Saturday. Kim's 
office, contacted later, refused to discuss the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Council members met Friday night to discuss the letter from IAEA 
Director General Hans Blix. More talks were scheduled at the United Nations for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials believe North Korea already has one or two nuclear bombs, 
possibly made with plutonium acquired from a 1989 change of fuel rods. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea claims it removed only a small number of fuel rods that year -- 
too few to make nuclear bombs -- but the IAEA says it has reason to suspect the 
North has more plutonium than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical analysis of certain rods in the reactor's core would enable the IAEA 
to establish their age, thereby revealing how many were withdrawn in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel rods currently being removed from the reactor are said to contain 
enough plutonium for several bombs.

CAMBODIA TALKS FAIL TO SET TRUCE

<P>
 Two days of peace talks between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the government 
ended Saturday with hopeful statements about national reconciliation but no 
concrete agreement on a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk's residence in the North Korean 
capital, Pyongyang, the two sides signed a declaration stating that Cambodia is 
a single, indivisible nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk, serving as mediator, said that Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan and 
Cambodia's co-premiers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, formed a 
committee "to discuss and resolve one by one" their differences. It will meet 
in Phnom Penh on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the talks, Sihanouk had proposed an unconditional cease-fire starting 
June 15, and the government agreed. Khieu Samphan said earlier last week that 
he also agreed to a truce, provided that five neutral countries could be found 
to monitor it. 
</P>
<P>
 No date was set for the truce to begin, Sihanouk said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Khmer Rouge has been fighting from the jungles since 1979, when it was 
ousted from power after having killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
fanatical attempts to restructure society. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas boycotted a U.N.-organized election in May, 1993, and continued 
fighting.

CUBANS SEEK ASYLUM AT BELGIAN ENVOY'S HAVANA RESIDENCE 
</P>

<P>
 Dozens of Cubans climbed over and opened wrought-iron gates at the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in Havana on Saturday and were holed up inside to demand 
political asylum, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A group of unidentified people penetrated the residence of the Belgian 
ambassador in this capital, and the motives for the action are not known," 
reported the Cuban government's Prensa Latina news agency, quoting an 
unidentified Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
 A foreign diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said there were 114 men, 
women and children inside the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier reports of the numbers seeking asylum, from Cuban police officials, 
neighbors and those inside the residence ranged from 20 to 124. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Ambassador Paul Belmeirsch arrived several hours later but drove onto 
the grounds without making any comment. 
</P>
<P>
 He left later to meet with Cuban officials, according to a diplomatic source. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders said some of the group demanding to leave the Communist-ruled 
island had climbed over the mansion's spiked, wrought-iron fence and opened it 
to let others in. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reinforcements arrived and cordoned off the area shortly after the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of smiling young Cubans at the residence gathered near a rear entrance 
shortly after the incident began. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a woman, held an infant in the air, while another held up a sign reading 
"Down with Fidel," a reference to President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene appeared peaceful, with police posted 20 yards apart around the 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian and Cuban government officials were not available for immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors near the ambassador's residence said Cubans had gathered in several 
groups in a park alongside the residence. At a prearranged signal they rushed 
the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Police guards, permanently stationed on one corner of the street where the 
residence is located, did not open fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans frustrated in attempts to leave the island have sometimes resorted to 
embassy invasions in efforts to win asylum abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Cubans invaded the Spanish, Czech, Swiss and Belgian embassies in 
1990 demanding permission to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 11 were given visas and immigrated to Mexico after forcing their way 
into the Mexican Embassy last year. Four tried to obtain visas by invading the 
Canadian Embassy in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds rushed the U.S. Interest Section on Havana's waterfront in February 
after hearing a false rumor that a mass of visas would be issued.

FIRST LADY'S BROTHER, BOXER'S DAUGHTER WED AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's brother-in-law and the daughter of Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) were married Saturday in the first White House wedding in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Garden was brimming with pink and white geraniums and roses as the 
Clintons played host for the marriage of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
younger brother, Tony Rodham, to Nicole Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 guests attended the 40-minute ceremony, which included poetry, 
Scripture and lilting violin music. Judge Peter Capua, a family friend from 
Miami, performed the wedding under a white canopy after remarks from a 
Methodist minister and a Jewish lay representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was extremely happy," said Neel Lattimore, a spokesman for Hillary 
Clinton. "There was applause at the end of the wedding and a lot of laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Chelsea Clinton, in a teal gown, performed her duties as a bridesmaid with 
aplomb, Lattimore said. And he described the President as "gleeful." 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, guests retired to the First Lady's garden and the state 
rooms for a buffet dinner and reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer is a 26-year-old film company executive from Marin, Calif. Rodham, 39, 
works for the Democratic National Committee. The groom's brother, U.S. Senate 
hopeful Hugh Rodham of Florida, was best man. 
</P>
<P>
 The families said they -- not taxpayers -- were paying for the wedding, which 
was private. 
</P>
<P>
 The last White House wedding was in 1971, when Tricia Nixon married Ed Cox.

CLINTON OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WORLD EVENTS; PRESIDENCY: REFLECTING ON D-DAY, HE SAYS 
HE IS UPBEAT ABOUT THE FUTURE DESPITE 'RAGGED EDGES AND UNCERTAINTIES.' 
</P>

<P>
 Reflecting on a world with "ragged edges and uncertainties" as the 50th 
anniversary of D-day approaches, President Clinton said he is more optimistic 
about the future than when he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite encouraged, actually, about the way things are going," the 
President told the BBC in one of two interview transcripts released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged limits on his ability to shape world events but rejected 
criticisms that his generation of leaders lacks the vision of the 
Roosevelt-Churchill era. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I admit there are ragged edges and uncertainties, but that was the 
case after the Second World War for a few years as well." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second interview, with Italian television, Clinton said he was learning 
the limits of his power as President but "I am, frankly, more optimistic than I 
was about the future of the world when I took office." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Harry S. Truman once said the President's job "largely consisted 
of trying to talk other people into doing what they ought to do anyway. 
Sometimes I feel that way, that I don't have as much power as I thought I would 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the ongoing bloodshed in Bosnia, for example, he said the United 
States "cannot impose our will, and we have to be flexible and listening." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Clinton said, "The United States is still prepared to lead in a world 
in which our concerns are clear -- security, prosperity, democracy and human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton echoed similar themes in his weekly radio address, holding out the 
sacrifice of the D-day veterans as a model for America's ongoing commitment to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, whose foreign policy has been labeled uneven and ineffective by 
critics, made it clear that new challenges loomed and there were limits to what 
the United States could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic and religious hatreds, hunger, economic and environmental devastation, 
and the threat of spreading nuclear weapons technology all persist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this new era we cannot dispatch our troops to solve every problem where 
our values are offended by human misery, and we should not," Clinton said. "But 
we are prepared to defend ourselves and our fundamental interests when they are 
threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response to his address, Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon of New 
York said one way to honor the nation's military personnel this Memorial Day 
weekend is to "give them the tools that just might save their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized Clinton's proposed defense cuts, saying the reductions would 
turn the U.S. military into a "skeleton force" unable to curb aggression and 
protect American interests abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton flies to Italy on Wednesday to begin an eight-day trip that will 
culminate in a huge celebration of the Normandy landing on June 6, 1944.

ALASKA GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL ALLOWING CONCEALED GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Walter J. Hickel has signed a bill allowing Alaska residents to carry 
concealed handguns, saying he weighed the concerns of police with those of 
citizens who want to protect themselves from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that impressed me the most were the women who called and said they 
worked late and had to cross dark parking lots, and why couldn't they carry a 
concealed gun?" Hickel said from Fairbanks, where he signed the bill Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Village public safety officers, who keep the peace in rural Alaska and are 
usually unarmed, had expressed concerns about a concealed-gun law. A provision 
was added to the bill to allow communities to vote to ban concealed guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaskans 16 and older may carry handguns openly without a permit. To carry 
concealed handguns legally, they must be 21, obtain a $125 permit and pass a 
gun safety course.

Q & A; THE TROUBLE AND TRIALS OF PROSECUTING SEX CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary LaFree, chairman of the sociology department at the University of New 
Mexico, has spent a quarter century studying rape and is among the nation's 
leading authorities on the crime and its punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1989 book "Rape and Criminal Justice," LaFree described the twists and 
turns taken in the criminal justice system by 900 rapes in Marion County, Ind.; 
only 50 of them resulted in prison sentences. As part of his research, LaFree 
worked in the Indianapolis district attorney's office and observed more than 60 
rape trials over two years. He has continued his research and expanded it 
nationwide for the second edition of the book, which is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In rape cases where there is physical evidence or eyewitness testimony, trials 
usually boil down to whether the suspect can be positively identified. More 
difficult to prove are cases that focus on the issue of consent: Did the victim 
willingly engage in sex, and then change her mind? 
</P>
<P>
 These "consent cases," as they are called, force a judge or jury to choose 
between the victim and the accused and decide whom to believe. Societal 
stereotypes about rapists, circumstances surrounding the incident and the 
victim's personality often affect the outcome of such cases, LaFree said. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing news accounts of Edward Patrick Morgan Jr.'s criminal history 
and his alleged rape and murder of Leanora Annette Wong, LaFree talked with The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What are your first impressions of this case? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: From the victim's point of view, and from the residents of 
California's point of view, (this is) the worst-case scenario. The sense of 
outrage that the community feels, and certainly other victims must feel, is 
certainly palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded like this offender is in serious need of help. 
</P>
<P>
 This guy represents the worst scenario, a kind of predatory offender, with 
probably a very high likelihood of recidivism. He's relatively young, he's 
committed four serious violent offenses that we know about -- and probably some 
we don't know about. The calculating aspect makes you real nervous about his 
future behavior as well. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the guy that the national "three strikes" legislation is aimed at, 
clearly, the guy that scarce prison resources are specially designed for. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no rehabilitation that's going to give people a very safe feeling 
about releasing this guy. The problem is that if you make a mistake in 
releasing someone like this, it's going to have very serious consequences. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. Morgan has been convicted for rape three times in the past decade. While 
out on parole in 1993, he was arrested again for rape, but prosecutors chose to 
let him go back to prison for a parole violation rather than file new charges. 
Why would they do that? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Parole is a bit like a plea-bargain decision. If you get someone to cop a 
plea you're going to get immediate prison time. It's attractive to the system 
because it involves no resources -- a court trial is a very costly enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the system does their best to avoid trials. Nobody really benefits 
from a trial except, possibly, the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you think the criminal justice system failed in this case? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It almost always fails. About the best (the system) can do is keep 
predatory, serious offenders like this off the streets until they get too old 
to do any mischief. It didn't in this case. That is a failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have a tough situation in the sense that they always have scarce 
resources. Do you use a large portion of those resources to do the right thing, 
even if there is a strong likelihood that you'll fail? 
</P>
<P>
 Basically it's a deal with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 (In the 1993 Morgan case), the prosecutor was faced with a definite year in 
prison for a parole violation versus a possible acquittal. At trial you've got 
approximately a 50% chance of acquittal; in consent cases (like Morgan's) 
you've got even less of a chance. In a plea-bargain or in a parole violation, 
you've got a 100% chance that he's going to serve time. 
</P>
<P>
 I think (the system) failed. I understand the rationale of the prosecutor, but 
I think he made the wrong decision. I think the prosecutor was taking it from a 
strictly managerial point of view. You have to take on some cases -- even 
though you may not win -- because they're important. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Many rape victims refuse to testify, but in the 1993 case, the woman came 
forward. How important is the victim's testimony? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Nothing's going to happen without (the victim's testimony), because the 
victim is the key to the whole thing. Virtually every state in the country now 
has some form of rape shield law (that protects the identity of the victim). 
Cases are getting into court that did not get in before. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it was too bad (the 1993 victim) didn't get her day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can you explain some of the various rape charges? 
</P>
<P>
 A. One of the problems in dealing with rape is that we do include a whole 
range of crimes, from the sort of predatory violent behavior all the way down 
to statutory rape, where the crime is essentially the age of the victim. Those 
cases can be very different. Having a range of punishments available is 
probably good for society because the crimes can differ a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Statutory rape applies to a situation that is rape just because of the age of 
the victim. It may or may not involve force or violence. A lot of jurisdictions 
don't prosecute it at all, or prosecute it very mildly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the challenges, in general, of prosecuting rape? 
</P>
<P>
 A. From the prosecutor's point of view, the best case is one involving 
identification (of a stranger who raped). The ones that are the nastiest are 
the consent cases, because basically you end up in a situation where it's one 
person against another. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases involving consent (in my study), right down the line they were less 
likely to result in arrest, less likely to be prosecuted as felonies, less 
likely to be indicted by grand juries, less likely to result in a guilty 
verdict, less likely to result in prison time for a convicted offender -- and 
this despite the fact that they're usually violent cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The best predictors of verdicts in our data had to do with our victims' moral 
character. If the victim had been drinking or using drugs, or had been having 
sex outside of marriage -- or was even assumed to have been doing those things 
-- they were less likely to get convictions. Even things like a gun were less 
important than the victim's moral character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do societal stereotypes impact prosecutions? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Almost everybody involved in the system is operating on stereotypes. 
They're looking for stranger cases, they're looking for squeaky-clean victims, 
they're looking for cases where an offender breaks into a house. 
</P>
<P>
 What's really going on in trial is, is the victim telling the truth? Can we 
believe the victim more than the offender? 
</P>
<P>
 The jury wasn't there, the criminologist wasn't there, the judge wasn't there, 
and there are rarely other witnesses. If there are things you associate with 
violence it's going to look better: if there's a gun, if there's a knife, if 
the victim is injured. But if there are things that look like a consensual 
relationship -- if there's alcohol, if there's drugs, if there's a bar -- then 
it's not going to look so good. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrible thing about these cases is we have incomplete information. In the 
absence of complete information we rely on stereotypes: Is she the kind of 
woman who would have fabricated a story? Is he the kind of man who could be a 
rapist? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. By all accounts, Morgan is a good-looking weightlifter who picks up young 
women with sweet talk and then dramatically changes personality when he gets 
them alone. Is this the profile of a typical rapist? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's not a typical profile, but it's not atypical either. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors in our study would frequently say, "He looks like the guy next 
door, how could he have done it?" After all of the television we've watched 
over the years, we have a definite idea of who the rapist is. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us, essentially, use the same stereotypes -- including the offender, 
because he knows what the stereotypes are, he's working it. We're all thinking 
ahead to how is this going to play on the six o'clock news or in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you think sentencing for rape fits the crime? Does society take this 
crime seriously enough? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Part of what's going on is social change. The consent kind of rape case 
(was) less important 40 years ago when women were not in the work force as they 
are now, when many more people were in monogamous relationships. . . . We've 
changed. We're going through some of those growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
 We've still got a criminal-justice system for the '50s, and a social system 
that's far ahead of it.

RAPISTS MAY STRIKE AGAIN AND AGAIN, EXPERTS SAY; COURTS: SOME SAY IT'S BETTER 
TO GET A CONVICTION ON A LESSER CHARGE TO GET THE OFFENDER OFF THE STREETS 
RATHER THAN RISK ACQUITTAL. 
</P>

<P>
 The most common myth about rapists is that they commit their crimes for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most are on a violent mission to humiliate and degrade women and to 
make up for their own insecurities. But a single attack might not be enough. 
That's why many rapists strike again and again, said Manhattan Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Linda Fairstein, who as chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in that 
section of New York City has gained a nationwide reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why it's also critical that sex crime prosecutors go after sexual 
predators as vigorously as possible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a prosecutor who believes plea-bargaining is entirely evil," said 
Fairstein, whose book, "Sexual Violence: Our War Against Rape," was published 
in October. "But I know that by the second or third time you see someone in 
court, he is a sex offender, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I bite the bullet and go after it with everything I have, even if 
it is a weak case," she said. "Even if we lose, I'll know we tried. I don't 
want to pick up the paper and find that someone who got out on a plea-bargain 
has finally killed someone." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what critics say happened in the case of repeat rapist Edward 
Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Four young women charged that he raped them in cases that stretch back a 
decade. In all but one case, Morgan was let off on lesser charges. In the case 
of one woman who said Morgan handcuffed her to a tree and sexually assaulted 
her, prosecutors declined to file rape charges at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say if more had been done to keep Morgan behind bars, Leanora Annette 
Wong, 23, of Huntington Beach, might still be alive. Wong met Morgan on May 19 
at an Orange nightclub. Her body was found the following morning in a parking 
lot across the street. Her genitals had been mutilated. Morgan now faces the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy should never have been on the street," said Ben Wong, grief stricken 
over his daughter's murder. "How could this happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton, head of the sex crimes 
unit, has defended his office's actions, saying the victims' credibility posed 
problems in all but one of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors may have believed the victims, it would have been difficult 
-- if not impossible -- to obtain convictions, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some rare instances, it is better to get a conviction on a lesser charge -- 
such as statutory rape, the charge Morgan pleaded guilty to in two of the cases 
-- rather than risk an acquittal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists say that panders to jurors who believe that a woman who has a 
drink or engages in sexual foreplay such as kissing gives up her right to say 
"no" to sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of attitude completely underestimates the jury system -- and 
victims," said Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who is known for championing 
feminist causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors are women, or men who have mothers, sisters and wives," she said. 
"They can look at the evidence and decide for themselves. When prosecutors 
don't want to take that chance, it's just reinforcing those stereotypes. And it 
gives these guys a license to rape again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Mason, co-coordinator of the Newport Beach chapter of the National 
Organization for Women, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just do not put that much stock in crimes against women," she said. 
"You don't see that same attitude with crimes against men." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairstein notes that public attitudes have changed -- if only slightly -- 
regarding rape victims, and even in cosmopolitan areas like Manhattan, there 
are still resistant stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fairstein said she makes sure her prosecutors are aggressive lawyers who 
anticipate defense attacks on the victims and vigorously shoot down stereotypes 
about rape victims just as they would fight racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the problem with victim credibility still exists, but that's what the 
jury selection process is all about," Fairstein said. "These cases are not 
extraordinarily difficult. You have to work harder to look for what I call 
'reverse jurors,' the opposite of the conservative types that prosecutors 
usually pick. You try to find young, hip, liberal types -- not blame-the-victim 
types -- to try your case." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairstein said trying such cases amounts to a legal victory each time around 
because prosecutors change attitudes in the process. Fairstein said sex-crime 
prosecutors also have an obligation to make frequent speaking engagements to 
get the word out before rapes occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to change attitudes in advance, because if we wait until trial, 
that's a little too late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara West, assistant director of the Community Service Programs' sexual 
assault victim services, the only rape crisis center in Orange County, said she 
believes the deck is stacked against prosecutors -- and victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel that their hands are tied in many cases," West said. "The legal 
system is tilted toward the defendant and not for the victims and there are not 
enough district attorneys -- those are some of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim-based clinical psychologist Sue Beck speaks regularly to community 
organizations about the need for sexual assault victims to tell the truth -- 
the whole truth -- and the need for others to believe and support them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many victims shoot themselves in the foot when they are not candid and open, 
when they do not tell police about all the circumstances, minimizing what makes 
them look bad and maximizing what makes them look good," said Beck, who said a 
victim's fear of not being believed plays a role in this. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical psychologist Wesley Maram said he has learned one critical lesson in 
treating sex offenders at his Orange practice, one that is echoed by Fairstein: 
The urge to rape almost always remains deep inside a sexual offender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I treat, they tell me the urge is gone, but I don't believe it. I 
tell them it's like riding a bike. Maybe you haven't done it in 40 years, but 
you can get right back on again. Sex offenders can learn to control their 
issues," said Maram, who dislikes the word "cured." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is the recidivism rate is very high," he said.

CITADEL TOLD TO DEVISE PLAN FOR WOMAN STUDENT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge wants to know how The Citadel intends to house, clothe and 
feed Shannon Faulkner if he permits her to become the first woman in the 
military college's all-male corps of cadets this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck on Friday gave the school 30 days to come 
up with the plan.He also asked Faulkner's attorneys to submit their own 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck made the order after hearing 10 days of evidence in Faulkner's federal 
court lawsuit to join the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 He made no ruling in the case and recessed the trial to give attorneys time to 
prepare their closing arguments, which he will hear next month. Houck said he 
would likely rule after July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the period I'm making the ruling something should be done to prepare 
for the possibility she may be admitted this fall," he said. "It could become a 
reality on the last day of August. It could become a reality never." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, 19, was accepted into the corps last year after asking that 
references to her gender be omitted from her high school transcripts. The 
college revoked its acceptance after learning she's a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute are the nation's only all-male, 
public military colleges.

VIRUS INFECTS 5 VACCINATED VOLUNTEERS IN AIDS STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least five volunteers in the government's principal AIDS immunization study 
have become infected with the virus, despite having been vaccinated, the 
Chicago Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter is further evidence that the search for an AIDS vaccine is not as 
promising as scientists had first hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, scientists found that while people who had been vaccinated were 
protected against the AIDS virus grown in a laboratory, their blood could not 
wage an attack against a virus taken from infected people. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also are worried about the remote chance that the vaccine could 
make the immune system more vulnerable to infection with the virus. In 
addition, there is the possibility that the vaccine is effective only against 
certain strains of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccines being tested contain only a piece of the AIDS virus. In theory, 
such vaccines generate antibodies that attack and neutralize the entire AIDS 
virus should it later appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five vaccinated subjects who later became infected, previously had 
developed normal levels of HIV antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing unusual about the responses of these individuals. Nothing 
stands out about their response to the vaccine," said Dr. Jack Killen, the 
National Institutes of Health official in charge of the vaccine trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five infected were considered to be at low risk for catching the 
virus. The other three were considered at high risk, meaning they had traits or 
behavior patterns that made them more likely to be exposed to the HIV virus 
than most people. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five infections, Killen said, have occurred in volunteers given a 
vaccine made by Genentech or by Biocene, both based in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The five cases have been discussed at scientific meetings, one in Washington 
in which researchers debated whether the NIH should continue plans to test the 
vaccine on thousands of new uninfected volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know what we're going to do," Killen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trials are designed to test the safety and immune response of the 
vaccines, not their effectiveness in preventing infection. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,400 volunteers have enrolled in the vaccine trials at five 
universities. The vaccines are under consideration for use in the expanded 
trials, but if further trials take place, they may include only 5,000 new 
volunteers instead of the 10,000 previously planned, the newspaper reported.

SEVERE DROUGHT IN PUERTO RICO FORCES WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prolonged drought has depleted lakes and forced water rationing on nearly 
half of Puerto Rico residents, who are counting on dredging and divine 
intervention to replenish the island's reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakes serving as freshwater sources continue to recede, with one reservoir 
recently hitting its lowest recorded level.Weather forecasters hold out no 
promise of rain anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Most condominiums and hotels here still have a supply of water because of 
storage tanks that are filled when water is running. 
</P>
<P>
 But the five-month drought proved dangerous Friday when low water pressure 
hampered efforts to control a fire in San Juan. The blaze destroyed four homes 
and injured two firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have imposed water rationing on 1.5 million residents in the capital 
city and the northeast corner of the island. That covers about half of the U.S. 
commonwealth's more than 3 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a search for more water, the U.S. government plans to dredge a major river 
that supplies one of the reservoirs, and may dredge another reservoir. This 
would free up water cut off by sediment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aqueduct and Sewer Authority is seeking permits that would allow it to 
drill to water-rich aquifers below San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another solution, says Cardinal Luis Aponte Martinez, is divine intervention. 
Aponte Martinez has urged all Roman Catholics to pray for rain. About 100 
members of the Stella Maris Church led a traditional prayer procession Thursday 
through the streets of an upscale tourist section of San Juan in which they 
called for rain.

SURFING WALK OF FAME CATCHES A WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wave riding enthusiasts dedicated a Surfing Walk of Fame on Saturday to pay 
homage to the sport's pioneers, competitors and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take great pride in being able to say I'm the best surfer in the United 
States Congress," Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), an avid surfer, 
told about 100 people gathered under sunny skies for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, some people do point out that I'm the only surfer in the U.S. 
Congress," said Rohrabacher, who surfs here frequently and has set up his 
reelection campaign office in the back of a surf shop. 
</P>
<P>
 With surf music by the Chantays blaring from speakers, the crowd gathered at 
Jack's Surfboards at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway to dedicate the 
walk, even though the first inductions will not be held until August. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidewalk plaques will feature the image of a surfer and honorees' names. 
Winners will be selected in four categories: surf pioneers, surf champions, 
surf culture and local heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Selected by sport representatives, the first inductions will be announced 
during the U.S. Open of Surfing. The late Hawaiian surfing pioneer, Duke 
Kahanamoku, also will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that this is 'Surf City USA' and Surf City worldwide," 
Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A mix of professional and amateur surfers and residents were on hand, 
including former world champion Peter Townend, who helped organize the walk of 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, people who have contributed to any sport are completely 
forgotten," Townend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several surfers, straddling their boards, bobbed amid the swells off 
Huntington Pier and looked seaward in search of the next big wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to surf but I don't much anymore," said Chris Byrne, a 26-year 
resident of Huntington Beach, who attended with his wife, Debbie. "Surfing is 
so much a part of Huntington Beach we wanted to check this out."

SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM; TREKKERS SHOW ALLEGIANCE, AND COSTUMES, AT ANAHEIM 
CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some came hoping to catch a glimpse of the Enterprise crew. Other Trekkers 
were snapping up plastic photon phasers and life-sized posters of Capt. 
Jean-Luc Picard. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Fennell and Roy Henderson came to the Anaheim Convention Center's Star 
Trek Convention Saturday to show off. 
</P>
<P>
 They were decked in full Klingon gear -- rippled foreheads, long curly hair, 
silver battle weapons and, of course, spiked knuckle bands. And even though it 
takes them more than an hour to create the space warrior look that they wear to 
all the conventions, Fennell and Henderson said it gives them a chance to be 
someone else for a while -- someone who stands for honor, truth and battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun playing dress-up," said Fennell, a 32-year-old San Bernardino 
homemaker. "It's like when you're a kid and you're pretending you're someone 
you're not. When I'm dressed like this people think I'm someone, even though I 
tell them I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo, who met at a Star Trek convention in San Bernardino last year, has 
since made appearances on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," "Entertainment 
Tonight" and "The Mike and Maty Show." On Saturday, they were drawing crowds of 
admirers as Trek fans waited for a real Klingon -- well, the actor who plays 
Lt. Worf, anyway -- to make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been around," said Henderson, 50, who has a real job working as an 
engineer for Riverside County. "And it's all because we dress like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day convention allowed thousands of fans a chance to purchase a full 
range of Trek paraphernalia, participate in a costume contest and meet some of 
the cast members of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Both Jonathan Frakes, who 
plays Cmdr. Will Ricker, and Michael Dorn, who plays Lt. Worf, made late 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the day it was the two self-styled Klingons who were the stars 
as they posed for countless pictures and signed autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fennell and Henderson said their characters have become so popular that they 
are talking about taking their show beyond Star Trek conventions. The Klingon 
Assault Group, which Fennell said consists of 11 other people donned in Star 
Trek costumes, is planning to hit the goodwill circuit, visiting cancer 
patients and charities involving children. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the popular spin-off "Star Trek: The Next Generation" recently 
completed its run, Fennell said that's OK because "Klingons will never die." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, fans could walk into the arena and watch a series of video 
salutes to "The Next Generation," which ran for seven seasons. And although 
most of the fans were sad to see the series end, many said they are looking 
forward to the upcoming movie, which features "The Next Generation" cast. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Star Trek' will never go away," said 14-year-old Kai Kaahaaina, who dressed 
in a Star Fleet uniform. "There will always be movies and reruns."  
</P>
<P>
 Kaahaaina said he's a fan because the show gives him a positive feeling about 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows us a future where diseases are curable and people of different races 
can coexist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan, Lisa Early, had come to the convention with shopping in mind. She 
said the show was on a smaller scale than others she has attended, but she 
wanted to grab some last-minute souvenirs, including a "Next Generation" tote 
bag she'd been searching for. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (trip) is more for buying," she said. "With 'Next Generation' going off 
the air, people are buying like mad." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone who attended the convention was a die-hard Trekker. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray O'Dell, the owner of an auto repair shop, said he had seen the show only a 
couple of times when his friends persuaded him to go to his first-ever 
convention. And he said he never expected the crowd's response when he walked 
on stage for the costume contest. With his pale complexion and bald head, he is 
the spitting image of Capt. Picard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trekkers went wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "With noise like that you could start another earthquake," the announcer said 
in response to the applause. O'Dell won the contest, taking home T-shirts, 
souvenir pins -- and thoughts of an acting career.

DANA PARSONS: D.A. ISN'T THE BAD GUY IN 1993 CASE AGAINST SEX OFFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Men like Edward Patrick Morgan Jr. are every woman's nightmare. The problem 
is, the women sometimes don't realize it until it's too late. Good-looking, 
smooth-talking and with an instinct for who's vulnerable, men like Morgan -- 
who had three sex-assault convictions before being arrested last week on murder 
charges -- are best left behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why many people were outraged to learn that the Orange County 
district attorney's office refused last year to file rape charges against 
Morgan -- a case that could have meant his fourth conviction. Had the D.A. done 
so, the argument goes, Morgan might have been convicted and in jail and Leanora 
Annette Wong -- who was sexually assaulted and killed May 19 outside an Orange 
nightclub -- would still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 A seemingly simple equation: A woman is killed, and a known sex offender is 
the only suspect. The conclusion must be that the system betrayed us once again 
by going easy on a dangerous criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 That lament is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that the D.A. isn't the bad guy in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked at some length last week to Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton, 
who made the decision not to prosecute Morgan last year. It's not as though 
Middleton or his underlings mistook Morgan for a Boy Scout. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton patiently explained last year's decision not to prosecute Morgan, as 
well as each of three previous cases in which Morgan was involved. Only in the 
first case, in 1984, Middleton said, were the facts clear-cut enough to press 
for the most serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has already reported at length on Middleton's decision not to pursue 
the 1993 case against Morgan. Middleton opted to let parole officials send him 
back to prison for a year on a parole violation. I asked Middleton if he's 
second-guessed himself now that Morgan has been arrested again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," he said. "I look back and we did what we had to do. If we had 
gone to trial on it, I believe he would have been out on the street. . . . 
Knowing we'd never get a conviction (in the 1993 case) and, if the judge 
wouldn't let his priors (Morgan's previous sex-assault convictions) in, we'd 
have problems. So there was the chance for parole violation and we took that." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in last year's case admitted to drinking a six-pack before the 
assault and she agreed to let Morgan, a stranger, pick her up while she was 
walking. Her initial report to police contained outright lies, Middleton said; 
any defense attorney could have had a field day with her story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Middleton said, prosecutors believed her story about the rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest job in working this unit is having to explain to the family or a 
victim why we're not filing a case," he said. "That's the hardest job, 
especially when we believe the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 If the woman was willing to go to trial, I asked, why not take a chance on 
convicting someone you know is potentially dangerous to others? 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it like this," Middleton said. "When you take a case you know 
you're not going to win and can't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and it's 
just one that you're singling out, it's tantamount to a misappropriation of 
government funds. You're taking court time, the victim's time, and you know 
what the result's going to be." Middleton discussed Morgan's earlier 
convictions, pointing out how vexing rape cases can be. In 1991, prosecutors 
dropped a more serious charge in favor of a lesser one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right before the trial," Middleton said, "the girl's stepmother calls and 
says the victim has major problems with exaggerating to get her way. Major 
credibility problems. Then the stepmother says the girl had been molested by 
her stepfather, brother, cousin, uncle and her cousin's friend." In addition, 
the girl recanted some portions of her story to police. 
</P>
<P>
 In another of Morgan's convictions, in 1984, prosecutors filed a lesser charge 
because the victim couldn't identify her masked assailant. But because she had 
previously dated Morgan and, therefore, knew him, the jury might have expected 
her to be able to identify him, even with the mask, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if the D.A.'s office was only taking "safe" cases to court to pad its 
winning percentage. While winnability is a major consideration, he said, "we do 
file cases that are marginal. Marginals are the ones that go to trial, 
generally. We do win a lot, and we lose some. When we get to the point where we 
know which ones, from experience, we are just not going to win, there's no 
sense in taking victims through all that process. . . . If we can't look the 
victims in the face and say, 'We can do it,' we'd be lying to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, all rapists would go to jail. No one is more deserving of 
lengthy "three strikes" incarceration than sexual predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Middleton could have taken his chances on convicting Morgan last year. 
But if his experience with jurors over the years and his knowledge of the case 
convinced him he couldn't win, what would have been accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 The D.A.'s job is not to play charades. Taking a case to trial you can't prove 
is a charade. That's why I can't join the chorus that says Leanora Wong would 
be alive today if Morgan had been tried last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A final question for Middleton: 
</P>
<P>
 What's your opinion of Morgan, I asked. "He's a dangerous guy, no question 
about it," Middleton said. "The problem is proving it to a jury." 
</P>

RHETORIC HEATED IN WESTMINSTER RECALL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His lunch untouched on his desk, his conversation punctuated by gulps from a 
bottle of Maalox, City Councilman Tony Lam last week contemplated the two-edged 
nature of his status as the first Vietnamese American ever elected to public 
office in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam's voice filled with pride as he recounted his early struggles in this 
country, his days pumping gas, his successes as a councilman, his efforts now 
to be a worthy role model for young Vietnamese Americans. Then his eyes misted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be the first to get kicked out of the office," Lam said, his 
tone urgent as he leaned across a cluttered desk in his Little Saigon campaign 
office. "That would be the most embarrassing thing. I bear the distinction of 
being the first elected; I don't want to have that distinction, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old Lam is one of four Westminster City Council members targeted 
in a bitter, costly recall effort spearheaded by the city's firefighters, who 
contend that the council's budget cutting has left them unable to adequately 
protect this city's 81,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In their latest campaign broadsides, the firefighters also say they are 
motivated by a desire to rid the city of politicians they describe as corrupt, 
including Lam, a restaurateur and longtime activist in the Vietnamese community 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the council votes is by campaign contribution," said Mike Garrison, a 
union director and recently dismissed captain in the Westminster Fire 
Department. "I can't help but think that's not honest government." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam and the other recall targets -- Mayor Charles V. Smith and council members 
Charmayne S. Bohman and Craig Schweisinger -- scoff at the fire-safety issue 
and vehemently deny the allegations of corruption, which they say are baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they argue, the recall stems solely from a decision by the 
firefighters union to resist a council-inspired reorganization of the Fire 
Department last year that slashed costs and helped bring spiraling overtime 
charges under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a power struggle," said Smith, who has been mayor since 1988. "The 
statewide fire union wants to take over this city, and we're not going to let 
them. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bohman, the subject of a recent attack piece by the recall group, criticized 
the negative campaigning. "I just think they've done everything they can to try 
to discredit us," she said. "I don't know of any way to defend oneself against 
these negative attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger could not be reached for comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
 With nine days left before the June 7 election, the campaign has turned 
increasingly ugly. The firefighters and their political consultant have shifted 
from an emphasis on public safety to their current focus on allegations of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The union leaders have distributed lists showing political contributions to 
the targeted council members in an attempt to link donations from prominent 
local businesses to past council votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phil Giarrizzo, the political consultant working for the recall group, 
said the matter has not been raised with the Orange County district attorney's 
office. And he appeared a little uncertain of exactly what the statements might 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it prove?" Giarrizzo asked rhetorically. "I don't know, but it 
doesn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters also have alleged -- inaccurately, according to the Fair 
Political Practices Commission -- that the four city officials violated state 
law by not listing business interests, property or income earned outside 
Westminster on their financial disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the business, income or property is not located within the jurisdiction 
they're serving, it's not a problem," commission spokeswoman Jeanette Turvill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, the union's attorney, asserted last week that the FBI is now 
investigating the union's allegations that city officials were motivated by 
political retribution in dismissing six firefighters earlier this year. The 
issue is the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by the union in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Agent Gary K. Morley, identified by Davis as the agent involved, said 
he could not comment on whether an investigation has been opened. Mayor Smith 
said he was not aware of any such probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The corruption allegations have even swirled into the office of the weekly 
Little Saigon News, whose editor, Brigitte Le, said that Lam last year told her 
that firefighters had set an arson fire that did $25,000 damage to the 
newspaper building. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam adamantly denied that he had made such a comment. "I have to be smart 
enough not to touch that controversial issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le said she later came to believe that both sides had tried to use the fire at 
her office to further their political agendas. "I think I got in the middle of 
their fight," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A firefighter whose name Le could not recall talked to her after the fire, 
stressing that the council's budget cuts could make it difficult to fight 
similar fires in the future. He later returned and gave her a $150 check from 
the union to help with the repairs to her office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le, who has frequently criticized Lam in print on U.S. relations with Vietnam, 
nevertheless backs him in the recall and has urged her readers to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 The current political struggle has its roots in a long-running conflict 
between the firefighters' union and the City Council. The acrimony escalated 
last fall when the council voted to eliminate the positions of five 
firefighters and removed one firetruck from service. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters union leaders say the cuts have endangered the public. "They're 
playing politics with people's lives," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials respond that the cuts have had no effect on fire protection. In 
fact, they say, the reorganization of the Fire Department has actually made 
paramedic and ambulance service more effective, a contention the firefighters 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with an independent review of the Fire Department's payroll practices by 
the auditing firm KMPG Peat Marwick, the city in January accused several 
firefighters of fraudulently collecting thousands of dollars in overtime 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, city officials have dismissed six more Fire Department employees, 
including Garrison and four others this month for alleged payroll abuses. In 
February, union President Paul Gilbrook was fired over allegations that he 
improperly claimed sick leave and drove a fire engine with a suspended driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 The former employees have denied wrongdoing and will try to win their jobs 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the cost of the political slugfest is soaring. Already, the two 
sides have poured more money into the campaign than has been spent on any 
previous ballot measure in the city's history, according to City Clerk Mary Lou 
Morey. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign spending reports filed with the clerk's office last week showed that 
the group behind the recall, the Westminster Citizens for Responsible 
Government, has spent $86,697 so far, about $35,000 more than those supporting 
the targeted council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-recall group reported receiving $49,000 in contributions during the 
latest reporting period -- all of it from the firefighters' union. It has spent 
about $31,000 more than it has taken in to date, the reports showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The group fighting the recall, the Westminster Citizens and Taxpayers Against 
City Council Recall, reported spending $51,792 and receiving contributions of 
$56,551 so far. The contributions included loans from the council members' 
election committees and donations from individuals and companies doing business 
in Westminster.  
</P>
<P>
 The last successful recall of a city official in Orange County was in 1989, 
after Fountain Valley City Councilman Fred Voss pleaded no contest to 
soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he and the others estimate that they need to raise $85,000 to fight 
the recall. And he said the higher level of spending by the firefighters leaves 
little doubt about the significance they attach to the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty obvious that this is a test case for the national fire union on 
how a city can be taken over by a union," Smith said. "Why else would they be 
spending this kind of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrison said there is nothing sinister about the money and other support 
the union has received from firefighters around the state, including an 
estimated 500 who flocked to the city last weekend to walk precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue of public safety and public corruption," he said. "When 
public officials place that safety in jeopardy, firefighters from all over the 
state are going to stand up and say that's wrong. And that's what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stan Hirsch, the leader of a group of mobile-home residents supporting the 
council members, disagreed. Seated in Lam's Little Saigon office last week, 
Hirsch said he resented the idea of firefighters from around the state 
traveling to the city to lobby its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody believes we need outside people to come in here and tell us how to 
run our city, they're wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Lam nodded approvingly. He said he was grateful for the 
support of many like Hirsch who are not from the city's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam slumped in his chair, speaking wearily of the difficulties involved in 
fighting the recall, the frequent precinct-walking, the struggle to defend 
himself and the other council members from each new allegation, the battle to 
drum up support from the Vietnamese community -- not only for himself but for 
each of those targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am recalled, really it would be very beneficial for my family," he said, 
adding that he could help his wife much more than he has lately in the 
operation of their three restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then it would take 5, 10 more years for anybody else, any other 
Vietnamese, to join in the political process here. I think that's a big loss. I 
have to fight this, and I will fight to the end of my career."

GO, FIGHT, WIN: EX-CHEERLEADER GIVES SELF A 'V'; BIAS: FORMER IRVINE STUDENT 
SAYS VICTORY IS SWEET AFTER LONG COURT BATTLE AND BITTER LESSONS ABOUT HIGH 
SCHOOL LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After four years, the news of Melissa Fontes' victory arrived Friday by fax to 
her college apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got home from school and my mom called and said turn on your fax machine, 
but she didn't tell me what it was," said Fontes, 20, now a sophomore at Lewis 
& Clark College in Portland, Ore. "I had to read through the whole decision -- 
it was pages and pages -- and finally I said 'Yes!' It was incredible. It felt 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes learned that a state appeals court ruled that she had been wrongly 
dismissed from the cheerleading squad as a 16-year-old junior at Irvine's 
Woodbridge High School for failing a chemistry class. 
</P>
<P>
 She would not have been dismissed from a sports team, but at Woodbridge and 
Irvine's other two high schools, cheerleaders are held to a higher standard. 
Athletes were required to only maintain a 2.0 average out of 4.0 and pass at 
least four courses the previous quarter. Cheerleaders had a "No Fs" rule, which 
was terms for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of her mother, Fontes sued the district. When a Superior 
Court judge ruled against her, she continued to maintain what the appellate 
judges ultimately decided last week that the Irvine school policy was unfair 
and discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Saturday, Fontes said she felt vindicated -- for all her 
troubles, for all the embarrassing media attention, for all the lonely days of 
feeling ostracized at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This definitely has been one of the biggest learning experiences of my life," 
Fontes said Saturday from her family's China Cove home, where she is visiting 
for the Memorial Day weekend. "It was difficult, but I would certainly go 
through it all again. I have learned so much about people in positions of 
power, about the press and about friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson, Fontes said, is that you must stand up for yourself, no matter 
what the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think integrity is a rare thing," Fontes said. "No one is interested in 
standing up for what they believe in. It's not a popular thing to do. Not only 
do people not support you, but they are hostile when you challenge things." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes' mother, Patricia Passy, seconded her daughter's thoughts. A 
self-described feminist, Passy had questioned why her daughter had wanted to be 
a cheerleader in the first place, but she vowed to see the fight through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just incredibly proud of Melissa," Passy said. "I watched her go through 
a very difficult year because of this . . . a very difficult experience at a 
young age. We supported her but she had to walk that path." 
</P>
<P>
 Until that spring, Fontes had been a popular member of the cheerleading squad 
for two years at Woodbridge, a sports-crazy campus, and had maintained a 2.9 
average. Her boyfriend was the captain of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
 But then she flunked chemistry in the fall. She said she was unaware of the 
"No Fs" rule, although she should have known about it because the policy was 
spelled out in the cheerleaders handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the cheerleader tryouts for her senior year, Fontes got the 
word -- she was out. At first, she said, friends were behind her as she 
appealed to her chemistry teacher, then to the principal, then to the school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the administration would not budge. Stricter rules for cheerleaders are 
justified because "they're out in front of 3,000 people at a football game with 
a microphone in their hands. They command respect," Principal Greg Cops said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 As the battle became more difficult, many of the more than 500 students who 
signed a petition in her support, some of them her closest friends, began to 
disappear. "There was a growing hostility on campus," Fontes recalled, and by 
the time football season began in the fall, she did not want to attend a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole attitude toward school was different. I wasn't as spirited. I was 
disillusioned about the whole school experience," Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother could see what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had been very popular, a model girl on campus," Passy said. "But because 
she had chosen to question and challenge, which is what our system should teach 
is the appropriate thing to do, she was ostracized and her support system gave 
way to their needs. . . . The process became very political." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Fontes suffered another setback when Superior Court Judge 
Robert Gardner rejected her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision stood until last week when the 4th District Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana ruled that "the distinction between cheerleading and athletics cannot 
pass." Fontes had not asked for any monetary gain but the court did award her 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine school board has threatened to appeal the ruling to the state 
Supreme Court. The board is scheduled to discuss that appeal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes' attorney, Bonnie K. Lawley, called the appellate court ruling a 
victory for young people nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole case was about bigotry in every form, about discrimination in 
every form," Lawley said. "Young people in our schools across the state have to 
be subjected to the same rules. You can't hold one group of young people to a 
higher standard than another -- and that was our whole purpose for pursuing 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Fontes said, her "cheerleading days are over." But her days of learning 
continue. She is currently a philosophy major and spent last week reading the 
works of Friedrich Nietzsche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was brought up to question authority and be free thinking," Fontes said. 
"If you think something is wrong, don't just sit back and let it happen. I 
always knew this was a thing I had to do, but it got hard sometimes."

TRIO OF AFTERSHOCKS STRIKES NEAR SIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three aftershocks of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake jarred the western San 
Fernando Valley and eastern Ventura County on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes were all centered six miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred at 7:48 a.m. and had a magnitude of 3.1.  
</P>
<P>
 About 2 1/2 hours later, two more aftershocks struck back to back, a magnitude 
3.2 temblor at 10:14 a.m. and a magnitude 3.6 at 10:15 a.m, according to Kate 
Hutton of Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of injuries or damage attributed to the trio of quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A stronger aftershock that struck early Wednesday was originally thought to 
have a magnitude of 4.5, but has now been downgraded to 4.2.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltech scientists have said at least one aftershock of 4.0 or larger can be 
expected once a month in the foreseeable future.

AREA'S FALLEN VETERANS ARE REMEMBERED MANY WAYS; HOLIDAY: OTHERS TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THE SUNNY WEATHER TO ENJOY THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND ON THE SAND, IN A 
CAMPSITE OR AT A FESTIVAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Following different but equally time-honored traditions, some Ventura County 
residents kicked off Memorial Day weekend Saturday by paying respects to fallen 
veterans while others headed toward the nearest beach, campground or outdoor 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Those taking advantage of the good weather Saturday can expect more of the 
same today, with temperatures again in the 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday began for dozens of people with a trip to Ivy Lawn Cemetery in 
Ventura to raise flags for veterans who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the Brownies, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and other volunteers at 
the flag-raising came out of general respect for the nation's deceased 
servicemen and servicewomen, others had more personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Fowler said she hoped the cemetery visit would help her 9-year-old 
daughter, Sarah, and 4-year-old son, Remington, cope with the loss of their 
father, a veteran who died in January. 
</P>
<P>
 His ashes had remained in the Ivy Lawn Cemetery vault, but on Saturday, Fowler 
said, she and the children would finally get some closure in dealing with his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take him home today," she said. "It's all coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 As Fowler's children and other youngsters scampered through the cemetery 
helping veterans and other volunteers to raise flags, some older county 
residents quietly laid flowers and decorations by the graves of family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouching over the grave of her husband, Joanne Barnes carefully planted three 
small plastic windmills and three tiny flags at the head of his flat headstone. 
</P>
<P>
 James H. Barnes died of cancer last October, she said, at the age of 56. A 
career Navy man, he had served several tours in Vietnam, helping Marines 
retrieve bodies of soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy was our life," the Ventura resident said. "He fought for his 
country. He believed in what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's in memory of soldiers such as Barnes that the local chapter of the 
American Legion and other veterans groups place flags at the cemetery every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the flags once draped the coffin of a local veteran who served in at 
least one war. Each year the number of flags grows as more World War II 
veterans die, said Gene Seitz, past commander of the American Legion post in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 This year more than 700 flags were raised, contrasted with 647 in 1993, Seitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Seitz said, "we've had as many as three members of our 
Ventura chapter pass away on one day." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of living veterans of the second World War may be declining, but 
the legions of World War II buffs are as large as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of WWII enthusiasts and aviation fans converged on Camarillo Airport 
Saturday to marvel at the dozen 1940s-era military planes on display at an open 
house of the Southern California Wing of the Confederate Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 At the show, Derrell Snider, his wife, Suzanne, and their five children 
checked out a TBM-3 Avenger, which was built in response to the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-old Tommy peered into the cockpit, pretending to pilot the vintage 
plane. Meanwhile, his 9-year-old brother, Timothy, said he was glad to be at 
the show, even though he did not have much choice in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad loves airplanes," Timothy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Derrell Snider said he once flew trainer planes for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he had motives other than his own interests in aviation for coming 
to the show. The event, which runs through Monday, is free. "It's inexpensive 
fun for the family," Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county residents found some different ways to have fun inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of sunny skies and temperatures that reached into the 70s on 
the beach and the 80s inland, an estimated 3,000 people flocked to the county's 
beaches Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," lifeguard supervisor Kirk Sturm said. "We've got plenty of 
sunshine, moderate surf, a light, comfortable breeze and a lot of families 
enjoying the day." 
</P>
<P>
 But the warm weather came with an unpleasant side effect: smog. The smog was 
at its worst in Simi Valley, where authorities said the air quality approached 
unhealthful conditions Saturday. It is expected to worsen slightly today. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady flow of people toward the beach and other recreational destinations 
slowed traffic on both the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway. But the 
California Highway Patrol reported no major backups or serious accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, one day at the beach wasn't enough -- all 174 campsites at 
McGrath State Beach in Ventura were full Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and Suzanne Lichtenberger and friends Richard and Laurette Harris, all of 
Simi Valley, had arrived Friday night and by noon Saturday were ready to hit 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The four planned to stick around, they said, "until they kick us out" at noon 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As nearby camper Bill Haas said, "Where else can you get a big, open area, 
throw some tents down, throw some horseshoes and put the kids out and let them 
run?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This," said Haas' friend, Fred Clements, opening a beer, "is what it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Merriment was also the order of the day on the other side of the county, at 
the fifth annual Cajun Creole Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people crowded into the outdoor event to dance to live Cajun 
and zydeco bands, and to feast on such New Orleans-style cuisine as seafood 
gumbo, boiled crawfish and alligator-on-a-stick. 
</P>
<P>
 For some visitors, the festival was a chance to sample new foods and hear a 
type of foot-stomping music not commonly broadcast on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the event was like a homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan Mohr, a Cajun from Louisiana who lives in the San Fernando Valley, sat 
at one of the long picnic tables demonstrating to onlookers the proper way to 
eat crawfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing one of the brick-red shellfish from a nearby bowl, Mohr tore the head 
away from the small body and sucked the meat from the head. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mohr ate, his friend Louann Cunningham narrated. "The Cajun way," 
Cunningham said, "is to suck the heads, pinch the tails." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Simi Sunrise Rotary Club in Simi Valley, the Creole festival 
will continue today beginning at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the festival has little to do with veterans or memorials, both 
organizers and visitors said it nevertheless is a proper way for people to 
commemorate the sacrifices of the nation's military men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people died for us to have a free country," Rotary Club member Jim 
Lowry said. The festival "is an opportunity to get out and enjoy life and be 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Cunningham put it: "The Cajun way is to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of the Memorial Day weekend ended with an evening event in Ojai 
that combined fun and solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds who gathered at Nordhoff High School were treated to a flyover of 
small aircraft, a musical performance by the Shirelles and a dramatic reading 
of the Gettysburg Address.

NEW SEABEE CHIEF CONFIDENT BASE WILL SURVIVE CUTS; PORT HUENEME: CONSTRUCTION 
BATTALION CENTER COMMANDER SAYS HE DOUBTS THE FACILITY WILL TAKE 'A HARD HIT' 
NEXT YEAR IN THE MILITARY'S CLOSURE PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capt. James L. Delker, the newly installed commander of the Port Hueneme 
Seabee base, has discounted rumors that the 52-year-old facility -- the hub of 
all Seabee activities in the Pacific -- would fall victim next year to the 
federal military base closure and realignment program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would doubt if we take a hard hit next year," Delker said last week. "It 
would be hard to continue our level of service to the fleet and the other 
branches of the armed services if Hueneme was closed or scaled back." 
</P>
<P>
 Delker said modern war planners want the United States to be able to carry on 
two "regional conflicts" simultaneously -- yet another reason the captain said 
he is reasonably certain the Seabee base will emerge unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker was installed as commander of the Construction Battalion Center during 
formal change of command ceremonies May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993 Base Re-Alignment and Closure program, the biggest change for 
Port Hueneme was the closure of the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory and the 
absorption of its operations onto the 1,615-acre base. At both Port Hueneme and 
the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, a total of less than 20 jobs were 
lost to the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker began his naval career in 1969 as an ensign assigned to a Seabee 
battalion constructing roads and bridges in Vietnam. Working near the sprawling 
U. S. military base at Da Nang on the South China Sea, Delker said his duty was 
not as hazardous as some others in the war but was dangerous enough to impress 
upon him the difficulties of trying to build things under fire in a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were there to build roads, bridges and office buildings primarily for the 
Marine Corps," Delker said. "I remember that we had to always be in a defensive 
posture because you never knew when someone might try to come into the camp. 
You'd never know when a mortar when come in or you'd go out to a job site and 
encounter a land mine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 24 years later, Delker says he is in charge of making sure that the more 
than 9,000 men and women in the 10 active and reserve battalions under his 
command honor the Seabee tradition -- a tradition built on such assignments as 
scratching out airstrips on South Pacific islands during World War II, etching 
out roads in the jungles of Vietnam and establishing campsites on the beaches 
of Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker said during a recent interview that aside from some of the heavy 
melodrama, the 1944 John Wayne film classic "The Fighting Seabees" accurately 
captured the spirit of the modern Navy builder-sailor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the film communicated the can-do confidence we have in ourselves," 
Delker said. "That's what our fleet commanders love best about the Seabees. 
They know they can ask us to go anywhere, anytime, under any set of conditions, 
and chances are we'll get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old Delker, a naval civil engineer by training with a master's 
degree from the University of Detroit, has served tours around the globe -- 
including stops in Spain, Italy and Guam -- and has been awarded the Legion of 
Merit medal, the Navy's seventh highest-ranking award. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent post was as director of personnel and Seabee support for the 
Naval Facilities Engineering Command in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. David J. Nash, Delker's predecessor and superior officer, said the 
captain's knowledge and insight of the inner workings of Washington and the 
Pentagon will help the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "His insight to how things work back there is invaluable," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, who was transferred to command the Third Naval Construction Brigade in 
Hawaii, called Delker an effective officer who works well with his 
subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a regular kind of guy and he's a very good listener," Nash said. "I 
really can't think of a better person to whom I could leave a command. I think 
he will work out just fine in (Port) Hueneme." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, who likes to jog and play golf, described his approach to management as 
proactive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kind of person that likes to get involved in solving problems. I like 
rolling my sleeves up," Delker said. "I don't think much of running a command 
from behind a desk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delker has been married the past 20 years to the former Anna Maria Mossa of 
Italy, who was his Italian teacher while he was on assignment to that country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is really looking forward to this command -- it's all he talks about," 
she said. "The people that we've met so far have been great, and they seem very 
supportive of the base. We're really looking forward to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Delker said he will focus on trying to improve the quality of life for the 
sailors and their families who live on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's the housing, the gym facilities or the kinds of activities we 
have in our clubs, we have to do those things that make life better for our 
people," Delker said. "I think Admiral Nash did a great job in this area, but I 
intend to keep the quality-of-life factor a high priority under my command." 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Construction Battalion Center, home to more than 9,000 military 
and civilian personnel and with an annual $297-million payroll, is the largest 
command of Delker's 25-year Navy career. It is one that he already relishes, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about as happy as a person can be," Delker said. "I was honored to be 
selected for this command."

SOKA BREAKS OUT OF SHELL AMID BATTLE OVER LAND; PARKS: UNIVERSITY DENIES NEW 
PROGRAMS ARE A PLOY FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT AGAINST SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
CONSERVANCY'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE SCENIC CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Soka University still doesn't have a library or a student union, but the 
embattled school is building something else it dearly needs: goodwill and 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroiled in a legal and political fight with state parks officials over use 
of its scenic Calabasas campus, the once-reclusive Japanese school now welcomes 
the public with open arms. Critics say it's a cynical effort by a wealthy 
institution to buy favor, but nonetheless are impressed by the sheer scope of 
Soka's programs, which include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Six free tours of the campus a month, with special attention to the 
sycamore-lined drive, used as the entrance to the plantation Tara in "Gone With 
the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 * Free or low-cost weekend retreats for nonprofit groups and their members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Evening classes in Japanese and other languages taught by highly 
credentialed instructors at low tuition rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the new botanical garden with an enormous California-native seed 
bank and free gardening classes. And on the academic front, a free human rights 
lecture series studded with Nobel laureates and a prestigious research program 
affiliated with Harvard University but funded solely by Soka. 
</P>
<P>
 While some community groups praise the avalanche of offerings, others are 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this isn't an organization trying to buy off the community, then what is?" 
said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that acquires parkland. "They have enormous 
resources, and they're using them to attempt to build a constituency base they 
would not otherwise have. What worries me is that, at a certain point, money 
talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Soka University spokesman Jeff Ourvan dismisses that notion with a snort. 
"We're not that Machiavellian." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan said the open-door policy and new academic programs are simply part of 
Soka's plan to expand the small language school for Japanese exchange students 
at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway into a liberal arts 
college with 3,400 students. They have nothing to do with Soka's effort to ward 
off an attempt by the conservancy to seize the campus for a park visitors 
center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what universities do," Ourvan said. "We are a nonprofit, public 
benefit corporation, so we feel it is incumbent upon us to serve the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The school wasn't always so community minded, Ourvan conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three years, starting in 1987, this place was run by all Japanese, 
and they didn't talk to anybody," he said. "Then we suddenly announced our 
expansion plans and no one knew who we were." 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing criticism by local residents, environmentalists and parks 
officials mobilized Soka, which spent more than $935,000 on public relations 
and lobbying, not counting legal fees, during the two-year period ending April 
1, 1993, according to the latest federal tax returns available. The Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy and its nonprofit foundation have spent about 
$834,000, including legal fees, lobbying and public relations, to obtain the 
land during the past seven years.  
</P>
<P>
 Soka's public relations effort includes deluging news organizations with press 
releases announcing its nature talks and other activities and publishing a 
newsletter that touts several of its programs, including some sponsored by its 
sister campus in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 One academic program, a post-doctoral research center on Pacific Rim policy 
issues, is based at Harvard University. Soka, the program's sole benefactor, 
spent more than $438,000 on it during the two-year period ending April 1, 1993, 
according to Soka's latest federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harvard is for sale," said John D. Montgomery, the Harvard professor emeritus 
who agreed to head the program after being approached by Soka officials. "How 
do you think we got to be the richest university in the world? But the question 
is, 'Who's buying whom?' We don't take any money for anything unless we want to 
do something in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent edition of the newsletter mentions an exhibit that critics say 
is designed to improve Soka's image, particularly among American Jews. The free 
newsletter is mailed to about 30,000 households in Calabasas, Malibu and Agoura 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about anti-Semitism in Japan, the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal 
Center looked for years for a Japanese sponsor of its traveling exhibit on the 
Holocaust. It recently found one in Soka University in Japan, which underwrote 
the $150,000 cost of bringing the exhibit to Tokyo City Hall in May, said Rabbi 
Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the best American institutions find it hard to ignore the blandishments 
that Soka can offer," said Edmiston, of the mountains conservancy. "That means 
that our task is all the more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ourvan insists the programs have nothing to do with Soka's legal and 
political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would do all this even if we weren't trying to defend ourselves against 
the conservancy," Ourvan said. "These programs will continue when the fight is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of Soka's motives, the school's investment appears to be paying off 
in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Soka has not formally asked groups to endorse its expansion plans, 
one private, nonprofit group that saved more than $14,000 by using the campus 
for free weekend retreats has become a staunch supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they've been so generous, yes, we would testify for their expansion 
before the Board of Supervisors," said Paula Crisostomos, a spokeswoman for the 
Educational Issues Coordinating Committee, a Los Angeles-based group that has 
taken about 75 poor children up to the campus twice in the past two years. 
"They're a valuable community resource." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Traditional Music Society, which holds an annual weekend-long 
festival on the campus, is another avid fan. The society was in danger of 
canceling its festival four years ago when Soka offered to rent the campus for 
$2,000 per weekend, a low rate considering the event draws some 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at 42 sites -- everything from the Queen Mary to Malibu Lake -- 
before we found Soka," said Elaine Weissman, the society's executive director. 
"They're the most professional, up-front people we've ever had to deal with, 
and we love them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, not all recipients of Soka's generosity are stepping up to support 
the school's expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the school treated 70 clients of Educare Foundation, 
another private, nonprofit group that helps disadvantaged children, to a free 
weekend retreat at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They even cooked us meals," said Stu Semigran, vice president of the 
Calabasas-based group.  
</P>
<P>
 But the group is not taking sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of respect for what the conservancy does, too," Semigran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka has also donated about $10,000 worth of computer equipment to the nearby 
Las Virgenes Unified School District. Grateful as school administrators are, 
the gifts will not affect the district when it comes time to take a position on 
the possible traffic impacts and other effects of Soka's expansion, said Leo 
Lowe, an assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't expect it as a trade down the line," Lowe said. "We'll just 
consider the direct impact on our 13 schools."

RADIO TRAFFIC GURU REFLECTS ON ROADS NOT TAKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weary commuters who depend on Dr. Roadmap's traffic tips on radio or his book 
on freeway alternatives can now see the good doctor offer advice in the comfort 
of their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Roadmap is actually David J. Rizzo, who also happens to be a part-time 
podiatrist. Thousands of Southern California commuters know him simply as Dr. 
Roadmap, the traffic guru on KABC radio who tells drivers which surface streets 
to take when the freeways are jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, 43, wrote "Freeway Alternates," a guide to commuting in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. The book, published in 1990, includes more than 100 pages of 
detailed maps showing the fastest street routes to take when the freeways are 
clogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the affable Rizzo is selling a 35-minute videocassette that promises to 
"help you take control of your commuting destiny." The tape sells for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Rizzo explained how he made the transition from a foot doctor -- who 
traveled as many as 200 miles per day making house calls -- to a transportation 
consultant. He practices podiatry nine hours a week but spends most of his 
weekday mornings in his Santa Ana apartment among radio scanners and road maps, 
"waiting for the call" from the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I only get 30 seconds' notice. The station will call me, tell me 
what and where the problem is and give me 30 seconds to offer a solution on the 
air," said Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, who always drives in the slow lane and never faster than 55 miles per 
hour, said he became interested in traffic consulting when he was putting 
thousands of miles on his car each month when making house calls from San 
Bernardino to Dana Point.  
</P>
<P>
 "I drive a 1977 Cadillac that has 281,000 miles, and you can almost see every 
mile on the car," joked Rizzo. "I personally travel every alternate route that 
I recommend. I've spent a lot of time studying and reading about 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the tips on surviving rush-hour traffic that he offers both in his 
book and new video are common-sense suggestions, he says. Rather than listening 
to a favorite rock station or a tape player while driving to and from work, 
Rizzo recommends keeping the radio tuned to a news station that offers frequent 
traffic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're getting great information for free. It's common sense, but many of us 
don't follow it," said Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
 He also advises commuters to familiarize themselves with the neighborhoods 
around their commute routes, "even if you've taken the same trip thousands of 
times." Study maps of the area, so you will know which surface streets run 
parallel to the freeway, he said. This way, when the freeway traffic comes to a 
screeching halt, you can exit and at least keep moving in the right direction.  
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Roadmap conceded that sometimes even he does not follow his own 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there have been times when I get lulled into a false sense of security 
that it's OK to take the freeway. When I'm trapped on the freeway, I ask 
myself, 'Where is Dr. Roadmap when I need him?' " said Rizzo.

STRAWBERRY THRILLS FOREVER; GARDEN GROVE FESTIVAL, PARADE AND CARNIVAL SALUTE 
FADING AGRICULTURAL PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Clad in white overalls decorated with strawberries, 3-year-old Jennifer Moody 
sat in her stroller at Chapman Avenue and Euclid Street Saturday morning, 
waving shyly to a woman dressed as the day's most celebrated fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer wouldn't have missed the annual Strawberry Festival and Parade for 
anything, said her father, 33-year-old John Moody of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been looking forward to this all year," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrymania struck the city Saturday as thousands turned out in the sunshine 
for the 36th annual event, a four-day carnival that transformed downtown into a 
giant block party -- replete with carnival rides, crafts booths, 
country-Western dancing, and a tempting array of strawberry desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of this year's festival said they expect about 200,000 visitors 
before the festivities conclude Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good family thing," parade organizer Jerry Margolin said. "The 
weather's beautiful for us -- too cold to go swimming and too warm to stay 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Orange County residents also found Saturday's temperatures, which 
were in the mid-70s, ideal for basking at the seashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach lifeguards estimated that about 85,000 beach-goers flocked there 
Saturday. Another 30,000 hit the sand at Laguna Beach, 30,000 more were at 
Huntington Beach and 15,000 were at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm weather is expected throughout the weekend, with temperatures probably 
reaching the mid-80s by Monday, according to WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorts and tank tops were popular apparel at the strawberry festival, where 
long lines formed for slices of fluffy shortcake and smooth ice cream sundaes 
loaded with fresh strawberries. Billed as the largest strawberry shortcake ever 
baked, the treat disappeared quickly Friday evening, with the fruit's fans 
standing in line as much as 1 1/2 hours for a free piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove was one of the largest producers of strawberries in the western 
United States when the festival began in 1958, Margolin said. Today, there is 
just one strawberry field remaining in the city. If that one is paved over, the 
festival will be one of the few reminders of this area's agricultural past, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those at the festival said strawberries weren't their reason for 
coming. They came to be with friends, snack on corn-on-the-cob and Polish 
sausages and take a whirl on the miniature roller coaster and the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove teen-agers Sherri and Jennifer Litwa, and their friend Dawn 
Quillen, favored the Kamikaze, a bullet-shaped ride that swings its screaming 
passengers back and forth, traveling progressively skyward until it comes to 
rest with its occupants almost completely upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also slower-paced rides for younger children, including the 
Berry-go-round and a traditional Ferris wheel that offered a great view of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Jennifer Moody and her 1-year-old brother, Shawn, were headed 
after the 1-hour, 40-minute parade of marching bands, equestrians and civic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've been hearing from Jennifer is, 'We have to go to the festival and 
ride the Ferris wheel,' " said the toddlers' grandmother, Donna Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiedler said the family of festival veterans will be back next year, for 
Shawn's third festival. He probably won't remember his first one last year when 
he's a grown-up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he was only 1 week old.

POLITICS '94 / A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE: 
METZLER CHANGES MIND, WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't read my lips: Mike Metzler, a candidate for the 69th Assembly District, 
has become the second Democrat in that race to reverse his position on a 
proposed initiative to bar illegal immigrants from public hospitals and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent taping of KOCE-TV's candidates debate, Metzler and fellow 
Democrats, Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno and John M. Patterson, said they 
support the "Save Our State" initiative that is proposed for the November 
ballot. Zeke Hernandez was the only candidate to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno -- endorsed by most of the Latino Assembly members -- received angry 
calls from Latino leaders. A few hours after the debate, he changed his 
position, saying he had not fully understood the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took Metzler several days to change his mind, now saying he only 
supports laws aimed at curbing illegal immigration. A spokeswoman said the 
change had nothing to do with the fact that Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los 
Angeles), who endorsed Metzler, opposes the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And skip the fine print: Nearly 90,000 campaign brochures being handed out by 
Dan C. Dutcher, an Orange County municipal judge in Westminster, boast the 
endorsement of the "district attorney" in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi hasn't endorsed 
Dutcher, who is being challenged by prosecutor Caryl Lee and Seal Beach 
attorney Barry S. Brown. Dutcher apologized to Capizzi and said the 
typographical error occurred during the printing process. It should have read, 
"district attorneys," in reference to county prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said he cannot afford to reprint the flyers and is considering adding 
the "s" by hand. "Nobody can think this is any type of effort to mislead 
people," Dutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Bruce Bridgman, who is running Lee's campaign, thinks otherwise. 
"To intentionally distribute such a misleading brochure would be a fraud on the 
public. It would show a complete lack of integrity and contempt for the 
voters," Bridgman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not in my back yard: In the 70th Assembly District race, Republican Barry J. 
Hammond recently mailed out a scary-looking brochure that shows a dark-haired 
man pointing a handgun straight at the reader. The caption states: "He's been 
arrested 28 times. He has seven felony convictions. He just got out of prison . 
. . and he's in your neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 He apparently is not in Hammond's neighborhood, however. On the back of the 
brochure, Hammond, an Irvine councilman, takes credit for his city's rating as 
"one of the top 10 safest communities in the entire United States." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'No' on airport? The Irvine Co., the largest landowner around the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, has been mum on whether it wants a commercial airport 
there when the military leaves. But the company wants Hammond, the strong 
anti-airport candidate in the 70th Assembly race -- donating $6,000 to the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammond's largest single contributor is the Allied Business PAC, a small 
group of conservative businessmen, including state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden 
Grove), which has given $7,500, plus $108,358 for mailers, research and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in: Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) in the 69th District and 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in the 70th District are leaving their seats to 
seek other offices. But they have made their picks in key June primary races. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who identified his most favorite candidates with asterisks, chose 
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson, but with no asterisk. He gave three asterisks to 
Jim Silva in the hot 2nd District county supervisorial seat and to Thomas G. 
Reinecke, who is his chosen successor. Ferguson also loaned Reinecke $20,000 
for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Umberg is backing State Treasurer Kathleen Brown for 
governor, Linda Moulton Patterson for 2nd District supervisor, and Metzler to 
succeed him in the Assembly. Umberg didn't lend Metzler any money, just 
political connections. UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Tuesday. This is the last day to apply for an absentee ballot for the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday. Backers of the proposed November initiative calling for the 
development of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
plan to submit more than 100,000 signatures to the registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday. Republican Business and Professional Women Federated host a 
candidates night, 41 Cape Cod, Irvine, beginning at 6 p.m. There is a $15 fee. 
Most Republican Counties 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans plan to mount major voter registration drives in 
Orange County soon after the June 7 primary. Democrats will focus on central 
Orange County while Republicans will try to increase their overall dominance.

DECISION '94 / LOCAL OFFICES; SYBERT AND HIS CASH LOOM LARGE IN GOP PRIMARY; 
CONGRESS: IN THE COMPETITIVE 24TH DISTRICT, THE FORMER WILSON AIDE SEEKS TO 
ATTACH AN AURA OF INEVITABILITY TO HIS BID TO OPPOSE INCUMBENT BEILENSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a costly and high-profile congressional primary, three little-known 
Republicans are vying to overcome the financial clout of newcomer Richard 
Sybert in their bid to oppose veteran Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a businessman and former senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who has 
amassed numerous GOP endorsements and sought to create an aura of inevitability 
around his candidacy, has already received national media coverage as a 
potentially formidable challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, the Calabasas Republican may well spend more money -- much 
of it his own -- than his three major competitors combined in the June primary 
. He has loaned his campaign $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24th District, which extends from Sherman Oaks to the western San Fernando 
Valley and Malibu and out to Thousand Oaks, is considered one of the most 
politically competitive in California. Republicans covet this turf, where 
Democrats have only a modest registration advantage and many voters are 
affluent and independent-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Valley congressional districts, none of the incumbents face 
significant primary opposition. Three of the challengers are engaged in 
low-key, low-cost primary contests in pursuit of rematches from the general 
election of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25th District, attorney James Gilmartin is seeking the Democratic 
nomination to oppose freshman Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) 
for the second time; in the 26th District, Sun Valley businessman Gary E. 
Forsch is running for the Republican nomination to take a second shot at 
six-term Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and in the 27th District, 
Altadena businessman Doug Kahn is competing for the Democratic nod to make 
another run at 11-term Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who faces only nominal primary opposition, has proven resilient 
during his nearly 18-year congressional career. The Woodland Hills lawmaker, 
who ranks third on the powerful House Rules Committee, defeated former 
Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock by a surprisingly decisive 17% margin in 
1992 in a newly drawn district. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Republican candidates maintains that he is uniquely qualified to 
turn that outcome around. Beilenson had the benefit of a strong California 
campaign by then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton in 1992. In 
contrast, in a midterm election such as this one, the President's party 
generally loses seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Beilenson is a tough opponent and I'm the one Republican who I believe 
can beat him," said a confident Sybert, 42. On the other hand, he said of his 
primary opposition: "I don't consider it substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sybert, the GOP field includes Mark Boos Benhard, owner of an 
Agoura public relations firm; Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, 
and Emery Shane, an Oak Park commercial real estate broker. Sang Korman, a 
Newbury Park businessman who has lost three previous Republican primaries, is 
also on the ballot but has not campaigned. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the candidates is well-known. As the primary approached, most 
acknowledged they were still introducing themselves to the district's 125,000 
registered Republicans through community forums, door-to-door stumping, 
campaign mailings and radio and cable television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said he expected to spend $200,000 to $300,000. Hammer said he hoped to 
raise close to $100,000. Benhard and Shane planned to spend less than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, 29, who has been endorsed by the rightist California Republican 
Assembly, the Young Republicans of California and the California College 
Republicans, appears to be the most conservative candidate. He is touting his 
experience as an aide for three years to former Rep. William Dannemeyer, 
(R-Fullerton), a crusader against homosexuality and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard says his message is similar to Ronald Reagan's. "We need to cut taxes, 
we need to get government off the backs of families and business, we need to 
maintain a strong defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, 44, who describes himself as "very conservative and a little more 
moderate on social" issues, is stressing his experience as a businessman and 
community activist. His priority if elected would be to reverse the 
"tax-and-spend" policies of the Clinton Administration and reduce government 
regulations on business. His slogan is "One of Us." 
</P>
<P>
 "This run is simply an extension of a lifetime dedicated to the community," 
said Hammer, who moved to Newbury Park in 1985. "What people want is someone 
who has given, not taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane, 36, calls himself "a Reagan conservative with a bigger heart," 
particularly in regard to small businesses, labor unions and inner cities. He 
counts among his supporters 20 of the past 26 presidents of the San Fernando 
Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who vote are people who have a stake" in an economic turnaround 
for Southern California, he said. "Realtors have been hurt. The defense 
industry has been hurt. And businesses have been hurt. And those are my 
strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, meanwhile, describes himself as a conservative on fiscal, defense and 
foreign-policy issues but "a social libertarian" on such issues as abortion. A 
Harvard-educated attorney, he headed Wilson's Office of Planning and Research 
for nearly three years and is now president of Lanard Design, a small 
toy-design firm in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a career politician," Sybert said in a letter to voters. "I'm a local 
businessman and native Southern Californian who recently served as director of 
California's Office of Planning and Research, where I tackled tough issues like 
crime, illegal immigration, economic development and transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's roots, as well as those of his opponents, have become a major issue 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert moved into the 24th District from Sacramento in November. Records show 
that he owns homes in Pasadena, Sacramento and Washington, D.C., but not the 
house in which he resides in Calabasas. He said he has put his three houses on 
the market and plans to buy a residence in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents have sought to paint Sybert as an opportunistic carpetbagger. 
Hammer called him "the gentleman fresh from Sacramento." Benhard said: "You 
ought to have a stake in your community before you want to represent it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he lived in Pasadena and Westwood before joining the Wilson 
Administration, Sybert called this "a manufactured issue. . . . I've got much 
deeper roots in Los Angeles than any other candidate. What's important is not 
where someone's been. It's where they're going." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he is the only candidate who lives in Los Angeles County -- along 
with 75% of the district's voters. The other Republicans reside in the Ventura 
County portion of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has fired off countercharges of his own. Among other things, he has 
attacked Hammer for voting infrequently in local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer was not registered to vote at his new residence until nearly two years 
after he moved to Newbury Park and has missed voting in four elections since. 
Hammer said the reason was business travel; Sybert pointed out that he could 
have voted as an absentee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary, Beilenson is opposed by Scott Gaulke of Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25th District, Gilmartin, who received 33% of the vote in 1992, is 
opposed by William H. Horning, a Lancaster clerk, in the Democratic primary. 
McKeon faces Sandra Tully, a Lancaster manager/technician, in the Republican 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 26th District Democratic primary, Berman is opposed by G. C. (Brodie) 
Broderson, a Mission Hills political activist, and Jose P. Galvan, a Sylmar 
librarian. In the Republican primary, Forsch, who won 30% of the tally in 1992, 
faces Bill Glass, a Sherman Oaks accountant, and John A. Furutani, a Los 
Angeles attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 27th District, Moorhead is being challenged by Elizabeth Michael, a 
Pasadena businesswoman, in the Republican primary. Kahn, who received 39% of 
the vote in 1992, is running against Roger A. Kulpa, a Burbank accounting 
business owner, and Daniel I. Hurst, a Glendale systems analyst, in the 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 29th District, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) is opposed in 
the Democratic primary by Jon Rappoport, a Los Angeles free-lance journalist 
and author. In the Republican contest, Los Angeles businessman Paul Stepanek 
faces Patrick Regan, an assistant film director from Santa Monica.

DECISION '94 / LOCAL OFFICES; NEW AGE DEMOCRATS MAKE 41ST THEIR TURF; ASSEMBLY: 
FIELD INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL, GAY, CIVIL LIBERTARIAN AND ANTI-SMOKING 
CANDIDATES. BUT THE VALLEY IS WHERE THE VOTES ARE.

<P>
 At times, the cast of would-be legislators in the upscale West Side-San 
Fernando Valley 41st Assembly District sounds as if it has been lifted from a 
Woody Allen movie about New Age California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the lesbian former television actress, the environmental 
activist-lawyer who defends nude dancers, the Malibu civil libertarian who 
urges legalizing prostitution while acting as one of the state's leading male 
advocates for abortion rights and the anti-smoking activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Touching off this polychromatic dash of Democratic Party candidates for the 
state Legislature was the surprise decision last February by Assemblyman Terry 
Friedman (D-Brentwood) to step down and run for a Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes the West Side communities of Santa Monica, Brentwood, 
the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, the San Fernando Valley communities of 
Woodland Hills, Tarzana and Encino and the Conejo Valley communities of Hidden 
Hills, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 With 50.4% of the 41st District electorate registered as Democrats and 36.3% 
as Republicans, conventional wisdom says the triumphant Democratic primary 
candidate wins the seat in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the front-runners in the six-person Democratic primary are strongly 
rooted in West Side politics, sheer numbers have forced them to pay keen 
attention to the San Fernando Valley part of the district. Records show that 
52% of the Democrats eligible to vote in the primary live north of Mulholland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the West Side-based candidates, three -- Bill Rothbard, Edward Tabash and 
Sheila James Kuehl -- have even set up campaign headquarters on Ventura 
Boulevard to prove their courtship of the Valley is earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard is vice chairman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and 
ex-president of the Berkeley-based nonprofit Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. 
He once led schoolchildren in protesting a traveling exhibit of the nation's 
original Bill of Rights documents because it was sponsored by Phillip Morris, 
the tobacco giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old anti-trust attorney's campaign has picked up the endorsements 
of a number of Valley-based homeowner leaders, including Rob Glushon of the 
Encino Property Owners Assn. and Bob Gross of the Woodland Hills Homeowners 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "True, I live on the West Side but through my work on the conservancy, I've 
dealt extensively with Valley environmental issues," Rothbard said. "I've also 
done all my own precinct walking in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard also supports the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
a viewpoint with a strong Valley constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is he a school reform parvenu, Rothbard says, pointing to his work as 
legal counsel to a parent group that advocates converting public schools in the 
Pacific Palisades -- where his own two teen-age children are being educated -- 
to independent charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Rothbard unsuccessfully sought appointment as Santa Monica city 
attorney, calling himself a champion of the underdog, and in the 1980s he was 
involved -- as an aide to U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) -- in the effort 
to block President Ronald Reagan's nomination of conservative Robert Bork to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard has raised more than $175,000 for his campaign, and is receiving the 
private support of outgoing lawmaker Friedman, a close friend. As a candidate 
for a judgeship, Friedman is barred from being overtly engaged in Rothbard's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Also armed with a large campaign war chest is Sheila James Kuehl, a Loyola Law 
School professor and a leader of the nonprofit California Women's Law Center. 
Her latest campaign report showed that she had raised nearly $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime actress, Kuehl played Zelda, the lovelorn pursuer of Dobie in the 
1960s sitcom "Dobie Gillis." Last week, she raised about $8,000 at a campaign 
fund-raiser featuring a reunion of the series' stars. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Democratic Party meeting in San Pedro in March, Kuehl said she hoped to 
become the first openly lesbian member of the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl has backed strong tenant-rights measures in her hometown of Santa 
Monica. Also, in 1993, as a member of a local service center for the homeless, 
Kuehl urged a moratorium on enforcement of a controversial Santa Monica 
ordinance prohibiting sleeping in the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a Santa Monica renter and a Jewish woman, your mailbox is going to 
be stuffed with our mailers before the campaign is over," said Barbara Grover, 
Kuehl's political consultant, commenting on the candidate's constituent base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina have endorsed Kuehl, who says her 
domestic violence work at the California Women's Law Center equips her to deal 
with a top concern of voters: street violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl says she has been tough on domestic violence criminals and is ready to 
show the same grit when it comes to street criminals but only after trying to 
rehabilitate young, first-time offenders. "I understand the 
three-strikes-you're-out mood of the public, but I also believe we need to 
intervene and offer treatment after the first strike," Kuehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some call her a left-wing ideologue, Kuehl insists that the tag 
doesn't fit and says her endorsement by Ben Reznik, former president of the 
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., and Roberta Weintraub, former Los Angeles 
school board member, proves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Jon Diamond of the Pacific Palisades has raised $110,000 in his quest 
for the 41st District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney, Diamond has made a name for himself in recent years defending 
nude dancing establishments in Orange County threatened by restrictive zoning 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 53-year-old Diamond's career in law and politics also amounts to a 
virtual road map of the California environmental and political reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Diamond was a key sponsor of an unsuccessful statewide ballot 
measure to ban smoking in many public places. "I've been crazy about smoking 
for years," Diamond said recently. "I used to carry a squirt gun around and 
shoot people who were smoking in public. Now this is popular. Then it was a 
lonely crusade." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the American Lung Assn. retained Diamond to help block a 
tobacco-industry challenge to the city's sweeping law against smoking in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Diamond was one of four official proponents of the ballot 
initiative, approved by Watergate-weary voters, that created the state's 
campaign-finance disclosure law and the Fair Political Practices Commission, 
and he was instrumental in getting an unsuccessful measure on the ballot to ban 
the construction of nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond was also a leader of NO OIL, the citizens group that led the fight to 
block oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades by Occidental Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 His work in the environmental trenches has earned Diamond the endorsement of 
Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, the council's anti-smoking champion, 
and the support of many members of the clean-air and clean-water movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tenacious," Diamond said. "Look at what I've done without holding office, 
so I think I'd be even more effective if I held office." If sent to Sacramento, 
Diamond says he would fight to limit campaign contributions in state elections 
and for bolder laws requiring pollution-free cars in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabash, 43, has courted Valley voters by calling himself a moderate Democrat 
who will champion tougher laws against illegal immigration. "The idea that any 
impoverished person who comes to our shores is entitled to financial aid and 
citizenship is unacceptable," said Tabash, who has a civil-law practice in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In one campaign mailer targeted at Valley Democrats, Tabash positioned himself 
as the candidate with the least in common with the "political power brokers 
that elected Tom Hayden" as he damned his Democratic rivals for being "more 
sympathetic to a world view of the left."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tabash is no stranger to progressive politics. In fact, since 1981 he 
has been chief spokesman for the California Abortions Rights Action League, a 
group that has endorsed his candidacy. And his civil-libertarian roots have led 
him to advocate legalized prostitution. When alleged madam Heidi Fleiss was 
arrested, Tabash was quoted as saying, "If we, as a society, really care about 
women . . . we will stop turning some of them into criminals because they have 
chosen to exchange sex for money." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabash, who lives near Malibu, has invested $150,000 of his own money in the 
race, bringing his war chest to about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the Democratic primary is Pat McGuire, 43, a self-described 
gay fiscal conservative from Tarzana. McGuire says he will fight to lower 
residential property taxes by shifting them to commercial properties over a 
five- to seven-year period. McGuire, who has raised $70,000 for his race -- 
much of it from family members -- and has been endorsed by several local 
political clubs, teaches adult education for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire's mother wrote a letter to voters telling them that her son was 
special because he would not accept money from political action committees and 
would devote half his salary as an assemblyman to provide more police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shallman, 30, a former top political adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan, is 
the sixth Democratic candidate in the race. Shallman, who lives in Encino, owns 
a business-consulting firm. He has raised about $15,000 for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only Valley candidate," Shallman said, pointing out that McGuire is a 
recent resident of the Valley. "We've had enough of West Side lawyers 
representing us." He describes himself as a political outsider and pragmatist 
who supports the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 A supporter of the death penalty, Shallman said he would focus on curbing 
juvenile crime through educational programs and boot camps for first-time 
offenders. He advocates tax credits to businesses that contribute personnel to 
act as mentors to young people. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two candidates in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Michael Meehan, 28, a reserve deputy sheriff who is completing work 
on his law degree at Loyola University and has raised $7,600 for his race. A 
Santa Monica resident and former student body president at UCLA, Meehan has won 
endorsements from the Los Angeles County Peace Officers Assn. and the Los 
Angeles Police Protective League, the latter being the collective-bargaining 
agent for city police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a deputy who works from eight to 16 hours a week at the Lennox substation 
in southeast Los Angeles, Meehan says he is the best-suited law-enforcement 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas resident Peter Eason, the second GOP candidate, works in marketing 
at California Federal Bank. Eason was a leader of the Calabasas cityhood 
campaign approved by voters in 1991 and currently is on the Calabasas Traffic 
and Transportation Commission. He has raised $10,000 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason, 39, has been endorsed by Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) and the California Republican 
Assembly, a grass-roots organization for GOP conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason said his business experience qualifies him to tackle the important job 
of streamlining state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Running unopposed as the Libertarian candidate in the race is Philip Baron, 
34, a Tarzana realtor.

DECISION '94 / LOCAL OFFICES; PRIMARY EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SOME POLITICAL 
SUSPENSE FOR VALLEY VOTERS; ELECTIONS: THOUGH MANY INCUMBENTS FACE LITTLE OR NO 
OPPOSITION, NEW FACES AND CROWDED RACES ARE PREDICTORS OF INTERESTING BATTLES. 
</P>

<P>
 The June 7 primary election won't be totally bereft of cliffhangers or 
promises of political novelty for San Fernando Valley voters, even though half 
a dozen incumbent state legislators are unchallenged or face only nominal 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Van Nuys-based 20th Senate District seat, GOP voters will pick a 
candidate to run in November against state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los 
Angeles), who has represented a mostly West Side district for years but is 
risking charges of carpetbagging to set up political shop in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic voters in the 41st and 42nd Assembly districts, where incumbent 
lawmakers are stepping down to seek other offices, will be trying to pick from 
among a slew of ambitious political novices in their party's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Democratic Party leaders will be watching the primary performance of 
Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor. Schiff must overcome two rivals to 
earn the right to run in November against Assemblyman James E. Rogan, the 
freshly minted Republican incumbent from Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing no opposition in their primaries are state Assemblywoman Paula Boland 
(R-Granada Hills), Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), Assemblywoman Barbara 
Friedman (D-Van Nuys), Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) and Assemblyman 
William (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale). 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran lawmaker Rosenthal, who has been endorsed by the powerful political 
organization headed by U.S. Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Howard 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), can be expected to easily overpower Michael Del Rio, 
his sole Democratic rival in the 20th Senate District primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal is seeking the 20th District seat after a period of political tumult 
that began after reapportionment moved his district from its familiar West 
Side-based moorings to central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a new political home, Rosenthal ran in 1992 for the West Side-based 
23rd Senate District seat which put him at loggerheads with another 
reapportionment refugee, Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden won that costly and bitter battle between Democrats, leaving Rosenthal 
with the option of resigning, running for reelection in his new heavily Latino 
central Los Angeles district or seeking more hospitable political turf. 
Rosenthal chose the latter course and aimed his sights at the Van Nuys seat 
being vacated by Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rosenthal seems a shoo-in in his new political digs, the outcome is 
less predictable in the 20th Senate District GOP primary which features gun 
store owner Randy Linkmeyer, realtor Dolores White and contractor Larry Martz. 
A fourth GOP candidate, Al Dib, a retired green grocer and perennial office 
seeker, has stepped aside and endorsed Linkmeyer although his name remains on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 White is the best known of the candidates. She sought the same seat in 1992 
and was main organizer of the failed April bid to recall Roberti. The recall 
was largely financed and inspired by Second Amendment activists upset by 
Roberti's authorship of a 1989 measure to ban certain military-style 
semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 By 59% to 41%, voters rejected the recall and kept Roberti in office. But term 
limits bar Roberti from seeking reelection. He is running for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 White received 26% of the vote on the second portion of the recall ballot that 
asked voters to pick the candidate they wanted to replace Roberti. Linkmeyer, 
also among the candidates, got 16% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal has some of the same characteristics as Roberti: both are considered 
liberals, both have been gun control supporters and both have invited charges 
of carpetbagging by moving their political bases to the Valley. But some doubt 
if Rosenthal will suffer the same troubles that vexed Roberti's political 
career in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Russ Howard, a leader of Californians Against Corruption, a 
group that was instrumental in the April recall election against Roberti, said 
his organization is unlikely to challenge Rosenthal. Unlike Roberti, who for 13 
years was Senate president, Rosenthal is not the high-profile exemplar of the 
bankruptcy of the state's political leadership, Howard said. "He is not a 
symbol," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others suspect that the forces that tried to recall Roberti are too exhausted 
from their recent campaign to mount a challenge to Rosenthal. "We're not 
hearing anything about them getting involved," said Lynette Stevens, 
Rosenthal's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest state legislative races in the Valley have developed around the 
decisions of two incumbents to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st Assembly District, a Democratic Party primary donnybrook was 
triggered when Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood) decided to seek a 
Superior Court judgeship rather than seek reelection to a seat where Democrats 
have a voter registration edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The other free-for-all has erupted around the efforts of seven Democrats to 
win their party's nomination in the 42nd Assembly District. The lion's share of 
the district is comprised of the communities of Hollywood, Fairfax, Bel-Air, 
Westwood and Brentwood and the cities of West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, all 
located south of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district also includes Encino, Sherman Oaks and Studio City in the 
Valley. Except for a very small stretch, the district covers the entire Ventura 
Boulevard commercial corridor from Valjean Avenue to Lankershim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) to run for state 
insurance commissioner sparked the 42nd District race.  
</P>
<P>
 In no time, the Democratic primary was teeming with ambitious, voter-tested 
West Side office seekers. The Democratic primary candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Slavkin, a Los Angeles school board member since 1989, has been 
endorsed by his former boss, retiring Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, 
and by U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). Slavkin's mother is an 
aide to Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Community College District board member Wally Knox is being 
endorsed by Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-Van Nuys). Friedman is a close 
friend of Knox's wife, Elizabeth Garfield, who was elected to the community 
college board herself last year. Knox, an attorney, has served on the board 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Koretz, a West Hollywood city councilman since 1988, has been endorsed 
by state Sen. Rosenthal and by Los Angeles City Councilmen John Ferraro and 
Joel Wachs. Koretz's wife is a top aide to Wachs. Koretz, who works as a 
political consultant, was a paid political adviser to Wachs' 1993 mayoral 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abbe Land, a West Hollywood city councilwoman since 1986, is backed by a 
number of women's organizations and by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 * Civil rights attorney John Duran, who ran against Margolin in 1992, is 
appealing to gay voters as the author of laws protecting homosexuals from 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laura Lake, a UCLA educator, has gained strong name identification by 
running in 1989 and 1993 against Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * Criminal defense attorney Bruce Margolin -- no relation to the retiring 
incumbent -- supports the legalization of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Republican in the 42nd Assembly District primary is Robert Davis, a 
West Hollywood businessman. Also running is Libertarian Eric Michael Fine, a 
business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 43rd Assembly District GOP primary, Assemblyman Rogan faces three 
rivals as he tries to keep a grip on the Glendale-Burbank-based seat filled in 
a May 3 special election to replace Pat Nolan, who had resigned after pleading 
guilty to political racketeering. Nolan is now in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's GOP contenders are Joseph Pietroforte, a retired public accountant; 
David Wallis, a businessman and engineer; and Louis Morelli, president of a 
taxpayers organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former municipal court judge, is expected to handily win the 
nomination for the new two-year term, especially because his main challengers, 
LAPD Officer Peter Repovich and Los Angeles Community College trustee Julia Wu, 
have bowed out of the race. Repovich and Wu's names appear on the ballot, but 
the pair suspended campaigning at the urging of Republican party leaders in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 43rd District Democratic primary, Schiff, a former assistant U.S. 
attorney, is expected to easily win. A moderate Democrat, Schiff is seen as a 
possible threat to Rogan in November in the recently redrawn district whose 
attenuating GOP roots were exposed in 1992, when local voters favored President 
Clinton and U.S. Sens. Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's two Democratic primary foes are Craig Freis, a Glendale businessman, 
and Ken Kulpa of Burbank who has no ballot designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as a Libertarian in the 43rd District is Willard Michlin, a real 
estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six races with unchallenged incumbents, the candidates in the primaries 
of the opposing parties are: 
</P>
<P>
 * 36th District (Republican Knight is the incumbent): James Hutchins is the 
sole Democratic primary entrant, and Eric Fussell is the Libertarian candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 38th District (Republican Boland is the incumbent): John Arce, a student, 
and Donald Cocquyt, an attorney and horseman, are vying for the nomination in 
the Democratic primary while Green party member Charles Wilken, a teacher, is 
running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 39th District (Democrat Katz is the incumbent): Nicholas Fitzgerald, no 
occupation listed, is the sole candidate in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 40th District (Democrat Friedman is the incumbent): Noel DeGaetano, a small 
businessman, is the only candidate in the GOP primary, while Kelley Ross, a 
Libertarian, is unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 44th District (Republican Hoge is the incumbent): Bruce Philpott, the former 
police chief of Pasadena, is the only candidate in the Democratic primary. Ken 
Saurenman, a contractor, is the Libertarian candidate.

NEW TRIAL IS DENIED IN '79 OXNARD KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 36-year-old former Oxnard man who claims that he was mentally ill when he 
pleaded guilty to killing a bar bouncer will not be given a new trial, a 
Ventura County Superior Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Melecio Cardona, who has already served 12 years of a 15-years-to-life 
sentence, had asked Judge Lawrence Storch to grant a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardona claimed that he was mentally ill when he pleaded guilty in 1984 to 
shooting Valerio Castillo, 49. The victim was a bouncer at El Obrero Bar on 5th 
Street in Oxnard when he died in October, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Willard P. Wiksell, who represented Cardona in the case, testified 
that Cardona did not seem to have any unusual psychological problems at the 
time of the plea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not singing songs or banging his head against the wall," Wiksell 
testified during the two-day hearing. "It (the plea) was his choice. He got a 
tremendous benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist also testified that he did not believe that Cardona suffered 
from psychological problems. Dr. Donald A. Patterson testified it was his 
opinion that Cardona just did not like prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cardona was very unhappy in prison," Patterson said. "He didn't like to 
share bunks and got into fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said Cardona once spent two straight years in "the hole," or 
solitary confinement.

POLICE IDENTIFY SIMI MAN KILLED BY COMMUTER TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man killed Friday after being hit by a Metrolink train was 
identified Saturday as Darren Fisher, 32.  
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was struck at about 5:25 p.m. after he tried to pull his dog from the 
railroad tracks, a police spokesman said.Fisher's dog also was killed in the 
accident.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident is the second Metrolink fatality in Ventura County and the fourth 
fatal Metrolink accident so far this year, a Metrolink spokesman said Friday. 
Ventura County's first fatal Metrolink accident occurred on Christmas Eve, 
1992, when a Simi Valley man committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the victim in Friday's accident was thrown about 30 feet into 
dense brush north of the tracks and was believed to have died instantly. His 
dog's body was found nearby.

OBITUARIES ; MARY VIRGINIA CAREY; CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Virginia Carey of Ventura, an author of children's books, died Friday at 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura after a long struggle with emphysema. 
She was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey worked for several years with Walt Disney Productions, writing 
novelizations of such movies as "Mary Poppins," "The Jungle Book" and "Peter 
Pan." In 1969, she began to work as a free-lance author, completing more than 
10 books in the "Three Investigators" series for Random House.  
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Gertrude Ryan of New York, said Carey was proudest of her 1985 
novel, "A Place for Allie." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was based on our mother's life as a child and her trip from Nova Scotia to 
Boston," Ryan said. "I think that personal book was the one she was most proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was a board member for the American Lung Assn. and a member of the 
Society of Children's Book Writers. Her sister said she was also an avid 
beachcomber. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her sister and a niece, also of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be at 9 a.m. Monday at Our Lady of the Assumption Church 
in Ventura. She will be buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Flushing, N.Y. In lieu 
of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the American Lung Assn.

RIVALS FACE HURDLES IN PLAN TO BOOST TOURISM; ECONOMY: LANCASTER AND PALMDALE 
HOPE TO SET UP A VISITOR AND FILM PANEL. BUT NEGOTIATING THE PROJECT MAY BE 
DIFFICULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On one point, Lancaster and Palmdale leaders agree: An aggressive, 
well-financed campaign to lure tourists, film crews and conventions to the 
Antelope Valley could give the region a badly needed economic boost. 
</P>
<P>
 But putting this idea into action is turning into a tough challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say they must come up with a marketing plan that will satisfy city 
officials and business owners in the rival cities of Lancaster and Palmdale. In 
addition, they must figure out who will run the proposed Antelope Valley 
Tourism and Film Commission -- and who will pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a wonderful success it if can happen," said Lancaster Councilman 
George Runner. "But there's a lot of land mines out there that they have to 
avoid." 
</P>
<P>
 Runner will represent Lancaster on Wednesday at a meeting of the new Antelope 
Valley Regional Partnership. The organization is slated to discuss the proposed 
Tourism and Film Commission at that meeting, which begins at 2:30 p.m. at 
Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regional Partnership group was formed as a result of a recent study 
commissioned by Antelope Valley officials. In it, Chicago-based PHH Fantus 
Consulting urged the two cities and the county to pool their resources and work 
together to improve the region's economy, which has been hit hard by setbacks 
in the aerospace and home-building industries. 
</P>
<P>
 One key recommendation was the creation of an Antelope Valley Tourism and Film 
Commission, a nonprofit organization directed by a board with representatives 
from the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster and the chambers of commerce in each 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The group would try to attract to the Antelope Valley more movie makers and 
conventions, which would bring in needed money for local hotels, restaurants 
and other businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 To finance this new organization, the Fantus report urged that the cities use 
transient occupancy tax money, sometimes called bed taxes, collected from 
guests at local hotels and motels. Lancaster's bed tax is 7% of the room 
charge, while Palmdale's is 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, bed taxes are collected to offset the cost of providing city 
services, such as street maintenance and law enforcement, to non-residents who 
are staying at local inns. Palmdale and Lancaster both put this tax money into 
their general fund for day-to-day city operations. 
</P>
<P>
 By bumping up its bed tax from 7% to 8%, Lancaster could provide about 
$114,000 annually for the proposed Tourism and Film Commission, city officials 
said. Palmdale, which has fewer hotels, could provide another $50,000 by 
allocating 10% of its current bed tax income to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these changes require the city councils' approval, but local officials 
say they won't tinker with the bed tax unless local hotel operators approve. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the innkeepers in his city believe that 
Palmdale and Lancaster must charge the same bed tax before they will endorse 
its use for the Tourism and Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for a level playing field," he said. "What I would suggest is 
we meet halfway" at 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Duggan, director of sales and marketing at the Holiday Inn in Palmdale, 
said that when a movie crew wants to reserve dozens of local rooms, the higher 
bed tax in Palmdale puts her at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, it's beneficial for film crews to go to Lancaster because the 
tax is less," Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bed-tax issue can be resolved, local leaders must still determine who 
would run the Tourism and Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Positioning itself for that job is the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. Two 
years ago, the chamber asked the Lancaster City Council to raise the bed tax by 
1%, then give that money to the chamber to promote tourism and attract film 
crews. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council rejected that idea, saying local hotel owners did not support 
the bed-tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with the economy still sluggish, the marketing proposal is more likely 
to win approval, said Sandra Dack, executive director of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hotels are ready to make a move up" in the bed tax, Dack said. 
"Now, it's just complicated by what the relationship with the city of Palmdale 
and the Palmdale chamber will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Using its own staff, funds and volunteers, the Lancaster chamber has already 
set up the Antelope Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau and High Desert Film 
Commission, which hopes to provide filmmakers with information on shooting 
locations and local actors and extras. 
</P>
<P>
 Dack believes the chamber could put more money into marketing than an 
independent organization in a separate location because it already has a 
building, phone lines, office equipment and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fischer, co-owner of the Desert Inn in Lancaster, said he wouldn't mind 
if the proposed Tourism and Film Commission shared space and some staff members 
with the Lancaster chamber. But he does not believe Dack could simultaneously 
oversee the chamber and the Tourism and Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it's a conflict," he said. "I think it's a pure and simple 
time problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dack believes the new organization could serve Palmdale and Lancaster 
in an evenhanded manner, some local leaders are worried that its ties to the 
Lancaster chamber would lead to a preference for hotels and businesses in that 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe this effort can withstand even the perception of that," said 
Ledford, Paldmale's mayor. "The reality is that we need to be very clear to 
both cities and both chambers that we have a clearinghouse with equal 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford pointed out that Palmdale and Lancaster recently put aside their 
rivalry to set up a joint program to attract new industrial employers to the 
area. He said the same sort of cooperation will be needed to set up an Antelope 
Valley Tourism and Film Commission.

TEEN FATALLY SHOT IN FRONT OF CROWDED FOUNTAIN VALLEY STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old was shot repeatedly in front of a crowded karaoke studio early 
Saturday in a fatal attack that police said appeared to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the first homicide this year in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released pending notification of his relatives, 
was standing with a group of people in the parking lot of Elvis Karaoke 
Studios, 18914 Brookhurst St., when the shooting occurred at 12:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim and his friends attempted to get into the karaoke studio, but it 
was so busy that night that they had to turn around," said Sgt. Dann Bean. 
"They were attempting to leave when the shooting took place." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that three people in a light-colored Toyota Celica drove 
up to the studio's parking lot and provoked a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a male passenger wearing a yellow bandanna over his face got out of 
the car, waved a gun around, yelled a gang name and exchanged words with the 
victim before opening fire, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six bullets were fired, and the victim was struck in the torso, the 
abdomen, hand and calf. His companions took the teen-ager to Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center, where he died a short time later. No one 
else was injured in the attack, although several people were standing near the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants drove away after the shooting and remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detectives, who were alerted by hospital officials about the shooting, 
interviewed people at the hospital and at the shooting scene, but the 
investigation has been hampered by "extremely uncooperative witnesses," Bean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started rounding up as many people as we could, but we weren't able to 
find out much of anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said the shooting has the trademarks of the drive-by shooting typical of 
Asian gangs. The shooter typically steps out of the car and makes contact with 
the victim before firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials consider these shootings to be potentially more 
threatening to the general population than drive-by shootings committed by 
Latino gangs because Asian gangs don't claim neighborhoods, so the shootings 
can occur anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a similar drive-by shooting occurred at the Family Fun Center in 
Fountain Valley. A gunman fired six shots into a crowd and injured three 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were similar situations, where the gunman gets out of the car and fires 
in a public place," Bean said.

L.A. TALLY OF VACATED BUILDINGS DROPS BY 30%; DAMAGE: BUILDING AND SAFETY 
OFFICIALS MISTAKENLY ADDED 9,000 DWELLINGS TO THE LIST OF STRUCTURES LEFT EMPTY 
AFTER JAN. 17 QUAKE. FEMA FUNDING WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 The number of homes and businesses vacated in the city of Los Angeles because 
of earthquake damage is actually 30% lower than was previously cited, city 
officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to a clerical error, city building and safety officials until recently had 
said that 30,680 homes and businesses were vacant due to quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only 21,536 were vacated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Takaki, a building and safety supervisor, said the error occurred when 
a notation in a report for $9,000 worth of damage to one dwelling unit was 
erroneously counted as 9,000 dwelling units vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other buildings were taken off the list because they are no longer empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The error will not affect quake funding from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency because most of that money is doled out as a reimbursement for costs 
paid out by the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the City Council's Public Safety Committee, the 
Building and Safety Department said the quake forced the evacuation of 20,844 
residential units, 336 commercial buildings, 314 mixed-use structures and 42 
other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Total damage to buildings in the city has been estimated at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the Public Safety Committee recommended that beginning 
next year all new and remodeled buildings be required to have a gas valve that 
automatically shuts off during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Councilman Marvin Braude, chairman of the committee, 
modifies a proposal originally offered by Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernson proposal failed to get approval because council members feared 
that the gas valves currently on the market may be triggered too easily, 
cutting off gas flow due to vandalism, accidents or small aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to send the proposal to Braude's committee for further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude recommended that the ordinance requiring gas shut-off valves be adopted 
but not take effect until July, 1995, to give manufacturers time to make 
adjustments to the device so that they only shut off gas during severe quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives for two gas-valve manufacturers told Braude at a hearing 
that they could make such adjustments fairly easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Picott, a bureau chief for the Building and Safety Department, who was 
critical of Bernson's original proposal, said he supported the modifications 
suggested by Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be a fair proposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson could not be reached for comment. The City Council will reconsider the 
proposal June 16.

TAKE TWO HERBS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING; HEALTH: FOR A GROWING NUMBER OF 
PARENTS -- AND DOCTORS -- THE TREATMENT OF CHOICE IS HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES.

<P>
 When Gail Gutierrez's 13-month-old son Daniel was found to have a double ear 
infection, the Santa Monica woman left her pediatrician's office with the 
requisite prescription for antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gutierrez had no intention of filling it. The prescription was only meant 
as a backup in case Daniel didn't respond to this brew: pulsatilla, an oral 
homeopathic remedy; the herb echinacea, and Mullin oil, an herbal eardrop 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days later, when Gutierrez returned to the pediatrician for a follow-up 
exam, her son's infection had cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always used homeopathic remedies," says Gutierrez, 27. "Daniel's never 
had antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy, a 200-year-old practice involving the use of minute doses of 
pharmaceutical agents, has long been big on the Westside, where some embrace 
alternative living as religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain drug stores here offer homeopathic remedies over-the-counter and several 
pharmacies specialize in homeopathic remedies and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, the alternative healing method is being used on 
children -- to treat maladies ranging from teething pain and colic to upper 
respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Though homeopathic remedies themselves are considered harmless -- they are 
exempt from federal Food and Drug Administration regulations -- the trend 
toward pediatric homeopathy makes some local physicians nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially, they warn, parents who use homeopathy might allow a child's cold 
or ear infection to steadily worsen, perhaps eventually leading to pneumonia or 
loss of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is that a small number of hard-core homeopathy adherents 
refuse to have their children vaccinated out of concern that vaccines might be 
harmful. That, experts say, could expose children to outbreaks of 
life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such worries, however, the demand for homeopathic treatment is rising 
-- and a growing number of physicians are taking steps to meet it. These 
doctors see at least some merit to homeopathy, and some of them credit patients 
for making them aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of my practice turns to homeopathy," said Dr. Jay Gordon, a pediatrician 
with offices in Santa Monica and Malibu who describes himself as self-taught in 
homeopathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really started listening to my patients who felt antibiotics and tubes 
didn't always work (for ear infections) and who didn't like antibiotics' side 
effects. And bacteria have developed a resistance to antibiotics. It is 
frightening. We need to try different methods to treat children." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy (from the Greek Homios, for similar, and pathos, for suffering) is 
based on the belief that a substance that causes certain symptoms can cure 
those symptoms when administered in microdoses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a tincture of belladonna, derived from a highly poisonous, 
fever-inducing plant called deadly nightshade, is used to fight fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The remedies are intended to act on the same principle that allergy shots do, 
selectively stimulating the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy has become a booming business nationwide, experts say. According to 
U.S. homeopathic manufacturers, it generates $250 million in annual sales and 
is growing at a rate of 25% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critics liken homeopathic remedies to placebos and faith healing. The 
compounds, they assert, are so diluted that virtually no molecules from the 
original substance are left in them, rendering them impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeopathic practitioners contend that molecules from the compounds they 
use imprint a kind of permanent energy pattern on the surrounding water 
molecules. Those water molecules, they say, become activated and more powerful 
when shaken vigorously, producing a highly effective medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 And homeopathy appears to be gaining some legitimacy in the United States, as 
it already has in Europe. A report on the first clinical trial of homeopathy by 
a U.S. doctor was published this month in "Pediatrics," a respected medical 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, a physician who uses only homeopathy in her practice in 
Evergreen, Wash., reported on a study she conducted using homeopathy in 
conjunction with oral rehydration to treat diarrhea in children, the leading 
cause of death for children worldwide. The study showed a decrease in diarrhea 
of about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 A repeat study is now under way in Nepal, said Jacobs, who also hopes to do a 
study on the use of homeopathy in the treatment of ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the alternative medicines branch of the National Institutes of 
Health earlier this year gave the first federal grant to study the 
effectiveness of homeopathy. The recipient was Michael Goldstein, a UCLA 
researcher and professor of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supposedly, there were more applications for this grant than ever in the 
history of NIH, which shows there is a lot of public interest in it," said 
Goldstein, who plans to track the treatment of 130 adult patients in the care 
of five Los Angeles homeopathic practitioners for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that people who've repeatedly (sought) mainstream medicine but have 
been dissatisfied, then turn to alternative medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathy has been popular for at least 20 years on the Westside, where the 
evidence of alternative health care includes underwater birthing centers, 
burgeoning midwife practices and the College of Homeopathy, which is in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica alone, there are an estimated 70 homeopathic practitioners, 
called homeopaths or homeopathics, who have received diplomas from homeopathy 
schools in the United States or abroad. Of the five Los Angeles-area pharmacies 
that specialize in the sale of homeopathic medicines, four are located on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 And such chain drug stores as Thrifty and Sav-on are scrambling to accommodate 
consumers, offering popular homeopathic remedies for children's problems, 
including teething, colic, bed-wetting and coughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Local pediatricians say that in the last three years there has been a decided 
increase in the number of parents asking that their children be treated 
homeopathically. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest has grown as parents have learned about homeopathy at birthing 
centers, mother support groups, natural parenting groups, food co-ops or just 
in parent-to-parent conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 With competition among doctors and hospitals especially fierce on the 
Westside, the local medical community is going to great lengths to meet the 
demand. Some medical doctors, for instance, have attended homeopathic colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Dr. Lauren Feder, a medical doctor who attended the British 
Institute of Homeopathy three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents that I see are saying that they aren't getting what they need from 
allopathic medicine, that they don't want another antibiotic," said Feder, 
whose Santa Monica practice serves both children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allopathic medicine helps the body suppress symptoms and blames outside 
causes rather than an internal weakening of the individual system for the 
problem. As homeopaths, we treat constitutional weaknesses and symptoms as a 
whole and stimulate the immune system to fight off (disease and infection)." 
</P>
<P>
 That approach appeals to people such as Barbara Olinger of Venice, a mother of 
two who discovered homeopathy five years ago through a mother support group 
that grew out of the Venice Ocean Park Food Co-op on Brooks Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with stacks of books on homeopathy and container after container of tiny 
white homeopathic pills in her medicine cabinet, she has put the practice to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 While on a camping trip recently with parents and children from the co-op, she 
passed out homeopathic pills derived from poison ivy. Though there was a great 
deal of poison ivy, she said, none of the children got rashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers in the group used (homeopathic remedies) and it kind of became a 
learn-as-you go kind of thing," said Olinger, who plugs homeopathy at support 
groups that she runs for mothers at Santa Monica's YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many who treat their children with homeopathic remedies, however, Olinger 
is open to using conventional medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about (homeopathic medicine) is it has no side effects, like the 
diaper rashes, digestive problems and diarrhea that come with antibiotics," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I just cleared up an ear infection my son had with homeopathy. But I 
am not totally against acetaminophen and antibiotics, because I had pneumonia, 
and when homeopathy didn't work, I used antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Neal learned about homeopathy from a friend who handed her a book about 
it after hearing Neal complain about a sore throat that wasn't responding to 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal has treated her 25-month-old son, Luka, successfully with homeopathy for 
ear and upper respiratory infections. But when Luka got the flu, she visited 
her pediatrician, who told her to keep a close eye on her son. 
</P>
<P>
 After waking from sleep, Luka's left eye area was swollen to the size of a 
golf ball. Neal's pediatrician told her to rush him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had periorbital cellulitis, and it can travel to the brain and kill them," 
said Neal, who lives in Santa Monica. "I said, 'Give him the antibiotics now.' 
He was in the hospital for two days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said she is wary of antibiotics because she took so much tetracycline for 
throat infections over the years that she has become "immune to antibiotics." 
The drug also turned her teeth a dull gray, she said, prompting her to spend 
$10,000 for dental cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I am attracted to homeopathy is so I am not dependent on something 
that is destructive to your immune system," Neal said. "It also gives you some 
control over your own health. But I am kind of middle-of-the-road, half in 
Western medicine and half in alternative medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more rigid users of pediatric homeopathy. They tend to use 
homeopathic practitioners who take a holistic approach to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 These homeopathics typically spend an hour or more with parents, learning 
about the child's symptoms and asking a seemingly bizarre range of other 
questions: Does she fear barking dogs? Does she wake up happy from her naps? 
Does she like sweet, sour or spicy foods? What does her sweat smell like? 
</P>
<P>
 Homeopathics say this allows them to treat a child's mind and body based on 
their unique set of symptoms and their constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most orthodox adherents of homeopathy shun Western medical 
treatment almost altogether -- and draw the ire of physicians who believe they 
unnecessarily place their children at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Hamilton, a Santa Monica pediatrician and assistant clinical 
professor at UCLA Medical School, acknowledges that there are medical 
applications for homeopathy. But he warns that there is also potential for 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if a child has a high fever and is taken to a homeopath and he has 
meningitis," Hamilton said. "That child might be diagnosed (too late), which 
can cause visual or neurological damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is ear infections, the second-leading ailment affecting 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of kids will get over their ear infections by doing nothing," said 
Dr. Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica pediatrician who practices conventional 
medicine but also advises parents on homeopathic remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loss of hearing is rare and primarily caused from chronic fluid in the ear, 
not from acute infection. The caveat we give to patients, whether they use 
antibiotics or homeopathics, is to watch it for three days and if it doesn't 
get better, (come back to the doctor.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Most physicians -- even many who see a role for homeopathy -- frown on parents 
and homeopathics who refuse to vaccinate children because of fears that the 
potential for harmful side effects from vaccines outweighs the benefits of the 
inoculations.

KHALLID MUHAMMAD EXHORTS CROWD WITH HIS STRIDENT MESSAGE; RACE: CRENSHAW 
SPECTATORS FERVENTLY APPLAUD EX-NATION OF ISLAM AIDE, REVILED BY MANY AS A 
HATEMONGER. BACKERS SAY HE PREACHES SELF-SUFFICIENCY.

<P>
 Khallid Abdul Muhammad, condemned nationally by most black and white leaders 
as a racist hatemonger, was greeted with fervent applause Saturday night by a 
mostly black audience of more than 1,000 in a Crenshaw district theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad -- fired last year from his job as a senior aide to Louis Farrakhan, 
head of the Nation of Islam -- displayed once again his strident brand of black 
nationalism that is routinely laced with condemnation of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that blacks have suffered more than Jews at the hands of oppressors 
("the black holocaust is one hundred times worse than any other holocaust," he 
said at one point), Muhammad quickly launched into the kind of name-calling and 
racial mockery that has earned him national enmity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let those bagel-eating, hooked-nosed . . . wanna-be Jews make you 
think" that Jews have been persecuted more than blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He also read a list of prominent Jewish entertainment and news media 
executives, denouncing most of them for promoting negative images of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing long, royal-blue robes over a crisp white shirt, Muhammad theatrically 
listed some of the most tragic episodes in the history of black people in 
America, starting with the horrors of the slave ship crossings. As his voice 
rose in indignation, insisting that recognition of black suffering had been 
repressed, the crowd applauded and shouted words of agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he came to one of his most emotional statements -- "the worst 
crime that can be committed is to be robbed of self-knowledge" -- the audience 
erupted in frenzied applause and screams of agreement that nearly drowned out 
Muhammad's voice.  
</P>
<P>
 There were also moments of dark humor. Arguing that Jesus was black, Muhammad 
said: "The Bible said Jesus would have hair like lamb's wool, that nappy hair . 
. . I'm talking about a black lord, a black Jesus, a black savior. Take that 
cracker down off your wall and throw him in the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience screamed in delight.  
</P>
<P>
 The crowd that came to see Muhammad did so out of a mixture of curiosity and 
almost-religious support. 
</P>
<P>
 The believers said Muhammad had touched a strong chord among American blacks 
and that his strength was his appeal to black self-sufficiency, not racism -- 
and that some of his outrageousness should be taken figuratively.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's telling black people to rise and take care of ourselves," said UCLA 
student Susan Leach, 21. "I believe in everything he says. I think it's white 
people who make the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not anti-Semitic or racist," said Patrick Pritchett, 41. "How could he 
be? How can the first people on earth be racist or anti-Semitic?" 
</P>
<P>
 There were a smattering of white faces in the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm curious to hear him in person," said Farley Ziegler, 31, as she waited in 
line outside the Vision Complex Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old black woman standing behind Ziegler patted her arm. "Good 
answer," said Michelle Clary of San Diego. "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with a lot of the things he says," Clary added, "but like her 
(Ziegler), I want to see for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the theater, the Crenshaw neighborhood took on the air of a street 
festival, intensified by a rally held in adjacent Leimert Park by a group 
called the All-African People's Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the hall, all members of the crowd and the press were frisked for 
weapons. Women's handbags were searched, and all objects, including pens and 
makeup containers, were scrutinized. When the speeches began, the crowd was 
treated to what seemed like a cross between the impassioned spirit of a rally 
and the fervor of a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad was preceded onstage by actor Wesley Snipes, who was sitting in the 
front row, and rapper Ice-T gave a rousing speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Also onstage were such guests as Georgiana Williams, the mother of Los Angeles 
riot defendant Damian Monroe Williams, and Celes King, a well-known bail 
bondsman and former president of the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission and 
the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. At one point, speakers asked for money to reimburse the sponsoring 
organization, the Crenshaw Improvement Assn., for the cost of renting the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Muhammad has no problem filling lecture halls at $10,000 a speech, he 
rarely finds vocal public support, and last week in Los Angeles was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 One local community activist who supports Muhammad refused to speak about him 
for attribution, for fear that financial benefactors, local and national, would 
be outraged by his connection to someone perceived as "anti-Semitic, racist or 
violent in overtone." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Vision Complex, actress Marla Gibbs, said she leased it 
because "it's a rental. I'd rent it to you if you wanted to speak. I'm not 
connected to it."  
</P>
<P>
 Most established scholars say that in their bitter analysis of oppression and 
racism against blacks, Muhammad and the Nation of Islam have many of their 
statistics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The academics Muhammad admires and quotes are members of established 
universities, but are coming increasingly under fire for their own anti-Semitic 
views. Muhammad also uses as a source the Nation of Islam's "The Secret 
Relationship Between Blacks and Jews" -- a book Henry Louis Gates Jr., a 
Harvard professor and chairman of the school's Afro-American studies 
department, has called "the bible of the new anti-Semitism."

GRIFFITH PARK SOUTH; OPEN SPACE: A 6,600-ACRE PORTION OF THE IRVINE CO.'S 
RESERVE WILL BE OPENED. COMPANY OFFICIAL SAYS IT WILL BE AN ORANGE COUNTY 
CENTERPIECE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 4-year-old promise to open a vast swath of land that has been closed to the 
public -- the 6,600-acre southern portion of the Irvine Co. Open Space Reserve 
-- is about to be fulfilled, company officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., said the land, which will open next 
month, will rival the greatest urban parks in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the centerpiece of the county, like Central Park is the 
centerpiece of New York," Bren said of the open space, which is being created 
in exchange for development rights on adjacent land. "It will be to Orange 
County what Griffith Park is to Los Angeles; a place bringing relaxation and 
relief from our busy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible asset that has been blocked by barbed wire for more than a 
century," Bren said of the parcel, which stretches from Coast Highway near 
Laguna Beach inland through Emerald Canyon and from Laguna Canyon Road to 
Crystal Cove State Park. "We think it is socially and botanically important to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Irvine Co., the county's largest developer, announced in 1990 that 
it intended to eventually make the property accessible to the public via 
docent-led tours. However, the opening of the reserve's southern Emerald Canyon 
portion, which was scheduled for last October, had to be postponed because of 
the Laguna Beach fire, which destroyed about 80% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven months since then, the area has experienced a dramatic recovery, 
experts say. So on Saturday, it was announced Thursday, the public will be able 
to hike through the area for the first time, accompanied by docents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to witness firsthand the recovery from the fire," said Trish 
Smith, a Nature Conservancy biologist overseeing the project. "It really is 
quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the company signed an agreement with the Nature Conservancy -- a 
nonprofit conservation organization -- to preserve and protect the natural 
resources of the land while developing a program to provide public access to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covered three pieces of Irvine Co. land totaling 11,000 acres. 
The pieces are not contiguous, but all are along Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the program began with the opening of Limestone Canyon to 
docent-led tours. The program is expected to be completed this fall with the 
opening of 2,800 acres in Weir/Gypsum Canyon farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the southern 6,600 acres in Emerald Canyon are getting the attention, 
especially after the land's impressive recovery from the devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
 An advance tour by van of the reserve Thursday revealed the bustling of 
natural life resuming. Where six months ago the landscape looked black and 
barren, it now provides nourishment for fields of purple wild hyacinths, red 
Indian paintbrushes and yellow California sunflowers. And a land not too long 
ago seemingly devoid of life now supports red-tailed hawks, meadowlarks, 
bobcats and mule deer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith, strenuous five-hour hiking tours led by Nature Conservancy 
volunteers will be available on the first and third Saturday mornings and 
afternoons of each month beginning Saturday. Also, 13-mile mountain cycling 
tours and 10-mile equestrian tours will be offered twice monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 To make reservations for tours, call (714) 832-7478. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be here and think that you're the only person in the world," said 
Monica Floria, one of the firm's senior vice presidents, gazing wistfully at 
the green and brown hills during the recent tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great experience coming out here," Smith said. "People are always 
amazed at the vastness of the open space. Every time I come here I experience 
something totally different. That's what keeps me excited; there's a surprise 
around every corner."

GELLER TO BE 1ST FEMALE RABBI OF LARGE CONGREGATION; RELIGION: ASSUMING 
LEADERSHIP OF TEMPLE EMANUEL IN BEVERLY HILLS PROMISES TO THRUST THE VETERAN 
ACTIVIST INTO NATIONAL PROMINENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was the summer of 1967, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
was meeting in a sweltering Memphis, Tenn., church hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Geller, a college student and one of only a few whites to attend the 
civil rights meeting, had stepped outside for a breath of air. 
</P>
<P>
 She was beginning to feel that she didn't belong, she confided to a veteran 
SCLC organizer. His reply helped turn her life around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're right," he said. "You don't belong. You should go home to your own 
community and organize there." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller has been working in her community ever since, as campus rabbi at USC 
for 14 years, and most recently as the highly visible executive director of the 
American Jewish Congress, a civil rights and political action group. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 44, Geller is about to step into national prominence as the first 
woman rabbi to head a large congregation -- Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The third woman ever ordained as a rabbi in the liberal Reform movement, which 
claims the allegiance of an estimated 40% of synagogue-affiliated Jews, she has 
even made a name for herself among some traditionalists who reject her ideology 
and do not recognize the right of women to be rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very warm, engaging person, with a brilliant mind," said Rabbi Daniel 
Landes of B'nai David-Judea, an Orthodox congregation in the Pico-Robertson 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller has counseled students, helped found a feminist center, worked to 
establish a dialogue between Jewish and Arab Americans in Los Angeles and 
spoken out for abortion rights and against violence here and in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also created various rituals to help congregants deal with life crises 
such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a great person," said another Orthodox leader, who declined to be 
quoted by name, "but she will stand up when the buttons are pushed to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel has seen its share of fighting. It has been racked by years of 
conflict over a previous rabbi, who left amid controversy over synagogue 
expansion plans, and, more recently, by a thwarted merger with the larger and 
richer Wilshire Boulevard Temple. Leaders say they hope the fighting is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just flying on a cloud. The response (to the hiring) has been 
tremendous," said Bruce Corwin, president-elect of the temple, who helped lead 
the fight to keep the 56-year-old institution independent. 
</P>
<P>
 With a flourishing day school and a prime location on Burton Way, Temple 
Emanuel has lost a few hundred families since its membership hit a high of 
1,200 families in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 900 families, however, it is still one of the largest Jewish 
congregations in the country and clearly the largest to be served by a woman as 
senior rabbi, said Rabbi Lennard R. Thal, regional director of the Reform 
Movement's Union of American Hebrew Congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large congregations are in suburban San Diego, with 650 families, and 
downtown Boston, with 575 member families. 
</P>
<P>
 With $500,000 in pledges in hand to help counter a reported debt of $2 
million, Corwin said he expects Geller to bring in new members and rally the 
existing ones, "people who are willing to step up and say, 'Here's my money, I 
want to support this place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some veteran congregants may drop out, said Rabbi Emeritus Meyer Heller, who 
came back from retirement two years ago, "but we're going to gain many more 
than we lose." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who would find it difficult to accept a woman as their 
rabbi," said Heller, who plans to stay on part time. "I understand that 
feeling, but I hope they will meet her, hear her preach, hear her teach, before 
they make their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 16 candidates for the post, Corwin said, Geller was "the most rabbinic 
. . . with a feeling of spirituality that none of the others had." 
</P>
<P>
 The other co-chair, Harry Helft, whose side lost the merger fight, said she 
was "the best and the brightest, one that would . . . be able to heal our 
temple." 
</P>
<P>
 Helft said that gender was not a major factor in the decision to hire Geller. 
But Corwin said there were some questions before the committee made its 
unanimous vote, which was announced May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, is our congregation ready for a senior rabbi who happens to be a 
woman? And secondly, are her views too far to the left? And she answered the 
questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I have strong points of view and I respect other points of view.' 
She handled everything with grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller was not sure of her calling until the early 1970s, when she worked with 
college students as a volunteer chaplain at Vassar College during her second 
semester of rabbinical school at the Hebrew Union College's New York campus. 
</P>
<P>
 After her ordination in 1976, she went to USC, where she met young people of 
every stripe of Judaism, from secular to Orthodox. She also started looking to 
Jewish tradition for new ways to deal with the crises, challenges and turning 
points of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 During her first year at USC, one young woman startled her by seeking a Jewish 
way for dealing with the emotional aftermath of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a live Jewish woman in need of healing. (The abortion) was 
appropriate, but she was surprised at the feelings of loss and guilt. She asked 
if she could say kaddish (the prayer for the dead). I said she could not. Then 
we talked about her feelings of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, such pleas led to the creation, by her and others, of 
ceremonies for naming a newborn girl, dealing with miscarriage and marking 
events such as divorce, menopause, significant birthdays, children leaving home 
and retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the ceremonies have to be invented. In other cases, Geller says, 
they can be glimpsed in the Biblical text, such as Abraham's feast on the 
weaning of Isaac, which inspired a Seder-like party when Geller weaned her own 
son, now 11. A daughter, now 5, was similarly feted.  
</P>
<P>
 Divorced from their father for four years, Geller recently married Ben Bycel, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission, which monitors city 
government and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the rituals have been published in book chapters and magazine 
articles, Geller said she hopes to finish her own book on them before her Aug. 
1 starting date at Emanuel. "Fat chance," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judaism speaks to the real issues of our lives," she said. "How we live. How 
we love. I've learned . . . that the real challenge to the Jewish future is not 
intermarriage, Arab propaganda or anti-Semitism -- it's boredom." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to that, she suggested, lies in community and spirituality, two 
themes that worshipers at Emanuel will be hearing a lot about in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look for that in a lot of weird places," she said. "We have to realize 
that Judaism can provide it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the first female rabbis, Geller says she has relied on male role 
models. The small Reconstructionist movement opened its doors to women in 1974, 
while the middle-of-the-road Conservative movement did not ordain a woman until 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 As other women have donned rabbinical robes, she said, "I've been mentored by 
some of my younger colleagues, and they by me." 
</P>
<P>
 At Mishkon Tephilo, a Conservative synagogue with 240 families in Venice, 
Rabbi Naomi Levi said that Geller has been a model for her. But, she added, 
"for both me and Laura, ultimately, hopefully, the day will come when people 
make such a fuss not because we're women rabbis but because we're good rabbis. 
Hopefully, perhaps when the Messiah comes, that won't be a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Busy with campus problems and larger community relations issues since moving 
to the American Jewish Congress three years ago, Geller said that being "the 
first woman" has not been a big deal for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, "there's no question that I'm the first woman to be the senior 
rabbi of a synagogue this large, so again it's an issue. . . . People will want 
me to prove myself, and I will prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years of life experience will help, she said, along with a sense of 
humor -- "I don't think I would have survived till now without it."

FOR DETECTIVES, A CASE OF TOO MANY MURDERS TO SOLVE; CRIME: DUE TO AN EXTREMELY 
HEAVY CASELOAD ON THE EASTSIDE AND IN SOUTH-CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST L.A., MANY 
KILLERS ARE NEVER CAUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Muriel Polk sensed that something was terribly wrong when she heard a knock on 
the door early that morning. On her porch were two detectives who informed her 
that her 21-year-old son had been shot to death on a South-Central street. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than three years after Patrick Polk was found slumped over the 
steering wheel of his car, the case remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmed by more recent killings, detectives say they have been unable to 
devote the time needed to solve Polk's slaying. So, in her own quest for 
justice, Polk has sought the help of a private investigator and visited the 
crime scene herself to interview witnesses and gather statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating because (the police) don't have enough people to follow 
through on murders like they should -- I can vouch for that," she said. "They 
get new murders every day, and you get pushed further and further back." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Eastside and in South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, homicide 
detectives in 1993 investigated two to three times more cases each than did 
their counterparts in other areas of the city, Police Department data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's busiest homicide detail last year was the Eastside's Hollenbeck 
Division, where six detectives investigated 68 murders, or 22.6 cases per 
two-person team. In the Central Division, which covers Downtown, six detectives 
handled 32 homicides, or 10.6 cases per team. On the Westside, six detectives 
in the Pacific Division investigated 17 homicides, or 5.6 per team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bureau, which consists of four divisions and covers most of 
South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, 43 detectives investigated 412 
killings last year, or 17.9 cases per team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollenbeck Division and South Bureau details last year had the lowest 
percentage of arrests for homicide cases in the department, a result that 
commanders blame in large part on their detectives' heavy workloads. 
</P>
<P>
 In both details, investigators often work 18-hour days and juggle half a dozen 
or more cases at once, only to be interrupted by yet another slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer a team handling on the average 10 to 12 homicides a year," said 
Detective Ben Lovato, the Hollenbeck commander. "That gives you enough time to 
do a really thorough investigation and to do a thorough job in following the 
case as it is prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity in workloads raises serious questions about how detectives 
should be deployed, city officials say. The way the detective details are 
staffed now, the investigators in the deadliest neighborhoods have the least 
amount of time to work the greatest number of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every place needs more detectives, but they should be spread out more 
evenly," said Gary Greenebaum, president of the Los Angeles Police Commission. 
The current deployment "makes no sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that anybody presented with these numbers would agree that something 
has to be done," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose 9th District in 
South-Central had 191 homicides within its boundaries in 1993, more than any 
other council district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The allocation for the deployment of personnel should be according to the 
need in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials contend that a more accurate measure of detective 
workloads at each station should not only take into account homicides but also 
crimes such as robbery and burglary that are handled by other detective 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can look at the single issue of homicide and determine 
fairness," said Lt. John Dunkin, a department spokesman. "You have to take into 
consideration the entire detective workload." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said each station is allotted detectives based roughly on the number of 
all crimes reported in each area. "It's kind of a subjective thing that's 
evolved over the years." It is up to the individual station commanders to 
determine how to use their detectives, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an effort to take a more centralized approach to deployment, Chief 
Willie L. Williams' command staff recently formed a strategy committee to 
determine how to better utilize detectives citywide, department officials said. 
Recommendations are expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officials say that all investigative details are stretched to the 
limit in the department, which has decreased from 8,450 sworn personnel in 1991 
to about 7,600 now because of hiring freezes caused by the city's fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, just adding more detectives to a detail would not ensure that more 
cases will be solved. Criminologists and detectives say a host of other factors 
also come into play: the type of slaying, cooperation of witnesses, 
investigators' individual ability and persistence -- and luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some cases that you are not going to solve, regardless of how many 
people you deploy," said Deputy Chief Robert Gil, commander of the department's 
Central Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives refer to the easiest cases to solve as "smoking guns" or 
"self-solvers," such as domestic killings in which the suspect confesses at the 
scene. Those are very different from gang- and drug-related killings, in which 
witnesses often refuse to cooperate or go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollenbeck Division, 64% of the homicides last year were related to 
gangs or drugs. In the South Bureau, 60% of all homicide cases in 1993 required 
witnesses to be relocated or guarded for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area where there is some of the greatest resistance to work with 
law enforcement because of the fear of retribution," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, 
commander of the South Bureau homicide detail. He said other details have 
similar problems, but "the percentage of those things is greater on the south 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists and detectives say there is no standard figure on what 
constitutes an acceptable workload. But in general, they say, investigators 
have a greater chance for success if they have more time to work on a case 
without being interrupted by another killing. That is especially true during 
the first 48 hours of a case, when evidence is still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once an event takes place, you have to ask yourself how much time and energy 
police have to follow up on the case and whether they can maintain that same 
intensity over a period of time," said Albert Cardarelli, a University of 
Massachusetts criminologist who has done extensive research on homicide 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Police Department homicide details with the lightest caseloads 
generally had the highest clearance rates -- the percentage of homicide cases 
in which arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northeast Division, where six detectives investigated 6.6 cases per 
team, 96% of the cases were cleared. The six detectives in the Central Division 
cleared 104% of their cases (that figure exceeds 100% because it includes cases 
that originated in 1992 for which arrests were made in 1993). The clearance 
rates were 60% in Hollenbeck and 63% in the South Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patrick Polk killing is an example of a case that has suffered because of 
the workload facing South Bureau detectives, Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a case that can be made," he said, "but you got to put more time on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Polk was dead from a single gunshot wound when officers found him in his car 
near Century Boulevard and Gramercy Place on the night of Feb. 28, 1991. His 
1973 Buick Regal had smashed into a wall and a light post. Because the 
investigation is still going on, detectives declined to discuss a possible 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 From the onset, detectives faced the difficult task of obtaining information. 
No witnesses had been immediately identified, and investigators on the case 
were constantly interrupted by new killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about a year after the slaying, the backlog of cases became too 
great. The original investigative team passed Polk's case to the South Bureau's 
unsolved-murder team, a now-defunct unit of two detectives who handled the 
slayings that other investigators no longer had time to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case that needed a lot of legwork, and that team just didn't have 
the time because of the volume of fresh homicides that were a priority," said 
Detective Carolyn Flamenco, who took over the investigation.

HIGH-TECH LINK PROMOTES SCHOOL DESEGREGATION; EDUCATION: VIDEO SYSTEM CONNECTS 
LATINO AND WHITE STUDENTS AT FOUR ELEMENTARY CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME and JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using a high-tech video system, Latino elementary-school students in Norwalk 
and white students in La Mirada are taking part in a groundbreaking, 
state-funded integration program that keeps students off buses and in 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The live, two-way transmissions allow more than 1,000 students from four 
elementary schools to share -- over the airwaves -- lessons, activities, 
experiences and even friendships without ever leaving their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts question whether the effort constitutes true integration, and 
whether the program should be paid for with state desegregation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program doesn't render the Norwalk schools any less Latino or the La 
Mirada schools any less white," said Los Angeles law professor James A. 
Kushner, who has written widely on the history of segregation and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Local school officials insist, however, that their plan achieves integration 
and is a popular and relatively low-cost alternative to busing -- a form of 
desegregation that typically inspires heated opposition. The program also gives 
students an opportunity to learn about advanced video and computer equipment, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is the wave of the future and I think we're going in the right 
direction," said Ginger Shattuck, deputy superintendent for Norwalk-La Mirada 
Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a way to allow students to come together through the most current 
technology we have. This is a natural evolution for integration, and for us, 
better than adopting a forced integration plan or another form of voluntary 
integration." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the state has contributed $2.82 million -- about 80% of the costs -- 
apparently without judging whether the program is true desegregation or a 
proper use of state funds designated for desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the state Department of Education said they have no role in 
approving desegregation programs. With no apparent scrutiny, the department 
forwards the funding request to the Legislature, which makes an annual 
appropriation for desegregation programs. The state controller's office, which 
actually pays the bills, ensures only that the money is spent as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The local desegregation program, which is called Global Studies for 
Multicultural Understanding and began this year, matches mostly Latino classes 
from Edmondson and Sanchez schools in Norwalk with mostly Anglo classes from 
Dulles and Gardenhill schools in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the video encounters, the third-, fourth- and fifth-graders 
meet in person for occasional activities, including field trips and art 
projects. And their teachers instruct them on appreciating different cultures 
and races.  
</P>
<P>
 This emphasis on teaching cultural diversity, not the high-tech hardware, is 
the heart of the program, said program director Richard E. Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent school day, fourth-grader Gilbert Contreras, 10, from Edmondson 
School, was using the live, two-way link with Dulles School to plan part of a 
districtwide cultural festival. The June 9 gathering will feature plays, 
dances, songs and speeches by students from classes paired for the 
desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert was explaining to Kevin Smith, also 10, how to make a maraca by 
putting pebbles in a soft-drink can and attaching the can to the end of a 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert sat facing a customized cart holding a bank of portable video 
equipment. The gear included two 27-inch color monitors. On one monitor, 
Gilbert could see himself and his own classmates. On the other monitor, he 
could see and hear the students from Dulles. The setup was the same on the 
other end of the transmission.  
</P>
<P>
 Students in the two classes have met in person three times. Each class has 
visited the other school and in December, the two classes traveled together to 
the San Fernando Mission.  
</P>
<P>
 Another set of classes, from Sanchez and Gardenhill, used the video link to 
plan experiments for a joint field trip to coastal tide pools at Corona del 
Mar. Students teamed up with partners from the other school to conduct the 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice," said Crystal Gil, 9, of the students she met from La Mirada. 
She's learned that she and her video buddy, Holly, "have a lot in common. We 
both like strawberries. And we both like each other." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she likes the video connection because "you can meet new 
friends and you can keep in touch with different schools."  
</P>
<P>
 The level of contact between the classes has varied widely.  
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders at Sanchez School in Norwalk and Gardenhill School in La Mirada 
collaborated almost daily for several weeks to compose three mini-operas, with 
the assistance of a guest artist provided through the Music Center of Los 
Angeles County. Sometimes, however, the video contact is as little as 30 
minutes a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of face-to-face meetings also varies. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-May, some of the 38 paired classes had yet to meet in person during the 
yearlong experiment. Other classes have met about half a dozen times, which is 
closer to what district planners had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students said they enjoyed using the video equipment, but added that it's 
hard to become friends via video alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the transmissions are often grainy and the sound 
quality poor -- problems that technicians are supposed to correct this summer. 
"You can't get to know them that well because you can't see them right," said 
Andrew Velasquez, 9, of Sanchez Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the video interaction allows the children to ease painlessly into 
another world view, said Martin Carapia, a fourth-grade teacher in Norwalk. "A 
lot of kids feel comfortable where they are," he said. "Here, they are in their 
own surroundings, but they get a view of another culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it integration? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a far cry from the comprehensive, desegregation experience," said James 
S. Liebman, a professor at Columbia University School of Law and an expert on 
desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that you want from desegregation is for students to be able 
to gain respect for each other's entire situation. What you can get from an 
image of a student is such a small proportion of what that student's life is 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have rejected similar desegregation proposals, including a Texas plan 
to desegregate via closed-circuit television, said Gary Orfield, director of an 
ongoing Harvard University desegregation study. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colorado plan to desegregate by having students spend half the school day 
together also was ruled inadequate by the federal courts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norwalk-La Mirada is under no court order. School district officials made 
the decision to embark upon their desegregation program without prodding from 
parents, politicians or courts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their objectives was to bridge misunderstandings between the 
communities of Norwalk and La Mirada. For years, disenchanted parents have 
claimed that schools in the other city were getting a larger share of district 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences between the communities have contributed to this sense of 
separateness. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 Census figures, La Mirada, a city of 44,000, is about 
two-thirds white and Norwalk, with 94,000 residents, about two-thirds minority. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, 82.4% of the residents of La Mirada owned their homes, compared to 
65% in Norwalk. The median annual income for La Mirada residents was $47,123, 
compared to $38,124 in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences also are obvious at the four elementary schools participating in 
the desegregation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, one of the Norwalk schools, is 98% Latino. About 85% of the 
students belong to impoverished families and qualify for subsidized school 
lunches. About 69% speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulles, in La Mirada, is 63% white, though it has a growing Latino minority. 
About 19% of the students qualify for subsidized school lunches. About 9% speak 
limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightly packed streets around Sanchez Elementary in Norwalk are lined 
mostly with simple, two- and three-bedroom wood or stucco single-family homes 
that date mainly from a post-World War II construction boom. The residents are 
largely a mix of recent Latino immigrants and Latino families who have lived in 
the area for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, district officials floated the idea of voluntary busing to 
achieve integration in both communities. But in a series of meetings with 
school officials, parents in both cities expressed little enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Families in the tight-knit Norwalk neighborhood did not want to send their 
children to school outside the area. The idea of busing received a similarly 
lukewarm reception in La Mirada, a quiet bedroom community that is home to 
numerous retirees and young professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is a mix of older middle-class neighborhoods interspersed among new 
tract developments. To some La Mirada families, Norwalk was a virtual barrio, 
plagued by gangs and crime. They did not move to La Mirada to send their 
children to schools in Norwalk, some said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district ditched the busing plan and began to look for alternatives. The 
current program was the brainchild of former district Assistant Supt. Marie 
Plakos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like with the technology available in this day and age, there would 
be an avenue available to bring kids together to get to know each other and 
work on common projects," said Plakos, now an administrator in the Savanna 
Elementary School District in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 After the school board in 1992 unanimously approved a desegregation plan that 
described several potential integration strategies, administrators quickly set 
to work on the technological approach.  
</P>
<P>
 They applied for funding to the state, which spends about $81 million a year 
on voluntary desegregation programs in 47 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other districts, the money typically pays for more traditional forms of 
desegregation, including voluntary busing and magnet schools -- which are 
schools with special programs designed to lure white students to minority 
neighborhoods and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk-La Mirada program does not fit neatly into any category of 
integration that the state Education Code lists as eligible for state funding. 
For its funding application, the district calls the four participating schools 
"magnet centers." 
</P>
<P>
 In a magnet school, however, students of different ethnicities are 
desegregated by actually attending the same school, said state and local school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Contreras said Norwalk-La Mirada was not trying to deceive 
the state by classifying its program under the heading "magnet centers." The 
problem was that the innovative program didn't fit an existing funding 
category, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program received high marks from a private auditing firm that examined it 
under the auspices of the state controller's office, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors checked to see that all the money was properly accounted for and 
it was, said Edd Fong, spokesman for the controller's office. The auditors, 
however, did not evaluate whether the program achieved true desegregation or 
how well it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong emphasized that the office does not have the expertise to determine the 
educational value of programs. "That's why you have a Department of Education," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard our people say that the presumption is that a program is valid 
unless we hear otherwise from the Department of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 But the education department is required to do nothing other than receive 
desegregation plans, and has no role in approving or rejecting them, said 
Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials simply added Norwalk-La Mirada's program to the package of 
desegregation plans approved by the Legislature. The Norwalk-La Mirada program 
has received about $1.4 million each of the last two years. The first year's 
money covered start-up costs. The video transmissions began last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Using this money and any other available funds, the district ultimately hopes 
to link all district classes by video and computer, said program director 
Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
 To use state desegregation money for video and computer technology is 
inappropriate, said law professor Kushner, who teaches at Southwestern 
University School of Law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather unfortunate that the funds are being diverted, through a 
well-meaning program, to something that is not desegregation," Kushner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local school administrators credit Norwalk-La Mirada for discovering an 
ingenious method to get state funding for technology by calling it 
desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school systems also want this technology, they said, but can't afford it 
during tight budget times when school districts everywhere are cutting programs 
and laying off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 With its desegregation funds, the Norwalk-La Mirada district has been able to 
purchase an array of equipment besides the two-way video system. 
</P>
<P>
 Each participating classroom has two computers that can read compact discs, a 
variety of educational software, a color printer and a laser disc player. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four schools has three machines, similar to overhead projectors, 
that transmit video pictures of documents to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Every campus also has a Xerox LiveBoard, which has a color monitor the size of 
a big-screen TV. Students can write directly on the monitor with an infrared 
pen and the text will appear at the school on the other end of the 
transmission, Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several current and former administrators outside the district praised 
Norwalk-La Mirada for finding a way, through desegregation funding, to help all 
its students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can find ways to legally bring in money from new or existing sources, 
bless you, because that's the only way you can offer special opportunities to 
youngsters," said retired school superintendent Stanley G. Oswalt.

POLICE SEARCH FOR MISSING SCHIZOPHRENIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police scoured the neighborhood around a Panorama City school Saturday in 
search of a 23-year-old retarded, schizophrenic man missing since Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Jonal Allen left the Vista Day Treatment Center, a school for the 
developmentally disabled in the 14200 block of Roscoe Boulevard, at about 3 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to find him," said Noellie Gardose, who runs a group home in 
Northridge where Allen has lived for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is without his medication," she said. "It is very important for him to 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen takes Haldol three times a day to control his schizophrenia, in addition 
to medication for epilepsy, Gardose said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending hours knocking on doors and beefing up patrols in the area, 
police late Saturday asked for the public's help in finding Allen. Sgt. Jim 
Bilodeau of the Los Angeles Police Department said officers were hampered in 
their search because no picture of Allen was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a picture, it is truly like looking for a needle in a haystack," said 
Bilodeau. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has arranged for a police artist to render a composite drawing of the 
man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was described as black, 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighing about 135 
pounds. He was wearing a light-blue shirt, faded blue jeans and white sneakers 
when last seen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing man has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and may exhibit 
behavior that "could get him in trouble," Gardose said, such as teasing people 
and playing hide-and-seek with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardose said Allen has no history of running away. She knows of no place he 
may be visiting in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gets tired, he will probably fall asleep on benches," Gardose said. "He 
may be at a shopping center parking lot with lots of benches."

 Stock options can turn executives into instant millionaires. But sometimes 
those riches are on paper only, as former Apple Computer Inc. President Robert 
L. Puette discovered last year.Apple's 1993 proxy statement listed Puette's 
total compensation as $7.7 million, which would have made him the 
fourth-highest paid executive at California's 100 biggest publicly held 
companies. But the bulk of the package -- $7.2 million -- was in stock options. 
And Puette says those options went unexercised when he left Apple in October.

JAMES FLANIGAN: FOOTBALL OWNERS CRY 'FAREWELL,' BUT MEAN 'WELFARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The war of nerves going on between Southern California and its National 
Football League teams has all the spectacle and outrage of millionaires looking 
for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis, managing partner of the Los Angeles Raiders, threatened again last 
week to move the team out of town unless the city handed him hugely profitable 
luxury boxes at the Coliseum plus other concessions, including free rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Anaheim, Georgia Frontiere and the Los Angeles Rams were 
preparing to move to another city, perhaps Baltimore, where Maryland taxpayers 
are ready with lottery-backed bonds to finance a $165-million stadium with 
luxury boxes and throw in concessionary terms on rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Violins were playing. "It's tough and unrealistic to move a team, but 
sometimes you have to do tough things," Davis said at an NFL owners meeting in 
Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's hogwash and hypocrisy. The economic truth is that nothing increases 
a team's value as much as a move to a new city that gives it a stadium with 
luxury boxes -- high-priced suites whose rents go to team owners, not the city 
or taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, for example, are valued right now at $148 million by Financial World 
magazine, which publishes annual estimates of team values in all professional 
sports. If they move to Baltimore, "the team could be worth $200 million," said 
Paul Much, sports specialist for Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, a Los Angeles 
investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, a prospective $50-million increase in value for a team that has 
been haranguing Anaheim city managers to come up with taxpayer-financed 
improvements at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when luxury boxes are put in the Coliseum, the Raiders' value will 
rise because revenue from such amenities -- leases to business groups at 
$50,000 to $100,000 a season -- go to team owners and, unlike television 
revenue, is not shared with the other 27 teams in the NFL. That kind of kicker 
makes a franchise more attractive for an eventual sale. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders, now valued at $146 million, stay in Los Angeles with luxury 
boxes and concessions on Coliseum rent, their value could rise over the next 
few years to $185 million -- a price the Philadelphia Eagles fetched in a 
recent sale. 
</P>
<P>
 If they move to another city, their value could rise more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Davis knows what smart money people in sports and finance all 
know these days: that over the next decade, "professional sports team values 
are going to rise to unthinkable levels." 
</P>
<P>
 That judgment, which appears in Financial World's latest rankings, is based on 
the coming of savvy corporate owners to professional sports. Walt Disney Co. 
owns hockey's Mighty Ducks and is open to owning franchises in other sports. 
Wayne Huizenga of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. owns the Miami Dolphins and 
baseball's Florida Marlins, as well as hockey's Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster is investing heavily, along with Florida taxpayers who finance the 
infrastructure, in a $1-billion theme park between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale 
that will feature a baseball stadium and an arena for hockey and basketball. 
Traditional team owners, whether families or groups of individual investors, 
couldn't contemplate $1-billion investments; the sports business is becoming a 
major industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of these entertainment companies, explains Timothy Mueller, a sports 
valuation expert for the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, is to "integrate 
entertainment delivery" -- sporting events as attractions for television, 
videos, CD-ROMs, theme parks, resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities multiply and are based on the public's demonstrated interest 
in sports. High ratings for the Winter Olympics this year surprised even CBS; 
chances are U.S. reception of soccer's World Cup this summer will be greater 
than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 But questions also multiply. If big entertainment corporations are willing to 
pour money into sports, and franchises are growing in value every year -- 15% a 
year, according to one study -- why are taxpayers being dunned to support them? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Politics and public appeal. There are more cities than teams, and the 
competition to be "major league" is intense. Politicians are in a bind: If they 
lose the local team they are criticized, but if they shell out taxpayer money 
they are also criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 So there are efforts to show that sports teams make a big economic impact. But 
people who know arithmetic scoff at such studies. "It takes $50,000 of 
investment to create one job," said Roger Noll, an economics professor at 
Stanford University. "By that reckoning, these $200-million stadiums erected at 
public expense should be creating 4,000 jobs, and they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 By that reckoning, the $20 million to $25 million needed to put up luxury 
boxes in the Coliseum for Al Davis should create 500 jobs. Will it? Not likely. 
In any case, an industrial park would create more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, yes, that's dull economics, which doesn't take into account the emotional 
lift a team brings to a city. Indeed, there's nothing wrong with sports as a 
business. When a franchise is well run, it can make money and rally the 
community. The Los Angeles Dodgers do a great job of marketing, fill their 
stadium with fans and make a profit. The Lakers fill the Forum, and Disney's 
Ducks in their first season brought hockey fans and a winning team to the 
Anaheim Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders and Rams don't fill the seats at the Coliseum or Anaheim 
Stadium because the teams' marketing is poor. Frankly, Davis and Frontiere 
don't run their businesses very well. And lately both have taken to blaming the 
stadiums and even the fans for their lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming the customer has never been a good business strategy. So maybe 
Southern California would be better off if both went elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What would happen if both Rams and Raiders left? This is the second-largest 
market in the United States. The National Football League and some savvy 
corporation would put a team in here double-quick. 
</P>
<P>
 However, reality is that the Raiders won't leave. If the Rams depart, Davis 
knows he'll be the only NFL game in an enormous market. His bargaining position 
will be enhanced; he'll get the luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he should sell the team or stop whining. In fact, a good idea for the 
Raiders and all sports teams would be to sponsor sandlot teams, especially in 
poor neighborhoods. Let them really get out and help poor kids -- and give 
something back for the taxpayer dollars that support their luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and all sports industry will prosper more surely in Southern 
California and elsewhere if they're seen as contributors and not as parasites.

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; SCALING NEW HEIGHTS; THE CORPORATION: PAY FOR 
TOP CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVES CONTINUES TO CLIMB, ALTHOUGH LINKS TO PERFORMANCE 
HAVE MADE COMPENSATION PACKAGES MORE COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a historic legislative effort to hold down towering salaries, the pay 
of top executives at California's biggest public companies thrust upward with 
tremendous force in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say executive pay hasn't changed. It has, in major ways. Pay is 
now much more related to a company's performance. And the elements that make up 
an executive's compensation package are far more complex. But in terms of 
overall magnitude, the numbers just keep getting larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael D. Eisner, chief executive of Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, weighed in 
with a record $203 million in salary and stock gains. 
</P>
<P>
 * The top five officers at toy maker Mattel Inc. together earned $27.8 million 
-- averaging roughly $5.5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 * The new chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores got $8.67 million -- 
including a $1-million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 25 most highly compensated executives at California's 100 largest 
public companies, none earned less than $4 million. The lowliest pay package in 
the top 100 totaled $1.8 million -- about 33 times the income of the average 
American household. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even the ousted had their day. Richard K. Eamer and Leonard Cohen, pushed 
out of National Medical Enterprises amid government investigations of the 
company's psychiatric care units, earned $9.8 million and $3.4 million, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The largess was piled high even though Congress made its first effort to limit 
executive pay -- through a law that says companies paying more than $1 million 
in "non-performance-related" salary cannot deduct the excess as a business 
expense on tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the continued bounty? 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest explanation is that the new limits, popularly mislabeled "the 
$1-million pay cap," did not go into effect until Jan. 1, 1994, after the 
earnings chronicled in The Times' pay survey had been allotted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts maintain that 1993 pay levels are just the first sign 
that the new law is going to backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of putting a ceiling on executive salaries, Congress may have placed a 
floor under them, says Richard Semler, principal in the Los Angeles office of 
Sibson & Co., a nationwide executive compensation consulting firm. Where 
executives earned less than the magic $1 million in salary and bonus in 1993, 
boards may be encouraged to match that figure in 1994, he adds. The logic: If 
Congress says $1 million is a reasonable salary, what corporate director is 
going to argue? 
</P>
<P>
 Other aspects of the law encourage boards to use formulas that will produce 
salaries higher than the already staggering amounts directors have been willing 
to pay in the past, says Graef S. Crystal, a Nevada-based compensation expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ain't seen nothing yet," he says. "Pay is going to get higher than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a pay cap law boost salaries? Because the law limits only pay that 
is not tied to performance. If an executive's salary is based on a mathematical 
formula linked to clearing some performance hurdle -- no matter how low -- his 
or her pay is deductible for the employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the measure, part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, lets 
boards cut salaries set under a formula, but not raise them. Ultimately, notes 
Crystal, that means directors -- who long have argued that they need 
flexibility in wage scales to attract and retain the best managers -- may be 
inclined to use formulas that result in too much pay rather than too little. 
That way, new law or not, they can maintain the discretion they have always 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, putting more pay "at risk," as the law requires, also argues for 
boosting incentives, experts note. It's the old risk-reward theory in action: 
When you take greater risks, you expect greater returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you have good performance, you are going to see very big pay packages" 
says Barbara Elter, executive compensation consultant with Hewitt Associates in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, because most consultants believe shareholders are less interested in 
the size of an executive's paycheck than in whether the pay relates to the 
company's accomplishments, the whopping salaries of tomorrow may not draw as 
much ire as the non-performance-related pay of yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, while lofty pay scales have not come down, the nature of pay 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 As the annual Times survey shows, stock is an increasingly important element 
in executive compensation. The vast majority of the executives on the best-paid 
list would not have made the grade without counting their stock options and 
awards. Indeed, most of the top wage earners got more than half their pay in 
the form of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigning a dollar value to the stock portion of compensation packages is 
tricky and controversial. If a company's stock price does not appreciate over 
the next 10 years, most executives will let their options expire as worthless. 
Also, companies can choose between two methods in valuing such benefits, with 
widely varying results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times tables give the figures as reported by the companies. Both methods 
arrive at values that are likely to be low. If stocks appreciate at roughly the 
same rate as they have since the end of World War II, most executives will reap 
stock gains that are two to four times the numbers that companies project. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, executive pay has become more complex. Now, instead of a simple 
salary and bonus, companies are offering "performance units," restricted stock, 
premium-priced stock options and shares that "vest" -- that is, become 
available to the executive -- only under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In adding up executive pay, The Times counts 1993 salary and bonus, long-term 
compensation paid during the year, the stated value of stock options granted in 
1993 and the value of restricted stock awards made during the year. The charts 
also include "other" wages -- generally the value of severance or relocation 
payments, sign-on bonuses, and company-paid extras such as executive use of 
company planes, automobiles and vacation lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
 On the latter score, Ray Irani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp., 
remains the perk king at California's biggest public companies, thanks to an 
employment contract that requires Occidental to pay nearly $1 million in 
personal income taxes for the 47-year-old executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The listings of total compensation do not include the value of stock options 
exercised during 1993. Companies have argued in the past that this figure is 
misleading, because while an executive may have received the money in a certain 
year, it was earned over a much longer period.  
</P>
<P>
 A separate chart lists the 20 executives at California's 100 biggest publicly 
held companies who cashed in the biggest stock gains during 1993. This is where 
you'll see Disney's Eisner and his eye-popping $203-million gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such fabulous packages, even the biggest critics say some progress has 
been made in restraining so-called runaway executive pay. 
</P>
<P>
 CEOs are no longer competing to be the highest-paid in the land, says Martin 
L. Katz, principal at the William M. Mercer consulting firm in San Francisco. 
Corporate boards are looking more closely at pay issues and trying harder to 
link pay to performance, he adds. And executives themselves no longer consider 
headline-grabbing pay packages something to boast about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be kind of a macho thing," with executives bragging about sitting 
atop national salary rankings, notes Nell Minow, principal of Lens Inc., a 
Washington investment company. "Now nobody wants to be in the top quartile. 
It's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises, for instance, points out that only the company's 
former officers qualified for listing among the state's highest paid. 
</P>
<P>
 NME has drastically revised its compensation strategies, so it is less likely 
that the names of its executives will pepper the top echelons of future salary 
surveys, a company spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the firm's proxy, NME executive pay will still be better than 
average. But executives' wages will be more closely tied to stock price 
performance -- a strategy that NME's shareholders, who have seen stock values 
plunge over the last two years, can probably stand behind. The California 50 
</P>
<P>
 This chart lists the 50 highest-paid executives in 1993 among the top-ranking 
officers of California's 100 biggest publicly held companies. They are ranked 
by total pay: salary; bonus; value of 1993 stock option awards; restricted 
shares; long-term compensation paid dring the year,and "other" pay, such as 
severance payments, signing bonuses and the value of company-paid perquisites. 
Most made the list thanks to stock options they were granted during the year. 
Companies estimate the value of such options, but their true worth can't be 
known until they are exercised--usually many years later. Some prove worthless.

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; CLEARING THE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, Congress reacted to public furor over runaway executive pay by 
passing a law limiting the business expense deduction for companies that pay 
executives more that $1 million in "non-performance'-based" compensation.That 
means if executives at your company earn more than $1 million in salary, the 
amount exceeding $1 million isn't deductible as a business expense. But if the 
top dog gets a $5-million bonus based on clearing some performance hurdle, the 
whole $5-million is tax-deductible. The law hasn't caused salaries to fall, 
compensation consultants say, but it has caused many companies to set very low 
performance goals.

 Executive compensation consultants Pearl Meyer & Partners say chief executives 
got a meager 1% raise in 1993, the smallest in years.Still, their pay wasn't 
exactly paltry. The average CEO earned $3.45 million in salary, bonus, 
long-term incentives and the present value of stock options granted, according 
to the firm. And total executive pay has risen 22% since 1990.

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; DREAMS OF MANY BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS CRUMBLE INTO 
WAGE GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confident that landing a job at a utility company would mean long-term 
financial security for his family, John Ortiz joined Southern California Edison 
three years ago even though it meant taking a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, trained as a diesel mechanic, figured he would make up the lost wages 
in a couple of years and eventually earn far more than he could have in his old 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 But as it turned out, Ortiz instead got caught up in a phenomenon that has 
upset the plans and expectations of many workers over the last two decades: 
stagnant wages. Today, he still makes slightly less than the $15 an hour he 
used to earn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected a better life than this," said the 33-year-old Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 While paychecks have skyrocketed for top executives at many of the nation's 
biggest companies, times have been tough for most workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings, on average, have been limping along. Although different economic 
gauges vary, figures generally show that workers' wages and benefits have 
barely stayed ahead of inflation since the early 1970s. Wages by themselves 
actually fell behind the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 That marks a big comedown from the previous two decades, when pay climbed 
robustly as the nation's growing prosperity was spread widely through the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the figures for the overall work force mask the economic losses 
suffered by vast groups of workers. While highly educated professionals, 
particularly women, have posted smart gains in recent years, blue-collar 
workers, particularly men, have fared miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a widened wage gap between people at opposite ends of the 
educational scale. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a 
liberal think tank in Washington D.C., the nearly three-quarters of the work 
force with less than four years of college suffered a 12.3% decline in wages 
from 1979 to 1993. Most of the loss was borne by men. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the prospect for young, blue-collar workers to secure 
middle-class lifestyles has severely eroded, said Lawrence Mishel, EPI's 
research director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people who want to own a house, have a family, are seeing their dreams 
collide with the reality of the lack of upward mobility," added Scott Hanlon, a 
business representative with Local 47 of the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon cited Ortiz, a member of his local, as an example. Although Ortiz and 
his wife managed to buy a house in Baldwin Park, their $130,000 mortgage is 
proving to be a crushing burden. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement the income from his Edison job and his wife's full-time position 
as a customer service representative, Ortiz moonlights on weekends cleaning 
trucks. But while that brings their family income to about $50,000 a year -- 
compared to the average Los Angeles County family income of $39,035, according 
to 1990 U.S. Census data -- the Ortizes still struggle to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the lower-than-expected pay raises has come frustration with the 
job itself. Despite two years of college training and Navy experience as a 
diesel mechanic, Ortiz remains locked in the original job he took with the 
utility -- pumping gas and washing company cars driven by Edison executives. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, given the changes beginning to sweep through the industry, Ortiz 
fears he may wind up out of work. "I could be getting laid off at any time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz said he and his wife, the parents of a 3-year-old boy, want to have 
another child, but because of their financial concerns, they feel they "can't 
take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons blue-collar workers have fallen behind, economists say, is 
the rise of computer technology. Higher technology eliminated the jobs of many 
lesser-skilled workers, according to experts, while providing more 
opportunities for highly educated professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the widened wage gap -- which appears to have bulged in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s and held firm since -- is blamed on many other factors, too. Some 
analysts point to declining union strength, intensified international 
competition and the arrival of large numbers of unskilled immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The downward pressure on wages also started squeezing some college graduates 
in the mid-1980s. A recent study shows that men in the 45-to-54 age group with 
four years of college -- traditionally big wage earners -- saw their pay fall 
14% from 1988 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Levy, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and one of the 
study's authors, said many workers in this category lost their jobs as 
companies opted to slash costs by streamlining management. The older workers 
were vulnerable, he said, because of their relatively high pay and, in many 
cases, limited computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
 These workers, in turn, often found new work only after accepting pay cuts or 
by going into business for themselves as consultants, sometimes barely 
scratching out a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Finkel, 57, of Woodland Hills was one of those corporate discards. He had 
more than 30 years' experience as a program manager and technical specialist in 
such fields as aerospace, robotics and life-support systems. But when a defense 
spending cutback put him out of a job in 1992, all that experience went for 
naught. 
</P>
<P>
 He job-hunted for a year but couldn't find anything in his line of work. A 
stumbling block was the concern of prospective employers about his salary 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel was willing to take a pay cut, but having earned $62,000 a year in his 
last job, he said, "I kept hearing that 'we can't afford to pay you that kind 
of money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, early in 1993, he went to work as an insurance salesman. Struggling 
to develop a business amid the weak Southern California economy, he now makes 
about $12,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not what he wanted, but at least it's a job. "I've got a mind," Finkel 
said. "I want to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The pay squeeze is also an unpleasant fact of life for Finkel's son, Howard, 
an engineer working for an environmental consulting firm in the Washington 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Finkel, at age 33, holds a master's degree and is in a field 
thought to have a secure future. Yet he has seen his annual raises shrink from 
as high as 20% to, most recently, 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the job insecurity that afflicts less-educated workers haunts Howard 
Finkel amid the cost cutting that has swept into his industry. Some of his 
colleagues have been forced to take 20% pay cuts to hold on to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Finkel fears that secure consulting jobs will be replaced by 
temporary, and often lower-paying, contract work, reflecting the loosening ties 
between employers and employees throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, he figured his future was secure with the company and that he 
could count on climbing steadily up the income ladder. But no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not depending on the company to take care of me through thick and thin," 
he said. "They can't. It's a business."

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; 'BLACK SHEEP' FINDS GOLDEN FLEECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin L. Flanagan's parents playfully labeled him the black sheep when he 
decided to leave his suburban Chicago hometown and forgo the family tradition 
of working at the Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 They wouldn't call him that now -- even in jest. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, senior vice president and chief financial officer of mutual fund 
giant Franklin Resources Inc. here, last year collected a $13-million pay 
package that landed him atop The Times' list of the highest-paid executives at 
California's 100 biggest public companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet 34 -- and uncomfortable in the compensation spotlight -- Flanagan 
hastens to explain that his hefty 1993 pay resulted in large part from 
accounting aberrations related to Franklin's 1992 purchase of Templeton, 
Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd., for which he had been a top official based in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, who married into the mutual fund business, essentially got three 
years' worth of contractual, multimillion-dollar bonuses lumped into one. The 
$6.65 million in restricted shares that constituted almost half his pay 
represents an accumulation dating from 1986, he noted; if he leaves the company 
anytime soon, he loses it. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the fact remains that Flanagan got a magnificent windfall last year 
-- roughly 500 times the median California industrial worker's 1993 earnings. 
Which prompts the impertinent question: How is he spending all that dough? 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from investing heavily in Franklin-Templeton funds and donating to his 
prep school and college, Flanagan said that so far he has done little with the 
proceeds. The demands of his new job -- trying to pull the two organizations 
together and meld their far-flung information systems -- leave scarce moments 
to cogitate on his own sybaritic strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a poor job of taking care of myself," said the brown-haired, 
freckle-faced executive. "I don't have fancy goals. No yachts, no racing cars, 
no planes, no horses -- none of that good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 He just bought a Lexus, though, his first new car in 10 years. Flanagan's 
seventh-floor office sports a sweeping view of San Francisco Bay. A table holds 
snapshots from an African safari; the walls are hung with sailing ship prints 
collected in the Bahamas and watercolors from Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as solidly Midwestern in values, Flanagan said his chief 
aspirations are to have a happy, healthy family and to return every summer for 
the Flanagan clan's annual reunion in northern Wisconsin's lake country. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born June 28, 1960, and grew up with two older sisters and a younger 
brother in Wilmette, an affluent suburb of Chicago. His mother was a homemaker, 
his father a longtime executive at the Board of Trade, as were Flanagan's 
maternal grandfather and an uncle.  
</P>
<P>
 At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he received dual bachelor's 
degrees in business and Ibero-American civilization. Under SMU's auspices, he 
studied in Spain, Ecuador and Peru. Arriving in Peru on the day of the nation's 
first general election in 12 years, he was greeted by tanks rolling down 
streets and armed soldiers positioned behind sandbags. While there, he got his 
first significant exposure to poverty and its ill effects on a country's 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Flanagan worked in Dallas for Arthur Andersen, the 
accounting firm, expecting to become a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 But he changed course in 1983 after serving as chaperon on a church youth 
group's white water canoeing trip, sponsored by Thomas L. Hansberger, the 
president of Templeton. At the time, Flanagan was dating Jennifer Gelety, a 
Templeton employee whose mother later married Hansberger. As Flanagan puts it 
half-jokingly, "My wife got me my job." 
</P>
<P>
 (Flanagan and Gelety, married in 1986 and have two sons, Casey, 3, and Ryan, 
2.) 
</P>
<P>
 At Templeton, Flanagan worked as part of a three-person team to develop 
affiliations and joint ventures with overseas firms. During his tenure, the 
company's assets under management grew to more than $20 billion from $2.5 
billion. He rose to chief operating officer before moving to California a year 
ago for his current posts at the combined companies, which together manage 
about $112 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir John Templeton, the legendary former fund manager for whom Flanagan worked 
in the Bahamas, recalled in a telephone interview from his Nassau office that 
Flanagan was known for intelligence, reliability and new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the things that made him valuable," Templeton said. Of Flanagan's 
new positions, he said, "I think I said to Marty that I can't recall a person 
who became CFO of such a big company at such an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, praised the 
long-term records of both Templeton and Franklin and noted that Templeton 
offers a big plus for shareholders by compensating key employees with stock 
that locks them into the company. (The restricted stock granted Flanagan last 
year represents Templeton shares accumulated since 1986 that were converted to 
Franklin shares.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The merger just looks brilliant now in retrospect," Phillips said. When value 
and global reach came back into favor last year, he noted, "Templeton funds 
turned in a terrific performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Flanagans have climbed significant mountains, including Kilimanjaro, but 
"not soapboxes," he said. He does not contribute anything out of the ordinary 
to special causes, but is instead trying to build a secure future for his 
family. They are renting a home while their $2.2-million house in the posh 
community of Hillsborough is renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan said he understands and agrees with the current rage among 
stockholders that executives be held more accountable and that pay be linked to 
performance. Franklin's compensation, he added, is "not out of line" with the 
industry, and its expenses are comparatively low. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that anybody earns this type of money," he said, adding that at 
Templeton, his wealth grew with the organization. But he is proud of the fact 
that "shareholders and clients did a whole lot better on a relative basis."

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; FIVE MATTEL EXECUTIVES PROVE THAT TURNAROUND 
MAKES FAIR PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K.H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Mattel Inc. pays its executives well, and it's certainly not play money. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Mattel's top five executives ranked in the top 30 of the most highly 
compensated executives among the state's 100 largest public companies -- a 
record matched by no other company on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way was Joseph C. Gandolfo, president of operations and the 
fourth-ranking officer of the El Segundo toy maker. His total compensation in 
1993 of nearly $7.3 million -- more than Mattel's own chief executive, by 
virtue of awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights -- was the 
fifth-highest of all executives on The Times' list. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four officers and their total compensations are John W. Amerman, 
chairman and chief executive, $7.2 million (ranking sixth); Jill E. Barad, 
president and chief operating officer, nearly $5.4 million (10th); James E. 
Eskridge, now president of Mattel's Fisher-Price unit, $4.1 million (24th), and 
Lindsey F. Williams, president of Mattel International, $3.7 million (29th). 
</P>
<P>
 It was those stock options and stock appreciation rights that made the Mattel 
executives' compensation packages so lucrative. Stock analysts say that's 
fitting, given the company's excellent performance since Mattel was on the 
brink of bankruptcy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, the company lost more than $90 million and began a plant-closing, 
product-adjusting restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past five years, "the stock has been a phenomenal performer," said 
Laurie Lively Smith, securities analyst at Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. 
"Shareholders have made an enormous amount of money, and it's only right that 
if management performs well, they should share in that and be (given 
incentives) to perform equally well in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The incentives are there. Under a long-term incentive plan, which is not 
included in The Times' 1993 compensation tables, the executives stand to reap 
large amounts of Mattel stock, provided certain goals and conditions are met. 
For Amerman, the long-term plan could be worth $5.2 million, for Barad $4.1 
million and for Eskridge $3.4 million. Although it was approved in late 1993 
following Mattel's merger with Fisher-Price, the shares were not granted until 
Jan. 1, and the executives will not be vested in the plan until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of recent history, the goals -- which include matching or bettering 
shareholder returns of the Standard & Poor's 500 -- seem attainable. The 
management team at Mattel today is largely responsible for the company's climb 
to No. 1 among the world's toy makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Amerman, Mattel dumped tangential -- and unsuccessful -- ventures into 
electronics and publishing, refocusing on its historic strengths, particularly 
the Barbie and Hot Wheels toy lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Amerman opened up what he called the company's "tunnel vision." Barbie, once 
primarily a fashion plate, became the center of a universe of products, largely 
under Barad's tutelage. Barbie is the unquestioned all-time champion of toy 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of licensing agreements and acquisitions, Mattel broadened 
its product line and customer base; most notable are its linkup with the Walt 
Disney Co. and its merger last year with Fisher-Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that acquisition, the stock market generally had fretted about Mattel's 
dependence on Barbie for revenue and had held down the company's stock price. 
Now Barbie accounts for about 40% of Mattel's sales, a figure that is likely to 
dwindle further as the company puts its international marketing savvy to work 
on Fisher-Price products. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no indication that any of the executives were being wooed by 
other companies, "retention" bonuses were a part of their compensation packages 
in 1993, ranging from $600,000 for Amerman to $300,000 for Gandolfo. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you compare Mattel to its peer group of high-quality consumer 
non-durables, by probably every financial characteristic it would rank in the 
top five," said Margaret B. Whitfield, an analyst who tracks the company for 
Hancock Institutional Equity Services in Washington. In the past five years, 
she said, the company's earnings have grown 33.9%, and its average return on 
equity has been 37.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock has been trading in the mid-$20s for most of this year, following a 
5-for-4 split. That's a sizable improvement from its nadir of less than $3 in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thinking of the board is, the stock of the company has risen by almost a 
factor of 10 over the past six or seven years, and the shareholders' value has 
increased about $5 billion," Mattel director Harold Brown said. Brown, defense 
secretary during the Carter Administration, is managing partner of E.M. 
Warburg, Pincus & Co., which has owned Mattel shares since it participated in 
the toy maker's 1984 restructuring.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the compensation, Brown said, "is dependent upon stock performance. So 
those who believe -- and I'm one -- that pay should depend on performance and 
be tied closely to the interests of the shareholders should view this as a good 
example of compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 The calculated value of the Mattel executives' stock options and grants is 
based on a conservative assumption of 5% annual appreciation of the company's 
stock price throughout the term of the options. 
</P>
<P>
 (Although the company did the calculations, as required, for inclusion in its 
proxy materials, a Mattel spokesman contends that to count such "potential" 
value as compensation in 1993 is a "misrepresentation." However, to achieve a 
5% increase in value, a stock would have to perform only half as well as the 
market's average over the past 50 years.)

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; THE STOCK OPTIONS 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The element of executive pay that generates the most controversy is exercising 
stock options. Typically, executives promised the right to buy shares at a set 
price exercise that right when the price of the shares has gone up. That can 
result in instant riches. This chart lists the 20 executives at California's 
100 biggest publicly-held companies who exercised the most valuable stock

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; HOW TO READ 
BETWEEN THE PROXY STATEMENT LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With so many executives earning so much money, stockholders increasingly want 
to know if the managers deserve those big bucks and if the insiders are minding 
the shareholders' business -- or merely their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, new proxy disclosure rules make it easier to conduct such 
assessments -- which, in turn, may be pivotal in determining whether your 
shares are worth owning over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you be looking for in the proxy statement? 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the stock performance table near the end of the proxy, says Nell 
Minow, principal of Lens Inc., a Washington-based investment company. This 
table graphically compares how your company's stock has performed relative to a 
market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500, and -- more tellingly -- 
relative to its peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the latter is the key comparison, because market forces -- such as 
strong or weak consumer spending and various investment trends -- affect 
industries in different ways at different times. In other words, the best 
company in the world could appear lackluster during a down market for that 
industry, and a terrible company could look like a superstar if you happen to 
examine it when that company's industry is popular with investors. 
</P>
<P>
 What's important is that your company consistently perform as well or better 
than similar companies. If you invest in Transamerica Corp., for instance, 
you'll want to know how its performance stacks up with that of other insurance 
or financial services firms. If you invest in Chevron Corp., consider how it 
has fared relative to other oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This information has been difficult for most investors to compile in the past, 
but thanks to Securities and Exchange Commission rules that took effect last 
year, companies must now disclose this information both graphically and 
numerically. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the "Performance Graph" for San Francisco-based Chevron appears 
on Page 21 of the company's 1994 proxy. The graph compares Chevron's stock 
value to the value of the S&P 500, as well as to a peer group index made up of 
Amoco, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, Mobil and Texaco -- the company's direct 
competitors. Over the entire period, Chevron performed somewhat better than the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd also like to see that compensation is going in roughly the same 
direction as the stock price, experts say. If the company's shares are falling 
year after year, you'd expect to see executive salaries, bonuses and stock 
awards decline as well.  
</P>
<P>
 The "Summary Compensation Table," which is usually in the middle part of the 
proxy, spells out how much executives have earned in salary, bonuses and stock 
awards over each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another item to watch is stock ownership of directors and executive officers, 
which is in a chart near the front of the proxy statement. At a glance, you can 
determine whether officers and directors own large percentages of the company's 
stock, or less than 1%. And if you spend a little time with a calculator, you 
can come up with a more valuable figure: the dollar value of insider holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 A positive sign is when officers and directors own several times their annual 
salaries in stock, says Minow. A warning sign is when the value of shares held 
by officers and directors amounts to significantly less than one year's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the people who know the company best," she says. "If it's not worth 
it to them to buy shares, you've got to ask whether it's worth it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Beware: The graphs can be deceiving. Most companies lump together the number 
of shares that executives and directors own outright with the shares they have 
not yet -- and may never -- buy through exercising their stock options. To 
determine how much stock the individuals already own, you must read the 
footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider San Francisco-based PLM, a transportation leasing firm that has seen 
sales and net income decline over the last five years. The company's director 
and officer stock ownership is given on Page 3 of its proxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert N. Tidball, president and chief executive, is shown as owning 137,000 
shares -- worth slightly more than $291,000 at PLM's 1993 closing price of 
$2.125. (Tidball's salary and bonus, on Page 10, amounted to $360,000.) 
However, the footnotes reveal that Tidball owns outright only 7,000 of those 
shares, or less than $15,000 worth. The rest were stock options -- rights to 
buy the company's shares at a set price in the future -- that he had not yet 
exercised. Tidball would not comment on his compensation package. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock performance graphs and the information on officer and director stock 
ownership give investors the company's track record and a reading of what the 
coach thinks of the team's chances of continuing to clear the hurdles. That 
information alone is enough to determine whether the stock is worth its salt, 
Minow says. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got some time and are interested in a more detailed analysis, you 
can also look at the "Compensation Committee Report," which explains how 
executive salaries are determined. This is important because executive pay in 
excess of $1 million a year as of 1994 will not be tax-deductible for the 
company unless it is linked to the company's performance. (Otherwise, such 
compensation is deductible as a business expense.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey conducted by Hewitt Associates, about half the nation's 
big companies have already taken steps to comply with the law. Others have said 
in their proxy statements that they don't plan to comply or will not be able to 
because of current contracts with their executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, look at the stock options and stock grants given to top executives. 
Stock options are widely used by companies as a way of tying executive 
interests to the interests of shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how they work: Shares of XYZ Inc. are selling for $20 each. The 
company's board wants to inspire CEO Jim Megabucks to work harder at raising 
XYZ's market value. XYZ gives Megabucks an option to buy 100,000 shares in XYZ 
at the current price of $20 a share. He can exercise, or use, this option at 
any time over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If XYZ's shares double in value to $40 before the 10 years are up, Megabucks 
is in the money. His option for 100,000 shares is suddenly worth $2 million, 
because he can buy 100,000 shares at $20 each, then turn around and sell them 
for $4 million -- double what they cost him. Investors should consider it a 
good sign when the exercise price at the date of grant is higher than the 
market value of the shares at that point, compensation experts say. The theory 
is that the higher the hurdle, the harder executives will run to clear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other warning signs are when companies issue options at below-market prices, 
issue "mega-grants" of several hundred thousand or even 1 million shares at a 
time, or "reprice" options. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Options issued at below-market prices indicate the board is not 
optimistic about the company's chances for strong price appreciation, Minow 
says. And mega grants are bad because executives win regardless of whether the 
company performs well, experts note. If Jim Megabucks gets an option for 4 
million shares, he will make $4 million even if XYZ's shares appreciate only $1 
over the next 10 years, says George B. Paulin, president of Frederic W. Cook & 
Co., a compensation consulting firm in Los Angeles. That's not exactly 
performance worth paying extra for. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problematic pattern: Some companies reprice their options when the 
market drops. In other words, if XYZ's shares fell to $10, the company might 
trade in Megabucks' $20 options for an option to buy 100,000 shares at a $10 
exercise price. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that reprice grants say out-of-the-money options are a poor 
incentive, but shareholder activists contend that executives should not get a 
retroactive price break on shares when individual stockholders can't get as 
good a deal. Such arrangements, they say, create a chasm rather than a link 
between the interests of outside stockholders and managers. And they may 
indicate that the company's board is pessimistic about the firm's chances of 
recovery -- an ominous sign for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any company that reprices options, sell fast," Minow says. "This is a company 
that's on its way down." Measuring Performance 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to graphically 
illustrate how their stock has fared in relation to a market index and a group 
of their peers. Such graphs give shareholders the ability to quickly determine 
how well their company's management has performed. This chart from Chevron 
Corp.'s latest proxy compares the oil company's stock performance to the 
Standard & Poor's 500 and a bundle of stocks representing its direct 
competitors. Comparative Five-Year Total Returns

BMW GIVES EMPLOYEES SENSE OF PRIDE IN WORK; AUTO INDUSTRY: THOSE IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA WHO HAVE LANDED ONE OF THE COVETED JOBS ARE MAKING SURE THEY ARE UP TO 
TASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When Allison Ballenger forgets to take off her BMW name tag after work, 
strangers often stop her and offer congratulations for landing one of South 
Carolina's most coveted manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the area wants a job at BMW. I mean everybody," says the 
29-year-old woman, who left a cable-making company to try her hand at building 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 With four months left before the German auto maker opens its first U.S. 
assembly plant here, Ballenger and her peers say they are working hard to make 
sure they are up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 initial hires are being taught to assemble cars in a hangarlike 
training building next to the unfinished factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Body panels fastened to display boards sit in one corner. Car bodies in 
various states of repair are available for hands-on work. Scattered chalkboards 
mark classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW plans to make its 3-series sedan here first, moving to a two-seat sports 
car by 1996. It hopes to have 2,000 workers at the plant when it reaches full 
production in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay starts at $12 an hour, increasing to $16 in two years. The average wage 
statewide for manufacturing jobs is about $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the money, workers say jobs at BMW offer other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those hired so far have been flown to BMW factories in Germany to 
learn from their overseas colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gainey, who had worked for a company that produced household and 
industrial cleaners, was with BMW for four days when he was sent to Munich for 
a month to watch workers install seats, steering wheels, air bags and 
windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you actually see it done, it doesn't seem so far-fetched to you," the 
29-year-old Gainey says. "I'm ready to start up." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas training is not unique to BMW. When Nissan built its Symrna, Tenn., 
plant in the early 1980s, nearly every worker spent time at a pickup truck 
assembly plant in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them that while we recognized it would be very costly, we saw so many 
long-term advantages," says John B. Schnapp, a consultant with Mercer 
Management Consulting who worked with Nissan in opening the Symrna plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers get a clearer sense of the company," Schnapp says. They also get a 
sense of pride in their work, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 At BMW Manufacturing Corp., President Al Kinzer also has taken a page from 
Honda's Marysville, Ohio, plant, where he was a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, including Kinzer, wears white lab coats. Managers work in an open 
area next to the training floor -- no walls, no private offices, no executive 
washrooms. The practice is meant to promote a feeling of unity, spokesman Bobby 
Hitt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a key thing was the teamwork and how well you work with others," says 
Ballenger, who left a job she held for her entire adult life for the chance to 
work at BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just money. It's just such a big opportunity to learn new things," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plant was first announced amid much publicity, 60,000 people mailed 
initial job application requests to a state agency, which handled screening and 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 When BMW ran another ad in April, application requests flowed in at 4,000 a 
week. And Spartanburg County is no corporate backwater. The area already is 
home to other multinational companies and boasts a 4.5% unemployment rate, one 
of the lowest in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Hitt says, BMW has promised to give preference to workers living 
within 50 miles of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW is quickly becoming something of a tourist attraction as well. Spartanburg 
Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Laura Corbin says people from across the 
country wander in asking for directions to the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in and say, 'Tell me where BMW is. Tell me how to get a job,' " 
Corbin says.

WHITTLE BETS ON FUTURE OF ITS ELECTRONIC MEDIA; COMMUNICATIONS: THE COMPANY HAS 
UPROOTED ITSELF FROM ITS PRINT BEGINNINGS 25 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Whittle reaped millions of advertising dollars and won a 
reputation as a media innovator by giving companies dozens of new ways to 
connect with appealing audiences over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He developed magazines for medical waiting rooms and beauty shops, posters for 
school corridors and veterinarians offices and books for corporate chieftains 
-- and sold advertising to companies who coveted those readers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the once widely diversified Whittle Communications has undergone a 
wrenching change in the past two years that uprooted it from print media and 
implanted it in the electronic age. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle, who helped create the Knoxville, Tenn.-based company nearly 25 years 
ago, has lived up to his name -- belatedly by some accounts -- by pruning a 
far-flung group of more than 30 different operations to three core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman, now 46, and his partners are placing bets for the company's 
future on the Channel One news program for schools, the Medical News Network 
system for physicians and the Edison school management project. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation came at personal cost. More than 250 employees have been 
dismissed in the past two years as revenue growth slowed and then declined 
partly due to restructuring moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle contends the three newly designated core businesses could generate 
more than $1.75 billion a year in business some day. 
</P>
<P>
 But associates say Whittle is a perennial optimist. They say he thought the 
old business could become a billion-dollar operation. Those were days when the 
company was posting double-digit percentage revenue gains each year, recruiting 
an all-star cast of managers and courting powerful new financial partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The heady growth ended three years ago just north of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue climbed 23% to $201 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991. It 
edged up 6% to a record $207 million the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the record revenue year, Whittle agreed to sell a one-third stake to 
the investment firm Forstmann Little & Co. for $350 million, but the deal soon 
collapsed when Forstmann disputed Whittle's revenue forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1993, Whittle revenue fell 5.8% to $195 million, the first yearly 
decline since the company was incorporated in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle expects another decline this fiscal year mainly due to the closing in 
March of the Special Report Network, which delivered a one-hour TV show, a 
magazine, posters and brochures to more than 24,000 medical waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said the underlying revenue trend is good. Electronic media 
now accounts for more than 80% of total revenue and is growing. Revenue from 
magazines, posters and sampling programs has shrunk so low that any further 
declines won't be as big a drag on overall revenue trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle Communications is privately held and therefore not required to file 
public financial reports, and Whittle declined to disclose earnings figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Whittle said he underestimated how TV and other electronic 
media would divert advertising and talent from his print properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Whittle collected $10 million in ad revenue in 1988 from 
Connections, posters hung in school corridors with stories and space for ads. 
</P>
<P>
 He expected Connections would complement the TV service for schools, Channel 
One, introduced nationally in 1990. But he found advertisers lost interest in 
posters once Channel One was available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Channel One drove over Connections like a truck. It obliterated it," Whittle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel One also attracted print staffers who wanted to be where pioneering 
work was done. "We had a wholesale desertion of talented people from print to 
the electronic forms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical News Network, delivered via satellite and computer terminals to 
doctor's offices, did the same to the book division, which Whittle is closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug companies that sponsored Grand Rounds Press, one of three ad-filled 
book series from Whittle, prefer the electronic system over books for reaching 
doctors, Whittle said. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology and the talent flow don't explain the revenue slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad spending growth generally slowed in the early 1990s. Whittle's critics say 
the company hurt itself with its early sales tactics and questionable audience 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 When it launched Special Report Network for medical waiting rooms in 1988, 
Whittle bypassed advertising agencies and dealt directly with top company 
executives in signing the initial multiyear ad contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad agency executives remember that when asked several years later for advice 
on whether the money was well spent and if contracts should be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an early arrogance regarding the agency community that (was) 
difficult to overcome," said Betsy Frank, who evaluates media for the agency 
Saatchi & Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
 She said many ad buyers were dissatisfied with the audience research. Whittle 
said audience measurement was improved continuously and not a reason for 
closing Special Report. He blamed high costs of delivering the program, 
prospects of more losses and staff defections to Medical News Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Company insiders said there were other problems. It cost plenty to build a 
college-like corporate complex in Knoxville and hire high-profile executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have enormous potential there that was unfortunately limited by the 
overhead they were dragging around," said Gerry Hogan, who left after 18 months 
at Whittle to head Home Shopping Network in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the recent restructuring moves by his old company "are directionally 
correct to get Whittle going again." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Whittle's involvement in developing the Edison Project to operate 
schools more effectively and profitably distracted him from the media business 
in the early '90s, leaving the company to try questionable projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle said his attention to Edison development will prove profitable for his 
investment partners. But he conceded the company missed Nicholas Glover's 
guidance after Glover left as chief executive in 1989. Glover returned in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Johnstone, chief executive of Philips Consumer Electronics Co., was 
recently named chief executive in a move to strengthen financial leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Philips' Dutch parent owns 33% of Whittle as does Time Warner Inc., which 
wants to sell its stake. Associated Newspaper Holdings of Britain owns 22%, 
Whittle himself has 7% and key executives own the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Philips, Associated Newspapers and Whittle himself own the Edison project. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may eventually get a chance to buy a piece of Channel One, Medical 
News Network and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics still say Channel One exploits students for profit, that health-care 
reform could cut drug makers' ability to finance MNN, and that school 
management is an unproven business fraught with political dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whittle, who became a multimillionaire by selling part of his company to 
outsiders, said that focusing on potentially big operations rather than smaller 
projects is the right move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of these businesses has greater capacity than the businesses we had 
in 1988," he said.

SYSTEM NEEDED TO TRACK MUTUAL-FUND INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever your goals and strategies, it's hard to get far in mutual-fund 
investing without a good record-keeping system. 
</P>
<P>
 You need well-organized records just to keep a fix on how your fund 
investments are doing. Beyond that, inadequate records can cost you dearly in 
extra taxes when you sell. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to cope with this situation is to save every piece of paper you ever 
receive from a fund, hoping that the resulting pile will serve as a file. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can work up a system that doesn't take a lot of time to maintain but 
that provides you quickly with information and documentation when you need it. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a bare-bones outline for such a system, offered as a model 
with the understanding that any plan needs to be custom-tailored to an 
individual's personal style. 
</P>
<P>
 In this system, all the paper that passes through your hands is separated into 
four files: 
</P>
<P>
 File 1. Items you need not save but want to retain purely for background 
information, such as fund family newsletters and other promotional literature. 
These go into a "miscellaneous" folder or drawer that is explicitly understood 
to contain no essential documents. 
</P>
<P>
 File 2. Items that pertain only to tracking investment performance and 
administrative details, starting with a current copy of the prospectus. This 
category also may include such things as quarterly and annual reports from the 
funds, independent advisory letters and any charts you keep of funds' net asset 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 File 3. Items to include in your annual income-tax file, including Forms 1099 
and other tax forms received from each fund for the year, and copies of 
monthly, quarterly or annual statements showing all activity in your accounts 
-- purchases and sales of shares, distributions received, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prime material for this file: Any document that affects the amount of 
tax you might owe on a fund distribution, such as a municipal bond fund's 
state-by-state breakdown of income sources. 
</P>
<P>
 File 4. Items to retain for long-term tax purposes. These include confirmation 
statements or other documents showing the dates and amounts of all purchases of 
shares. Here you need to keep track not only of what you buy directly, but the 
purchases you make with automatic reinvestments of distributions or switches 
from one fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is to know, and be able to document, precisely how much you have 
paid for all your shares, so that you can accurately figure your capital gain 
or loss when you sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate for this file -- material that documents any and all 
non-deductible contributions you make to a tax-deferred savings program such as 
an individual retirement account. The idea is to avoid having to pay tax on 
this money again when you make withdrawals from the account. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a few pieces of paper will fall into more than one category, 
requiring occasional trips to the nearest available photocopier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, many fund families have been expanding the 
record-keeping support services they offer investors, even on such long-term 
matters as calculating cost bases. 
</P>
<P>
 This can help simplify the investor's job and be a great help in 
reconstructing lost records. But it doesn't remove responsibility for good 
record-keeping from the investor's shoulders.

SCALING NEW HEIGHTS; YOUNG EXECUTIVES ARE OLD HANDS AT LEADING CORPORATIONS; 
SUCCESS: NINE OF O.C.'S TOP 100 ARE NOT YET 40; ONE IS 27. SOME ATTRIBUTE RAPID 
RISE TO LUCK, WHILE OTHERS CITE HARD WORK.

 Wayne Lowell humbly attributes his zoom up the corporate ladder to luck. James 
T. Schraith was in such a hurry to get where he is today that he dropped out of 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel L. Westover wanted to be a doctor but discovered he enjoyed crunching 
numbers more than peering into microscopes. Kelly A. Gray recalls as her 
inspiration childhood dinners where her parents passionately discussed their 
family business. 
</P>
<P>
 However they did it, they became some of Orange County's most successful 
executives -- all before their 40th birthdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 100 highest-paid officers at local public companies are in their 
30s. And Gray, senior vice president and creative director of St. John Knits in 
Irvine, is a mere 27. 
</P>
<P>
 With total compensation last year of $803,569, Gray was the 
second-highest-paid female executive in Orange County -- behind only her 
mother, Marie St. John Gray, the apparel company's co-founder and vice 
chairman. Together, they represent half of the women who ranked among Orange 
County's best-paid corporate officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very fortunate to have achieved so much at such a young age," Gray 
said. "It's very much due to the guidance I've received from my family and a 
strong support team at work." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray got her first job with St. John at age 12, wrapping packages in the 
mailroom. "I always imagined myself as being very involved in the company," she 
said. "It was my parents' life, and it became my life." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her other responsibilities, Gray models clothes for St. John 
magazine advertisements. Her salary last year included $165,000 in modeling 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Westover, president and chief executive of Systemed in Laguna Hills, is almost 
a millionaire at age 38. Last year, the company paid him $956,116 -- all but 
$109,000 of it in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made good career choices," Westover said. Thirteen years ago, he left 
his job as an accountant with Price Waterhouse for a position as chief 
financial officer at a small start-up company: Los Angeles-based Maxicare 
Health Plans Inc., now a $2-billion operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he joined Systemed, which manages prescription drug insurance 
plans. "I wanted to work again for a fast-growing, entrepreneurial company," 
Westover said. 
</P>
<P>
 And 36-year-old Schraith, senior vice president of sales and service for AST 
Research Inc., pocketed $595,067 in salary, bonuses and stock options last 
year. He started working for electronics companies when he was a teen and 
hasn't stopped -- not even to finish the course work for a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't patient enough," Schraith said. "When I was in school, all I wanted 
to do was get out and get my hands dirty. I don't know if I'd recommend that to 
everyone. But by getting into the workplace early, I learned a lot more than I 
would have sitting in a classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith was recruited by Irvine computer maker AST in 1987. Though only 29, 
he had already spent a decade at electronics giant Schlumberger Technologies, 
based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell, 39, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Pacificare 
Health Systems in Cypress, made $675,614 in total compensation last year. He 
claims that he owes much of his success to serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can underestimate the benefits of being in the right place 
at the right time," he said. "I know a lot of men and women who are equally 
dedicated and who have worked equally hard, but who just haven't gotten the 
right opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell joined Pacificare -- which owns and operates health maintenance 
organizations -- eight years ago as corporate controller. At the time, the 
company had about 250 employees and $100 million in annual revenue. It since 
has grown to 3,000 employees and expects revenue of almost $3 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ever wanted to do is what I do now," Lowell said. "But I thought I 
would be doing it for a smaller company and that I would be five or 10 years 
older."

SCALING NEW HEIGHTS; FIDELITY AMONG COMPANIES THAT PLACE STOCK IN REWARD 
SYSTEM; INCOME: NOT ALL SALARIES AND BONUSES, HOWEVER, REFLECT THE VALUE OF A 
BUSINESS' SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You wouldn't know it by looking at the chief executive's base salary, but 
Fidelity National Financial Inc. placed first among Orange County companies in 
stock appreciation over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's fifth largest title insurance companies, Newport Beach-based 
Fidelity saw the value of its shares increase more than tenfold. According to 
its proxy statement to shareholders, $100 invested in Fidelity shares in 1988 
was worth $1,388.50 at the end of the company's 1993 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity rewarded four of its five top officers with pay hikes and increased 
bonuses over the past few years. However, the salary of President and Chief 
Executive William P. Foley II stalled at $394,008, unchanged from the previous 
year and down 3% from the $405,836 he was paid in 1991. Foley's annual bonus 
took a dive, too: $415,000 last year, down 40% from $697,742 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than with a raise, the company acknowledged Foley's contribution to 
Fidelity's good fortune with sizable grants of stock options -- worth a 
conservatively estimated $3.5 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank P. Willey, Fidelity executive vice president and general counsel, said 
the reward system provides Foley an opportunity to make more money than he 
would with standard pay hikes. And, what's good for a major shareholder is good 
for all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 5% to 10% increase in salary does not even compare in terms of value to a 
big jump in stock value," Willey said. "We have an employee stock purchase plan 
that many of our employees and all of our executives are involved in. As a 
result, we are very motivated to look at stock appreciation. The more we can do 
to enhance the value of our stock for our shareholders, the more financial 
reward we ourselves recognize." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, 1993 was a good year for Fidelity. Its profit more than doubled 
from 1992 to $36.3 million, and revenues rose 47% to $575.4 million. That 
helped Foley's 20% stake in the company climb from a value of $38 million at 
the beginning of 1993 to $86 million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care companies, benefiting from a growing emphasis on cost-saving 
managed health plans, crowded the other top slots for stock value appreciation. 
If you invested $100 in Pacificare Health Systems in Cypress five years ago, by 
the end of 1993 it would be worth $1,262.50. Fountain Valley-based FHP 
International Corp.'s stock value grew sixfold to $607. And at Safeguard Health 
Enterprises in Anaheim, a $100 investment turned into $550 over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 82 Orange County public companies that were required to report stock 
performance trends in their proxies, 50 showed gains over the five-year period 
while 32 reported losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The big losers were shareholders of Koll Real Estate Group, where a $100 
investment in the Newport Beach development company, made when its stock was 
first publicly traded in 1990, would have plummeted to a mere $4.48 at the end 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Donald M. Koll and Chief Executive Raymond Wirta joined Koll Real 
Estate just last year, so their respective salaries of $162,500 and $110,417 
cannot be compared to company performance over the three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raymond J. Pacini, the company's chief financial officer and executive 
vice president, saw his salary and bonus increase 32.6% over the three years -- 
to $286,500 in 1993 from $216,000 in 1991. Pacini's actual salary dropped 
slightly in 1993, off 5.25% to $156,500 from $165,167 in 1992. But his annual 
bonus of $130,000 was more than twice the $60,000 bonuses he received in 1991 
and again in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bonus was based on specific objectives that we accomplished during the 
year," Pacini said -- adding that the company raised $100 million through asset 
sales and financing, paid off $58 million in bank debt and retired another $53 
million in public debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported 1993 profit of $14.3 million, which included a gain of 
$41 million from discontinued operations, compared to a loss of $38.4 million 
the year before. Revenue declined 41% to $16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other losers over the five years included Alliance Imaging in Orange, where 
$100 fell to $9; UnionFed Financial Corp. in Brea, which turned $100 into $10 
for shareholders; and CMS Enhancements in Irvine (since renamed AmeriQuest 
Technologies Inc.) where $100 invested in 1988 fell to $18 at the end of 1993.

SCALING NEW HEIGHTS; LUCRATIVE FAMILIAL DEALS ADD TO OFFICERS' COFFERS; PACTS: 
COMPANIES REASSURE SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE REAL ESTATE AND SERVICE CONTRACTS SOME 
EXECUTIVES HAVE WITH THE PUBLIC CORPORATIONS THEY HELP MANAGE ARE IN THE BEST 
INTEREST OF ALL CONCERNED. 
</P>

<P>
 Top executives at public companies are well rewarded with salaries, bonuses 
and stock options. But a less obvious, but nonetheless lucrative, sort of 
compensation comes in the form of real estate deals and service contracts some 
have with the public companies they help manage. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, they are the customer, the salesperson and the merchant rolled 
into one. But companies assure shareholders in their proxy statements that 
these familial deals are in the best interest of everyone concerned -- and that 
the transactions are no less favorable than could be obtained from unaffiliated 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "These linkages are not necessarily bad things," said Lawrence Wangler, a 
principal in the Irvine office of Towers Perrin, a national human resource 
consulting firm. "The office lease or the supply contract could be the best 
deal in town. It's up to the outside directors to make sure that it is a good 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, St. John Knits Inc. leased its corporate office and adjacent 
manufacturing facilities in Irvine from G.M. Properties -- a partnership in 
which the Gray Family Trust has a 50% stake. That means St. John's chairman and 
chief executive, Robert Gray, did business with himself -- bringing home about 
$500,000 from the publicly held company, of which he and his family own 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra Partners, another partnership owned largely by Gray and his family, 
made $293,000 leasing a second manufacturing facility in Alhambra to St. John. 
And Ocean Air Charters Inc., solely owned by Gray and his wife, Marie St. John 
Gray -- co-founders of the clothes design company -- leased an airplane for 
business trips and a boat for entertainment purposes to St. John in 1993, 
making a total of $310,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Carl N. Karcher's ouster as chairman from Carl Karcher Enterprises 
last fall, the company's founder still had several side deals with the 
corporation. The fast-food chain paid the Karcher Trust more than $1 million in 
rent for its two-story Anaheim headquarters, and another $474,000 to lease five 
restaurant properties -- which have since been acquired by the corporation for 
nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcorp Inc. likewise pays rent to its chairman and chief executive, Ernest 
S. Rady. A holding company for Western Financial Savings Bank, Irvine-based 
Westcorp leases space for its branch offices in Encino and Walnut Creek from 
Insurance Company of the West, a private company partly owned by Rady. Last 
year, the savings and loan paid $407,000 to ICW. 
</P>
<P>
 The money flows both ways: ICW shelled out nearly $100,000 to landlord 
Westcorp in 1993 for office space it uses in Orange, Fresno and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcorp also spent $150,000 last year to lease space for its Del Mar branch 
offices from the Ernest S. Rady Trust. Kearny Mesa Business Center, partly 
owned by Rady, collected $60,000 in rent checks from Westcorp for a San Diego 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all. Property manager American Assets Inc., which is controlled 
by Rady, made almost $500,000 last year managing apartment buildings acquired 
by Westcorp through foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rule is that we only use (the outside services) of somebody who is 
associated with Westcorp when their price is actually lower than all other 
bids," said Westcorp President Stephen Prough.

HOT PROPERTY: SHE BUYS OWN 'LITTLE HOUSE' 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MELISSA GILBERT, who co-stars with Cicely Tyson as a pair of Southern lawyers 
who champion the underdog in the fall NBC series "Sweet Justice," has purchased 
a three-bedroom San Fernando Valley home for about $500,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert just finished a movie with Marlee Matlin for Lifetime Cable and is 
about to start work on a CBS movie with Patty Duke. Now 30, Gilbert became a 
well-known actress as a child, playing Laura Ingalls on the long-running series 
"Little House on the Prairie." 
</P>
<P>
 She starred in the CBS movie "Babymaker: The Dr. Cecil Jacobson Story," which 
aired earlier this year, and co-starred last year in five TV movies, including 
"A Family of Strangers," with Patty Duke and William Shatner, and "House of 
Secrets," with Bruce Boxleitner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, who was divorced from actor-writer Bo Brinkman in February, was 
briefly engaged to Boxleitner after her separation from Brinkman. 
</P>
<P>
 She was living in her mother's guest quarters in the San Fernando Valley 
before buying the home, which is between Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1944, the 3,000-square-foot, Cape Cod-style house has shutters, 
window seats, French doors, two fireplaces, a cozy kitchen, breakfast nook, 
pool and spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Nelson and Nicki Marcellino represented Gilbert, and Gayle Slade had 
the listing. All of the realtors are with Prudential California Realty in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 MATT FREWER, who played Trashcan Man in Stephen King's miniseries "The Stand" 
earlier this month, and his wife, documentarian Amanda Hillwood, have purchased 
a three-bedroom Malibu home for close to its $799,000 asking price, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The home features what is being termed "an organic design of natural building 
materials" and has many trees on its 1.5 acres, with a footpath to the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Frewer also played Cinemax's high-tech talk-show host Max Headroom, which was 
resurrected by Bravo on cable this year, and he later appeared in the CBS 
sitcom "Doctor, Doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan and Char Rubendall of Fred Sands' Malibu Riviera office handled both 
sides of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 THAAO PENGHLIS, who returned recently after an eight-year absence to his role 
as Count Antony DiMera on NBC's "Days of Our Lives," is nearing the end of a 
$130,000 refurbishing project at his home, built by architect John Lautner in 
1964 just off of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Penghlis, who also starred as master-of-disguise Nicholas Black in the revived 
"Mission: Impossible" series and co-starred in the miniseries "Memories of 
Midnights," has been painting the three-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot house, which 
was originally gray, to complement his collections of Greek pots and Oriental 
screens and vases. 
</P>
<P>
 He painted the outside of his home cobalt blue and the inside in earth tones 
of yellow and gold with red touches. He is also redoing the landscaping, having 
completed a waterfall and pond, and modernizing the kitchen, installing black 
granite counters and walls and black kitchen appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it dramatic and masculine," he said of the home, which he 
has owned for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a maze, constantly turning corners, like my life," Penghlis, who is of 
Greek descent but born in Australia, philosophized. 
</P>
<P>
 YVETTE MIMIEUX, who most recently appeared in Jackie Collins' "Lady Boss" 1992 
miniseries but has made dozens of TV and feature films since the 1960s, has a 
house for lease in the Beverly Hills area at $8,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which has two bedrooms and a den plus guest quarters and sits on a 
gated six-acre knoll overlooking Benedict Canyon, is co-listed by Elaine Young 
and Paul Czako, both of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>

GARDENING Q&A: WHAT NUMBERS MEAN IN PLANT FOOD LABELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: What is a "balanced plant food," and what do the numbers on plant 
food containers stand for? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (or N, P and K respectively) are 
required by all plants and affect plant growth in rather specific ways. 
"Balanced plant foods" contain all three of these nutrients in various 
proportions, depending on how they will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The package label displays a three-number formula (such as 8-10-6 or 12-12-12) 
identifying the percentage of each nutrient in that blend of plant food. 
</P>
<P>
 The first number in the formula always stands for nitrogen, which promotes 
greenery and leafy growth in plants. (There are two types of nitrogen in plant 
foods, identified in the "Guaranteed Analysis" on the package label: 
slow-acting, longer-lasting "ammonia" or "urea" forms, and fast-acting, 
short-term "nitrate" or "nitric" forms. Slow-growing plants such as camellias 
prefer the ammonia form, and fast-growing plants such as roses prefer the 
nitrate form.) 
</P>
<P>
 The second number is the percentage of phosphorus, used by plants in roots, 
flowers, fruits and seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third number represents the amount of potassium or potash in the plant 
food. This nutrient is required for healthy stems and proper growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this, it's easy to decide which of the many available formulas are 
best suited to the needs of your plants, as long as you know what you want your 
plants to do. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, you want your lawn to grow lots of greenery, so you should use a 
plant food highest in the first number, such as 12-6-2 or 10-6-4 or 8-4-2. The 
same is true for growing lettuce or cabbage or celery in your vegetable garden. 
(Lawns grow fast, but they are intended to last a long time. Therefore, it is 
best to feed lawns with blends containing both the ammonia and the nitrate 
forms of nitrogen, for both immediate and lasting effects. Most vegetables grow 
quickly and benefit from the quick-acting nitrate forms of nitrogen.) 
</P>
<P>
 Roses grow vigorously, producing lots of flowers on new shoots. To promote 
optimal bloom they require a formula such as 15-30-15 or 8-12-6, highest in the 
middle number, with the faster-acting nitrate form of nitrogen. Camellias grow 
slowly, producing their flowers on mature wood; they benefit from a similar 
formula that uses the slower-acting ammonia-type nitrogen. Similar formulas 
highest in the middle number should be used on any plants intended to bloom 
heavily (such as hibiscus, day lilies and irises) or produce fruits (squashes, 
peaches, oranges, avocados) or seeds (peas, beans, almonds, pecans) or edible 
roots (potatoes, turnips, onions). It's fairly easy to decide which type of 
nitrogen should be in the formula just by knowing how fast the plants grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant food formulas highest in the last number are never really needed and are 
not normally available on a commercial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 One last word of advice: When using plant foods, be sure to apply them in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, because an overdose can be 
lethal. Just enough will save money and will give wonderful results. How to 
Prepare Soil for Planting Garden 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How should I prepare my soil for planting vegetables and flowers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In this arid, semi-desert climate our soils desperately lack organic 
matter, which would significantly improve their water-holding capacity and help 
keep essential nutrients available for plant growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners here are wise to amend their soil with humus, leaf mold, composted 
rice hulls, aged manures, shredded forest materials and other such products to 
save water, to maximize their harvest and to increase the efficiency of their 
own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not recommend the use of redwood or peat-moss products in our area for 
the following reasons: redwood contains a component that may actually inhibit 
the growth of some plants, especially roses; and peat moss must be thoroughly 
moistened before use and never allowed to dry out. Once peat moss dries out in 
the soil, it becomes practically waterproof and may jeopardize your plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a marked improvement in your garden soil, cultivate the ground to a 
depth of about 12 inches, then add 3 to 6 inches of organic amendment and mix 
it thoroughly into the soil by spading and re-spading or by rototilling. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is both laborious and potentially expensive, but it will give 
amazing results and is truly worth the investment in time and money if you plan 
to do serious gardening on a long-term basis. Even so, any amount of organic 
material added to your soil will be beneficial. How Does Vitamin B-1 Help New 
Plants? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've heard that Vitamin B-1 should be used whenever I put new plants into 
my garden or landscape. What does it do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The use of Vitamin B-1 has long been advocated by nurserymen to prevent 
transplant shock and stimulate new growth. However, studies within the last 15 
years at UC Davis and elsewhere have shown no effect by Vitamin B-1. 
Furthermore, researchers for Sunset magazine, applying six different treatments 
on a crop of marigolds in a recent study, found absolutely no beneficial 
results from the use of this product. 
</P>
<P>
 So save yourself some hard-earned cash and skip the B-1. Your plants will grow 
just as well. Fertilizer Formulas 
</P>
<P>
 The formula will be in numbers such as 10-6-4. The numbers stand for the 
percentage of chemicals in the bag, nitrogen, phosphate and potash. 
</P>
<P>
 An easy way to remember this is UP, DOWN, ALL AROUND. 
</P>
<P>
 - The first number is nitrogen. It makes the grass grow up and green. 
</P>
<P>
 - The second number is always phosphate and it makes the root system grow down 
and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 - The third is always potash and it makes the grass grow all around. Types of 
fertilizers 
</P>
<P>
 - Organic: Is obtained from plants and animal waste and is a balanced 
fertilizer. It's drawback is that it is slow-acting. 
</P>
<P>
 - Slow release fertilizer: WIN on the label (water insoluble nitrogen). It is 
very high in nitrogen, enough to burn the grass. However since the chemical is 
slow released, it is not a problem. The advantage of slow release fertilizer is 
that you don't have to apply it as often. 
</P>
<P>
 - Soluble synthetic fertilizer: It is easy to handle and the cost is not 
prohibitive. On the negative side, if the product is overlapped or the lawn is 
wet when applied, or if the lawn is not watered after application there could 
be fertilizer burn.

KEEPING IT ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY LUKAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lukas is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When newlywed Albert Sakharoff and his French bride boarded a bus in New York 
City in 1946, they were bound for Southern California and his job as a 
sheet-metal worker, which paid 40 cents a hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 47 years later and retired since 1984, Sakharoff and his wife, Micheline, 
have assets estimated at $9 million -- much of it in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in their Ventura Keys home, the Sakharoffs, both 70, talked 
about the plans they have made to pass their wealth -- as free from taxes as 
possible -- to their only daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple began estate planning several months ago after a discussion of 
annuities with their insurance agent. Micheline Sakharoff, now retired after 25 
years of teaching French language and literature at Cal State Northridge, had 
accumulated the annuities through her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (the agent) saw our financial statement, he urged us to see an expert 
right away," Sakharoff said. They contacted attorney Jon J. Gallo, an estate 
planning specialist, who advised them to create a family limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 A family limited partnership (FLIP) is one of the most complicated, 
sophisticated and expensive of tax-reducing techniques. It is particularly 
suitable for people who have much of their wealth in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A family limited partnership is a means of making gifts of property to 
children at highly discounted rates. As long as the gifts fall below the 
$600,000 lifetime exemption for each parent, they will avoid gift taxes. FLIP 
also serves to reduce the value of the estate when the parents die. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point in the FLIP's favor: Transferring real estate to a family 
limited partnership does not trigger a property tax reassessment under 
Proposition 13. And once the property is in the FLIP, the parents can transfer 
up to 49% of the partnership to their children without reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sakharoff FLIP, which is filed with both the county and the state, 
consists of five pieces of income property they own in Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. When appraised when the FLIP was created, the net value of the 
properties was $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple made their only child, Katherine, a limited partner in the FLIP, 
giving her a 30% interest with no control over the affairs of the partnership. 
Sakharoff and his wife are 70% general partners, making all decisions relating 
to the management of the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Sakharoffs simply given Katherine a 30% interest in the properties 
without their being part of the FLIP, the gift would have amounted to $434,000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after applying certain discounts, which are a key element of a FLIP 
-- Katherine's 30% was worth only $222,000, a reduction in value of $212,000. 
This procedure, as mentioned earlier, has reduced the value of the gift and 
ultimately the value of their estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of Katherine's interest is so much less under the FLIP because the 
partnerships operate on "discount theory," the premise that investors will 
offer less for property interests if they are non-marketable and if they lack 
control. Both conditions describe the status of limited partners such as 
Katherine. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a simple explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 If you owned a duplex worth $400,000, do you think someone would pay you 
$100,000 for a 25% share, which gave that person absolutely no say in operating 
the duplex? Not likely. Any potential buyer would want a discount because that 
25% minority share is definitely not worth 25% of the full value of the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of limited partnerships, the sum of the parts is less than the 
whole," Gallo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS no longer challenges the concept that the market discounts minority 
interests, the experts say, if you're wondering about the legality of this 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's up to the taxpayer to have credible evidence to support the claimed 
discount. And that evidence can only be provided by qualified real estate 
appraisers; in fact, two types of appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what they do: 
</P>
<P>
 Before the FLIP is created, the property that's going into the partnership 
must be appraised. That's the job of appraiser No. 1, whose fee can range from 
$1,000 to $10,000 -- if you happen to own a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Once his or her work is complete, the appraisal goes to a second appraiser who 
specializes in fractional interest discounts. This specialist will provide one, 
or possibly two, vital figures: 1) an appraisal of the discounted value of the 
limited partnership interest being given to the children when the entire 
building is in the partnership, and/or 2) an appraisal of the value of the 
children's minority interest when only a portion of the property is being 
transferred to the partnership. (This second appraisal is a double-discounting 
technique, and you may have some difficulty with the IRS if you try to take 
double discounts.) 
</P>
<P>
 These appraisals will cost between $1,500 and $3,500 -- or more -- depending 
on the type and size of the property. The Sakharoffs, for example, are paying 
$10,000 for all their appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides appraisal fees, the attorney's fee for creating the FLIP can range 
from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Sakharoffs, it's money well spent. Their FLIP will save their daughter 
at least $118,000 in estate taxes. (This is 55% of the $212,000 discount that 
was created by the transfer. The Sakharoffs are in the 55% tax bracket, as is 
anyone whose net worth is more than $3 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 With an estate as large as theirs, the Sakharoffs said they are also 
investigating the merits of a charitable remainder trust and a qualified 
personal residence trust. People with substantial wealth frequently utilize all 
three of these techniques, legal experts say. How a FLIP Works 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a hypothetical example of how a family limited partnership works: Tom 
and Charlotte Martin have two children and a highly appreciated duplex 
appraised at $400,000. The Martins create a FLIP and transfer the duplex to the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the FLIP conditions is that Tom is the general partner and owns a 2% 
interest. Tom manages the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte is a limited partner with a 98% interest. As a limited partner, 
Charlotte has no control over the duplex, but she can give away part of her 
interest in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 She gives 24% of her 98% interest to son Jim and 24% to daughter Carla. In 
dollars, that means that Jim's limited share in the partnership ought to be 
worth $96,000 and Carla's share ought to be worth $96,000. But they really 
aren't, because who wants to buy a 24% minority, limited partnership interest 
in a partnership controlled by Jim and Carla's parents? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if someone did want to buy a minority interest, the buyer would expect a 
discount ranging from 25% to 40%, experts say. But even with such discounts, it 
would be hard to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the discount is still applicable for valuing the gift of the limited 
partnership interest for gift and tax purposes. In our example and using a 40% 
discount rate, the original $96,000 gift is reduced to $57,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The FLIP thus allowed the Martins to transfer roughly one-half of the property 
(worth $200,000) at a discounted value of $115,200. Help With Estate Planning 
</P>
<P>
 The estate-planning strategies discussed in this series are too complicated to 
tackle on your own. You need an attorney specializing in this field. But how to 
find one? 
</P>
<P>
 A first step is to call the Los Angeles County Bar Assn.'s lawyer referral 
service, SmartLaw, which makes referrals to private attorneys in more than 30 
areas of law, including estate planning, wills, probate, taxes and elder law. 
The lawyers are screened and have met a require level of professional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients are asked to pay a $25 fee to help support the nonprofit service for 
their first half-hour consultation with a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The SmartLaw number is (213) 243-1525.

YOUR MORTGAGE; MAIL BRINGS OFFERS OF GUARANTEED MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With new loan applications sagging this spring, home mortgage lenders are 
turning to aggressive marketing techniques pioneered by the credit card 
industry. Get ready to be pitched one or more of these deals in the coming 
months: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pre-approved, fully guaranteed credit lines of $15,000, $30,000 or higher 
tied to your home equity. You never actually apply for the money. You've been 
pre-screened electronically, and the lender knows your home value, your credit 
history, even the number of kids in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer of guaranteed money simply arrives in your mail, like one of those 
pre-approved VISA or Mastercards you've probably received. All that's needed is 
your signature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Credit card tie-ins offering substantial discounts on your mortgage fees, 
interest rate, closing costs or homeowner purchases. These are patterned after 
high-profile "co-branded" automobile, airline and other forms of VISAs and 
Mastercards. They all offer rebates on future vehicle, travel or other 
purchases as incentives for extensive use of their plastic on your everyday 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reverse mortgage cards for seniors in their 70s and 80s. These are 
pre-approved equity lines, accessed through plastic, up to a maximum dollar 
amount. Unlike other credit cards, however, the reverse mortgage card won't 
have to be paid off in monthly installments. Instead the full loan balance, 
plus interest, is paid off following the sale of your home. You could charge a 
European vacation to your gold reverse mortgage card, and never have to pay 
back a cent until after you're dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound far-fetched? Not at all, say top marketers for the mortgage industry. 
Plastic-style rebates, tie-ins and computerized target marketing are the 
hottest new concepts in the home mortgage field. Here's what's happening: 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-approved mortgages are being introduced in key markets around the country 
by clients of Investment Marketing Group (IMG), based in Chicago and Arlington, 
Tex. Firm president James W. Finkenkeller says the typical offer works like 
this: 
</P>
<P>
 The lender defines the sort of new borrower it wants to attract -- say, 
upscale baby-boomer families with plenty of equity in their homes, solid credit 
histories, but who have no home equity loans or lines of credit outstanding. 
IMG then uses credit bureau data and computerized homeowner profiles to 
identify consumers in the bank's market area who fit all the desired criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 IMG then sends solicitations to the household heads offering them "guaranteed" 
credit -- instant cash -- up to the bank's target limit, say $30,000. For 
consumers who respond, the bank then offers either the line of credit or a 
first mortgage that consolidates the family's outstanding debts -- for autos, 
boats, college tuitions, etc. -- into a single loan secured by the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the data resources now available" on millions of households' personal 
finances across the country, Finkenkeller said, "this (technique of targeted, 
pre-approved loan offers) will become increasingly common" in the mortgage 
market. Because of confidentiality clauses in his contracts with banks and 
mortgage banking firms, Finkenkeller said he cannot identify any of his 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you've got a lot of home equity, and you are an active user of consumer 
credit (via charge accounts or personal loans), don't be surprised if you find 
an unsolicited offer of instant, guaranteed mortgage money in your mailbox. 
Should you accept? Check out the fine print first: Is the interest rate in 
single digits like other home equity lines of credit that are tied to the 
banks' prime rate? If not, who needs high-cost debt -- guaranteed or not? 
</P>
<P>
 Another home loan come-on heading your way: Mortgage tie-ins with VISA or 
Mastercards. For example, Wells Fargo Bank now awards rebates toward mortgage 
services on all purchases using its "California Advantage" Mastercard. The 
rebates come off mortgage fees, settlement charges or the interest rate on a 
new home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo's tie-in concept is similar to popular "co-branded" VISA and 
Mastercard programs like the General Motors card with Household Bank, the 
Ford-Citibank VISA, and others that allow card users to cut the cost of a 
vehicle by hundreds or up to thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it for you? Tie-ins and rebates could indeed save you money on your next 
home loan -- unless you've binged on your credit card purchases, racking up 
monthly balances with interest charges of 15% or 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 What about reverse mortgage cards? They don't yet exist, but one West Coast 
executive, K. Shelly Porges of San Francisco's Porges/Hudson Marketing Inc., 
says they're just over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not allow (seniors) to access (reverse mortgage) credit lines with charge 
cards?" she asked.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: FRONT-LOAD WASHER CLEANS BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My skin is sensitive to detergent residues in clothes and I need to 
buy a new clothes washer. What clothes washer design is the most efficient and 
provides the best cleaning and rinsing? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Front-loading clothes washers provide the most thorough cleaning and 
rinsing. Some models even have allergy rinse cycles for people sensitive to 
detergents. Over its lifetime, a new front-loader can save over $1,500 in 
water, detergent and energy costs as compared to a standard top-loader. 
</P>
<P>
 With a front-loader, the washer tub rotates on a horizontal axis (like a 
clothes dryer). This tumbles the clothes through the sudsy water up to 50 times 
per minute for superior cleaning. The typical top-loader model just swirls the 
clothes slowly through the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the clothes tumble through the water in a front-loader, the tub has to 
be only partially filled with water for effective cleaning. These designs use 
30% to 50% less water and 60% less detergent than a top-loader. This saves 
water and energy and reduces pollution in our rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 One front-loader uses a unique "hydromatic" cleaning process. The agitator 
fins in the tub are designed like ladles too. First, the tub rotates slowly for 
5 seconds as fins lift the sudsy water and it falls onto the clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next four seconds, it stops and lets the clothes soak. Then it spins 
faster for 5 seconds to agitate the clothes through the water. This cycle 
repeats every 17 seconds. Another model reverses the tub rotation every 13 
seconds. This improves cleaning and reduces tangles and wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 Very thorough rinsing is a plus with many front-loaders. Some of the European 
models have up to five separate rinses per cycle. This virtually eliminates all 
the detergent residue and dinginess from your clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the horizontal axis tub, front loaders can spin as fast as 1,500 r.p.m. 
(revolutions per minute). This extracts more water and detergent residue. A 
typical top-loader spins at about 700 r.p.m. High-speed spinning also reduces 
the required time in your dryer, another significant energy savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Front-loaders are smaller (only about 27 inches wide) than top-loaders because 
the large agitator is not needed. Since the door is in the front, you can stack 
the dryer on top of the washer to save floor space. 
</P>
<P>
 Some models have built-in water heating elements so you only need to run a 
cold water line to it. The top-quality European front-loaders have built-in 
shock absorbers for vibration-free spinning and are very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 630 showing a buyer's guide of front-loader 
washer manufacturers, cleaning cycles, features, operating costs and prices, 
and a listing of the most efficient standard top-loaders. Please include $2 
handling fee -- cash or check.

 Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen 
Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. What to Do About Solar Window Crack 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Several years ago, I built a solar window heater that you recommended. It 
works great, but the clear acrylic plastic cover is starting to crack. What 
should I do to fix it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You'll have to replace the clear acrylic plastic cover. You apparently 
installed the acrylic cover too tightly or did not allow for clearance holes. 
Once tiny cracks start in acrylic, they tend to grow until the entire piece is 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Acrylic, like most plastics, expands and contracts a lot with temperature 
changes. Use some type of compliant weatherstripping below it and make large 
clearance holes at the screws to allow for this expansion.

 My real estate agent is pressuring me to make a decision. How should I handle 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to discern whether or not the agent is providing good 
advice.If he or she seems eager because they want you to take advantage of a 
good deal, a certain amount of encouragement may be unavoidable and even 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the agent seems detached from your personal circumstances, beware. 
An agent may be overworked or believe they have shown enough homes and now it's 
time to reap their commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beware of the agent who's desperate to make a sale," cautions Dian Hymer, 
author of "Buying and Selling a Home in California: A Complete Guide," 
(Chronicle Books, San Francisco, 1994.) "Top agents manage their personal 
finances so . . . their livelihood doesn't depend on the success of a single 
transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Try discussing the problem with the agent's broker. If the situation cannot be 
resolved, most experts would recommend that people find another agent. 
</P>
<P>
 To legally end a relationship with a salesperson or broker when there is a 
preset agreement on compensation, George Devine, author of "For Sale by Owner," 
(Nolo Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1993) says pay for the hours used and notify the 
broker in writing that you don't need their services anymore.

DOOR PRIZES; COLLECTOR OF ANTIQUE DOORKNOBS KEEPS HAND IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA HENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Henning is a Long Beach free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gripping a doorknob, Bud Wolski believes, is like "shaking hands with a 
building." If that's true, he's met a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski is a collector of antique doorknobs, and he's got more than 4,000 of 
them, in every size, color, material and design. They decorate walls. They are 
stored in cupboards and in display cases. They are tucked away in drawers and 
in cardboard boxes on wooden shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The doorknobs take up most of an anonymous-looking bungalow on Manchester 
Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles and overflow into two walk-in metal cargo 
containers he uses for storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski's collection, which he believes is the largest in Southern California 
and among the largest in the United States, reflects the dizzying diversity of 
antique doorknobs. He specializes in the Arts and Crafts bungalow knobs 
manufactured in Los Angeles in 1910. But the Victorian era is well represented, 
as well as Art Deco, Mission style and the funky '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The knobs are made of everything from brass, bronze and wrought iron to carved 
wood, plastic and white porcelain (with and without flower decals). He also has 
marble and onyx knobs that are smooth and cool to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the glass knobs that catch the eye first. One is a perfectly formed 
clear glass orb with bubbles inside. Other glass knobs look like sparkling, 
outrageously large faux gemstones. They are in shades of brilliant turquoise 
and green, garnet red, amber, pink and purple. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski, 73, is coy when it comes to the value of his collection. He says his 
doorknobs range from "free" to several hundred dollars in price. But there is 
one knob he will not part with for any amount of money. It comes from actress 
Marion Davies' former beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 35 years ago a contractor was repairing the structure, which by then 
had been converted to an apartment building and had suffered fire damage. When 
he needed a doorknob to replace a damaged one, he approached Wolski and a deal 
was made. Wolski got the oversized glass knob that the flames left attractively 
crackled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the thought that Marion Davies had her hand on this knob is a thrill," 
Wolski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski comes by his interest in doorknobs naturally. His father made windows 
and doors, a business Wolski continues in the same South Central location where 
the company was started more than 70 years ago. The doors required hardware, so 
Wolski Sr., a scavenger at heart, scrounged up doorknobs and hinges from odd 
lots that hardware stores were liquidating. His son still owns some of those 
knobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Wolski continues to add to his collection. Good sources are garage 
sales, flea markets and the basements of old hardware stores that are going out 
of business. He also acquires them at sales and auctions held at conventions of 
the Antique Doorknob Collectors of America. "The doorknobs are antiques, not 
the collectors," Wolski added, with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski had always thought of himself as just a pack-rat until Maud Eastwood, a 
legend among doorknob aficionados, took one look at what he had and announced, 
"You're a collector and you don't know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by word-of-mouth, decorators and old-house renovators show up at his 
compound, which consists of three bungalows, one of which he was born in, an 
extensive woodworking shop and an outdoor accumulation of stuff that ranges 
from old sinks and tubs to chandeliers. Sanford & Son would feel at home in 
Wolski's place. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of his doorknobs have been used in television series, and one had a 
starring role in the movie "Beetlejuice." In the movie a teen-age character 
peers through a keyhole and there on the screen is his porcelain doorknob 
"shining out there white and pretty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The knob was among $1,000 worth of household hardware a representative of the 
production company bought from Wolski. She, like others in the movie business 
who insist on authentic set design, knew of his collection and contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski is one of 35 Californians in the 250-member doorknob collectors 
association; it is the largest contingent in the group, according to Ray and 
Loretta Nemec, Illinois collectors who edit the association's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors are attracted by the beauty of antique doorknobs, Nemec said. In 
the early decades of this century, the heyday of these unique decorative 
pieces, European artists were imported to create the bewildering array of 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors specialize in knobs from fire and police departments, hotels or 
telephone companies. Knobs from public schools and state and federal buildings 
are also popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Other collectors specialize in geographic areas. One man, for instance, has 
knobs only from Des Moines, Iowa, and another only wants ones from Chicago 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter their preference, one thing is certain. These collectors will never 
take the lowly doorknob for granted. "After all," Nemec said, "what would we do 
without them?" Learn More About Antique Doorknobs

Nemec and the Antique Doorknob Collectors of America by writing Box 126, Eola, 
Ill., 60519-0126; (708) 357-2381.

 A May 15 article on estate planning reported that the federal estate tax rate 
ranges from 37% to 55% and that there is no California estate tax. Under a form 
of revenue-sharing known as the Credit for State Death Taxes, California shares 
in a portion of the federal estate tax paid by an estate. Although the state 
calls this the California Estate Tax, it is not an additional tax and does not 
increase the total taxes paid by an estate.

STANLEY CUP FINALLY IN RANGERS' REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Smith pointed out a man standing at the entrance to the corridor leading 
to the Rangers' locker room. More specifically, he noted the name on the 
uniformed guard's chest. It was Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we're going," he said. Actually, the Rangers are staying put. 
It's the Stanley Cup that's on the move. Starting Monday, the most celebrated 
trophy in North American sports will be on display in the lobby of the New York 
Hilton, headquarters for the NHL's championship series beginning Tuesday night 
in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 15 years, New York City will be playing host to the 
playoff finals. And, while the Cup will be shipped to Vancouver for Games 3 and 
4 starting next weekend, there is an excellent chance the Rangers soon will be 
parading the silver vessel up Broadway. It may be the best chance the old 
franchise has had since 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the fact that the Blueshirts compiled the best record in the 
league during the regular season or that they will enjoy home-ice advantage 
over the Canucks in the best-of-seven series. More significantly, the manner in 
which they overcame the relentless New Jersey Devils in their Eastern 
Conference showdown suggested that nothing so ephemeral as a jinx or a curse 
was to stop the Ranges from their objective. They were too tough, too talented, 
too driven to stop now. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to be all of the above to oust the Devils in a classic series that 
ended in the final hour of Friday night. But not before exhausting participants 
and spectators alike. The Rangers, who appeared to have secured a 1-0 victory 
in regulation, needed a second overtime to subdue an opponent that pushed them 
to the limit, and 24 minutes and 24 seconds beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 On such occasions, it is not uncommon for the winners to graciously state that 
neither team deserved to lose. Smith, the general manager who assembled the 
best hockey team money can buy, did better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shouldn't be a winner," he said early Saturday moring, reflecting on 
one of the most competitive, compelling playoff series in any sport that New 
York witnessed. "It should be a team made up of half Rangers and half Devils. 
But I'm glad it's us." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect the NHL to be terribly unhappy either. Not only does New York 
provide a grander setting for the Cup than a swamp in an adjoining state but 
the Rangers boast some of the brightest stars in the sport. An, in the 
semifinal analysis, they were the difference between nerve-wracking triumph and 
a potentially devastating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 After captain Mark Messier rallied the team from 2-0 deficit in the final 22 
minutes of Game 6 with one of the great clutch performances in NHL history, 
Brian Leetch scored a spectacular goal midway through the second period on 
Friday night and Mike Richter preserved the slim margin for the next 30 
minutes. But with 18,200 fans on their feet and counting down the final 
seconds, the Devils' Valeri Zelepukin jabbed the puck under Richter's left pad 
from directly in front of the crease. The ensuing suspense was almost too much 
to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about not watching (overtime)," said Smith, whose observation post 
is high above the Garden ice. "I was really convinced the way the team was 
playing that we would win. But you just live with fear. You keep saying, 'They 
won't do it to us again.' Then you think, 'Cripes, it's like the first game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The tone for the series was set in Game 1 when the Devils' Claude Lemieux 
scored with less than a minute left in regulation to tie the score at 3, making 
possible Stephane Richer's winning goal in the second overtime. It put the 
Rangers on notice that the team they defeated in all six meetings during the 
regular season would be no pushover. And it provided the opening act in one of 
the most fascinating and emotionally wrenching sports dramas in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the nature of the beginning, only a truly theatrical finish would 
be suitable. "If you could decide what was the best thing that could happen," 
Richter acknowledged later, "you'd say seventh game, double overtime, we win. I 
was thinking last night it would be great to win, 9-0. But then I realized it 
would be better to go into overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Better for hockey perhaps. Better for the television audience. But certainly 
not better for print journalists on deadline or for the blood pressure of the 
partisans in he arena.

SCALING NEW HEIGHTS; STOCK OPTIONS BOOST INCOME OF O.C. OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When economic pundits said early last year that 1993 would be a rebuilding 
year for recession-battered Orange County, the people who make executive 
compensation decisions apparently were listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the overall economy barely held its own with no job growth, many 
corporate officers at Orange County's publicly traded companies saw their pay 
packages grow to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The yeast in their dough wasn't always cash, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the corporate directors who determine compensation increasingly 
linked pay with business performance and awarded their key executives large 
blocks of stock options that have value only if the companies' profits and 
revenue -- and stock price -- continue growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At AST, we reward people in a variety of ways. Base salary is a key element, 
of course, as are bonuses tied to the company's performance. But we also 
believe strongly in stock options tied to the company's ability to deliver 
value to the shareholders," said James T. Schraith, senior vice president for 
sales at AST Research in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm constantly looking at decisions I make with an eye toward enhancing 
shareholder value because I am a shareholder," said Schraith -- who received 
AST options worth an estimated $235,875 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Orange County Edition review of the 1993 compensation of top officers 
at 95 public companies headquartered in the county shows that annual and 
long-term compensation made 36 of the 100 highest-paid executives millionaires 
last year; 13 of them had multimillion-dollar pay packages. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, only 26 of the Top 100 had total compensation of $1 million or 
more and only five of those had packages exceeding $2 million. But among last 
year's millionaire executives, only five reached seven figures from their cash 
compensation -- annual salaries and bonuses -- compared with eight people in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest, like Clothestime Chairman John Ortega II, are millionaires on paper. 
Ortega received options valued at $2.2 million as part of his compensation last 
year, but he must wait several years to cash them all in. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluded from the Orange County 100 are such highly visible executives as 
Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren, who is a billionaire, and wealthy developer 
William Lyon. Their companies are private, and they are not required to 
disclose their compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the public companies, the growing reliance on stock instead of cash to 
reward executives is part of a nationwide shift to performance-based 
compensation, said Elliot Gordon, managing vice president at the Newport Beach 
office of corporate consultants Korn/Ferry International. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most option packages can't be exercised for three to five years, they 
become the ideal corporate carrot dangled before executives. If the company's 
stock doesn't do well in ensuing years, the value of the options on the open 
market dwindles and what was once worth $1 million or more becomes something 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the opposite also can be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie G. McCraw, chairman of Fluor Corp., counted $736,997 worth of options 
in his $2.9 million total compensation. But Fluor and its stock have done well 
in recent years and McCraw cashed in numerous options he had received in 
earlier years. That netted him an additional $2.75 million, for combined 
take-home pay of $5.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Options granted in previous years can especially make a big difference in 
take-home pay when things aren't going well -- as long as they're used in a 
timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan Panic, chairman of ICN Pharmaceuticals and its several subsidiaries, is 
near the end of the Top 100 list this year with a pay package of just $634,862, 
which is 91% less than he received the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 His Costa Mesa-based company lost $11 million in 1993 and Panic received no 
raise, no bonus and just $60,600 worth of options. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the company's stock price started falling, Panic cashed in a batch 
of options that he had been awarded over the previous 10 years -- options that 
let him buy stock as prices far below the 1993 market values of the shares he 
acquired in ICN, SPI Pharmaceuticals, Viratek and ICN Biomedicals. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Panic made a $9.5-million profit when he sold the shares and his 
total take-home pay last year swelled to $10.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those who monitor executives' pay consider it unfair to suggest that 
Panic, McCraw or anyone else who cashed in options got paid that much in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In adding up executive pay, The Times counts 1993 salary and bonus; the value 
of other annual compensation, including life insurance premiums and automobile 
allowances; long-term compensation paid during the year including the stated 
value of stock options granted in 1993, and the value of restricted stock 
awards made during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits from stock options awarded in prior years but exercised by executives 
during 1993 are not included in their annual compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercising long-held options is like making withdrawals from a savings account 
-- it represents compensation deposited in earlier years and already was 
counted as part of the pay received for those years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Orange County's business community is made up largely of 
entrepreneurial companies and those once privately held, there are a numerous 
methods of compensation that rarely show up in the financial reports of Fortune 
500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim was living in Kentucky 
when he was recruited to head the hamburger chain at the end of 1992. Houses in 
Orange County cost a lot more than in Louisville, however, so Donald E. Doyle 
was promised some help. 
</P>
<P>
 The company disclosed in its report to shareholders earlier this year that the 
assistance comes in the form of a $4,375 monthly housing differential payment. 
Doyle gets the stipend, which totals $52,500 a year, through December, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Help with housing appears in several other executive pay packages around 
Orange County, which is one of the nation's most expensive residential real 
estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Emulex Corp., for example, paid President Paul F. Folino $88,000 to help 
relocate his household from Texas when he was hired last year. And in 1992, 
Abbey Healthcare Group loaned Chairman Timothy M. Aitken $1.25 million to buy a 
new house. The company also promised to forgive up to 25% of the accrued 
principal and interest each year for four years, and to pay the state and 
federal taxes on the loan forgiveness, if Aitken helped Abbey meet certain 
performance goals. In 1993, Aitken received a $1.1-million bonus from Abbey 
that included forgiveness of $675,000 of the loan's principal and interest.

 Deals like this, which may seem a bit too lucrative to some shareholders, are 
good business, said Matt Ward, a executive compensation consultant for Wyatt 
Co., a San Francisco-based benefit consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are starting to put the oomph in their pay packages just where 
shareholders want it: in performance-related items that give the executives 
incentive to make it all work," he said. "That's the great news that's starting 
to trickle back after several years of controversy" about accelerating 
executive pay that often had little to do with how well or poorly a company was 
doing.

<P>
 Salaries, bonuses and options are not the only way executives are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacific Sunwear, an Anaheim surf wear retailer that went public last year, 
President and Chief Executive Michael W. Rayden gets an $800-a-month car lease 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 AST Research co-founder Safi U. Qureshey received total compensation of $2 
million last year that included almost $180,000 paid in premiums on a 
$24-million life insurance policy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey's employment contract also calls for him to receive his base pay for 
five years after he quits or retires or if he is ousted without cause. That's a 
gilded parachute worth $2.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year term of Qureshey's termination package is longer than most, 
which range from one to three years, but the practice of compensating top 
officers long after they fade away is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 When Downey Savings & Loan Assn. co-founder Maurice L. McAlister retired in 
June, it triggered a clause in his employment contract that ensures his 
financial security: McAlister or his heirs get $32,167 a month for 10 years, 
with cost of living raises every three years. The guaranteed $3.8 million is in 
addition to the value of McAlister's stock in the company -- he owns 3.2 
million shares, worth almost $60 million at current prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the retirement plan is modified when a founder wants to stay active. 
</P>
<P>
 At FHP International Corp., the Fountain Valley-based health maintenance 
organization, founder Robert Gumbiner retired in 1990, so he doesn't show up in 
the executive pay reports. But the 70-year-old physician continues to serve as 
chairman of the board and has a consulting contract that lasts until June 30, 
1995. Under that pact, Gumbiner drew $536,565 in consulting fees during FHP's 
fiscal 1993 -- just $10,000 less than the combined salary and bonus of chief 
executive Westcott W. Price III, who had total take-home pay of nearly $1.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. chain, fought a bitter and 
well-publicized battle to keep his job with the company last year after a split 
with Doyle and the board led to his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reinstating the 77-year-old Karcher calls for him to receive 
$400,000 a year as chairman emeritus until January, 1999, and then to receive 
$200,000 a year for life as retirement pay. Like Gumbiner, Karcher doesn't show 
up in the executive compensation charts because he is not considered an active, 
decision-making officer of the company. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Such deals with former top executives are valid and valuable, says Fred E. 
Whittlesey, a principal of Compensation Performance Management Inc. in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that the corporation will help take care of their finances at the end 
of their careers provides necessary incentive for executives to stay involved 
with company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when you are considering compensation you have to look at all the roles 
some of these people play. Many are employees and directors and shareholders, 
and each hat they wear has a value," Whittlesey said. "One thing shouldn't 
cancel out the other. You can't underpay an executive just because he also got 
rich as a shareholder. That's not what this country is all about." Largest 
Changes in Pay 
</P>
<P>
 Bonuses and raises--the cash that executives get in their pay 
packages--usually are based on predetermined goals and can swing wildly from 
year to year. The changes in 1993 ranged from a near-tripling of one officer's 
bonus to elimination of several others'. The top 10 increases and declines, by 
percentage change from 1992:

 RON UNZ 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Sept. 20, 1961, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Palo Alto 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Full-time candidate for governor, on leave from managing 
his small software company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degrees in physics and history, Harvard University. 
Phi Beta Kappa. Recipient of a Churchill Science Fellowship to Cambridge 
University in England, where he studied quantum gravitation under Stephen 
Hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: In the late 1980s, Unz took a leave of absence from 
Stanford University, where he was enrolled in a Ph.D. program in theoretical 
physics. He worked as an associate at a New York City mortgage finance company. 
In 1988, he founded Wall Street Analytics Inc., a financial services software 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Unmarried The Record  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Unz has no public record and brings an unusual, if not unique, background 
to his quest for California's top public office. He has a strong record of 
academic and intellectual achievement. His IQ has been estimated at 214 -- what 
one expert calls "one in a million" -- and as a teen-ager he won first place in 
the national Westinghouse talent search competition for a paper on black holes. 
He is a physicist as well as an expert on the Spartan naval empire. 
</P>
<P>
 After working for a New York City mortgage finance company, Unz founded his 
own small firm that sells specialized computer programs to Wall Street firms. 
The firm has become highly successful during the last six years and has made 
Unz a wealthy man. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has no political experience, he says he has long had an interest 
in politics and has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
conservative think tanks and causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz says his years in the business world have prepared him well to govern 
California. "In terms of the sectors of the American economy that create 
wealth, I have more experience than the other four candidates together, times a 
factor of a few," he said. The Speech: In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the Republican Party stands for clear principles and firm ideas 
-- smaller government, lower taxes, fewer regulations and traditional values -- 
and that Pete Wilson stands for nothing except his political ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, Pete Wilson and the Democrats have enacted the 
largest state tax increase in American history, deepening our recession and 
destroying jobs. Pete Wilson and the Democrats have led our Golden State to the 
brink of ruin. A choice between Pete Wilson and the Democrats means no choice 
at all for the people of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, I have not abandoned the mainstream of the Republican 
Party . . . and its basic principles. . . . Under Ronald Reagan, these were the 
ideas which swept the nation and the world. I am the Republican candidate for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, my affiliation with the Republican Party is not 
hereditary: I come from a family of Democrats. But when that former Democrat 
Ronald Reagan transformed the Republican Party into the party of the ordinary 
working people of America, it became my party. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, I didn't attend an elite prep school, but received my 
education in the public schools of Los Angeles, back when they still provided 
an outstanding education for all of our children, rich and poor alike. It was 
this education which provided me with the tools of opportunity I needed to 
achieve economic success. But today, I am disgusted by the decay of our school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, I don't believe we should raise taxes again and again, 
until our entrepreneurs and small businesses are faced with some of the highest 
tax rates in America, driving our jobs and prosperity to other states. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, who has been on government and political payrolls for 
almost 30 years as a lifelong career politician, I come from the private 
business sector, the part of our economy which actually creates the wealth, 
provides the jobs and pays the taxes. I understand the value of money and the 
long hours required to earn it. I reject the waste that is routinely accepted 
by the special interest politicians who don't understand what it's like to earn 
a living in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Pete Wilson, who has little or no comprehension of the industries of 
tomorrow, I come from a scientific and technological background. I know that 
California's future prosperity cannot be based merely upon jobs to build and 
maintain Pete Wilson's endless array of future prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that the high-technology industries of tomorrow such as computers, 
telecommunications, biotechnology and the entertainment industry can be the 
foundation of California's prosperity. I see that the widespread adoption of 
telecommuting could make our freeway traffic jams a thing of the past. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My grandparents came to California in the 1920s and 1930s as poor European 
immigrants, willing to work hard to provide a better life for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a native-born Californian who remembers the hope and optimism and endless 
sense of possibility which the California Dream once meant to us. Our state has 
the finest climate, enormous natural beauty, and tremendous scientific and 
technological resources unequaled any place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary obstacle on our road to recovery is the deep failure of our own 
overgrown state government. Join with me in overcoming this one obstacle, and 
together we can restore the Golden State which we all remember.

 PETE WILSON 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Aug. 23, 1933, Lake Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Governor 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree with major in English literature, Yale 
University, 1955; law degree, University of California, Boalt Hall, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: State Assembly, 1966-71; mayor of San Diego, 1971-1982; 
U.S. senator, 1983-1991; governor since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to the former Gayle Graham; sons Todd and Philip Graham. The 
Record 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two decades in public office, Pete Wilson became governor in 
1991 and was immediately confronted with a budget crisis that was to mushroom 
into a $14.3-billion gap between the state's anticipated revenue and spending. 
Working closely with Democrats in the Legislature, Wilson tried to close the 
gap with a combination of tax increases, budget cuts and one-time accounting 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But within months after his first budget was enacted, it was clear that the 
recession that gripped the state's economy was not about to fade, and revenues 
plummeted again. The ongoing fiscal crisis has colored much of Wilson's first 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the worst economic downturn since the Depression, Wilson has 
weathered the Los Angeles riots, devastating urban wildfires in the Bay Area 
and Southern California, and earthquakes on the North Coast and in Los Angeles. 
He has declared states of emergency in 47 of California's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson came into office preaching the benefits of prevention over remedial 
programs but has, by his own admission, only planted the seeds of the programs 
he believes are needed to steer California's next generation away from drugs, 
gangs and crime and into productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Wilson has reached several bipartisan deals with the 
Legislature meant to improve the state's business climate and overhaul welfare. 
The Speech: In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 We must begin to take back our streets from violent crime . . . reclaim our 
schools from drugs and gangs . . . begin to create new jobs again. 
</P>
<P>
 God knows we've endured more than any people should have to. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been shaken by earthquakes, scorched by wildfires, battered by recession 
and devastated by Washington's defense cuts. But the California spirit has 
never been broken. 
</P>
<P>
 California has the people, we have the power, to make our own destiny. That's 
what we must do today. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And we've already begun. When I took office four years ago, our state budget 
was a runaway train headed for a wreck. We turned it around. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't just slowed the growth of government, we actually cut the size of 
government, nearly $3 billion in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 We've slashed bureaucracy by cutting 111 state boards and commissions and 
reducing the number of state employees as a percentage of the population to the 
lowest level since Ronald Reagan was governor. We've reformed welfare so that 
it finally pays to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're again leading the nation in taking back our streets from violent 
crime. . . . We're making a California that's safe for jobs and safe for 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 When I took office, California had a business climate that was chasing jobs 
across our border. Years of accumulated rules, regulations and red tape had 
created a job-killing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 So we cut taxes, reformed workers' comp and slashed red tape. And we got 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employers like Intel, Pac Bell, and the Danish toy company Lego have 
responded by announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments that 
are creating thousands of new jobs for California. 
</P>
<P>
 We've turned California from a job-killer into a job-creator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Californians still have many other challenges. Even though we've turned the 
corner in reviving California's economy, we have a long way to go in making it 
healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians still face tough times. And to get through these tough times, we 
need more than 10-point plans and catchy slogans. What California needs today 
is strong and unflinching leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about leadership by example and by experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned from a grandfather I never knew, because he gave his life as a cop 
on the streets of Chicago. I learned it from a mother and a father who did the 
quiet work of raising a family and paying the bills. I learned it serving in 
the United States Marine Corps and walking the streets of quake-shaken L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor of California must be many things -- a crisis manager when the 
earth shakes or the forest burns, a booster for California jobs across the 
country and around the world, a person of conviction who can stand up for 
what's right no matter what the consequences or who's opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, above all, the governor of California must be a leader who can 
bring California through tough times. . . . California needs a governor who can 
fight crime by making the tough call to invoke the death penalty -- and do it 
in good conscience because he believes it to be right. 
</P>
<P>
 California needs a governor who can tell Washington that guaranteeing health 
care, education and welfare for the families of illegal immigrants isn't just 
wrong. It's making the problem worse. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I ask for your support in this campaign to complete the job we started, this 
campaign to make California shine again.

SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW; DECISION '94 / A VOTER'S GUIDE TO STATE AND 
LOCAL ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; ABOUT THIS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been one of the glory jobs of American politics, a post that decorated 
the resumes of a president, a Supreme Court justice and assorted other seminal 
figures in the nation's political history. This year, there are active 
campaigns by both Democrats and Republicans seeking their party nominations to 
become California's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Pete Wilson, the incumbent, has overseen a state buffeted by 
disasters of epic scope, from earthquakes and wildfires to unemployment and 
economic malaise. Wilson, running what he says will be his last campaign, is 
fending off the assaults of a 32-year-old computer millionaire and political 
neophyte, Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi have campaigned for more than a year, Brown running 
as the telegenic heir to her family's political dynasty and Garamendi as a 
jeans-clad everyman who can get California working again. A late entrant into 
the race was state Sen. Tom Hayden, who has called for wholesale reforms in the 
system by which California elects its politicians.

 TOM HAYDEN 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Dec. 11, 1939, Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: State Senator representing the 23rd District, which 
includes Santa Monica, Malibu, Pacific Palisades and parts of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree in history, University of Michigan, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Founder of anti-war organization Students for a 
Democratic Society in the 1960s; founder of Campaign for Economic Democracy, a 
political action group; author of seven books; elected to the California 
Assembly in 1982 and to the state Senate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to actress Barbara Williams; children Troy and Vanessa from 
previous marriage. The Record  
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden is one of the best known of California's lawmakers. But 
his fame has less to do with his legislative accomplishments than his 
activities as an anti-Vietnam War protester and his former marriage to 
actress-activist Jane Fonda. During 10 years in the seniority-dominated 
Assembly, most of Hayden's efforts were thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
 His major contribution to California law may have been his support of 1986's 
Proposition 65, the anti-toxics initiative that did an end run around the 
Legislature. An indication of his standing in the Assembly came during the 1992 
redistricting, in which the leadership did away with his district. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his two years in the smaller and more freewheeling Senate, Hayden has 
found his voice. As his campaign literature points out, Hayden recently led the 
first successful effort in 111 years to block confirmation of a University of 
California regent, in a battle that centered on Hayden's opposition to student 
fee increases. Similar efforts have denied the Wilson Administration its 
nominations to the Board of Prison Terms and the Lottery Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Hayden has concentrated his legislative efforts on curtailing college 
student fee increases and emphasizing the state's previous reluctance to spend 
billions of dollars in freeway funds on seismic safety. He also has sought to 
reform the state's political process, an issue that now forms the backbone of 
his campaign for governor. The Speech: In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 Our human hopes and possibilities are being smothered by a special-interest 
state that has befallen Sacramento. Every night, lobbyists for special 
interests are making big contributions to politicians, and on the morning 
after, they ask those same politicians for a vote. Last year, the lobbyists 
spent $128 million lobbying those politicians, and you paid for it because 
lobbying expenses are tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 These lobbyists not only enrich their clients, they impoverish and downsize 
our schools, our health care, our future and our hope. They strangle us with 
the heavy hand of the past when we should be listening and tending to the needs 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 California cannot restore its strength when we are 41st in the nation in 
school funding. I want our school rooms to be "exploratoriums," on-ramps to the 
information highway of the future. I propose we increase school funding over 
the next five years until we reach the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should we be closing the doors of higher education, as the soaring fees of 
Pete Wilson have done to 200,000 students in just two years. I will reduce 
college fees by 20%, and make up the cost by closing wasteful tax loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 I will create a committed and idealistic California Service Corps, sending 
thousands of college students into a teacher corps and a police corps, to 
reduce our school dropout rates and increase community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for these educational initiatives, we have to change our priorities. I 
will insist on a $1-billion cut in bloated state bureaucracy and a $3-billion 
closure of totally wasteful tax loopholes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We are under-funding education to pay for a "three strikes" law and a prison 
building program that are fiscally reckless. We must amend "three strikes" to 
focus on violent repeat offenders, not check forgers or people who are caught 
growing three marijuana plants. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Too many middle-class people, including our younger people, are trapped in 
McJobs, permanent part-time jobs that lack meaning and go nowhere. I propose 
jobs with a future, jobs that require more education instead of less, jobs of 
restoring the environment instead of degrading what's left of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hayden renewal program will begin by creating 55,000 jobs in southern 
California making clean, zero-emission cars in the coming decade. . . . 
California can lead the world in designing and exporting energy conservation 
technology. . . . We must lead in renewable resources like solar and wind 
energy. . . . We must lead in telecommunications, and reduce our addiction to 
polluting by commuting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But we cannot realize this brighter future without a governor with the 
independence and vision to stand up to the special interests . . . that 
dominate Sacramento like undertakers in the delivery room. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reform governor with a mandate from the people, I will insist on Day 1 
that the Legislature enact these reforms: No. 1, campaign contribution limits 
of no more than $250; expenditure limits to contain the campaign arms race; a 
prohibition on lobbyists soliciting money for politicians they lobby, and 
stiffer penalties for political corruption than the slap-on-the-wrist attitude 
of today. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is a campaign that is also a cause. This is about the politics of hope 
triumphing over a future of fear. Don't waste your vote on the status quo. Vote 
at least to send a message -- and together we may make a miracle.POLITICAL C

 JOHN GARAMENDI 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Jan. 24, 1945, Camp Blanding, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Walnut Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: State insurance commissioner 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, business, UC Berkeley, 1966; master's in 
business administration, Harvard University, 1970 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Assemblyman, 1975-77; state senator, 1977-91; insurance 
commissioner, 1991-present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Patricia Wilkinson Garamendi, associate director of the 
Peace Corps; children Genet, John Jr., Christina, Autumn, Elizabeth and Ashley. 
The Record  
</P>
<P>
 John Garamendi sponsored a variety of successful measures during his 16 years 
in the Assembly and Senate, but most often mentions tax reform bills in 1987 
and 1988 to provide tax incentives for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the thousands of votes he cast, he acknowledges some mistakes, such as 
voting for inmate rights in the 1970s. Garamendi now says he would repeal such 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As insurance commissioner, he has won about $900 million in auto insurance 
rebates out of a potential $2.5 billion as part of his effort to enforce 
provisions of Proposition 103, which also made the office of insurance 
commissioner elective. He won extra settlements for victims of the 1991 Oakland 
fires, froze auto insurance rates, and worked against insurance redlining. 
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with insurance companies has been contentious and hostile and 
some critics say he could have accomplished more with a less confrontational 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been openly criticized for the takeover and disposition of failed 
Executive Life Insurance Co., but Garamendi says his actions protected the best 
interests for the investors and policyholders, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 An acknowledged expert on health care reform, Garamendi developed some of the 
ideas that served as the basis for the Clinton Administration plan. The Speech: 
In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 As many of you know, when I decided to run for governor, I was determined to 
run a different kind of campaign, a campaign that takes risks, calls it like it 
is and challenges business as usual, a campaign based on the premise that 
actions do indeed speak louder than words. And most of all, a campaign where I 
work side by side with and listen to the people in every corner of this state. 
</P>
<P>
 I've learned that one of the most important factors in maintaining the 
strength of California families is economic security. The Garamendi 
Administration will commit itself to preserving and supporting California's 
families. That means that for starters, we must do two things. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must provide universal access to health care for every Californian. 
No Californian should suffer pain or leave a disease untreated for a lack of 
money. That is simply unconscionable in this society. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, every Californian deserves the chance to hold a job. Every Californian 
deserves the chance to support himself, or herself, his or her family, by 
earning a decent living. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in Marysville in another one of my 84 jobs, this one with some hospice 
care providers, (when) we went into a small mobile home on the outskirts of 
Marysville, and there . . . lay a man who was about 57 years old, dying of lung 
cancer. Behind his bed he had a handwritten sign that said "No CPR." We talked 
to his wife and the conversation turned to health care. And she said that she 
had signed up for the Medicare program for those who were fully disabled and 
dying. She then turned to her husband halfway through that conversation and 
said to him, "Jim, you can't die. You can't die. Thirty-one more days and 
they'll pay our medical bills." 
</P>
<P>
 What have we come to in this great state and this leading nation when a man . 
. . writes behind his bed "No CPR," and (his) wife begs for 31 more days so 
that she does not lose everything? What have we come to? People dying of cancer 
shouldn't have to worry about staying alive just to get their bills paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we're going to change what is going on in California and in America. We 
will have in this state and in this nation a universal health care system so 
that no want-to-be governor ever has to hear what I heard that wife say. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on our resources that create both short- and long-term economic 
growth, we can inject our economy with the shot in the arm it so desperately 
needs. With the savings from 24-hour health care reform alone, we can have as 
much as $5.5 billion available to stimulate the California economy and to 
assure that over the long term we will stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ethiopia (in the Peace Corps), Patti and I learned that it's one thing to 
dream about the future and quite another to make the future happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I am working as hard as I can to make a better future happen for my children, 
for California's children. For my family, for California's families. For my 
community, for California's communities. To rebuild the bridge of faith between 
each of us and our government. 
</P>
<P>
 Join me in making California work again. The new California is ours for the 
making.

 KATHLEEN BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Sept. 25, 1945, San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: State treasurer 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, Stanford University, 1969; law doctorate, 
Fordham University, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Member, Los Angeles Board of Education, 1975-1980; 
attorney, 1985-87; member, Los Angeles Board of Public Works, 1987-1989; state 
treasurer, 1991-present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to television executive Van Gordon Sauter; children Hilary 
Armstrong, Sascha Rice, Zeb Rice, Mark Sauter, Jeremy Sauter. The Record  
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown is running on the theme of "America's Best Treasurer," which 
she bases on her record since taking office in 1991. Since then, she says, she 
has transformed the office from "a sleepy bureaucratic backwater" into a leader 
in financial management and prudent investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown cites record bond sales and earnings, but those claims have been 
contested by critics. In some cases, it is difficult to make comparisons 
because of lower national interest rates during her tenure and the large number 
of bond issues approved by voters in recent elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also says she has used state funds to leverage investments in home 
mortgages and small businesses; streamlined the way the state borrows funds to 
tide it over deficit periods and save on interest payments; allocated business 
to include firms headed by minorities, women and disabled veterans, and 
generally encouraged investment of state funds, where possible, in California 
enterprises. During her 1990 campaign for treasurer, she accused her 
predecessor of allowing the buildup of a massive amount of unsold bonds, but 
the backlog remains almost as large. The Speech: In Her Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight I want to tell you a story. It's the story of California. It's the 
story of opportunity. It's the story of a state that has lured generation after 
generation after generation with its extraordinary riches. It is, in short, a 
story about opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the story of California and it is the story of jobs -- jobs that lured 
my great-grandfather August Schuckman to the hills of Colusa County and jobs 
that lured my other great-grandfather, Joseph Brown, to the city of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs that kept my grandparents in San Francisco after an 8.3 earthquake that 
nearly destroyed that city and kept them there in spite of setbacks and 
disappointments. Jobs that created generation after generation of new 
opportunity. . . . And they were good jobs, decent-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm here to tell you that that's what California needs some more of, 
because jobs have meant the promise for California. They provided the 
opportunity for us to have good schools, to have and keep safe neighborhoods, 
and it was those jobs that kept our people coming from Michigan and Mexico and 
from Pennsylvania and the Philippines. . . . And they had a dream of a better 
future -- not simply for themselves but a dream of a better future for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 As your governor, I will make it my mission to create that environment where 1 
million new jobs can be created. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state treasurer, I have been a builder, selling over $10 billion of 
voter-approved bonds to build schools and transportation systems, hospitals and 
water systems. I have done it at the lowest interest rate in decades. And as 
your state treasurer, I have earned you $4 billion because I am an investor on 
your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 And I have been an innovator, bringing new programs to the treasurer's office 
that have helped small businesses and home buyers, and helping our businesses 
to clean up the environment. And I have been a fighter, fighting for you on 
those pension boards against excessive executive pay and against corporate 
irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to be the same kind of governor: a fighter, a builder, an innovator, an 
investor, because that's what it's going to take to create those 1 million new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown as governor will offer a new-jobs tax credit to make our state 
competitive. On Day 1, I will call for California First preferences so that 
when we spend our tax dollars on those public works projects, we will see that 
California workers get a chance to be on those jobs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On my first day as governor, I will call for a $1-billion Rebuild California 
Fund to help cities and counties rebuild their infrastructure so that they can 
be the engine of economic growth that we so desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 A Golden State Growth Fund to provide capital and loans to small businesses is 
the final element in just the beginning of an economic plan to create those 1 
million new jobs. Because without jobs, we cannot have the dream. Without jobs, 
we cannot have the promise of safe neighborhoods. And without jobs, we will 
never realize the promise again of the best schools in our country. 
</P>
<P>
 People ask me, why do I want to be governor? Because I want California to 
stand for something again. I want it to stand for progress. I want it to stand 
for prosperity. I want it to stand for enduring values. I want California to 
stand for, at minimum, 1 million new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 So I ask you to join me. If you believe in 1 million new jobs, join with me. 
Because together in this campaign for governor, and beyond, we are going to 
make history. 
</P>
<P>
 We're going to put Californians back to work. We're going to bring back the 
California promise. We are going to reinvent the California dream.

 Duties include the largely ceremonial task of presiding over the state Senate, 
replacing the governor in the chief executive's absence, chairing an economic 
development commission, and service on a variety of boards and commissions,

</P>
<P>
 There is a tight race between the two Republican nominees, state Sen. Cathie 
Wright of Simi Valley and Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Gray Davis, the state controller, does not face a serious challenge. 
ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 All three say they would boost the profile of the state's No. 2 job. Statham 
is known for his proposal to split up California. He favors abortion rights, 
while Wright is strongly anti-abortion. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP primary could be a replay of 1990, when state Sen. Marian Bergeson of 
Newport Beach, strongly anti-abortion, defeated Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim, 
who supported abortion rights. In the general election, Bergeson lost to 
Democrat Leo T. McCarthy, who is retiring. In recent years, the job has not 
been a springboard to higher office. PROFILES

 The officeholder is the state's banker and pays out whatever state funds the 
controller authorizes. The office administers and clears an average of 400,000 
state checks each day. Taxpayers rely on the treasurer to protect and nurture 
the state's $26-billion investment portfolio. In addition, the treasurer 
administers the sale of state bonds and services outstanding bonds. The 
treasurer is also a member of dozens of state financing boards, committees and 
commissions, and as a result has a voice on a wide range of topics. The salary 
is $90,000 a year. MAJOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 A fight between two Democrats: state Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys and 
Phil Angelides, former head of the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Fong is running unopposed for the Republican nomination. ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is who will best manage the state's investments and bonds, but 
Angelides and Roberti have picked out some side issues to try to distinguish 
themselves. Angelides says his main focus is on investing and creating jobs, 
but he also highlights his views on abortion rights. Roberti, who opposes 
abortion rights, reminds voters that he fought off a recall by groups that were 
angry over his assault weapon control bill. He casts himself in the role of a 
tough crime fighter and says he would bring decades of government experience to 
the job. Fong says that as treasurer he would oppose new taxes and blow the 
whistle on wasteful government spending. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 Before the incumbent, Kathleen Brown, brought her celebrity surname to the 
office, the late political powerhouse Jesse M. Unruh held a lock on the seat 
through four election victories. PROFILES

 PHIL ANGELIDES 
</P>
<P>
 * Age: 40.

 * Residence: Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Chairman of the state Democratic Party for two years, 
until April, 1993. He was credited with helping candidates get elected through 
his efforts at fund raising, recruiting volunteers and registering 1.2 million 
new Democrats. Angelides took the party's helm after gaining attention for 
building a large-scale planned community in suburban Sacramento. The housing 
development was part of a wave of new communities designed to get neighbors 
mingling again, with a town center, front porches, bicycle paths and access to 
mass transit. Before that, Angelides worked in state government for eight 
years, first for the state Department for Housing and Community Development and 
later as chief of staff for the Assembly majority leader. This is his first 
campaign for public office.

 * Career highlights: A senator representing the San Fernando Valley, Roberti 
headed the Legislature's upper chamber for 13 years as Senate president pro tem 
before voter-approved term limits forced him to hand off the post earlier this 
year. Roberti has served 28 years in the Legislature, first as an assemblyman. 
He became known as a consensus-builder on contentious issues such as the state 
budget. Roberti authored legislation in 1989 to stem the sale and distribution 
of military-style assault weapons in the wake of a Stockton schoolyard 
shooting. Firearms rights advocates led a recall effort against him, but 
Roberti held on to his seat after a costly local campaign. Before winning an 
Assembly seat in 1966, Roberti was a deputy state attorney general.

 Voters in the June 7 primary will find an incumbent in only one of the seven 
races for statewide offices below the rank of governor. The rest are open-seat 
contests in a particularly competitive year for statewide office, with 
wide-open campaign free-for-alls. Also listed on these Statewide Offices pages: 
an incumbent facing a serious challenge to his regional seat on the five-member 
Board of Equalization.

 The holder of this $90,000-a-year job is responsible for coordinating 
elections and voter registration, preparing the statewide voters pamphlet, 
collecting campaign finance reports and keeping myriad corporate and business 
registration records. MAJOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 The contested race is among the Democrats: Acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller of Pleasant Grove, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles and former 
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno is unopposed. ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in the wake of a series of political corruption convictions, 
campaign reform is once again emerging as an issue. All of the candidates have 
plans to limit the influence of campaign contributions on elected officials. 
Woo and Moore back partial public financing of campaigns; Miller and Jones do 
not. Miller backs legislation to make the office nonpartisan in future 
elections. And he wants to eliminate the $800 start-up tax on small businesses 
as a way of helping create jobs. Moore has called for simplifying voter 
registration and making it easier for voters to regularly cast their ballots by 
mail. She also proposes computerizing information about candidates and campaign 
contributions, and making this information available at local libraries. Woo is 
pushing for tougher fines for candidates who fail to file timely campaign 
reports. He is calling for partial public financing of campaigns, as well as 
campaign and spnding limits. He also wants lawmakers to stop moonlighting at 
other jobs. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of statehood, the secretary of state was appointed by the 
governor, not elected. This century, Republicans Frank C. Jordan and his son 
Frank M. Jordan occupied the post for more than 50 years -- each dying in 
office after multiple terms. The caretaker nature of the post changed with 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., who used it to push campaign reform -- and to 
launch his successful race for governor. Brown's successor, March Fong Eu, was 
elected five times -- quitting in February to become U.S. ambassador to 
Micronesia. PROFILES

CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Both major parties have picked their candidates for the November general 
election. Republican incumbent Dan Lungren is running unopposed; two-term 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) became the Democratic nominee after 
Arlo Smith, the San Francisco district attorney who lost narrowly to Lungren in 
1990, decided to drop out of the primary. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 From Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. to George Deukmejian, the office has been 
something of a steppingstone to the governor's office, and that's just what 
most Republicans see for Lungren. Only one incumbent has lost in this century 
-- Republican Atty. Gen. Fred Howser lost in the primary in 1950 -- and Umberg 
has an uphill fight.

SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW; DECISION '94 / A VOTER'S GUIDE TO STATE AND 
LOCAL ELECTIONS; STATEWIDE OFFICES; A LOOK AT THE MAJOR CANDIDATES IN CONTESTED 
RACES.; INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most powerful statewide officeholders, the insurance commissioner 
has the authority to grant insurance rate increases, investigate fraud and 
respond to consumer complaints. The commissioner can seize insurance companies 
deemed to be insolvent and manage them to protect policyholders. Salary: 
$95,052. MAJOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans: James Conran, director of the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs; Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush, and Wes Bannister, an insurance 
agency owner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats: Assemblyman Burt Margolin and Sen. Art Torres. ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and Margolin are liberals with similar voting records. Margolin vows to 
take a strong pro-consumer approach toward rate hike requests and other 
matters. Torres also vows to be pro-consumer, but says he would tone down the 
rancor between the commissioner's office and the industry. Margolin takes a 
particular interest in health insurance reform and is against no-fault auto 
insurance, saying accident victims should have the right to sue in cases of 
negligence. Torres was in favor of no-fault insurance but has modified that 
stand, saying consumers should have a choice between buying no-fault insurance, 
which would cost less, or policies that would allow them to sue. Both Democrats 
supported Proposition 103, the 1988 industry-opposed ballot measure that set up 
the current regulatory scheme. Both pledge to take no campaign donations from 
the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Republicans opposed Proposition 103. Conran describes himself as 
pro-consumer, but also has pledged to have a positive relationship with the 
industry. Conran supports no-fault auto insurance and takes donations from 
insurance companies and independent insurance agents. Quackenbush, a moderate, 
also supports no-fault, and takes a free market approach to most economic 
issues. Quackenbush accepts donations from agents, but not from insurance 
companies that he would directly regulate. Bannister, the GOP nominee in 1990, 
is running a low-cost campaign, and says the job should go to one who knows the 
industry and is not a politician. He is taking money, mostly in small 
increments, from insurance agents, and also from a few insurance companies. He 
favors no-fault auto insurance. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 The office became elective -- although not a constitutional office like other 
statewide positions -- in 1990 with the passage of Proposition 103. John 
Garamendi, the first elected insurance commissioner, has run a high-profile and 
controversial office, waging battles with mixed success to force insurance 
companies to give consumer rebates intended by Proposition 103. The new 
commissioner will inherit that task. Garamendi is leaving the office to run for 
governor. PROFILES

 WES BANNISTER

 * Current position: Owns an independent insurance agency 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, University of Houston 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Bannister won the Republican nomination for insurance 
commissioner in the 1990 primary but lost to Garamendi in the fall, garnering 
37% of the vote. He was on the Huntington Beach City Council from 1986 to 
1990and is a member of various water boards.

 * Career highlights: Became director of the Department of Consumer Affairs in 
1991, after working as an executive for Pacific Bell for 13 years. He quit the 
agency to become a candidate. As a top state bureaucrat, Conran gained a 
reputation as a tough administrator. He sacked longtime executives and managers 
of Consumer Affairs boards that license and regulate professionals ranging from 
doctors to funeral home owners. Conran garnered headlines by leading an 
overhaul of the Medical Board of California, which had been accused of lax 
regulation of doctors. He also initiated an investigation of Sears auto repair 
operations that led to an $8-million settlement with the giant retailer.

company that supplied temporary workers, primarily to Silicon Valley firms. In 
the Assembly, he holds a seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.

<P>
 * Career highlights: Margolin got his start in politics by working as a 
legislative aide for Democratic Rep. Henry A. Waxman in Washington, and Howard 
L. Berman when Berman was an assemblyman. A liberal with a pro-consumer voting 
record, Margolin is regarded as a hard-working but low-profile lawmaker. He has 
taken a lead role in health insurance, offering bills that prohibit insurance 
companies from writing polices that exclude existing conditions, and 
establishing a program by which small businesses can pool their resources to 
buy coverage for their employees. He carried several bills involving workers' 
compensation insurance, but his attempt to fashion a workers' compensation 
overhaul in 1992 fell apart, in part because of insurance opposition.

</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, UC Santa Cruz; law degree, UC Davis 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: As a lawyer from the Eastside, Torres got his start in 
politics working for United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez, although the two 
had a falling out when Torres voted against then-Assemblyman Howard L. Berman, 
Chavez's choice to become Speaker in 1980. Torres is among the most stirring 
orators in the Senate, works long hours and is known as an intelligent lawmaker 
capable of striking compromises. He is a liberal who, in years past, often was 
mentioned as someone who could become governor. He faltered in his personal 
life, twice being convicted of drunk driving. After his 1990 conviction, he 
entered a recovery program. He no longer drinks and speaks openly about his 
recovery. In 1991, Torres lost a bitter campaign for Los Angeles County 
supervisor to Gloria Molina, who once worked for him. As chairman of the Senate 
Insurance Committee, Torres held widely televised hearings last year on the 
pay-at-the-pump auto insurance plan by which all motorists would pay for 
insurance through added gasoline costs. He endorsed the plan, but it died for 
lack of support.

<P>
 Except for the state income tax, the board administers all major taxes 
collected by the state, including those on retail sales, alcohol, petroleum 
products, tobacco, cigarettes, insurance companies and the disposal of toxic 
waste. It writes property tax regulations and acts as a tax court to settle tax 
disputes. Four members are elected from districts and the fifth is the 
controller, who is elected statewide. Board members are paid $95,205 a year. 
MAJOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 In District 4, which includes most of Los Angeles County, a race is on between 
Democrats Brad Sherman, the incumbent, and Dave Elder, a former state 
assemblyman. In District 2, which stretches from Butte County in the north to 
San Bernardino and part of the Antelope Valley in the south, state Sen. Robert 
Presley of Riverside is expected to lead the Democrats and Assemblyman Dean 
Andal of Stockton the Republicans. There is no incumbent in that race. In 
District 3, which covers the far southern portion of the state and reaches into 
parts of southern Los Angeles County, incumbent Ernest Dronenburg is not 
expected to face a serious challenge. ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Elder is pushing for changes in the way the board operates, contending that it 
takes too long to resolve tax disputes. He says the board should meet more 
often to erase a backlog of cases. He favors changing the way sales taxes are 
distributed so cities get more tax revenue. Sherman is seeking reform of tax 
laws and regulations affecting municipalities. Heavy dependence on sales tax 
collected from retail businesses, he contends, has forced cities to seek retail 
development over manufacturing. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 This year's State Board of Equalization races are not expected to be as 
contentious as some in the past. During the last election two Democratic 
incumbents -- Paul Carpenter and William Bennett -- were under criminal 
investigation and their legal problems dominated the campaign. Both were 
reelected, but a federal criminal conviction prevented Carpenter from serving 
and Bennett resigned without serving out his term. This year only two 
incumbents are seeking reelection, Sherman and Dronenburg. PROFILES

 * Career highlights: In the Assembly, where he served seven terms, Elder 
became the Legislature's chief watchdog over the state's two largest pension 
systems. He used his position as chairman of the Assembly Public Employees 
Retirement Committee to critique the Public Employee Retirement System 
(CalPERS) and the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) and the way they 
invested more than $125 billion in pension funds. He made headlines exposing a 
decision by CalPERS in 1990 to purchase $400 million in real estate stock that 
later plummeted 75% in value. But sometimes his criticisms missed the mark. 
After the Wall Street crash of October, 1987, he scolded officials for 
investing too heavily in stocks only to see the value of those investments soar 
a few years later when the market rebounded. After his district was 
reapportioned, he was defeated in the June, 1992, Democratic primary.

 * Career highlights: Sherman has held the chairmanship of the State Board of 
Equalization during some of its most tumultuous years. After two of its members 
faced criminal charges involving their conduct in office, Sherman tried to 
rebuild the image of the agency by taking visible positions on big tax issues. 
He criticized the Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson for imposing a sales tax on 
snacks, calling it a "nightmare" to administer, and campaigned for an 
initiative that repealed the tax. Until his election to the board in 1990, 
Sherman had not held public office. He previously worked as a certified public 
accountant and an attorney specializing in tax matters.

 It is the only nonpartisan statewide race on the ballot, and could be decided 
in the primary if there is a majority vote-getter, although the large field of 
12 candidates makes that unlikely. As top executive of the Department of 
Education, the officeholder oversees operations of the department, shares with 
the appointed State Board of Education policy-making decisions affecting the 
state's $29-billion-a-year, 5.2-million-student system of public schools, and

Delaine Eastin, an assemblywoman from Fremont; Wilbert Smith, a Pasadena 
businessman, and Gloria Matta Tuchman, an Orange County teacher and school 
board member. ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Campus violence, poor academic performance, the state's new testing system and 
school finance and spending are some of the campaign themes. Carrabino wants to 
cut administrative costs and reduce the authority of the state Department of 
Education. DiMarco calls for building broad coalitions to depoliticize the 
education system. Eastin proposes reforms that include allowing teachers more 
say in ways to raise academic performance. Matta Tuchman calls for ending 
bilingual education. Smith supports providing parents with tax vouchers for 
private school tuition and opposes the state's new testing system. HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Honig was forced to resign the post upon his February, 1993, conviction 
on felony conflict-of-interest charges. The governor was unable to win 
legislative support for a replacement to complete Honig's term, so there is no 
incumbent. The office has not provided much of a contest since 1982, when a 
well-financed, high-profile Honig defeated three-term incumbent Wilson Riles. 
Riles had won the post in 1970 after a bruising battle with conservative 
incumbent Max Rafferty. PROFILES

 * Family: Married to Evelyn, 1955; children Bruce, Kim and Susan. The Record  
</P>
<P>
 William Dannemeyer left a House seat in 1993 to challenge appointed U.S. Sen. 
John Seymour in the 1992 Republican primary. Dannemeyer offered himself as the 
conservative alternative to Seymour, but he lost by a margin of nearly 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer has been a champion of the religious right during his years in 
Congress and on the campaign trail. He charges that the Constitution's 
guarantees of free speech and freedom of religion are under attack largely due 
to the U.S. Supreme Court and its decisions against voluntary school prayer and 
separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer gained a national reputation in the mid-1980s when he became an 
outspoken opponent of homosexuality and he sponsored a number of controversial 
AIDS bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Dannemeyer authored a book critical of homosexuality and describing a 
militant gay political movement. The Speech: In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 Winston Churchill is supposed to have said there are two things that are 
difficult in life, one is climbing a fence that is leaning toward you and the 
other is kissing a girl that is leaning away from you. To the third list of 
difficulties, I will add, "How do we defeat Dianne Feinstein in November?" 
</P>
<P>
 I think the answer to that question is that we nominate somebody on behalf of 
the Republican Party who is in contrast to the liberal policies that Dianne 
Feinstein has pursued, rather than a clone of that person. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to dispel a rumor that has been floating around. Somebody has said 
improperly that I don't like Texas or Texans. That's not true. I like Texas and 
Texans. I just don't happen to believe that Texas should have three U.S. 
senators serving in the United States Senate. We should have two and Texas 
should have two. And the reason I say that is that my principal opponent, 
Congressman Michael Huffington, first voted in California in 1992. I am a 
native of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you noticed a similarity between marriage and those of us who have served 
in public life with a voting record? If our spouse would reveal everything they 
know about us, my suspicion is it could alter the image we seek to depict for 
our own lives. Similarly our voting record, I believe, will describe what we 
believe and what we stand for far more distinctly and clearly than any 
television or radio spots we may be putting on the tube to describe ourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington has a voting record. Bill Dannemeyer has a voting record. 
Let me give you an example. Michael Huffington voted for the family leave act. 
President Bush vetoed that in the last Congress. I voted against that. Only two 
Republicans in the House delegation voted for it, one of whom was Michael 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 In May of '93, when the Clinton tax increase plan was on the floor of the 
House for a vote, Michael Huffington was the only Republican in the House 
delegation to vote against the Republican House leadership alternative to that 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In September of 1993, an amendment was offered to rescind the ban of 
homosexuals in the military. Eleven Republicans in the House of Representatives 
of the 175 voted to rescind the ban. Michael Huffington was one of those 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In October of 1993, a bill was up to reauthorize the National Endowment for 
the Arts. Two of the 22 Republicans in the (California) House delegation voted 
to reauthorize the National Endowment for the Arts. Michael Huffington was one 
of the two.  
</P>
<P>
 My friends, my votes on those issues are the opposite of where Michael 
Huffington finds himself. If we want to defeat Dianne Feinstein, we need to 
nominate a person on behalf of the Republican Party who is an economic 
conservative and a social conservative. It is one thing to put on the tube Bill 
Bennett's "Book of Virtues." I don't believe somebody who votes to rescind the 
ban on homosexuals in the military can align themselves with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington is also a supporter of what the abortion crowd calls the 
freedom of choice act. . . . I am, without apology, a pro-life person. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We came close to defeating Barbara Boxer with our conservative, Bruce 
Herschensohn. We would have won but for the fact there was a tide running on 
the political left that really brought in President Clinton. When our nominee 
John Seymour was opposed against Dianne Feinstein he lost by a bigger margin 
than (Herschensohn). And the reason I believe that Herschensohn ran much closer 
was because he identified himself to the people of California as an economic 
conservative and a social conservative, which Bill Dannemeyer is. 
</P>
<P>
 We Republicans have to give the conservative Democrats and the Perot voters, 
of whom there were 20% in the November, 1992, election, a reason for voting for 
Republicans. And we give them that reason when we make clear that we are the 
party that wants to lower taxes, not raise them, to restrain the growth of 
government spending. And when I see a member of Congress like Michael 
Huffington . . . putting a burden on the small businessman by voting for family 
leave, my friends, I do not define that person either as an economic 
conservative or a social conservative but I define him as an economic liberal 
and a social liberal. And I'm suggesting that if we Republicans want to win 
this Senate race and retire Dianne Feinstein, that Bill Dannemeyer is the 
person we should nominate.

 MICHAEL HUFFINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Sept. 3, 1947, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Santa Barbara 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Congressman 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degrees in engineering and economics, Stanford, 1970; 
master's in business administration, Harvard, 1972 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Partner, Simmons & Huffington Inc. (investment firm), 
1974-1976; vice chairman, Roy M. Huffington Inc., 1976-1990; assistant 
secretary of defense for negotiations policy, Defense Department, 1986; member 
of U.S. House, 1993-present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington; children Christina and 
Isabella. The Record  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington emerged on the California political stage just recently 
when he won his first bid for public office in 1992 by unseating an 18-year 
House veteran, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). Huffington set a 
national record for the most money ever spent in a House race when he used 
about $5.2 million of his personal fortune to finance the campaign. He moved to 
Santa Barbara from Houston in 1991 after spending most of his career working in 
his family's oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, Huffington has been an independent voter, breaking from the 
California Republican delegation on several high-profile votes including 
support for President Clinton's family leave act, the recent assault weapons 
ban and the easing of the ban on gays in the military. He was the only 
California Republican to oppose a GOP alternative to the 1993 Clinton budget, 
saying he favored more spending cuts. The Speech: In His Own Words  
</P>
<P>
 I thought I'd talk a little bit about my campaign and why I think we can beat 
the honorable Sen. Feinstein and retire her to San Francisco this year. The 
first thing is, let me tell you, I have actually been up and down this state, 
going from whether it is Willits to Red Bluff, Sacramento, Temecula, San Diego, 
Los Osos, you name the town, I've tried to be there. One of the reasons is that 
I believe the people need to see the candidate face to face whenever possible. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, and I would say Feinstein and Boxer also are taking us down a 
fork and that fork is to the left. It's toward socialism. When you talk about 
putting 15% of the gross national product under government control -- i.e. 
health care -- so that the government takes in every single dollar and pays it 
out. They determine who your doctor is, there is no choice in this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide you don't like what the doctor told you about your daughter, 
your 3-year-old or granddaughter and you don't think that doctor gave a good 
analysis, you want to go to the old family doctor or another doctor in another 
city, guess what? In many circumstances that doctor is going to be fined $1,000 
for just seeing you under this health care plan. Most people don't know that. 
Can you imagine in the United States of America and you can't go to any doctor 
that you want to see. That's what this plan is about. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My main concern about Mrs. Feinstein is her vote on the budget. That is the 
reason I really got involved in this race. When Clinton got in office he said 
to the American people, 'I am going to give you a deficit reduction package.' 
And he raised taxes, the highest tax increase in America. And he raised 
spending. If there is any deficit reduction it's because interest rates are 
low, not because of the tax increase or the spending increase. It's not because 
of what he did. When Mrs. Feinstein was one of those 50 votes that voted for 
it, I realized that if I was a senator from this state it would have been 51 
against and 49 for and it would have failed. Most Americans were against it. My 
phone calls were 10 to 1 against it. She is not pro-business. Now a lot of 
people think she might be because she speaks like a moderate. Her rhetoric is 
moderate. Her actions are liberal. She and Mrs. Boxer, who is not known as a 
moderate, are the Thelma and Louise of the United States Senate. They vote 95% 
the same, they are almost identical twins in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce has said, 'Let's look through the voting records of 
Mr. Huffington and Mrs. Feinstein.' Michael Huffington got 91%. Now when I went 
to school, that's an A. Mrs. Feinstein got 9%. The Wall Street Journal, they 
listed the top 50 spenders in the United States. Out of 100, the top 50. Well, 
Mrs. Feinstein gets an A there. She came in eighth in the United States Senate. 
Sen. Kennedy, who is not known as a fiscal conservative, came in 12th. Mrs. 
Boxer came in 27th. Mrs. Feinstein is no moderate. I voted for a $90-billion 
deficit reduction package just recently called the Penny-Kasich plan. . . . I 
don't see the same attitude across the capital. And so my point is this, there 
are working men and women in this country who make $30,000 a year, they pay 
their taxes, they don't have enough money to send their kids to school, they 
don't necessarily have enough money to buy a house anymore and here we are 
wasting money in the Senate and in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 If we ever want to put more money back in your pockets, we can't keep raising 
taxes and raising spending. We've got to cut programs. I'm willing to do that. 
So this is going to be a fiscal campaign. We are going to talk about economic 
issues. We are also going to talk about where she flips and flops on different 
things. In one case, she is against the death penalty when she is in a liberal 
city and she's mayor. In another case, she is for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for NAFTA because I think it's good for America, it's good for Canada 
and it's good for Mexico. . . . She voted against NAFTA, which is not good for 
business. She voted against NAFTA because she got a $2.5-million contribution 
from labor unions. People in this state are fed up with special interests. 
They're fed up with it. I'm going to represent all of you as individuals. I'm 
going to represent your grandchildren too.

SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW; DECISION '94 / A VOTER'S GUIDE TO STATE AND 
LOCAL ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; DEMOCRAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN FACES NO SERIOUS 
OPPOSITION FOR HER PARTY'S NOMINATION. ON THIS PAGE, A LOOK AT THE TWO MAJOR 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, THEIR RECORDS AND EXCERPTS FROM THEIR STUMP SPEECHES.; 
THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to hear a speech about Rep. Michael Huffington, listen to William 
E. Dannemeyer. If you want to hear a speech about Sen. Dianne Feinstein, listen 
to Huffington. The two leading candidates for the Republican nomination have 
had little direct confrontation. But there are plenty of differences between 
the two. Feinstein has done little active campaigning and hasn't joined in the 
campaign's debate over issues. CRIME 
</P>
<P>
 Both Republican candidates describe crime as one of the nation's most critical 
problems. Both favor the death penalty, both call for truth-in-sentencing laws 
and both support the "three strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Huffington, Dannemeyer has not called for a deployment of more police 
on city streets. He believes society cannot have, at a reasonable cost, enough 
police to solve the crime problem. His solution is to supplement police with 
voluntary neighborhood patrols of armed citizens. He said citizens should have 
firearms training, although he acknowledges that the patrols could lead to 
mistaken shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unlike Huffington, who calls for more prisons, Dannemeyer suggests that 
the government study the possibility of housing its criminals in Third World 
countries to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says money for more police and prisons can be found. "The preamble 
of the Constitution says to maintain domestic tranquillity," he said. "We don't 
have domestic tranquillity." 
</P>
<P>
 The two disagreed recently on banning assault weapons. Huffington voted in 
favor of the ban when it passed by one vote in the House. California gun groups 
immediately got behind the campaign for Dannemeyer, an opponent of the ban. 
IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have complained about the burden of illegal immigration. They 
want more resources to protect the integrity of the border and support a plan 
to prevent babies born in the United States to illegal immigrants from 
automatically becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington believes the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he 
supported, will prove to be a deterrent to illegal immigration by improving 
Mexico's economy. Dannemeyer opposed NAFTA, criticizing the supranational 
authority it created. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer favors an initiative expected to be on California's November ballot 
that would deny illegal immigrants access to public schools and health 
benefits, except for emergency care. Huffington is undecided about public 
school access, but says health care should be limited to infectious diseases 
and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has called for a tamper-proof national identification card to 
assist in denying welfare and other services to illegal immigrants. Dannemeyer 
opposes such a card, saying it would pose the potential for an improper 
invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer supports employer sanctions, while Huffington thinks they are 
unfair to businesses without a tamper-proof national identification card. Even 
then, however, Huffington said he is uncertain whether that portion of 
immigration law is appropriate. ECONOMY 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail and in television commercials, both candidates have 
portrayed the economy as a top priority. Both have also addressed the issue in 
the same broad and general themes: smaller government, lower taxes and fewer 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have criticized the Clinton deficit reduction package. Dannemeyer has 
attacked Huffington for voting against the Republican alternative to Clinton's 
1993 budget. Huffington has said, however, that he supported even deeper cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 While he served in Congress, Dannemeyer offered his own budget alternative to 
the House eight times. Its most innovative component is a plan to refinance the 
national debt with gold-backed bonds, ostensibly lowering interest rates. 
Dannemeyer contends that the savings, along with modest spending cuts, would be 
enough to balance the budget in about five years, lower taxes and provide more 
for defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has not been nearly as specific. In his campaign position paper, he 
lists four proposals to improve the California economy, including a lower 
capital gains tax, less regulation, support for fair trade and a promise to 
fight government bureaucracy. SOCIAL ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Their differences on litmus-test social issues place Huffington and Dannemeyer 
at opposite edges of their party. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer is an abortion opponent and leader of the conservative Christian 
ranks. Huffington supports a woman's right to have an abortion, though he voted 
against federal funding of abortions for indigent women.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffington supported President Clinton's family leave act and his policy on 
gays in the military. Dannemeyer has attacked both votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond those issues, Dannemeyer and Huffington have emphasized the need for a 
greater attention to moral values.  
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates want to reinstate voluntary school prayer.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; ABOUT THESE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three major candidates are seeking the six-year U.S. Senate term on the 
California ballot this November. Pete Wilson won the office in 1988, serving 
until he was elected governor in 1990.His appointee, John Seymour, was defeated 
two years later when voters chose Dianne Feinstein to finish the term. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Feinstein seeks reelection to a full term. She came into the election year 
as a formidable candidate. As a result, she has no major challenge in the 
Democratic primary and, so far, her campaign has had a low profile. The former 
San Francisco mayor spent most of the spring in Washington and has not aired 
any television commercials, preferring to wait to see whom the Republicans 
select to challenge her. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking the Republican nomination are two major candidates. One is Michael 
Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara who has promised to 
generously finance his campaign from the fortune he earned in his family's 
Texas oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is former Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, who has support 
from the party's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Republican candidate, Riverside attorney Kate Squires, has excited 
some GOP conservatives. But with little money and no political experience, her 
campaign has been unable to attract wide support.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What it is: This measure qualified for the ballot by citizen petitions. It 
would authorize $2 billion worth of bonds to buy, develop and conserve 
parkland, historic sites, wildlife areas, coastal areas and other land 
throughout California.It is the most expensive parks bond measure in California 
history and provides money for more than 400 projects in all corners of the 
state. Passage also would require the state Department of Parks and Recreation 
to give priority in awarding grants to groups that hire at-risk urban youths to 
clean up parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: The proposition would protect wildlife, open space and 
parklands throughout California at a time when state budget for these types of 
projects may be dwindling. It is also meant to give job opportunities to urban 
youths, thereby diverting them from gangs or crime.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: The measure is too costly and places too great a burden on 
California's future generations, who will have to shoulder the debt service. 
The initiative would spend most of the $2 billion to buy and preserve vacant 
land rather than to keep up existing local parks and recreational facilities. 
Passage would force diversion of resources from crime-fighting, school 
construction and other public needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who supports it: Planning and Conservation League, California Park and 
Recreation Society, League of Women Voters of California, California 
Organization of Police and Sheriffs, Sierra Club, American Assn. of Retired 
Persons, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, California 
Historical Society. 
</P>

SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW; DECISION '94 / A VOTER'S GUIDE TO STATE AND 
LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; PROP. 178 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What it is: Like Proposition 177, this measure would grant an exemption from 
the taxes on new construction added on to existing property. In this case, the 
exemption would be allowed on installation of water-saving equipment used in 
agriculture -- adding to property value by replacing a sprinkler irrigation 
system with a more expensive drip system.Analysts estimate that the exemption 
could save farmers and ranchers $7 to $10 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: Tax savings available under Proposition 178 would encourage the 
installation of equipment requiring less water for crops and thus help conserve 
water. Particularly in a state subject to drought, it is unfair and 
counterproductive to extract a higher tax based on improvements to property 
that cut back on water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: Tax losses from this measure would leave a hole in revenues 
needed for local governments to fund critical services and for schools. Farmers 
who install water-saving devices will automatically enjoy a reduction in their 
costs, in the form of reduced water bills. They don't need a tax break to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who supports it: Sen. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena); heads of the California

 What it is: This measure would authorize the sale of $900 million in general 
obligation bonds to help pay for new construction, renovation and seismic 
strengthening of buildings on California's public college campuses. The 
legislative analyst's office reports that the 138 campuses in the system suffer 
from maintenance backlogs that have left some older buildings in need of 
seismic upgrades.If the measure passes, funding for specific projects still 
would require approval by the Legislature and governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: A key element in the recovery of California's economy is a 
strong higher education system. In recent years the public college and 
university system has been staggering under severe budget cutbacks. This 
measure would help reinvigorate the system by providing a source of funds to 
repair and modernize dilapidated structures. The construction and renovation 
work would create jobs and help the state's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: The current recession has forced public colleges and 
universities throughout the state to cut back and economize. The passage of 
Proposition 1-C could spark a college building boom that in turn could 
encourage these institutions to hire more staff to fill the new facilities, 
leading to higher taxes. This measure would create more debt for the state and 
fail to provide funds for what is most needed -- remedial education.

Council.

 What it is: This measure would reinstate the state's income tax credit for 
renters and make it permanent. Beginning Jan. 1, 1995, the proposal would 
guarantee a renters tax reduction of $60 for individuals and $120 for married 
couples.The credit was first allowed in 1973 as a counterpart to the homeowners 
exemption, which is $7,000 on the assessed value of owner-occupied homes. But 
with the state facing mounting financial woes, the renters credit was first 
limited to poor and moderate-income renters and then last year eliminated for 
1993 and 1994, saving about $840 million. As part of that deal, however, the 
present proposal was placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: By wiping out the credit, legislators in effect raised the 
annual taxes paid by renters by as much as $120. This could be done because 
renters don't employ powerful lobbyists and the credit does not enjoy the same 
constitutional protection as the homeowners exemption. Reinstating the credit 
as a constitutional amendment would restore the tax break and treat renters and 
homeowners in a similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: The tax credit is an inappropriate "giveaway" that should 
not be granted constitutional protection. It would give renters a tax break of 
up to $120, a bigger break than the homeowners $7,000 exemption, which nets an 
average tax saving of only $74.

Foundation of Los Angeles, Western Center on Law and Poverty and California

 What it is: This measure would authorize $1 billion in general obligation 
bonds to help finance construction, renovation and seismic safety projects for 
public schools serving kindergarten through high school. With an expected 
enrollment increase of 900,000 students over the next five years, California 
schools are projected to need about $3.5 billion annually for those 
purposes.Proposition 1-B would provide up to $400 million for renovation 
projects, $360 million for new construction, up to $200 million for seismic 
retrofitting and up to $40 million for projects in school districts that agree 
to assume at least 60% of the costs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: With half of its schools more than 30 years old, California has 
fallen behind in the building and repair of classrooms. More construction money 
is needed to keep pace with mushrooming enrollments, to repair older structures 
and to ensure that schools are safe in the event of an earthquake. This measure 
would provide additional construction and renovation funds without raising 
taxes. The new construction and renovation would not only ease overcrowding but 
also create jobs. Although California voters have shown a general reluctance in 
recent years to approve bond issues, they have been more receptive to those 
that finance school construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: The proposal would increase California bonded indebtedness 
and pass off to future generations the cost of repaying the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who supports it: California State PTA, California Teachers Assn., California 
Council of the American Institute of Architects, California School Boards 
Assn., California School Employees' Assn., County Superintendents of Schools 
and state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael).

 What it is: This measure would authorize the sale of $2 billion in general 
obligation bonds to help pay the state's share of the estimated $20 billion 
needed to repair damage from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and to provide 
for the seismic strengthening of highway overpasses throughout California. The 
bridge retrofitting program would get the bulk of the bond money -- $950 
million. The remainder includes $575 million for housing rehabilitation, $265 
million for quake repairs to schools and other public buildings, $65 million to 
reduce earthquake hazards in public buildings and $145 million for highway 
repairs that are not eligible for federal funds. The principal and interest on 
general obligation bonds are paid by the state out of its general fund, which 
is supported primarily by revenues from state income and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: The use of bonds to raise these essential funds avoids a tax 
increase that could further depress California's struggling economy. By 
earmarking some of the money for seismic retrofitting, other state funds would 
be freed for transportation maintenance and construction projects. All 
retrofitted bridges survived the Northridge earthquake, proving that seismic 
strengthening is a wise investment. The bond issue would enable the state to 
complete retrofitting at an accelerated pace. For low-income victims of the 
earthquake, it could become the only source of financing available for home 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: The use of bonds to pay for seismic retrofitting and 
roadway repairs violates the California tradition of financing highways on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. A temporary gasoline or sales tax increase is the 
preferred method of financing highways. Those methods are less expensive and 
avoid saddling future generations with today's debts. Furthermore, passage of 
the bond issue would not cover all costs of seismic retrofitting or alleviate 
the need to find additional revenue to finance the state's transportation 
program. 
</P>

 Who supports it: Gov. Pete Wilson, state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys),

Seniors.

<P>
 What it is: Thousands of people -- mostly teen-agers and children -- have been 
killed or wounded in recent years in drive-by shootings. Under this 
proposition, the minimum sentence for a second-degree murder conviction in a 
drive-by shooting would be increased from 15 years to 20.The maximum sentence 
would still be life imprisonment. Under the state Constitution, it takes 
passage of a voter initiative to make the change because the original 
second-degree sentencing law was enacted by a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: Drive-by shootings have become so frequent, particularly in the 
Los Angeles area, that tougher action must be taken against those who kill and 
maim from a passing car. This measure will ensure that drive-by killers get 
long prison sentences even if prosecutors cannot obtain first-degree murder 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: Longer prison sentences mean more costs for the state and a 
greater likelihood of prison overcrowding.

 Who supports it: Gov. Pete Wilson, state Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino),

 Eight of the nine ballot measures that California voters will decide on June 7 
call for decisions on fiscal issues -- four relating to taxes and four to 
borrowing in the form of bonds. Only Proposition 179 asks for a decision on a 
social issue -- whether to increase the punishment for a crime.Three of the tax 
measures might seem too obscure to be put before the voters -- Propositions 
176, 177 and 178. Each, however, amends the state Constitution, and that 
document cannot be changed except by a two-thirds vote of each house of the 
Legislature and a majority vote of the people. Likewise, Proposition 175 is a 
tax-related measure and thus a constitutional amendment. Only one measure, 
Proposition 180, reached the ballot as a citizens initiative. The rest were 
authorized by the Legislature.

 What it is: This measure would exempt from property taxation any building 
improvements that would make access easier for disabled people. Such 
improvements would not be classified as new construction, which under 
Proposition 13 calls for reassessing the property's value and thus payment of 
higher property taxes.State law already allows this exemption for 
owner-occupied buildings. Proposition 177 would extend the exemption to most 
commercial buildings open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments for: The exemption would encourage more owners of property such as 
apartments, restaurants, hotels and stores to make the necessary alterations to 
help disabled people gain access to and more easily use public accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments against: Passage of this measure would amount to a piecemeal 
approach in addressing the unfairness in property taxation brought about by 
Proposition 13.

 Here are some facts and figures about politics in California: 
</P>
<P>
 * PARTICIPATION: In the Nov. 2, 1993 general election, only 31.6% of Los 
Angeles County voters went to the polls at 3,786 precincts. Alpine County, the 
state's smallest with only five precincts, had a voter turnout of 55.1% 
</P>
<P>
 * ABSENTEES: Absentee balloting jumped from 6.3% of statewide voters in 1980 
to 21.8% in 1993. Keeping the Status Quo 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the percentages of state Assembly and Senate incumbents who won in 
recent California primary elections: 02,12,09 PERCENT June, 1992 94.4% June, 
1990 100 % June, 1988 100 % June, 1986 100 % June, 1984 98.9% June, 1982 98.6% 
June, 1980 97.6% * PARTIES: There are six qualified political parties in 
California: Democratic, Republican, American Independent, Green, Libertarian 
and Peace and Freedom. There are several non-qualified political bodies with 
registered voters such as the Humanist Party, the Pragmatic Party and the Rock 
and Roll Party. 
</P>
<P>
 * OTHER VOICES: Among the non-qualified parties: the Environmentalist Party 
registered 73 voters statewide, with 12 in Los Angeles County; the Puritan 
Party had 66 voters statewide, five of them in Los Angeles County, and the Rock 
and Roll Party, with 52 voters statewide, had 11 members in the county in

 * Duties: The assessor is responsible for preparing property tax bills. The 
department's 1,800 employees locate taxable property in the county, identify 
its ownership and establish the value, including reassessments due to change in 
ownership, market conditions, new construction or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major candidates: The nonpartisan race has attracted a large field of 16 
candidates that is dominated by incumbent Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn and former 
Assessor John Lynch, who served one term. Hahn unseated Lynch from the 
$151,000a-year position four years ago. Many political analysts attributed his 
victory to his having the same name as the popular Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who 
is no relation. As in the 1990 election, many of the candidates are current or 
former employees of the assessor's department who are dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 * Issues: The dominant issues are largely the same as four years ago: 
paperwork backlogs, a troublesome computer system and character. A more recent 
issue is a proposed 25% budget cut for the assessor's office that would force 
the layoff of more than 400 employees and exacerbate the logjam of appeals and 
reassessments.  
</P>
<P>
 * History: The office lost much of its public profile when California voters 
approved Proposition 13 in 1978. That reduced assessments to a simple 
calculation based on the sales price of a property.  
</P>
<P>
 * Other candidates: Alan Bato, deputy county assessor; Robert Burman, manager 
in the assessor's office; John Carl Brogdon, taxpayer appeals representative; 
Roy Z. Cossio, deputy assessor; Ruben Vasquez Chagoy, deputy assessor; Richard 
B. Forsch, attorney; Khalil Khalil, engineer; Dennis C. Kumaus, deputy 
assessor; Roy R. Sharman, the assessor's chief appraiser; Marsha G. Tuton, 
supervising deputy assessor; William R. Lenney Jr., deputy assessor/contractor; 
Harley Lee Outten; assessor representative; Nick Stansfield, deputy assessor, 
and Janet Woods, businesswoman.

The sheriff and district attorney are also funded by the county budget. The 3rd 
District encompasses the Westside, including the cities of Malibu, Santa Monica 
and West Hollywood, and most of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major candidates: Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was the first 
to jump into the race for this nonpartisan job after incumbent Ed Edelman 
announced his retirement in December. Yaroslavsky faces retired Fire Captain 
Don Wallace, who is a former aide to Edelman, and two other candidates, Elgin 
Trammell Sr., a former gang member and youth counselor, and Michael Hirsch, an 
environmental consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Issues: The election is Yaroslavsky's to lose, and with a $1-million-plus 
campaign war chest and a long list of endorsements, the veteran Westside 
lawmaker is leaving little to chance. Yaroslavsky has pledged to attack waste 
in county government, dismantle what he calls the board's secretive practices 
and bring campaign finance reforms to county politics. Wallace has said that as 
an aide to Edelman he has been the supervisor-in-training for several years. He 
has expressed support for term limits and campaign finance reforms. Trammell 
has said he wants to make county bureaucracy friendlier, while Hirsch, the only 
Republican in the race, has pledged to be an environmental leader. 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisor Gloria Molina is running unopposed in her bid to represent the 
Eastside district for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: The 1990s have been years of upheaval for county government. 
Molina, the board's first-ever Latino, took over a seat held for years by the 
board's most conservative member. In 1992, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, an African 
American attorney, replaced retiring board member Kenneth Hahn, a veritable 
institution on the board. The departure of Edelman, who has been a supervisor 
for almost two decades, and the likely election of Yaroslavsky would put a new 
generation of liberal Democrats in power at the Hall of Administration and 
probably accelerate the impetus for change.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; L.A. COUNTY RACES; SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Duties: The sheriff is in charge of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, with over 8,000 sworn deputies and about 4,000 non-sworn personnel. 
The department is the fourth-largest police agency in the country, with 
jurisdiction over 42 cities and unincorporated county areas with a combined 
population of more than 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major candidates: Five candidates are opposing Sheriff Sherman Block's bid 
for a fourth term, but none are politically well known. Three of the five -- 
Gil Carrillo, Tab Rhodes and Sgt. John R. Stites II -- are uniformed deputies 
in the department. One, Robert J. Irmas, is a reserve sheriff's captain and the 
fifth, Robert H. Lewis Jr., is a sergeant with the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Issues: Block is running on his record under the slogan, "tough job, tough 
sheriff." His challengers claim the department is poorly administered and that 
the staff has poor morale. Block has been an exponent of reform, particularly 
in the areas of monitoring and limiting excess use of force. With the exception 
of Lewis, his opponents say the reforms are overly bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: The first Los Angeles County sheriff was elected in 1850, and there 
have been 25 sheriffs in all, 19 elected to office and six appointed by the 
Board of Supervisors. Block, who joined the department 38 years ago and worked 
his way up, is a registered Republican, but the office is nonpartisan. The 
sheriff had two successful bouts with cancer, and is beyond the usual 
retirement age. But he has repeatedly said he would serve out a new term in 
office. PROFILES

SPECIAL REPORT: EXECUTIVE PAY; EXECUTIVE PAY AT CALIFORNIA'S 100 BIGGEST PUBLIC 
COMPANIES; HOW WE PUT THESE CHARTS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Source: The compensation data in this chart was provided by Star Services of 
San Francisco and was derived from proxy and 10K filings of California's 100 
largest publicly held companies, as ranked by revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is listed: The adjacent chart lists the top-ranking officer at each 
company, usually the chief executive officer. In a few cases, we have cited the 
president or chairman of the board rather than the CEO because historic salary 
trends indicate that this is the top officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Total compensation: Includes salary, bonus and reported value of stock options 
granted during the year, value of restricted stock awards, long-term 
compensation. "Other" compensation includes company-paid perks, relocation 
allowances, severance payments and retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock options granted: The figures in this column are those reported by each 
company. They may have been calculated in one of two ways. Some companies 
report the present value of the options based on a complex formula called the 
Black-Scholes method. (These figures are marked with a * in the chart.) Others 
report the future value of the options based on the assumption that the stock 
will appreciate 5% a year. The 5% method typically results in a higher value 
than the Black-Scholes method.  
</P>
<P>
 Stock awards: Restricted stock awards are gifts of stock that usually become 
free of restrictions after a certain period or after performance goals have 
been met. The listed value of the award represents the value of the underlying 
stock on the date of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock options exercised: This column lists the difference between the market 
price of an officer's stock and the price at which the option to purchase it 
was exercised, as of the date of purchase. Figures in this column are not added 
to the executives' "total compensation" for 1993, because the gains are earned 
over a period of years, even though they're recognized in just one. 
</P>
<P>
 Size ranking: This is where the company ranks, based on revenue, among 
California's 100 largest publicly held companies. 04,32,06,23,15 Company Rank

DECISION '94; BATTERED, BORED VOTERS IN O.C. MEET BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They are battered, worn out and, to some extent, bored. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, about half of Orange County's 1.1-million voters are likely to head for 
the polls June 7 to choose from a pack of candidates in almost three dozen 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 An inconsequential election? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the city, county, state and congressional races facing Orange County 
voters next week are contests for three of five seats on the Board of 
Supervisors -- including two being vacated by incumbents. The results could 
place two women on the board for the first time. At the same time, a prominent 
Democratic candidate -- Linda Moulton Patterson -- is threatening to break the 
Republican hold on the nonpartisan board. 
</P>
<P>
 In another nonpartisan race that would normally receive little attention, 
voters will decide a judicial race in which the incumbent, Superior Court Judge 
Claude E. Whitney, is facing misconduct charges filed recently by the state 
Commission on Judicial Performance. He has one opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorder Lee A. Branch -- who was censured earlier this year by the Board of 
Supervisors for misconduct in the way he ran his office -- faces a three-way 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats and Republicans, their party primaries will provide voters an 
opportunity to register a protest against the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republicans -- usually counted on in the November general 
election to deliver the winning margins for their statewide nominees for 
governor and U.S. senator -- will be watched to see if they cast a significant 
"protest" vote for computer entrepreneur Ron K. Unz against Gov. Pete Wilson, 
who has had a lukewarm relationship with party conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A big vote for Unz in Republican-dominated Orange County could be as 
embarrassing to Wilson as Patrick J. Buchanan's presidential bid was to 
incumbent President George Bush early in the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats, meanwhile, once again hope to field post-primary nominees who 
are strong enough to challenge the Republicans in the November General Election 
and break the GOP's hold on local legislative seats. Every congressional and 
state Legislature seat, except the one held by departing Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove), is in Republican hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when voters want local and state public officials to do something to 
reduce crime and speed the economic recovery, the candidates have their work 
cut out for them, said Mark Baldassare, a social ecology professor at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that local voters continue to sense there's a void in leadership and 
they are still looking for leadership at the county level," Baldassare said, 
after recently concluding a Times Orange County poll of 600 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think there continues to be a lot of frustration about the state of the 
economy, which is going to be a serious problem for (Gov. Pete) Wilson in this 
election," Baldassare added. "Pete Wilson is going to have to do quite a bit of 
work to get the Republicans behind him here" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed Wilson would beat either Democrat front runner -- Kathleen 
Brown or John Garamendi -- in Orange County, but the governor's margin would 
not by sufficient to offset heavy voting by Democrats in Northern California 
and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter anger also set in at two city halls, where council members are targets 
of recall efforts because they cut fire services or raised taxes to balance 
budgets to meet expenses in a time of economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, firefighters are testing the strength of their union against 
three council members who voted to cut the Fire Department's budget. And in 
Fullerton, voters are being asked to recall three council members and the city 
clerk, as the result of citizen opposition to a 2% utility-tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all the frustration being voiced by local residents about 
incumbents and government, some local campaigns have found voters and 
contributors disinterested. When the usual wells for campaign funds dried up, 
several candidates loaned their own campaigns tens of thousands of dollars to 
"make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.1-million citizens who are eligible to cast ballots next week represent 
no great surge in voter registration, according to figures released last week 
by the Registrar of Voters.  
</P>
<P>
 While the number of voters this year is 53,265 more than the total for the 
1992 June primary, there will be 87,084 fewer eligible voters than for the 
November, 1992, presidential election -- a drop off that usually occurs during 
gubernatorial election years. Turnout in recent June elections has been between 
40% and 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither party made significant gains in voter registration before the primary. 
Party affiliation is considered key in several central Orange County state 
Legislature and congressional races, where Democrats outnumber Republicans and 
the seats are expected to be competitive in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans face two critical Assembly primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the hottest local races, Republican voters could very well be 
choosing the successor to Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in the 
70th Assembly District. The district has the second highest Republican voter 
registration in the state and the GOP victor should have an edge in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the beginning of the campaign season, the three Republican 
hopefuls have bruised each other in a contest that has split the party's 
conservative faction.  
</P>
<P>
 In another intraparty struggle in the 69th Assembly District, Republican 
voters will be selecting a nominee to lead their party's effort to recapture in 
November the only local legislative seat held by a Democrat. Incumbent Umberg 
is running for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Democrats, meanwhile, are battling to succeed Umberg. Holding on to the 
seat is the Democrats' top priority this year, and the party's success will 
largely turn on how well the nominee survives the fractious primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also see the 46th congressional district seat in central Orange 
County, held by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), as ripe for pickings. 
Dornan barely won reelection in 1992 even though Democrats hardly put up a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan is unopposed in the primary and is expected to battle hard against 
whoever emerges from the Democratic primary, which has been marked by divisive 
rhetoric.

DECISION '94; ORANGE COUNTY CONTESTS; NEW SUPERVISORS TO CHANGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the retirement of a pair of longtime members, the June election will 
create the most significant leadership overhaul the county's Board of 
Supervisors has undergone in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a feeling that there will be a change of chemistry on the 
board," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, the only incumbent on the ballot. 
"I think there will be different prospectives and chances for different 
leadership. But whoever is there will have their work cut out for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are up for grabs, and at least two will be filled by newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many county observers say the replacements for veteran Supervisors Harriett M. 
Wieder and Thomas F. Riley could greatly change the direction the current board 
has mapped out on key issues such as the county's budget, the future of El Toro 
Marine Air Station, development at Bolsa Chica, jail overcrowding and various 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be extraordinary," said Stan Oftelie, the Orange County 
Transportation chief executive. "It's going to be a fresh board with fresh 
eyes. Some real talented people are leaving, but there are some great 
opportunities ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The most hotly contested race is for Wieder's 2nd District seat in a contest 
that has become a power struggle among several current and former Huntington 
Beach council members. Wieder, who been on the board for 15 years, has 
hand-picked former county planning commissioner Haydee V. Tillotson as her 
successor. Whether or not her endorsement will be a factor is yet to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for the seat are: Raymond Thomas Littrell, a president of the Midway 
City Sanitary District and former Garden Grove city councilman; Linda Moulton 
Patterson, the mayor of Huntington Beach who also sits on Huntington Beach 
Union High School Board; Jim Silva, a high school teacher and Huntington Beach 
city councilman; John A. Thomas, a founder of Thomas Crane and Trucking Co.; 
and Tillotson, a partner with her husband in a local property management 
company and transportation firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's 5th District seat is expected to go to current state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is running unopposed. County officials believe 
she is the most politically savvy board candidate who would wield considerable 
influence in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to hit the ground running," Riley said. "She's an experienced 
legislator and she's aware of all the significant problems in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final board race, for the 4th District seat, Steiner will be running 
against Phillip Knypstra, a college business professor and former policeman. 
Steiner was appointed to the board March 1993 after supervisor Don R. Roth 
resigned his seat and pleaded guilty to seven misdemeanor charges of conflicts 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time two new supervisors joined the board at the same time was in 
1981 when Supervisor Roger R. Stanton and former Supervisor Bruce Nestande were 
sworn into office. 
</P>
<P>
 County administrative officer Ernie Schneider said the county will miss Wieder 
and Riley. On the other hand, he said, "I think anytime there is a opportunity 
for new blood it's positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor's positions have long been coveted by county politicians because of 
the $82,000 annual salary, generous health benefits and county car. Once 
elected, supervisors tend to remain long in office. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most vexing issues the board faces is how to convert the El Toro 
base, scheduled to close by 1999. A controversy revolves around whether to 
convert the air base into a commercial airport. Many South County residents are 
opposed to the conversion while many in North County favor the idea.The board's 
recommendations on the base will be forwarded to the Department of Defense for 
a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Another significant challenge ahead for the new board is balancing the 
county's budget. In the past several years, the county's financial resources 
have dwindled, forcing severe cuts and downsizing in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year it gets more difficult when you get less money. And when cuts have 
to be made that affect people it gets even harder," Riley said. "We don't know 
how the budget is going to work out and it's going to be tough issue for who's 
ever on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said he hopes the new board will continue "a recent 
trend" by county officials to "share power" with cities.

DECISION '94; ORANGE COUNTY CONTESTS; BITTER BATTLES WAGED FOR LOW-PROFILE 
COUNTY OFFICES

<P>
 The treasurer-tax collector and clerk-recorder are two of the county's 
lowest-profile elected offices, but they've produced a pair of heated election 
battles this year that have entrenched incumbents facing unusually strong 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 After 23 years in office, county Treasurer Robert L. Citron is locked in a 
bitter battle with John M.W.Moorlach, a certified public accountant who has 
criticized Citron's investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorder Lee A. Branch, who was censured by county officials for misconduct 
earlier this year, is being challenged by county Clerk Gary L. Granville, a 
veteran elected official whose position is being eliminated as a cost-cutting 
measure. Ella M. Murphy, Branch's top assistant, also is seeking to oust her 
boss, along with attorney Christopher J. Leanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two races are among five countywide seats that will be decided June 7. 
Local voters will be asked to select a superintendent of schools, public 
administrator and county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other countywide offices are not contested: Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and County Auditor Steven E. Lewis are running 
unopposed for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for county assessor, 19-year incumbent Bradley L. Jacobs faces two 
of his employees: Larry Lee Bales, an auditor-appraiser, and David J. Holbert, 
the deputy assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' office was criticized last year for the slow pace in processing tens 
of thousands of appeals for property tax reassessments. Homeowners complained 
about the red tape involved in the reassessment process, as well as the many 
months they had to wait for their cases to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said his staff has carried out tax assessments as swiftly as possible 
and "reduced (property) values when it was proper to do so." Actions have been 
taken in recent months by the Board of Supervisors to speed up the reassessment 
process. Jacobs said he also is pushing for tax reforms in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbert and Bales vowed to lower many property tax assessments that they say 
are inflated. They also said they would work to reduce the backlog of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for school superintendent, incumbent county Superintendent John F. 
Dean faces Darrell Opp, chief education officer in the county Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent's responsibilities include approving budgets, providing 
curriculum support to local school districts and making sure legal mandates are 
being followed. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected for a second term, Dean said he will strive to improve education 
for all students, pursue legislation allowing "burned-out" teachers and 
administrators to leave the profession with "dignity," continue to scrutinize 
budgets and services for more savings and use the county's influence as the 
third largest in the state to push for widespread reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Opp said he would bring new leadership, reinforce programs teaching basic 
academic skills, stress school safety and strive to revamp county audit 
procedures to prevent fraud as seen in the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District, where a school administrator was convicted of embezzling funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for public administrator pits incumbent William A. Baker against 
businessman Michael K. Stark and vocational guidance counselor Mitchell T. 
Tracy. The public administrator is in charge of managing the estates of people 
who died without wills or left disputed wills. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for clerk-recorder has centered on Branch's record in office. An 
investigation by the county affirmative action office concluded that Branch had 
mismanaged his department and sexually harassed two women in the department. In 
January, the Board of Supervisors censured him. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville and Murphy have criticized Branch's conduct. "In the recorder's 
office, people are oppressed and morale is low," Granville said. He and Murphy 
vowed to boost staff morale and improve service if elected.  
</P>
<P>
 Leanders said he would work to make the office more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has denied any wrongdoing and said the accusations against him have 
been overblown. He said he wants to modernize record-keeping methods and make 
it easier for the public to obtain copies of birth, death and marriage 
certificates. "I want to finish what I've started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another contentious race, the battle for treasurer-tax collector made 
national headlines earlier this year when Moorlach raised questions about 
Citron's investment strategy, which relies heavily on using the county's pool 
of U.S. Treasury bills and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low 
interest rates. The borrowed funds are then invested in mid-term corporate 
bonds and securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such investments can yield high returns when interest rates are low. Over the 
last decade, Citron's strategy has earned an average return of 9.03%, or nearly 
double the return of comparable investment pools. 
</P>
<P>
 But as interest rates have inched up recently, the value of the securities 
used to borrow money has declined, forcing the county to pay more than $200 
million in additional collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach and his supporters maintain that Citron's strategy is unwise in a 
climate of rising interest rates. He's called for a more "conservative" 
approach that relies on the "safest" investment practices.

DECISION '94; CONGRESS: ORANGE COUNTY; HOT-BUTTON ISSUES FOCUS OF CONGRESSIONAL 
RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the 17 candidates running in the Democratic and Republican 
congressional primaries June 7 agree on the issues they think excite most 
Orange County voters: legislating business tax breaks to fix the California 
economy and finding ways to cut crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But in two of the six districts -- the races attracting the most attention and 
the greatest number of candidates -- the Republican incumbents, not these 
hot-button issues, are the focus of the campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st Congressional District, four Republicans and two Democrats have 
lined up to take on the one-term incumbent, Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), 
who is being investigated by several agencies for alleged campaign, labor and 
tax law violations relating to his former engineering firm, and his possible 
use of the business's financial resources to bolster his 1992 congressional 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the heart of Orange County, in the 46th Congressional District, six 
Democrats are engaged in a spirited contest for the right to challenge the 
incumbent, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan faces no opponents in the GOP primary after soundly defeating a 
well-financed moderate challenger, Judith Ryan, in the 1992 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan looks vulnerable to Democrats because he barely won the general 
election against Robert John Banuelos, an underfunded, low-profile Democratic 
candidate. In addition, the 46th District is the only Orange County 
congressional district with more Democrat than Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the conservative, outspoken congressman as a target, Orange County 
Democrats hope that the primary winner is strong enough to defeat Dornan and 
break the Republican Party's hold on all the local seats in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside Dornan's proven ability to win elections, having a cohesive 
party emerge from the primary could be a tough assignment for the six Democrats 
who have beaten each other during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, three Democratic candidates -- Madelene E. Arakelian, 
Banuelos (the 1992 nominee), and John M. Ivler -- teamed up to criticize what 
they claimed were unethical campaign tactics being used by Mike Farber, another 
candidate in the race. They charged Farber with stealing campaign signs and 
claiming to have an endorsement that had been given to Banuelos. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, who received the state Democratic Party's pre-primary endorsement, 
denied the charges, saying he was being maligned because he is the 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st District, which includes a slice of northern Orange County and 
spans parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, incumbent Kim has 
virtually ignored the ongoing probes into his 1992 campaign after initially 
stating there was no wrongdoing on his part. Instead, he has run a low-key 
campaign focusing on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 His Republican primary opponents, however, have campaigned on Kim's troubles 
and the general theme of ethics in government. 
</P>
<P>
 The four -- mining engineer Ronald L. Curtis of Upland, Ontario businessman 
Bob Kerns, Upland businesswoman Valerie Romero and attorney Todd R. Thakar of 
Orange -- have played on Republican fears that if the investigations linger and 
Kim wins the nomination, then Democrats could successfully target a damaged 
candidate in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's supporters believe, however, that having multiple opponents helps their 
man. With four candidates diluting the anti-incumbent vote, Kim's backers say 
he will survive the primary challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, national Democratic Party leaders have not focused too much 
attention on Kim, the first Korean American elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, both Democratic candidates -- urban redeveloper Ed Tessier and 
attorney Richard Waldron -- have largely ignored the ongoing probes. Instead, 
they say Kim's voting record and his inattention to local issues make him 
vulnerable in November. Tessier said Kim had claimed to be a supporter of legal 
abortion in the last campaign, then cast an anti-abortion vote, and also voted 
against the Family Leave Act, which provides workers with time off for family 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 And with neither party having a majority of the voter registration in the 
district -- Republicans have 48% and Democrats 41% -- Tessier said he expects 
voters in November to give equal consideration to the Democrats in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four other Republican incumbents in Orange County, only Reps. 
Christopher Cox of Newport Beach and Ron Packard of Carlsbad face primary 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging Cox in the 47th District is Steven J. Frogue, a Lake Forest high 
school teacher who received 12% of the vote two years ago when he first ran 
against Cox. Frogue disagrees with Cox's vote in favor of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 48th District, which takes in part of southern Orange County and 
northern San Diego County, Packard faces Ed Mayerhofer, a Mission Viejo realtor 
who received almost 16% of the vote when he ran against Packard in 1992.

DECISION '94; STATE LEGISLATURE: ORANGE COUNTY; TERM LIMITS BRINGING CHANGES TO 
LEGISLATIVE RACES IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Orange County, races for state legislative offices have historically been 
tidy affairs. Longtime Republican incumbents almost invariably have blown away 
any Democrat who dared challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
 But things are beginning to change. The state's new legislative term limits 
law has turned incumbents -- including the flock of GOP stalwarts who have 
dominated Orange County -- into an endangered species. Though the Republican 
grip on the county's legislative seats probably won't ease, the names will 
certainly begin to change. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's headline race is in the GOP primary in the 70th Assembly District, 
where three newcomers are battling to succeed Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), who is abandoning his heavily Republican seat to run for 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District, the departure of the county's lone Democratic 
office holder -- Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who is running for 
state attorney general -- has caused a feisty scramble in both the Republican 
and Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a couple of incumbents -- state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) -- have attracted primary challengers, 
most of the rest have a free ride in June. Running unopposed in the GOP primary 
are Assemblymen Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia) and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), as well as state Sen. 
William A. Craven (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, those incumbents don't have long. Term limits will force Allen, 
Conroy and Johnson to move up or out in 1996, while Morrow, Pringle and Craven 
can stick around in their present jobs only through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 If this year's races for open seats are any indicator, the future of campaign 
politics in Orange County under term limits might begin to look like a rerun of 
American Gladiators. For proof, look no further than the Republican primary 
fight between Marilyn C. Brewer, Barry J. Hammond and Thomas G. Reinecke for 
the 70th Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Orange County primary battles, the candidates differ little on the 
issues, so the focus has been on political mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke and his supporters held a press conference early on to put a halt to 
rumors that he was sued for non-payment of an abortion allegedly performed on 
his girlfriend. Meanwhile, the financial dealings of Hammond, an Irvine 
councilman, have become an issue, most notably a 1991 personal bankruptcy. 
Brewer, meanwhile, has come under attack from conservatives angered because she 
supports a woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the vitriol in the 69th Assembly race has come in the Democratic 
primary, which has been consumed by a feud between two of the four candidates 
-- Latino activist Zeke Hernandez and Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute in the 69th is the subject of an investigation by the district 
attorney's office. Hernandez alleges that Moreno offered him money to stay out 
of the race. Moreno claims Hernandez illegally taped their telephone 
conversation to set up the bribery charge. Both deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two other challengers are trying to stay out of the fray. Santa 
Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler has gotten the endorsement of 
departing Assemblyman Umberg, as well as labor and teachers. Businessman John 
M. Patterson is walking precincts and banking on the base he established during 
an unsuccessful campaign for the Santa Ana City Council in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side in the 69th district, Anaheim manufacturer Jim 
Morrissey has the backing of party conservatives, particularly the big bucks of 
Sen. Rob Hurtt and his Allied Business Political Action Committee, which has 
pumped more than $2.5 million to candidates since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Two moderates are also in the running -- Martin Ageson, whose one-man law firm 
represents small businesses; and Judy Buffin-Edge, a retired bank branch 
manager and party volunteer. Rounding out the list is Virgel L. Nickell, who is 
using shoe-leather campaign tactics and has name identification in the district 
from an unsuccessful primary battle in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 68th Assembly race, two Democrats are battling to represent their party 
against Republican incumbent Curt Pringle, but their campaigns have taken place 
largely from respective sick beds. Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler has been 
hobbled by broken legs suffered in an auto accident, while Linda Kay Rigney -- 
who ran unsuccessfully against Pringle in 1992 -- has been waylaid by 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Republicans who have challenged incumbents of their own party have 
proven that at the very least they've got guts. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank L. Adomitis, an accountant, has the unenviable task of facing Hurtt and 
his campaign money machine in the 34th Senate District GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 67th Assembly District, incumbent Allen faces a candidate she believes 
was put up by political rival Ferguson. Allen and Ferguson are expected to 
battle in a special election early next year for the Senate seat being vacated 
by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is running unopposed for a seat 
on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Allen's challenger, Tony Nottke, is 
a former Ferguson staffer.

DECISION '94; JUDICIARY / CITY HALL: ORANGE COUNTY; JUDICIAL CANDIDATES VIE FOR 
4 OPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judicial candidates for one opening on the Orange County Superior Court and 
three Municipal Court judgeships are in the unusual position of campaigning for 
designated seats that would be eliminated under a proposal to merge the two 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed by state Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the constitutional amendment 
could create a "super-court" system that would consolidate the municipal 
courts, which mainly handle misdemeanor and civil cases, and the superior 
courts, which handle felony trials and civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies estimate the measure would save $22 million annually in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and detractors agree that its passage would amount to a judicial 
revolution that will change the way justice is delivered in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is still being fine-tuned and will not go on the statewide ballot 
until November, said Karin Caves, Lockyer's spokeswoman. But its implications 
provide a controversial backdrop for the June 7 judicial elections in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the nine local judicial candidates say they will support the merger if 
it aims at increasing efficiency and productivity while also saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's anticipated that (the court merger proposal) is going to be a major cost 
saver and I don't think you can be against that," said Mission Viejo attorney 
John C. Connolly, who is challenging South County Municipal Judge Pamela L. 
Iles. "There is a lot of administrative duplication going on." 
</P>
<P>
 But Iles said the proposal will be a disaster and plans to fight it every step 
of the way. The court system needs to increase its efficiency, she said, but 
creating a countywide district court will result in more cumbersome bureaucracy 
and strip local residents of control when it comes to voting for judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a bureaucracy grown, conceived or bloomed that didn't 
end up serving itself first," Iles said. "I would end up getting a raise if 
(the proposal passes), but I think the average citizen will lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would boost municipal judges' salary to that of the Superior Court 
level, and give all judges the power to handle all cases countywide, Caves 
said. Salaries for municipal judges start at $95,214, while starting pay for 
Superior Court judges is $104,262. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the measure would eliminate administrative duplication and 
improve court access for citizens. It would also allow municipal judges to help 
with the caseloads facing the superior courts, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Patrick Ryan and Barbara (Tam) Nomoto, Orange County municipal judges in 
Santa Ana, are running for a seat on the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said he is concerned that Municipal Court cases will get "lost" in a 
merger and noted that many municipal judges already assist the Superior Court 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some areas of concern, but the concept of increasing efficiency is 
a good one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomoto agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very good reasons for it, in the sense that court congestion 
and Superior Court caseloads must be addressed," said Nomoto, who added that 
she wants to study the final proposal before deciding whether to endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan C. Dutcher, a municipal judge in Westminster who is running against 
prosecutor Caryl Lee and Seal Beach attorney Barry S. Brown, said he sees 
firsthand the duplication in Orange County's courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people in the courts who do nothing but assign cases to open courts 
that are available. And you have people doing that in the five municipal courts 
and in the Superior Court," said Dutcher, who supports the proposal. "If that 
were centralized in one location, that would be much more efficient."  
</P>
<P>
 Lee said a merger has the potential to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system needs to be streamlined so cases are getting to court faster and 
are being heard faster," she said. "As it is, cases get transferred from 
courtroom to courtroom, judge to judge. It seems wasteful. I'd like to see some 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he wants more efficiency, but has concerns that the merger could 
dilute voting powers of minorities if judges are elected countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can oppose something that would make the court system more 
efficient, but not if it's going to have an effect that is harmful," Brown 
said. "We don't want a situation where the cure is worse than the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Claude E. Whitney, a municipal judge in Santa Ana who is being challenged by 
Yorba Linda attorney Dennis Patrick O'Connell, did not return repeated phone 
calls seeking comment on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney is facing misconduct charges filed by the state Commission on Judicial 
Performance stemming from allegations that he routinely denied attorneys to 
defendants appearing in his court and violated other constitutional rights. The 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is also reviewing allegations against Whitney, 
who has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said he supports the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any downside to any of this," O'Connell said. "It will save money 
in the long run. There is no reason to have a Superior Court and a Municipal 
Court, when you can have one court doing the same job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Bar Assn. does not endorse judicial candidates but polls its 
members for recommendations. Of nearly 6,000 bar members, 691 responded. The 
results were released last week, but many bar members said they did not know 
enough about the candidates to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey: 
</P>
<P>
 * 220 respondents said Whitney was qualified, while 174 found O'Connell 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 320 respondents said Iles was qualified, while 86 found Connolly qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 429 respondents said Nomoto was qualified, while 379 found Ryan qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 285 respondents said Dutcher was qualified, while 71 found Lee qualified and 
19 found Brown qualified.

DECISION '94; JUDICIARY / CITY HALL: ORANGE COUNTY; HEADLANDS USE DOMINATES 
ISSUES IN DANA POINT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local problems such as crime and illegal immigration are being discussed in 
the Dana Point City Council race. But the issue that's far and away dominating 
the campaign is an old controversy -- the development of the Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 12 council candidates for three seats were launching their campaigns 
in May, the 3-year-old question of how to develop the landmark 121-acre 
Headlands peninsula continued to swirl throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council -- confronted by community opposition -- agreed to 
make an approved plan for a 400-room hotel and 370 homes on the Headlands the 
subject of a citywide referendum in November. Development supporters say the 
project will generate badly needed revenue for the city; foes say the project 
is too massive and will rob the city of limited coastal open space. 
</P>
<P>
 This council election in June, focusing on the Headlands issue, could 
foreshadow how the vote will go in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the council race) will be an indicator," said Bill Walter, a local 
real estate agent and staunch opponent of the Headlands development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands issue has also put Dana Point's two powerful political-action 
groups face-to-face on opposing sides. The two groups are backing six 
candidates, giving key support that probably makes them the front runners.  
</P>
<P>
 But with two six-year incumbents sitting out of the race and a field of 12 
candidates on the ballot -- the largest group since the city's first council 
race drew 26 names in 1988 -- anything can happen, most observers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be wild," said Councilman Mike Eggers who, along with 
Councilwoman Eileen Krause, has chosen not to run for reelection. "I think a 
candidate can get elected with only 3,500 votes this time. I see it being 
extremely close." There are about 19,000 registered voters in the community of 
34,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The two influential PACS are Dana Point United, a group that supports the 
Headlands plan, against Hometown Dana Point, a recent addition to the city's 
politics that has backed opponents of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Kaufman, Bill Shepherd and incumbent Councilwoman Karen Lloreda are 
Dana Point United's picks, while Hometown Dana Point is backing Ernie Nelson, 
Toni Gallagher and Robert Wilberg, a former park district director and a dogged 
campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other candidates who could make strong showings, although they're not 
backed by either political group, are Addison H. DeBoi, a Capistrano Beach 
resident who was the leading vote-getter in the last water board race, and 
Witold Muller, who has name recognition because of his commercial real estate 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the dark horses are Ron C. Hascall, David Pytleski and Bob Moore, a 
former candidate in 1988 who could win considerable backing as the only 
candidate from the posh Monarch Beach area of the city.

DECISION '94; TAX FOES HOPE TO UNSEAT 3 ON FULLERTON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents angry about a 2% utility tax imposed last July by the City Council 
to finance local government will get a chance June 7 to oust the mayor and two 
council colleagues in the city's first-ever recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead 
face a recall effort by the Fullerton Recalls Committee, which advocates 
replacing them with council members who will repeal the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its effort to shake up City Hall, the committee also advocates 
firing City Manager James L. Armstrong and electing a full-time mayor to run 
the city, imposing term limits on local officials, eliminating the 
Redevelopment Agency and electing council members by district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe representatives of the people should represent the majority of the 
people," committee chairman Thomas S. Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council instituted the utility tax so it could balance the $70-million 
1993-94 fiscal budget without having to trim fire and police services, Catlin 
said. At the time, the city faced a $3-million deficit, which the council 
reduced by trimming about $1.5 million in city services. The utility tax is 
scheduled to expire in June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a decision in good faith because we did not want to lose essential 
services," Catlin said. "This recall is ridiculous. Recalls are for people who 
are incompetent, fraudulent or immoral in office." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the council members, City Clerk Anne M. York also faces recall. 
York, who has served in her post since 1976, was targeted by Babcock's group, 
which has accused her of delaying the recall process by rejecting valid recall 
petitions against the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 York acknowledged rejecting several petitions because its language exceeded 
the 200-word limit set by state law. She said she consistently handled all 
recall paperwork within a day. 
</P>
<P>
 To fight the recall, a group of residents formed Citizens for Fullerton, which 
has about 300 supporters and has raised $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also will be asked whether any vacancies created by the recall should 
be filled by special election or by council appointment.

 In a battle that pits the firefighters union against City Hall, voters will 
decide next week whether to recall Mayor Charles V. Smith and three City 
Council colleagues, who approved cuts last year in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam 
voted in July to cut nearly $1 million from the Fire Department's budget, 
forcing layoffs of five of the city's 69 firefighters and putting one firetruck 
out of service. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders have defended the cuts, which were part of a $2.6-million 
spending-reduction plan, as necessary to balance the city's $24.8-million 
budget for the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were merely doing our job," Smith said. "We have to reduce costs because 
of the reduction in city revenues and the state cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Westminster Firefighters Assn., which is leading the recall drive, 
said the cuts endanger local residents and that the motivation for them was 
retaliation for the firefighters' support of Joy L. Neugebauer in her 
unsuccessful 1992 mayoral race against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cuts were irresponsible," said Mike Garrison, firefighters union 
director. "The issue of this recall is public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first recall election since the city was incorporated in 1957. 
Three years ago, Smith, Schweisinger and Councilman Frank Fry Jr. were targeted 
for recall over increases in water rates, but proponents failed to gather 
enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote is being watched by cities and firefighter unions around the state, 
with the state firefighters union supporting the recall with money and 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and the firefighters have hired consultants to run their 
campaigns and both have created political action committees to coordinate fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign against the recall attacks the union, saying a "no" vote battles 
higher taxes. "The recall is (about) whether the council elected by the people 
should run the city or the firefighters union should run the city," Smith said.
